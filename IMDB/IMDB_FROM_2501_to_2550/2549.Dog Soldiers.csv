0,TheLittleSongbird,Really enjoyable,8,26 May 2012,"I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did. While the final battle with the creatures is a little more silly than scary and the special ops was a good idea in hindsight but felt tacky, I found Dog Soldiers surprising. It was stylishly filmed, with great location work and very effective make-up. That's not all, the music is stirring, the dialogue is fun, naturally flowing and suspenseful, the characters are likable and well-developed on the whole and the story is thrilling with moments that are genuinely terrifying. The werewolves also make a positive impression, and the acting is never wooden, but naturalistic and engaging. All in all, I really enjoyed Dog Soldiers. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Dog Soldiers
1,Leofwine_draca,Tremendous fun,8,6 July 2016,"The werewolf story seems to have had some kind of cinematic resurgence in recent years - first was the Canadian GINGER SNAPS, then the French BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF, and now the British DOG SOLDIERS. They say that bad things come in threes, but the opposite is true here as all three films are above-average genre examples. DOG SOLDIERS is a refreshingly straight-forward cross between an action flick and a splattery horror film with plenty of humour, bloodshed and thrills to appeal to mainstream audiences. As such, its been garnering rave reviews and after visiting the local cinema I can't find much to fault about it. Don't go in looking for plot or complex twists - this is an old-fashioned thriller with a simple premise and lots and lots of action to carry it along.Things begin creepily enough with some taut scenes in the woods which rival THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT for eerieness. Our unfortunate soldiers find themselves stalked by some prowling creatures (P.O.V. shots show a greyed vision of the action). Tension builds, interspersed with some clever shocks - the falling cow is a real jolter in particular. Then bam! the werewolves are introduced in some extremely bloody antics involving dangling intestines and impalings which prove to be real eyeball-poppers. Refreshingly, this is a crowd-pleasing B-movie which doesn't skimp on the gore effects - in fact director Neil Marshall started out as an SFX technician and his proficiency shows itself with plenty of decapitated heads, splattery blood, and fountains of gore all over the place. However, this is enjoyable rather than disturbing, thanks to the mean streak of extremely black humour which recalls the like of Peter Jackson's BRAINDEAD - there's a particularly sickening bit involving a dog and an intestine which is completely gross but still somehow funny with it.Once the foe has been introduced, our heroes make a truly thrilling run for cover as darkness falls and night closes in - some very taut and exciting moments follow in the ensuing chase. Finally, they find solace in a mysteriously abandoned farmhouse, where character motivations are uncovered as well as a fair amount of shocks, surprises, and plot twists. None of them are particularly surprising and indeed DOG SOLDIERS is a film packed with clichés - there's nothing here that hasn't been done before in the likes of ALIENS, An American Werewolf in London, and the farmhouse siege sequences directly reference the likes of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and other famous siege movies. Yet Marshall puts his heart on his sleeve and openly acknowledges his influences, with plenty of sly but not in your face movie in-jokes and asides to make things enjoyable. Where the film succeeds is in mixing said clichéd situations into a new, unpredictable mix, thus making it interesting and fresh viewing.Things culminate in a spellbinding conclusion that features some impressive explosive effects, an amazing man vs. werewolf punch-up in a kitchen (hilarious) and some edge-of-your-seat stuff as a cat and mouse game ensues between heroes and villain. The action sequences are excellent and realistic with it, instead of never-ending bullets our heroes find their supplies dwindling and are forced to use their imagination to find other weapons. The characters are well-defined and the cast populated by some fine actors - particularly TRAINSPOTTING's Kevin McKidd, who shines as the underdog-turned-heroic leader. Elsewhere we have Emma Cleasby as a helpful ecologist, Sean Pertwee (EVENT HORIZON) doing his bit extremely well as the hard-headed Sergeant, and Liam Cunningham excellent in an early role. The film offers plenty of distinctly British humour - most of it blackly comic as the characters bemoan their desperate situation - which keeps it snappy and likable. The pacing is also spot on. As for the werewolves themselves, well thank god they're not CGI, but instead animatronics. Obviously low budget and not terribly convincing, Marshall does well to hide them in the shadows and show them only in quick cuts so that they retain their menace throughout. But the werewolves are only part of it - the icing on the cake, so to speak. This exciting B-movie epic would be just as good without them, but with them it becomes something unique and special. A tremendously fun experience.",Dog Soldiers
2,claudio_carvalho,"Action, Horror and Sense of Humor",8,26 January 2007,"In Scotland, a group of six soldiers leaded by the tough Sgt. Harry G. Wells (Sean Pertwee) are left in the forest by helicopter for a routine exercise, with the weapons loaded with blanks. When a dead cow with many bites falls in their camp, they move around the area and find another military camp with only one survivor, Capt. Ryan (Liam Cunningham), who is wounded and scary. They find also a great quantity of live ammunition, when they are suddenly surrounded by huge and fast creatures. While escaping, a private is killed and Sgt. Wells is seriously wounded but saved by Pvt. Cooper (Kevin McKidd). They see a jeep on a narrow road and the driver Megan (Emma Cleasby) rescues them and they go to an empty farmhouse. Megan tells that the creatures are lycanthropes, aka werewolves, and they have to fight along the whole night trying to save their lives, and disclosing hidden dirty secrets.A couple of days ago I saw ""The Descent"" and I were surprised with the excellent direction of Neil Marshall, who wrote and directed a great scary and claustrophobic horror movie. I have just watched ""Dog Soldiers"", also written and directed by Neil Marshall, and this film is a great action horror movie. The story is well developed, with horror, action and even comedy in right doses, and I personally loved when the brave soldier after fighting like a tiger with the werewolf and without any further object for self-defense, wishes that the werewolf have diarrhea, showing a great will power and warrior spirit. The scene in the credits with the result of the soccer game between Germany and England is also witty. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Dog Soldiers  Cães de Caça"" (""Dog Soldiers  Hunting Dogs"")",Dog Soldiers
3,gavin6942,The Second Best Werewolf Movie Ever Made,7,10 May 2006,"Yes, I say the second best because nothing compares with ""The Beast Must Die!"" and probably never will unless TBMD gets a sweet digital remastering.The story: a group of soldiers are in search of werewolves and they end up setting up camp right in the very home of those werewolves. Hilarity - and lots of it - ensues.My only 2 complaints with this film are the Scottish accents (though you'll adjust) and the feeling that some parts were much longer than needed. One scene around a campfire involved a lengthy story that has no point. Granted, once the action starts it just keeps rolling, but do you want the audience to fall asleep first? I could complain about the special effects. One man's intestines were obviously sausages and the werewolves were not high-grade costumes (they couldn't even open and close their mouths). But you know what? I'd rather have special effects with heart than some high-budget CGI effects that make everything look like a cartoon. Give me a squib of blood over a computer rendering any day.Not sure what else to say... werewolves, lots of guns, Scottish people. Think I covered it. If you like werewolf movies, you have no excuse to skip this one.",Dog Soldiers
4,jboothmillard,Dog Soldiers,7,6 September 2005,"For a British horror from debut director Neil Marshall, who followed with the good The Descent, this is a good horror film with a classic theme recreated. Basically a British Sqaud, led by Sgt. Harry G. Wells (Sean Pertwee, son of Jon Pertwee, aka Worzel Gummidge) are sent on a training in the woods of Scotland against Special Operations, ignoring childish ""campfire"" stories about the area. Soon though they stumble into a savage werewolf attack, and they are now in battle with these terrifying creatures. They seclude themselves in a farmhouse provided by Megan (Emma Cleasby), and the terror continues as these man-sized werewolves try to get in, and tear everyone apart, or turn them into more of them. Also starring Kevin McKidd as Pvt. Cooper, Liam Cunningham as Capt. Ryan, Thomas Lockyer as Cpl. Bruce Campbell, Darren Morfitt as 'Spoon' Witherspoon, Chris Robson as Pvt. Joe Kirkley and Leslie Simpson as Pvt. Terry Milburn. The performances are cool, the effects are very good for a low budget film, and it a very good thrill film combining light humour and great gruesome gore. Very good!",Dog Soldiers
5,ma-cortes,"Thrilling movie full of amazing makeup work , noisy action and kinetic energy",7,28 February 2011,"This exciting movie is packed with noisy action, unbelievable stunts, tension, thrills, chills, and lots of blood and gore, including throating-slit ,beheading, impaling and slashing .

As they encounter zoologist named Megan (Emma Cleasby), it results out that werewolves are active in the country. After getting away the find shelter in a country house but the group encounters a pack of carnivorous, crawling creatures are waiting for them . They find themselves caught , hunted, and waiting for the long night to reach its ending . They have to prepare for some action , hope running thin and chances slipping away, as the there will be a full moon tonight with time running out .Some of them undergo a dental and hirsute transformation at the night and going on a murderous rampage every time the moon is full .The motion picture displays action,suspense,terror with claustrophobic touches and is quite entertaining . This is a gripping, exciting , high-octane nightmare of the worse scenario with terrible werewolves stalking a soldiers team . The screenwriter provided a well-knit plot with mystery and horror, giving full rein to Neil Marshall natural talent for the terror and action genre . The theme of people being stranded in a hostile, perilous environment with attackers creatures is justly reminiscent of former films and subsequently to be made another story in similar style titled ¨The descent¨ . Stirring musical score fitting to action by Mark Thomas and appropriate cinematography Sam McCurdy . The motion picture is decently directed by Neil Marshall with splendid visual style but with no originally because he has copied previous films. Neal is expert in making brutally violent horror movies (Doomsday, The descent). Rating: Good, better than average, the film is classified PG-13 for lots of guts, gore and violence. This remarkable action film appeal to terror genre buffs .",Dog Soldiers
6,BA_Harrison,Well ahead of the pack.,9,14 December 2009,"The concept is simple—soldiers vs. werewolves—but thanks to director Neil Marshall's witty script and exuberant direction, superb performances from a likable and very talented cast, and astounding special effects from Bob Keen, Dog Soldiers proves to be not just one of the most enjoyable horrors of the decade, but also one of the best werewolf films ever.Marshall's command of his material is superb, and his achievement is doubly impressive given that this is his debut full-length feature. The cinematography is excellent, with impressive use of camera placement, the lens always on the prowl, whether swooping through the woods to give a wolf's eye view, or weaving between the soldiers as they fight for their lives. The well considered editing, also by Marshall, adds immeasurably to the tension and excitement, with a combination of staccato cuts and longer shots used to add variety and interest to the visuals (if only other modern directors/editors could learn a trick or two from Marshall: films don't always have to resemble music videos).The cast, of whom there is only one genuinely 'recognisable' name (Sean Pertwee, giving the performance of a lifetime), are also absolutely brilliant, giving a sense of realism to their absurd situation that makes the terror even more palpable. Thankfully, the script (which—let's not forget— is ALSO by Marshall!!!) never dumbs down proceedings: the dialogue between characters is often funny, but only because the character's have a great sense of humour, and the manner in which they communicate with each other and react to their plight is always believable.This being a relatively low budget movie, one should not expect mind-blowing transformation effects in the tradition of An American Werewolf in London, nor, thankfully, CGI abominations as in recent blockbusters like Van Helsing. Instead, we get fleeting glimpses of beautifully designed and incredibly imposing wolf-men, courtesy of Bob Keen, whose sheer size is enough to send chills up the spine (well, that and the fact that they can tear their victims apart with ease). The gore is also up to par, with guts being graphically spilt, heads torn off, and blood splashed all over the place.Marshall has since gone on to give fans of fantastic film the wonderful subterranean horror The Descent and the enjoyable, but less immaculate post-apocalyptic Doomsday (a spot of self-indulgence from the director, but forgivable given his track record), and now seems to be concentrating on action films (Centurion, Drive). Let's hope that he returns to fully-fledged horror sometime soon, though: he's so good at it!",Dog Soldiers
7,tavm,Dog Soldiers was an awesome horror-action werewolf flick!,8,31 July 2018,"Continuing my series of reviews of werewolf movies in chronological order, I'm now at 2002 with this British-made film. In this one, a group of soldiers are doing a test mission but it becomes obvious real quick that there's something terrible going on...I'll admit the accents made some of the dialogue confusing (good thing I looked up on Wikipedia to help make clear what was going on in the plot) but other than that, this was quite an awesome horror-action flick with some good humor involved. Nothing more to say except I highly recommend Dog Soldiers.",Dog Soldiers
8,BandSAboutMovies,Wolves vs. SAS,4,23 August 2020,"Neil Marshall has directed several Game of Thrones stories, as well as the remake of Hellboy. This movie is much better than that one by several dog hairs. It's the story of a squad of six British soldiers who are on maneuvers when they meet an enemy even more deadly than they are - a werewolf.Private Lawrence Cooper (Kevin McKidd, Trainspotting) failed his special forces test because he refused to shoot a dog. Now, he's stuck back with his old unit in the Scottish Highlands for wargames against an SAS team. As soon as they get there, they find the remains of those men and realize that maybe they shouldn't be here.Before long, the team's commander Captain Richard Ryan (Liam Cunningham, The Card Player) reveals that they were here to capture a werewolf alive. What follows are twists, turns, double crosses and bloody death. It's a nailbiter and honestly, I don't want to give much away.There was talk of a sequel, Dog Soldiers: Fresh Meat, and a prequel, Dog Soldiers: Legacy, but neither ended up being made.Between references to H.G. Welles, Zulu, The Matrix, Evil Dead, Jurassic Park, The Company of Wolves, The Searchers, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Jaws, Zabriskie Point, A Bridge Too Far, Apocalypse Now, The Shining, Southern Comfort, An American Werewolf In London, Predator, Love, Honor and Obey, Battle Royale, the TV show Spaced (Simon Pegg was almost in this)and Aliens, this movie is packed with references to other genre favorites. Marshall would later claim, ""I think I got completely carried away.""",Dog Soldiers
9,Coventry,Brave new horror!,6,2 February 2005,"I must admit that I didn't really care for ""Dog Soldiers"" when I first got around watching it back in 2002, right after its release. I thought the concept of a lost patrol fighting a troop of werewolves was overly hectic and the monsters themselves didn't look half as frightening as the elderly ones from ""American Werewolf in London"" or ""The Howling"". Maybe it's because I've seen so many crap horror since then or maybe I just didn't pay enough attention the first time but my second opinion is much more positive. Neil Marshall wrote and directed an enthusiast gore story about a squadron of soldiers on a routine training exercise in the Scottish forests and all of a sudden their lives are in danger because of ravenous werewolves lurking around the area. They also encounter a captain from another platoon (who's acting very mysteriously) and a young environmental researcher who eventually rescues them and shelters the group in a nearby farmhouse. Completely isolated and low on ammunition, the group has to survive the night as the aggressive creatures won't go away as long as the moon is full. The lines and dialogues in ""Dog Soldiers"" are well-written and often blackly humorous, while Marshall allows his cast to overact in several sequences. Tension is successfully reached thanks to the hopeless surrounding of the farmhouse. This film will especially be remembered by horror freaks because of the explicit gore and violent action scenes. I particularly appreciated the fact that many of the special effects were developed in the 'old-fashioned' way, without using dreadful CGI. The werewolves clearly are tall men in suits but I easily prefer them over the artificially constructed things in ""Underworld"" or ""Van Helsing"". I suspect that this film will become an ""underdog"" in the modern horror genre and, in time, it'll develop quite a large fan base (if it hasn't already). Personally, I still like the ""Ginger Snaps"" films better when it comes to post-2000 werewolf-flicks, but this ""Dog Soldiers"" is a worthy second. Recommended!",Dog Soldiers

Taking refuge in an abandoned farmhouse, the soldiers have a lot to think about when a zoologist(Emma Cleasby)explains they are the prey of a pack of overly developed werewolves. No training imaginable will prepare this group for what is to come. With more courage than ammunition, the soldiers realize that a bloodbath may be unavoidable.

11,hitchcockthelegend,He looks like he took on Jack The Ripper and came last.,9,13 September 2008,"A British Squad is on training manoeuvres in the Highlands of Scotland, after finding Special Ops Squad leader, Captain Ryan, in a bad way and rambling incoherently, the night is about to become a fight for survival, the enemy? Werewolves!Director Neil Marshall has never hid his influences (and love), here in this incredibly enjoyable lupine piece, he fuses a number of personal favourite pictures, most notably Assault On Precinct 13, Aliens and Night Of The Living Dead. There is nothing wrong with homaging as long as the resulting film has made its own stamp, and certainly Dog Soldiers does that very well. For sure all the genre staples are here, things that howl in the night, a glowing full moon and of course a house straight out of your darkest creepy fairy-tales. But lifting this above the mundane is its wonderful tongue in cheek script as dashes of humour sit snugly alongside the gory trappings of its horror roots. With Marshall having an adroitly deft knack of eeking out nervous laughs as our Squaddies come under lupine siege. The non use of CGI for the wolves is a pleasant surprise, and certainly it gives the piece an added earthy quality, as does a cast clearly having the time of their lives on this shoot. A cast that contains British and Irish cult heroes in Sean Pertwee & Liam Cunningham. Some of the gags will pass over the heads of those residing outside of the UK, that's not an insult, it's fact, because Marshall and his team are aiming squarely for the British market. Which to us UK residents is most definitely not ""Bone"".Nonsense fable of course, but these Dog Soldiers are prime pedigree chums. 8.5/10",Dog Soldiers
12,Theo Robertson,Despite A Somewhat Poor Start A Great Horror Movie,8,20 February 2004,"***** MILD SPOILERS ***** Good to see that I wasn`t the only person slightly disappointed with the start of DOG SOLDIERS and its flawed view of how the military work . This has been a problem with British film makers over the last couple of decades , they confuse being anti-war with being anti-military  . In order to join the SAS you have to shoot dogs do you ? I don`t think so . Oh and it`s all right to hit commanding officers ? In war time serving soldiers have been shot on the spot for less . It should also be pointed out that if a military patrol are carrying out exercises under combat conditions it`s highly unlikely they`d walk through a forest whistling tunes or light a camp fire especially if the patrol leader is a combat vet , and as is often seen in movies soldiers cock loaded weapons and throw them at each other to catch . What ? Soldiers  throwing loaded weapons at each other ?  Believe me this only happens in movies But unlike a previous reviewer from Australia I can forgive these military blunders from writer/director Neil Marshall who has crafted a very effective and totally entertaining small budget horror movie . Yeah okay it`s totally unoriginal with a premise from ASSUALT ON PRECINCT 13 and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD but so what ? Are we to think because one or two scenes have been stolen from ZULU and STRAW DOGS that this is a bad movie in any way ? From the scene where the cow lands on the camp fire to the end titles I was totally engrossed in the story and Marshall manages to film a lot of enthralling scenes like the bit where the Sarge is lying in bed unaware that werewolves are creeping into the room through the window and Spoon`s last stand is strangely touching , maybe not as touching as the departure of Boromir from LORD OF THE RINGS but remember this is a low budget horror film which aren`t exactly known for their emotional impact . It`s also great to see British soldiers shown in a good light , there`s not many recent films that do that , compare this to the portrayal of the soldiers in 28 DAYS LATER and on second thoughts Neil Marshall has obviously been doing his home work when one of the characters  mentions "" Midges "" a small fly like insect with an irritating bite native to Scotland which has spoiled many a Summer walk in the countryside . I hope to be seeing a lot more of Neil Marshall`s work in the future . I`m sure I will",Dog Soldiers
13,Hey_Sweden,This film is definitely not bone.,8,20 October 2012,"""Dog Soldiers"" puts an invigorating, irresistible British spin on the classic werewolf film, complete with references to genre films of the past.A platoon of Army soldiers, on a training exercise in the Scottish Highlands, runs afoul of aggressive, hungry werewolves and subsequently have to fight for their lives. The story very much turns into a ""Night of the Living Dead"" homage as these people are forced to hole up inside an isolated farmhouse, hoping that they can last until dawn.Buffs will note the resemblance of some of the plot points here to those in the ""Alien"" franchise, and among the other in-jokes are lines of dialogue and set pieces taken from films such as ""Jaws"", ""Aliens"" and ""Star Trek"". Director Neil Marshalls' screenplay is strong on action and atmosphere, and features one memorable shock and some priceless one liners.The always excellent Sean Pertwee as Sgt. Wells also has a fantastic monologue that sort of sets the tone for the horror to come. Marshall populates his story with colourful and entertaining characters, such as Private Spoon (Darren Morfitt) and the soccer-obsessed Private Joe (Chris Robson). Everyone gives a lively performance; Kevin McKidd is solid as the heroic Private Cooper and Liam Cunningham makes an appropriately odious human villain as Captain Ryan. Morfitt has one hilarious line that's basically akin to one of Captain Rhodes' legendary quotes in ""Day of the Dead"". And the werewolves themselves are wonderfully hideous, more-wolf-than-man bipeds that are among the best looking in the genre.*Tons* of juicy gore add a lot of punch. In effect, another film that ""Dog Soldiers"" resembles is ""Predator"" where it starts somewhat slowly and doesn't make its main characters aware of the nature of their enemy until well into the story. The action is fast and furious once it does come, and totally rousing.Granted, it's got one ending too many, but it's still compulsively watchable for 105 straight minutes. It kicked off Marshall's career with a bang, as he would go on to make other fine entertainments such as ""The Descent"", ""Doomsday"", and ""Centurion"".Here's hoping we continue to see great things from him.Eight out of 10.",Dog Soldiers
14,preppy-3,"It's no ""Howling"" but it's not bad",8,3 February 2003,"A bunch of British soldiers are stuck in a remote farmhouse during a night of a full moon.  They're attacked on all sides by werewolves.A huge hit in Britain, this got virtually zero theatrical release in the U.S.  That's a shame--while no great movie it's a good, solid, gory horror film.  The obviously low budget works against its total success (the barely shown werewolves look pretty silly).  Also the thick British accents make entire exchanges of dialogue unintelligable--and some main plot points are being discussed!  And there are annoying lapses in logic--would a family of werewolves really own a dog as a pet?  And all the characters are familiar stereotypes.But the movie has huge doses of gruesome, violent action, tons of gore and a thankful lack of humor--when people are killed here it's not joked about--it's shocking and sad.  And it's so great to see a horror film not skimping on the blood and guts.  The acting is pretty good too.So, it's a definite must-see for horror fans--good luck with the accents!",Dog Soldiers
15,CinemaSerf,"""If you go into the woods tonight....""",7,24 October 2020,"I will admit to being somewhat sceptical when I sat down to watch this, but within about twenty minutes the auditorium was chuckling to the witty banter of Sean Pertwee and his squad of soldiers who find themselves stuck on an exercise in a remote Scottish forest when they'd sooner be in the wardroom sinking a few beers while watching Germany beat England at football. When their fireside banter is ruined by a missile shaped like a dead cow; things start to liven up and what ensues is a race against time for their very survival - there are more dangerous creatures in the forest than red squirrels! Kevin McKidd keeps the troop focussed at they face their foes with grim determination and their black humour prevails pretty much throughout their ordeal. The special effects are a little bit ""Dr. Who"" but Neil Marshall ensures the lighting and sound folks do their level best to keep the suspense going for a long as possible and at no stage does it hang about: it's end to end action with a tinge - a soupçon - of horror as the story builds to an enjoyable denouement! On the big screen again now in late 2020 - not sure why - but if you get chance, and you like your horror unsophisticated and funny, then this is definitely for you.",Dog Soldiers
16,poolandrews,"""I hope I give you the sh*ts"" Brilliant stuff, 'Werewolves ate my platoon', I loved it.",9,7 November 2006,"Dogs Soldiers is set in the isolated Highlands of Scotland where a platoon of soldiers lead by Sergeant Harry Wells (Sean Pertwee) are dropped off on a regular training exercise. However things take a turn for the worse when they discover a special ops platoon totally slaughtered & the only survivor being Captain Ryan (Liam Cunningham), they are then attacked by Werewolves who kill one of the soldier's. The remaining troops run & luckily run into Megan (Emma Cleasby) who all then drive off to the nearest house for shelter, unfortunately the Werewolves destroy their jeep & there are no phones to call for help & they are a four hour drive from the nearest town. Their problems mount as they quickly run out of ammo, the Werewolves start to pick the platoon off one-by-one & as the night draws on their chances of survival seem very slim...This British Luxembourg co-production was edited, written & directed by Neil Marshall & I thought Dog Soldiers was a totally brilliant horror film & over several viewings since it first came out has become an absolute fave of mine. The script has a definite sense of humour & doesn't take itself too seriously although it is at heart quite basic with a platoon of under-equipped soldiers stuck in a dangerous situation with monsters coming at them from all directions, yep I've got an Aliens (1986) with a little Evil Dead (1982) thrown in there feeling as well, but it never tries to be anything else & taken on that premise, as pure thrilling entertainment, it's as good as anything out there in the horror genre as far as I'm concerned. The character's are perfect & there isn't an annoying American teen in sight, the dialogue is great & these feel like real people as they talk dirty, talk about football & just seem natural & very likable. The film moves along at an almost perfect pace, it keeps on going but it also manages to take the time to develop the character's which makes what happens on screen so much more engaging. The film doesn't mess around with Werewolf film-lore too much & there are some top gore moments. I don't really have anything negative to say about Dog Soldiers, I thought it was brilliant, top-drawer entertainment all the way & it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Marshall does a great job, the action scenes & shoot-outs are cool & he works wonders on what must have been a low budget. The special effects are great & very impressive while I cannot applaud the decision to not use CGI enough, he films the Werewolves with quick cuts & the camera never lingers on them for too long but crucially the action always remains clear throughout & you can tell what's happening despite the quick editing. There's some nice touches here & there, there's a good atmosphere & there are a few good old fashioned scares here as well. There's some good gore here, there's plenty of blood & intestines splattered around, someone is impaled on a branch, someone has their stomach torn open & their guts spill out & there's a nice decapitation in here as well. There's plenty of the red stuff, sorted.Technically Dog Soldiers is better than it has any right to be with surprisingly good effects apart from the exploding toy house at the end & despite being set in Scotland it was actually filmed in Luxembourg not that you would ever know unless someone told you. The acting was very good by an unknown cast.Dog Soldiers is absolutely top-notch stuff from start to finish, sure not every single person out there will agree but films are all about personal opinion & I thought it was most brilliant. Nothing else to say other than watch it as soon as you can. Director Neil went on to make the almost as excellent The Descent (2005) while according to the IMDb a sequel Dog Soldiers: Fresh Meat (2007) is currently in pre-production.",Dog Soldiers
17,dbborroughs,Great action horror film,8,19 January 2008,"SCIFI picked this up so it went to cable instead of going to theaters. I don't know whether to thank them for making people aware of it or curse them since it meant that people first saw this with commercials.First- if you saw it on SCIFI you didn't really see it. Go rent it and watch it uncut where the suspense and the violence remain in tact.Second- This is one of the best horror films I've seen and which almost no one has seen fully in the US because the commercials on SCIFI kill the tension. I liken it to the almost disappeared SCARECROWS which rocked just about anyone I've ever shown it to.The plot, a group of soldiers on a training mission run into way more then they bargained for when they are attacked by werewolves.Thats the plot.Where and how it goes is from there is just great. Yea you may have seen chunks of this before but this sucker moves so fast and with such wit and style that you really don't care.Yes there are twists you expect and then at the same time there are some twists that never come and leave you pleasantly surprised that at the turn of events.(What Identity failed to do in the last couple of minutes) I really like this movie a lot. I had heard great things when SCIFI ran it and took a chance by picking it up on DVD as a used title. I was more than blown away by the film. It was worth the purchase price and then some.As I've said rent the movie on tape or DVD, do not watch it on SCIFI. This is a movie of even increasing tension and the tension will be lost if every twelve minutes there's an ad for toilet paper. Yes its free on SCIFI and you'll get a taste of the film but it won't be the same, trust me.The wolves are of the HOWLING variety but bigger and meaner and they look great when we do see them...Great action and suspense... see the film...And stay into the credits to see who won the football game...",Dog Soldiers
18,view_and_review,Scottish Werewolves,6,10 February 2021,"Werewolves of all types and from all areas are not to be trifled with, and Scottish werewolves are particularly potent.
Nothing seemed to stop them. I get that most lycanthropes must be killed by silver bullets, but usually normal bullets and weapons will at least slow down a werewolf while it regroups/regenerates. Well, the Scottish werewolves in ""Dog Soldiers"" weren't even slowed down.""Dog Soldiers"" set up a near perfect situation for werewolf prey. A team of Scottish soldiers were doing a training exercise in North Wales when they were attacked by multiple lycans. You would think that a squadron of heavily armed soldiers would be the wrong group to mess with. Any predator would have to pay a heavy price for a meal. Well, if you thought that, then you thought wrong. Those soldiers may have just as well been armed with BB guns.

19,kannibalcorpsegrinder,A genre's landmark entry,10,26 July 2012,"Sent into the wilderness as part of a training exercise, a group of British soldiers find the area saturated with vicious, murderous werewolves and must find a way of getting away from the deadly creatures before they all fall victim to the creatures.This here turns out to be one of the greatest entries in its' particular genre, appearing to be a standard bearer for years to come. One of the film's many great points is the unrelenting action on display, which is incredibly fun to watch and gets so many big impact scenes throughout its running time. There's some absolutely fun action scenes here, from the initial charge through the jungle firing off numerous rounds at the approaching horde as the battles take place in the shrubs and different outlying sections of the forest while they make a getaway into the car to the frantic attempts at holding them off inside the house which is good fun in the extended encounter that utilizes everything from scalding pots of water, knives, bullets and fire as tactics during the battle as well as the countermeasures employed by the werewolves as they begin toying with the soldiers. Even amongst the great fun here is their big assault on the house which has an insane amount of action as the creatures break through the protective barricades and fully unleash their savage attitudes against the remaining members which brings out the fun action-packed encounters in the kitchen as they get swarmed over through the windows resulting in plenty of brawling and hiding out as they try to escape or the great encounters upstairs as they break-in through the windows forcing a series of battles to hold them off and escape the house. What makes both of these elements work is how they are just an absolute blast and far among the film's best qualities. Along with the loads of action is bucketfuls of gore, and this provides that in copious amounts with limbs being ripped off, a stomach chewed open, decapitations and far too many scratch-wounds and body mangling to count, leaving this one satisfying for gore-hounds as this does have an ocean of blood. Several moments do strike up the suspense that is wrought throughout the movie that makes the gore watchable from the forest stalking and the escape to the barn as well as the fun tactics at the end which really works nicely here, The last positive here is that the beasts in this film are about as realistic a looking werewolf ever seen since the creatures themselves look really vicious and menacing, looking impressive when they are walking around, and coupled with their suit-build and smartness on display, create an imposing villain. While these here work, it does have one flaw here in one area expected to see in every werewolf movie. In this film, we have the potential for at least two great transformations. The claws burst forth and the eyes glow red, but then the character ducks underneath the table and we hear the transformation, but never see it. The second character is shot before the transformation is complete, so we never had a chance to see a werewolf transform in the movie. It's still quite a bit of fun.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and violence against animals.",Dog Soldiers

Initially skeptical, the evidence proves overwhelming, and the soldiers escape with the help of a female zoologist named Megan, and take refuge in a cottage, where the werewolves want to get in, since as it turns out, the cottage is their home... Sean Pertwee stars as Sgt. Harry Wells, the leader of the group. Surprisingly effective film with innovative direction and fine acting(especially Pertwee).

The cast are all great in their respective roles, and even though think he's a great screen presence, i'm glad Statham decided not to do the film.What makes this film something with a little more substance than your average horror is the banter between thew Squaddies, and th fact that you really believe that they are friends, so when one of them buys it, you really feel a loss for the team. Kudos to the film makers for limiting CGI to more or less zero, and keeping the creatures hidden until more or less the very end.My only criticism with the film, is the twist at the end. It's really out of place and makes one feel that it was tacked on at the end to give the film a little more 'whoa' factor, that it did not need.otherwise it's a good movie, lots of fun, and quite scary in places.",Dog Soldiers

It also has a little ""Dead Alive"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" in it as well.  It has other movies too, but this one is a very good werewolf movie.  This one revolves around a troop sent into the woods for training exercises.  They uncover another team that appears to have been ripped to shreds.  The good news is that these people who were killed left behind lots of weapons, and seeing how the other troop only had guns that fire blanks it is a good thing.  The bad news is that all these weapons are fully loaded; whatever killed these guys did so, so quickly that the soldiers never even had a chance to return fire.  There is one survivor who has a giant claw mark in his chest.  The soldiers eventually find out that there are werewolves out in the woods and they find a girl who drives them to a farmhouse where the army men must hold out till dawn when hopefully the werewolves will return to normal.  Great flick, people always told me this one was worth checking out and they were right. The only problem I had was understanding the actors at times as they really had some heavy accents...don't know if they were British or Scottish.  You can understand them for the most part though; it is just at times they say something that you don't hear right and at others they will say a ""saying"" and you won't be sure what they are meaning.  Other than that though this one was really cool.",Dog Soldiers

Strange, yep, it sure is and the werewolves do attack but you can't take it all too seriously and that's for me a bit of a problem with this flick.Fist fight with a werewolf, and other things like that do make it a rare flick to watch. And not all is explained, Megan cutting her hand, why and how and what does it mean? How did they become werewolves, it's a myth and why they attack and defend is also a mystery.Attacks do mean gore and yes, here and there it's really messy with a load of red stuff but sadly it's low on gore itself. It's the effects used that are sometimes a bit cheap to watch, intestines hanging out but suremy looks like they are just laying in the body. Fix it with some minute glue no pain or whatsoever, you see, not to be taken seriously.Is it worth a watch. Sure, but don't expect to much of it, weird editing and a lot of shaky cams.

So after watching it I'm really surprised so many people gave it a perfect score because there is so much wrong with Dog Soldiers. First of all, the acting, let just say some of the actors improved alot since making this movie because in Dog Soldiers you get your portion of bad acting. A big reason for that is also the extremely cheesy script, where the dialogues at times couldn't be dumber. Add on that the tons of bad decisions in the story, the werewolves that might have looked good in a 1950 movie but not for a 2002 movie and they were actually the only good part of this movie. I quote another reviewer (joker1actual) : ""When I got this movie I was expecting cheesy American B movie about soldiers against people in rubber wolf masks. How much more wrong could I have been?""

Cheap movies are just as bad as expensive ones, if not more so, and they've become the very thing they shouldn't be: boring.""Dog Soldiers"" is a low-budget British werewolf movie hybrid  it mixes elements of war with sci-fi, horror, comedy and drama. It's a commendable effort. The first hour is a blast.But the second hour is a mess  and not in a good way, either.Plot holes become more abundant than donuts at a police station and characters transform into the all-too-typical cardboard cutouts of cinema, spewing the same stupid garbage we hear from every horror movie released today. ""I'll be back!"" and two seconds later they're dead, or the ""We've got to stick together and be more than men"" bull delivered by a soldier to his fellow comrades in order to boost their morale. It is so annoying. Or how about the tough-but-naïve character we're supposed to like, who's kept around until the end, when he finally dies an honorable death? Yawn.The plot: A pack of British soldiers (Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt) are on a routine training mission in the Scottish high lands when they inadvertently stumble across a pack of bloodthirsty werewolves. After their team is ambushed and their Sergeant left dying, they take refuge in a nearby deserted farmhouse. But the wolves are just warming up for dessert.As I mentioned above, the first hour is superb. The camera work was a bit too fast, but worked well when building suspense and paranoia. The acting was fairly good, the dialogue even better. Like ""Predator,"" it builds itself up as a war film, and then turns into a monster movie.Unlike ""Predator,"" however, ""Dog Soldiers"" becomes silly, stupid and boring. It relentlessly rips off every movie in sight  also including ""Evil Dead,"" ""Aliens,"" ""Platoon,"" ""Blair Witch Project,"" ""The Thing""  and to be fair, it does try to deliver a lot of fun; the problem is that the movie is incredibly insulting and childish.Of course, no movie about werewolves is going to attempt to explain itself seriously (or let's just hope it won't)  and ""Dog Soldiers"" doesn't. But there's a fine line between suspension of disbelief and feeling cheated  it crosses the line.The ending is cheap, tacky and dissatisfying.

28,Red-Barracuda,Reasonable werewolf flick,5,1 October 2009,"This is a fairly run-of-the-mill people trapped-in-a-building-while-homicidal-enemies-try-to-get-in movie. In this case a group of soldiers out on training manoeuvres in the Scottish Highlands wind up trapped in a remote cottage while a group of hungry werewolves try to get in and eat them. There's not a great deal more to the story than that and the set up has been done many other times, the only real difference is it's a bunch of lycanthropes who are the baddies. Other than that this, it follows the same premise that many films such as Night of the Living Dead and Assault on Precinct 13 trod many years previously. It's a decent enough effort, just completely unremarkable; there is very little in the way of surprises here. The werewolves themselves are quite impressive. They aren't often shown in too much detail but when we do see them they are quite well presented. The soldiers themselves are fairly sympathetic but not all that interesting or memorable. Although I did find the Special Forces guy to be a somewhat one-dimensional villain and I couldn't really be bothered with him. Possibly the main fault in the film is that it's just not that scary. There isn't really much of an atmosphere; the focus is mainly on shoot-outs and violent attacks. I think the werewolf presence could've been introduced in a more sinister way, instead we quickly find ourselves in a siege situation, and it does get a little limited and boring after a while.This is an OK horror film that is worth a watch if you like werewolf movies. Nothing too special though.",Dog Soldiers

It's much better than your stereotypical sex-craving young students out in the woods running and getting killed by a creature. This group is a tough military group on a training exercise that is defending themselves against a pack of werewolves.Although the movie was made in 2002, it uses no CGI special effects. It has a wonderful 1980s retro look and feel to the movie. These werewolves are quite amazing to see for a movie that is low budget. The quality of the werewolves is right up there with the classic ""American Werewolf in London"" but the two stories are nothing alike.Yes I recommend this movie if you like werewolf or horror movies in general.

31,sddavis63,Both Frightening And Flawed,7,5 November 2011,"There is so much about this movie that works so very well. Most breathtaking is just the overall atmosphere of the film and the mood that it manages to set. The opening scenes of the young couple in a tent who get attacked by - well, something - is eye catching and creates a feeling of suspense (and even fear) right from the start. The bulk of the movie is then set in this isolated part of the Scottish Highlands, as a unit of the British Army is out on a training mission. It's lonely and it's dark and the soldiers suddenly come under attack from ... what? Well, we know what they are, but the suspense is well built and maintained. It takes a very long time before we get a good look at the beasts. Mostly we get silhouettes and shadows - which probably make this more frightening than if we were looking at them eye to eye. Finally holing up in a local home (which is strangely empty; the family who owns it nowhere to be found) the movie becomes a night-long battle between the soldiers and the werewolves. Frankly, it is at times quite terrifying - exceptionally well done for the most part, and the movie manages to draw you in to the plight of the soldiers, who may be trained for war, but not for this kind of battle. In the end, you sympathize with them and you care about them.But, yes, I said ""for the most part."" There were some things in this that didn't quite work for me. The whole ""special ops"" connection seemed quite unnecessary. It was an add-on; it didn't really further the story and as a result it perhaps distracted a little bit from what was really important - the battle against the werewolves. What should have been the climax of the movie - the last battle against the creatures - also seemed to me a bit overdone. What had been a frightening movie dissolved a little bit into silliness in the end. Those two problems were directly related to the third problem I found here - a couple of characters (Capt. Ryan and Megan) who were in a way quite superfluous to the story. Neither added much of value in my opinion; neither would have been missed much if they weren't there - the story could easily have been adapted in fairly minor ways to make perfect sense without them.Still, there was a lot that was done right in this movie. It's a decent if somewhat flawed addition to the werewolf genre. (7/10)",Dog Soldiers
32,sol-kay,You just let nature take its course,8,9 January 2013,"***SPOILERS*** One of the best yet underrated werewolf movies ever made has a squad of British elite commandos dropped into the Scottish Highlands for field maneuvers and mock warfare with an elite of the elite Special Ops SAS unit. The squad led by Sgt. Harry G. Wells, Sean Partwee, comes across a bloody massacre of SAS troops with only the survivor their commanding officer Captain Ryan, Liam Cunningham, barley alive. Among the squad led by Sgt.Wells is his point man Pvt.Cooper, Kevin McKidd, whom we saw earlier in the film have a violent altercation with Ryan while trying to qualify as an SAS commando. This sets the stage in the movie for the tensions that were to explode between the two later on in dealing with a far worse satiation in what Captain Ryan was keeping from Sgt.Wells and his men. Just why they where there, the Scottish highlands, in the first place and it didn't have anything to do with a harmless military exercise. It had to do with what was soon to become a life and death situation which many of them won't live through!Incredibly gory horror film made all that more effective in being set in the eerie and almost uninhabited and frightful surrounding where it was to take place; In the almost totally isolated from humanity Scottish Highlands. We never get to see the enemy, werewolves, until almost a half hour into the movie. But when they do make their presence known the British commandos realize that they have a life and death struggle on their hands with them, despite all their fire power available to them, being on the short end of the stick. Being picked up by a local resident who lives by herself in the Scottish Highlands zoologist Megan,Emma Cleasby,the surviving commandos spend the evening at her deserted farmhouse that's some 40 to 50 miles from the nearest population,town or village, center in the highlands. It's there that the commandos and Magen make their stand against the almost indestructible band or pack of werewolves hoping to hold them off until sunrise when, with the full moon gone, they go back into their cave until the next moon cycle comes around. But in underestimating just how determined and blood thirsty, for human flesh,the werewolves are the commandos are in for a night of unspeakable horrors that will end up with most of them not seeing the rays of morning sun.***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Not only did Captain Ryan know who the enemy, the werewolves, was but what it's effects like bite and claw marks can cause to its surviving victims and kept that from Sgt. Wells and his men. It wasn't until the very end, with the farmhouse being besieged by the werewolves, that it became evident to Sgt. Wells what Captain Ryan was keeping from him and his men. But by then Captain Ryan realized it was too late for him as well since he was soon to become one of them, guess who, and join to pack! Blood splattering final with the werewolves just about to overtake Pvt.Cooper, the only survivor among the commandos, and finish him off when Megan's pet dog Sam came to his rescue. Not just with his bark but in alerting Pvt. Cooper to a silver plated dagger like letter opener on the floor! That, like a stake driven into a vampires heart, was just all he needed to finish off the last of his attacker!",Dog Soldiers
33,lost-in-limbo,A fun werewolf thrill-ride.,8,24 April 2020,"I remember when I first encountered the striking movie poster in a magazine (and it had an eye-catching comment ""... aliens and predator with a werewolf twist""). There was no question, I'll be seeing this one when it hit the cinema. So when it was released, I was there (along with a friend) and to no surprise there was only one other person in the cinema. I really enjoyed it and was lucky, because after a week it was no longer showing. I've seen it a couple times since and it still remains excitingly explosive in what is far from a gradual stroll through the woods.British director Neil Marshall's (who after this debut feature hit it big with his follow up 2005 film 'The Descent') low-budget home-grown feature superbly mixes a perfect (if rough) blend of gruesome horror and dark humor in what you can call a relentless werewolf shooting parlor in tightening quarters. It was efficiently executed, considering its minor-budget. Biting, cheese-smacked dialogues stream from a naturally committed cast led by Kevin McKidd, Sean Pertwee, Liam Cunningham and Emma Cleasby. The chemistry between them really adds to the film's high-stakes energy. The violence is kept bloody and the towering, menacing werewolf designs (with similarities to those from 'The Howling') look simple, but stood-out due largely to disguising them amongst the kinetic camera-work and shadowy lighting. Those looking for any sort of transformation, don't get your hopes up as it occurs off-screen... be it one slight, basic glimpse.The woodland setting gets atmospheric and the cottage where it mostly takes place holds tight drilling in some exciting passages of siege suspense. The action is jolting, graphic FX (as these werewolves would virtually tear you apart!) is chucked about (look out for sausages) and from that it gathers some intentional laughs. The straight-forward story (soldiers coming up against something unnatural) is concise with the evident clichés being pulled off, despite some contrived developments. Nonetheless it's not enough to destroy the overall fun.I'm curious to what ever happened to the supposedly rumoured sequel Dog Soldiers; Fresh Meat.",Dog Soldiers
34,Robert_duder,A cult classic that spawns as much gore as it does thrill,8,11 September 2008,"I am a horror buff, have been for years, and I am always up for seeing film makers try to do something different even if it's a genre that has been done and done again. I wanted to see Dog Soldiers for a long time because it always looked like a lot of campy fun and the fact that apparently a sequel (which now appears to be scrapped) was in the works. I finally sat down to watch the movie and was really glad I did. First of all Dog Soldiers isn't actually campy at all. The movie turns in a very serious gory film about werewolves, and it even really relies on one of my favorite Horror ideas...isolation. Stuck in an apparently abandoned farmhouse in the UK country side a group of soldiers fight for their lives against these monsters. The movie is part thriller, part monster movie and part good old fashion blood splattering horror. The plot is simple enough but the actors do such an incredible job, some of them really giving great performances, and the special effects while fairly low budget still leave you screaming for more. Certainly director and writer Neil Marshall knows how to give the best possible outcome from a low budget.I became a big fan of Kevin McKidd on the short lived but brilliant Journeyman on TV and then again in his small role in Made of Honor. He really shines leading the cast in this film too. He proves he could carry a film by being tough and macho and the perfect hero. He has a very big fan base and this is a great film for him. Emma Cleasby does a decent job as literally the only female role in the film. She doesn't really stand out against the stronger parts of the cast but she does decently. Fortunately they don't try to force some sort of misplaced romance between McKidd's character and hers outside of some brief sexual tension. Liam Cunningham and Sean Pertwee also give particularly outstanding performances. Either one of them could make for a great villain or a hero and they both really draw you into the story and lock your attention. Between the three guys they make the entire film worthwhile. The rest of the crew, the supporting characters who get smaller roles are excellent and they really do help the story but the three guys and the main girl carry most of the work.As I mentioned Marshall is a good director for this type of film. He knows his limitations and he uses everything to the best possible angle. For instance if there is one downfall to the movie it is that the werewolves look a little cheesy. I mean they look like people in enormous poorly made werewolf costumes. Marshall obviously knew this because he really keeps the camera off of them and uses them more as a hidden horror rather than making them come straight into the forefront. This makes them all the more terrifying and lifts the suspense in the movie and also avoids any comments about cheesy monsters. The story focuses entirely on the survival of this military unit and only briefly touches on the werewolves and their origins and who they are. We do get to see two conversions which is actually done very well but I would have loved to seen them serialize this and give us more story to this pack of werewolves and where they came from. It just felt like there was more story there to tell but they weren't getting to it. There are truly some eye hiding, teeth clenching moments and horror fans and werewolf lovers will find the movie to be really well done. Let's hope the sequel returns and with the same level of work that they put into this one. 8.5 out of 10",Dog Soldiers

A group of soldiers on an apparently routine mission in the Scottish Highlands are besieged by a family of werewolves and are picked off one by one. First time director Neil Marshall also wrote the highly intelligent and, for the most part, very black and funny script, as well as editing the film, but it is in his handling of the action scenes in and around the farmhouse they hole up in that he really shows his mettle.

36,bowmanblue,So simple. So much fun,9,10 June 2014,"Yes, movies like 'Inception' where the plot twists and turns are clever and tax your brain as you try to figure them out. But there's also something to say for the totally simple movies that need no real brainpower to understand them because they're just so perfect as what they are 'Dog Soldiers' doesn't try to baffle you with anything. It's quite simple - werewolves vs soldiers. That's all it is and it benefits from its simplicity.Naturally, it's pretty horrific in places. The film-makers (courageously?) decided to opt for animatronics special effects over computer-generated ones. Again, I think this is a benefit. However, along with the horror and action you have just enough humour added to the mix. A platoon of rough and ready British grunts may not be the most likable bunch of cinematic heroes, but the humour really helps you root for them as they're stage their heroic stand against some pretty overwhelming odds.Basically, if you like either horror or action (especially served with a dose of black humour) then this one's for you.Yes, it's cheap, but it's all the better for not trying to compete with 'Hollywood blockbusters' on their terms.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Dog Soldiers

From the opening scene, to the film's final moment, there literally was never a dull moment, with suspense all the way. This film just got better and better as it progressed, more intriguing and scary!This is not your typical werewolf story, and I enjoyed this breath of fresh air. Instead, the film remains very mysterious and foreboding well into its running time, leaving the viewer guessing as to what is actually going on here. The natural acting added to the credibility of this far-fetched tale. While the werewolf and make-up effects might not be the greatest, the film's tense storytelling more than compensates for that. 'Dog Soldiers' is a werewolf horror movie with substance, and likable characters. There's some humor thrown in here as well, with really funny dialogue, which are never out of place and always appropriate despite the circumstances.

38,sol-,War Dogs,6,17 June 2017,"Attacked by horrific wild beasts while completing a military exercise, a group of British soldiers have to unexpectedly put their skills and training to use in this action thriller with a horror twist. The film is slow to warm up with not one but two prologue sequences (neither of which enhance story) before the film switches to the soldiers in training, but things soon get interesting as the attacks begin. It all starts with a dead cow being hurled at them, which the soldiers of course do not think twice about, believing it to be part of the training. The film does not quite milk their ignorance for all it is worth, but even when they catch onto the seriousness of the situation, it is all quite engaging as we are only shown the briefest snippets of the creatures, mostly in silhouette at that. As the film plods further along though, we get to see more and more of the creatures and the novelty and shock value is not the same when they are seen in full view. The film also feels drawn out given the slimness of the premise. There are a couple of pivotal twists in the second half, but the movie may have well worked better at two thirds of its actual length (with less opportunity for repetitive action). With old school, non-CGI special effects and the occasional thoughtful thing to say about army weaponry and protocols, 'Dog Soldiers' has a fair bit going for it, but the potential for more is noticeable.",Dog Soldiers

I was most impressed by (and not a little envious of) the lycanthropes themselves (whose design owes more than a nod to Rob Bottin's work in THE HOWLING), but the soldiers were throwaway characters whose plight one couldn't really get too worked up over: when they're disemboweled, they simply tie their dangling entrails around their waists and keep on going.

In many respects, this one reminds me of self-conscious films like TALES FROM THE GIMLI HOSPITAL and SIX-STRING SAMURAI: the director is all too painfully aware of the type of films he is ripping off, and contents himself with putting on a display that is, in the end, all form and no substance. Is there a single novel idea in the whole film? If there is, I must've blinked and missed it.",Dog Soldiers

41,jzappa,Relentlessly Gripping Homage Film Humming with Steam Engine Liveliness,7,15 November 2010,"This relentlessly gripping locomotive of a monster movie is splendidly ludicrous and gruesome midnight movie material, without any of the psychosexual drivel usually inherent in modern werewolf fare. Some have shrugged it off as an Aliens knock-off of something of that sort, and while it is a heavy borrower and payer of homage, Dog Soldiers is also a film designed to provide our basest animal expectations from movies about war and military combat by dressing up as a supernatural slasher picture. It's plumb horror, guys getting slaughtered piecemeal in the ghastliest manner possible, and occasionally staying alive in the ghastliest manner possible. Part of what makes Neil Marshall's classy and hard-boiled movie so enjoyable is the exceedingly resourceful crudity of his squadron of British soldiers on a training exercise in the Scottish Highlands.Though Trainspotting's Kevin McKidd plays the heroic action-taker of the squad, it is Sean Pertwee as the Sergeant who takes what might have inevitably been a slavish exposition and made it the most intriguing part, delivering a chilling monologue about a past combat experience, and affording the air of a guy in charge who wouldn't slow down no matter how many internal organs may be discharged by strange talons. We begin to get the feel of a real squad of more or less individual guys, which is more than one could say for most monster movies. Then, the film develops into yet another affair closely akin to Aliens, The Thing, The Evil Dead, humans being slain till there's merely a couple remaining, at which juncture someone is, customarily, furtively one of the beasts.But just as Neil Marshall demonstrated a patent pattern of duality in his work by following up this purely male-dominated horror actioner (with the exception of a ridiculously sexy woman surrounded by man's men who sporadically mention how women screw everything up) with a purely female-dominated horror actioner (with girlfriends seeking to get their minds off men in their pasts), in this very debut film he is not just making a horror film but a guys-on-a-mission film. Dog Soldiers hums with that vigorous, passionate workmanship straddling various tropes to give off the feeling of depth and color to a piece. Just as many successful pulp filmmakers before him and after---Tarantino, Rodriguez, Eli Roth, Zach Snyder, Kevin Smith, Joe Carnahan---Marshall makes essentially an homage film with such steam engine liveliness that pausing to go out for a cigarette never crosses one's mind, and frankly, no matter how above the material anyone might feel they are, we're interested in what happens next.The night under consideration occurs during a full moon, except issues of silver are sparse until the climax in a manner that makes one doubt the success of shooting thousands of rounds at the brutes. Said cheekiness makes this splendidly transparent and adrenalized shocker less a werewolf movie than a genuinely well-done genre Xerox and indie action picture. Shot on what must have been a shoestring, the film's monsters have the magnificent appearance and aura of old-school puppet, make-up and practical-effects handiwork. That Marshall's debut is basically an especially well-directed, serviceably written, marvelously edited, stunningly well-acted, plain chip off various old genre blocks is a natural outcome, but there's a lot to be said for vigor and dexterity.",Dog Soldiers

If you're into the Werewolf legends, and a fair share of gore, this is gonna be a must-see for you. The suspense is wonderful, and the musical score is far better than anything you'd expect from a production such as this. The story and dialog are extraordinarily realistic lending an almost desperate believability to this attempt.The performances were realistically done by all. I was most impressed with the quality of energy these guys gave to this work. Quite honestly, I figured, ""Yeah, yeah; another crappy little nothing movie everybody loves and I'll detest."" I'm glad to report that I was wrong. This movie was a delightful surprise, filled with suspense, atmosphere, action and wolves. Lotso' werewolves. Just excellent work all around. Even the werewolves look good, along with the blood effects. I was honestly impressed.Some critics have labeled this work as ""ridiculous."" That almost put me off giving this one a chance. I am glad I did not listen. To those who have lost the ability to believe, then it may be ridiculous.

44,Polaris_DiB,Good entertainment for maybe a night with friends,5,23 January 2008,"Werewolf movies... a person gets bitten, changes a month later, then stalks around killing innocents until somebody close to him finds him out and ends his life. Or must it be? Dog Soldiers is another action-comedy-horror retelling of a contemporary myth like many others that are coming these days. The idea behind this one is that the pun ""Dog Soldiers"" refers both to the Scottish soldiers doing their drills and the, uh, werewolves that come out of nowhere to attack them. References are made to ""that time of month"" and even The Matrix, but in the meantime we've got action and gore to look forward to.Despite an almost immediate over-use of dissolve that is usually the sign that a movie is poorly created (I guess this movie proves that wrong), it's actually pretty decent. The dialog isn't brilliant, but it is very far from wince-inducing, and heck, you may even find yourself caring about a few of the characters here and there. There are enough explosions, blood-spraying gouges, and fast edits to keep your eyes dazzled. And the filmmakers literally take over a house and do whatever they can to trash it until it's completely destroyed.It's basically the perfect rental for an evening when you just want to get together with some buddies and eat some popcorn or drink a beer or something. And God knows, we need more movies like this that can entertain without being all-out nonsensical and/or obnoxious.--PolarisDiB",Dog Soldiers

The rest of the movie was just men being frightened and yelling at each other macho BS. Most of the movie were taken in darkness, and that's what you did during the movie. Watch much of darkness where there is little light.I wouldn't say that this movie isn't a serious effort on the part of the producers, but I saw little entertainment value in it. If you're going to make a werewolf movie, make a werewolf movie, and not intellectualizing around the whole subject to make it look like there's more substance than there really is.Best avoid this piece.",Dog Soldiers
46,dee.reid,Soldiers + Werewolves = Brave Action Film,8,8 September 2004,"""Dog Soldiers"" is an action film that has the qualities of its many predecessors (""Aliens"" and ""Predator"" come first to mind) but is bravely original in its own unique way. It abides by no set standards other than the story (that we've seen many times before), which has a group of soldiers who are on a routine training mission in the Scottish Highlands and come face-to-face with a pack of bloodthirsty, mutant werewolves.If that's not what gets the hearts of the audience pumping, then it's the wall-to-wall action and incredibly bloody violence. Yes, ""Dog Soldiers"" does make for an exciting action film, with lots of blood and gore and people running from monsters.But surprisingly, there's a strong center about men who are bound by their duties as soldiers and must contend with creatures that are every bit as bound by an honor as they are. This is why we get to learn and understand the men who quickly grow tired and are picked off one at a time by a rarely-seen enemy.You see, much is made in this film about opposing sides coming together and fighting to the death. Given this, it sets up the film's scenario, with the soldiers being ambushed in the woods and later forced to take shelter in an abandoned house, where they fortify it in hopes of surviving until morning while fighting off the werewolves who lurk in the dense forest outside.I doubt that ""Dog Soldiers"" would have been a huge success if released in American theaters given its shaky premise of soldiers vs. werewolves. I'm certain that the critics would be on alert for the slightest flaw in the story and would then rip it to shreds like the wolves in the film do to their prey. And I think that another reason that failure would come so easily to ""Dog Soldiers"" if released in America, would be that it lacks American elements period.It's a Scottish production, with Scottish actors in the roles and I think that would alienate American viewers. But people were flocking to the theaters to see ""Trainspotting"" in 1996 weren't they? As an American movie-goer myself, I would have had no problem giving ""Dog Soldiers"" a chance at the theater. But everybody knows how stubborn Americans can be when it comes to movies, they just won't watch anything without an American element.However, this movie does seemed to have developed a small cult following on VHS and DVD. As I scroll through the IMDb comments index, I can see that a large number of careful and open-minded individuals have showered praise over ""Dog Soldiers.""The first time I watched ""Dog Soldiers"" was only a few months ago, when I caught the second half of the film on the Sci-fi channel and thought that this isn't a bad movie. In fact, it's quite intelligent and brave.What has made ""Dog Soldiers"" the unique film that I think it has become in the last two years, is that it has an intelligent story that plays well under very careful thought. It has action, gore and more action, which makes for quite a fun viewing experience.8/10",Dog Soldiers

Instead, what we basically see, is an entertaining productions with lycanthropes moving around and soldiers fighting for their lives, with touches of gore here and there.(+) As I understood, it was a low-budget movie, so nothing to complain here. They did a good and more than decent job.(+) The acting was good and believable and fun to follow.(+) Very good filming and cinematography in comparison to itself.(-) The movie needed to be deeper and tenser IMO. One of its most negative parts.(-) Almost non existent decent, suspenseful and frightening music.(-) Too much non-believable situations, especially related to the beasts' behaviors. The other most negative part.Of course, the above are my opinions, as I like very scary, deeply frightening movies.
Other reviewers may like it as it is, for its enjoyment and entertaining value.So, in the end, it may not be to everybody's taste; furthermore, I expected more of it for a 2002 thriller, horror categorized movie.Worth the watch for lovers of the genre and definitely better than ""An American Werewolf in London"" IMO, with a faster pace and more solid screenplay, with no backgrounds and many unanswered questions however.",Dog Soldiers

51,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Inventive bloody fun,8,27 October 2015,"Neil Marshall's Dog Soldiers is an inventive little werewolf flick that plays like Predator meets The Howling. Marshall always pushes the visceral envelope with his projects, and this one takes what has been established in the subgenre up to that point, and adds a nice little spin, out of this world creature effects, gritty performances and no small amount of humour. A routine training mission for SAS special forces operatives gets hairy when they are cut off from communication in the English moors, and realize they are being hunted by something..big. Heading up the squadron is hard bitten Wells (the always awesome Sean Pertwee), with sympathetic Cooper (Kevin Mckidd) as his second in command. They stumble on Cooper's former commander lost in the woods, a royal prick named Captain Ryan, played by Liam Cunningham. Liam uses his acid tongued wit to bring us a contemptible A hole that you just can't help but root for. The squad attempts to evade and survive, and eventually run into a mysterious girl (Emma Cleasby) who knows the terrain and guides them to shelter. Soon they are surrounded on all sides by a horde of angry lycantnhropes, and must fight tooth and nail to escape with their lives. The cast throws themselves right in, the effects are stellar and refreshingly practical based, and Marshall directs with a sense of fan boy enthusiasm, especially in a spectacularily gory climax.",Dog Soldiers

53,I_Ailurophile,Superb action-horror that exceeds all expectations,9,26 October 2021,"Gorgeous, lush filming locations contrast vividly with the substantial blood and gore. The premise plainly denotes a more action-oriented flick than the average werewolf movie, and that's just what we get. The film's prior association with what is now the SyFy channel confers little reassurance - yet while this is only the debut feature of writer-director Neil Marshall, he readily demonstrates film-making skill that makes 'Dog soldiers' a solid cut above the average creature feature.Yes, it's a little cheeky and over the top at points, with small touches that inform the movie isn't wholly serious about itself. But these are employed sparingly to taste, adding piecemeal levity to break up the horror, and come off as endearing instead of cheesy. The screenplay even glosses over the common tropes of werewolf films, dispensing with those notions we've seen again and again to cut more directly to the bloodshed. Cemented with great special effects - viscera and crimson not least of all - and strong scene writing, bursts of action are wonderfully exciting, and even when the frenetic violence subsides the picture sustains a ponderous, tense atmosphere.It goes without saying that movies like this don't generally pay much heed to depth of character writing or plot, let alone dialogue, but again 'Dog solders' surprises. We're allowed to see real personality shine through in these figures, and while the writing is not so lax as to enable the cast to illustrate Shakespearean grandeur, the assembled players inhabit their roles with admirable, welcome nuance and range (if constricted by the genre). Underneath the ""werewolves versus soldiers"" tomfoolery lies captivating, concrete story beats far more carefully considered than the genre has trained us to anticipate. For that matter: any given action-horror flick is apt to try to strike shifting moods that are not realized authentically and instead impress as very ham-handed. Here, Marshall's writing is so adept that genuine emotional beats are organically woven in to make the narrative even more complete and well-rounded. And like those varying sentiments, the script in such features is broadly full of schlock, but once more Marshall pens lines that feel real and believable instead of forced and kitschy.Composer Mark Thomas' score is very suitable, ably lending its ambience at all times. Yet at some moments, especially in the last act, he hits upon some true dynamic brilliance that far exceeds expectations. The lycanthropes actually look really great, a relatively rare feat when cinema so often struggles to depict the beasts in a fashion that's at all credible. The camera never completely locks in on a transformation, only showing bits and pieces, but what we do see again looks far better than we've come to assume. Truthfully, I don't think there's any aspect of 'Dog soldiers' that doesn't grab my attention as startling well done, and easily eclipsing countless other movies that play at the same intersection of genres.It's not necessarily perfect; in particular, the first act is a little rough around the edges. And by all means, this won't be the sort of movie that's for everyone, and that's perfectly okay. But I began watching with mixed expectations, presuppositions built from past experience, and I've been handily pleased with what I see. This is a comparatively rare instance when the action and horror genres are blended to a fluid consistency, and the result is delicious. Every element is astonishingly well crafted, marking 'Dog soldiers' as a very strong debut for a filmmaker, and a fantastic, satisfying slice of entertainment.",Dog Soldiers
54,dworldeater,"Essential horror/action and one the best werewolf movies ever , with the only exception being An American Werewolf In London",9,4 March 2016,"This places our heroes, a group of British soldiers out on a routine training exercise in the Scottish Highlands. They soon discover a special forces camp wiped out and torn to pieces. They take as many weapons and live ammunition that they can carry and find themselves engaged in pursuit and combat with a ravenous pack of werewolves. They receive aid from a local girl who shelters them in a deserted farmhouse where our ill fated platoon must stand their ground and try to survive the night against the big bad wolves that await them outside. The wolves are very big and bad indeed, standing at over 7ft tall, with great speed and strength and a craving for human flesh. They will not go down easily and it takes a strong resolve and a hail of gunfire to keep them at bay. Sean Pertwee and Kevin McKidd are first and second in command of this unit, they do a great job in commanding their unit and are very convincing as soldiers. The group of soldiers was pretty authentic, convincing and displayed excellent chemistry and camaraderie. This film is really well made and has tight direction, solid storytelling, great practical f/x and good acting. The dialogue is good as the action, of which there is an abundance of here as our soldiers don't back down and unleash a storm of steel at their undead predators. Dog Soldiers also delivers big on gore and is very brutal and bloody. This is director Neil Marshall's film debut and is pretty close to flawless.

This movie left quite an impression on me when I first saw it back in high school. I was just starting to get into horror film, and I remember going over to a buddy's house to watch this and being blown away by the amount of gore they crammed into this film, but also the amount of tension that ran throughout the story. It had been years since I watched this, but in that time I'd been touting this film as one of the best werewolf movies ever made. I wont lie, I was a bit nervous to revisit it, as some of the films I watched in that time, and used to hold in high esteem, I now think are garbage. Regardless, when my roommates and I were looking for a horror flick, I suggested this, and we watched it. To my great delight, this film still holds up after almost seventeen years.",Dog Soldiers
56,vertigo_14,Not much to it. (spoilers),6,11 March 2005,"Recent foreign indie horror has been a surprising treat for me, especially 'Murder By Design' and 'Brotherhood of the Wolf.' But, there was just not enough substance to this film about a group of British soldiers who encounter a clan of rabid werewolves while out in the country doing military drills. The movie may aim to be somewhat character-driven, at least initially as we get some sketchy idea about the primary characters (thoughy one or two are of real focus, but there really is no main character over all in this film). The entire movie, however, is simply these guys trying their best to dodge their attackers while holed up in a country home with a young woman. Something that we have already been exposed to in the Romero zombie series...that matter of just waiting and continuously being limited in mobility and defense as the beasts continue to try all they can to get to these people before they people can successfully kill them. Only here, it's werewolves and not zombies (though the werewolf fiction has the same effect as zombies...one bite turns you into the monster).This is the bulk of the movie while the first few minutes is just meant to arouse your suspicions of what creepy thing is going to happen to these generally easy-going soldiers in the middle of a lonely, dark forest. But, the entire time is just a minute-by-minute scare fest about the beast fiercely trying to get to his victims. There's not much to it. May be best enjoyed upon first-time viewing. After that, I'm not sure how long the simplicity will hold your interest.",Dog Soldiers
57,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Werewolves vs Soldiers,8,9 September 2020,"This is a subgenre of horror that I don't really venture into too often. I actually really enjoy the idea of the werewolf, it just to seem like one where there aren't a lot that come out and I've seen most of the major classics. This was a film that I had been meaning to see for awhile as it has been talked about on a lot of podcasts I listen to. I have no given it a second viewing as part of The Podcast Under the Stairs Summer Challenge Series for the 2000s. The official synopsis for the film is a routine military exercise turns into a nightmare in the Scotland wilderness.We kick off with a couple in the Scotland Highlands as they are vacationing. The woman gives her boyfriend a present that is a silver letter opener. That night they are attacked by something in their tent. Afterwards we see that there's a full moon out.It then shifts to a soldier who is being trained to join a Special Forces unit. He has been captured and his name is Cooper (Kevin McKidd). The captain of this unit is Ryan (Liam Cunningham). The last thing he has to do it is shoot a dog that helped find him. When Cooper refuses he fails the test and Ryan does it himself.The film then shifts to a month later. A unit of soldiers is doing a routine military exercise as the synopsis states. It sounds like they're going up against a unit of Special Forces soldiers in a kind of competition. The leader of this unit is Sgt. Harry G. Wells (Sean Pertwee). Cooper is also a member here after not getting into the Special Forces.That first night they get a scare when a cow is thrown into their camp. It is covered in bit marks and it freaks the unit out. They then happen upon a camp that looks like it belongs to the other unit. There are no bodies, but there is equipment left behind and blood everywhere. They do find Ryan wounded and help him. The radio is smashed so they can't call for help. Wells goes off and is attacked by what decimated the other unit, werewolves. Ryan keeps repeating that they only thought there was one. Cooper saves Wells from death, but he needs medical attention as his stomach has been ripped open.Those still alive flee into the woods and happen upon a road. A woman stops, Megan (Emma Cleasby). She takes them to the closest house to hold up until morning. They have to deal with periodic attacks by the creatures. The occupants are nowhere to be found, even though it looks like they just up and left. There is a much deeper plot going here that involves Ryan, Megan and the occupants of the house.My plan isn't to spoil all of the reveals in this film, but I like a lot of what this film did. From the items in the Special Unit camp, we can tell that they were trying to capture one of these werewolves. I like the idea that there's a think-tank of Special Weapons that is trying to use the data from that to create military applications. It is pretty messed up that the other unit was brought in as bait. I do like this idea though of trained soldiers being in over their head against creatures like we get here, especially since they're supposed to be better equipped than normal people.There is also the idea of genetics that's used here. I found it interesting that the highlands of Scotland were used, as I feel this is very similar as to where An American Werewolf in London begins. I wouldn't be surprised as there are quite a few nods in this film like the names of two of the soldiers, Sgt. H.G. Wells and Cpl. Bruce Campbell (Thomas Lockyer). This film is also kind of similar to The Evil Dead in that they go into the woods, something comes after them and they hold in a cabin. Very loosely based, but there are the parallels. There is a feel of the siege narrative as well.My first viewing here, I did have an issue with the pacing. With a second viewing, I don't really have that much of a problem anymore. I do feel that it runs a bit long still. Trimming 15 minutes could have tightened up what we got as there is a bit of downtime where we aren't progressing the story or learning enough about the characters. I get the feel part of this is to get us closer to daybreak, which is salvation for the characters.Acting for this film I thought was really good. Pertwee was solid as the leader who is out of commission for a stretch. There is something that gets introduced when he is sleeping, but then we see that it fits for him as well. McKidd was also good as the soldier with morals who will stick to them. I like that he is one of the newest soldiers in the unit, but he has survival skills beyond his rank. On top of that, he really takes everything over due to his abilities which I enjoyed. Cleasby was good to fill in more of the science and ecological aspect of the film. I like that they did well in grounding it in reality. Cunningham I think is a fine actor. He doesn't have much of a part in this film, but I love the change in character. He is a jerk through and through, but it is much different when he is found wounded. The rest of the cast round out the film well.Something else I've been excited to talk about with the film was the effects. I love when I saw that everything in this film was done practically. This was at the height of bad CGI and this film decided to go a different way. The werewolves do look a tad skinny to me, but I don't really mind it. They look and move in a realistic way, which I believe I read they were played by dancers. That does seem to make sense and really helps. They are bipedal if you are curious, which isn't my preferred form. The effects of the blood and gore in the film also look really good. If anything, it borders a bit on being too much blood at times, but I love that these werewolves tear their victim apart if they get the chance. I thought the fight scenes among the soldiers and the werewolves were also well done. I have nothing negative to say here.Now with that said, I really liked this film. I found it to be one of the better werewolf films that have come out since the 2000s. I thought it had an interesting story and setting. That was something I really did touch on. They are ways away from people and that adds to the fear. Grounding the werewolves in reality was something that I thought was really good in this film as well. Acting was very solid across the board. The effects were amazing. My issues with the pacing aren't as bad as the first time, but there is a bit that could be trimmed in my eyes. The score of the film didn't really stand out to me, but I didn't have anything negative against it. I found this to be a good film and definitely worth a viewing.",Dog Soldiers
58,Samiam3,A little furry fun,6,17 June 2009,"Potentially entertaining with a breezy sense of wacky fun, but a little choppy in pacing, Dog Soldiers feels like a bit of a throwback, to old zombie films like 'Night of the living Dead', where the characters must survive on wits or be picked off, and creatures live on questionable special effects and fun disgusting gore. Wolf Soldiers sets itself up well, but gradually gets faster and faster and more chaotic, showing a certain lack of knowledge and control on the part of the filmmakers. After seeing 'The Descent' however, I realize that director Neil Marshall has come quite a ways since this. If he had a little more experience with the genre when he made Dog Soldiers, than it would've certainly be an equally fun movie, instead it is mildly fun.In the beautiful Scottish highlands, a military squad on a routine training exercise is forced to make a stand in an abandoned house against a family of werewolves after barely surviving an attack in the woods. They run into a local zoologist who offers to help but seems to know more about what is going on than she is telling . As I said, the formula is very similar to 'Night of the Living Dead', only it is far less restrained. It is fast, gory and violent. Very often in movies, soldiers are portrays as dumb ruffians who tell crude jokes, insult each other and are in love with firepower. While some of that behavior is seen in a few of our characters, these soldiers are a much more likable bunch, and we end up routing for them. Such is not the case with films like Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' where we want the monster to win, because he is so much smarter. Dog Soldiers needs a little work and polishing, but for Neil Marshall, it is an excellent start to building an identity as a horror filmmaker.",Dog Soldiers
59,Matt_Layden,Best Werewolf Film to this date.,9,14 February 2005,"Dog Soldiers opens in Scotland, where two love struck campers are attacked by some creature in the middle of the night. Cut ahead a few weeks and we are introduced to a group of army trainees that are left in the woods as part of an exercise against a team of Special Forces. Lead by Sergeant Wells (Sean Pertwee) and motivated by Private Cooper (Kevin McKidd), the squad is surprised upon their first nightfall in the wild by a mutilated cow that is thrust into their campsite. Following the bloody trail of the animal, they are soon led to the massacred remains of the elite Special Forces team that was stationed in the same region. Evidence of a struggle was everywhere, but no bodies were immediately evident, except for the ramblings of the sole survivor, Captain Ryan (played by Liam Cunningham) who was severely injured during the night.There are countless references to other great movies from 'The Evil Dead' (the closing shot through the doorway) to the ingenious 'Matrix' quote, 'there is no Spoon' when the character Spoon is splattered all over the cottages kitchen. My favourite line in the whole movie is from Spoon, when he knows he is about to die ""I hope I give you the shits!"" The Special Effects of Bob Keen really capture the essence of terror and realism with peoples insides being ripped apart by hungry and very realistic lycanthropes. Not that I know what a real werewolf looks like as I've never met one. GORE, GORE, GORE. If you love to see a guy trying to hold his intestines in while being chased by a werewolf, check this flick out.Neil Marshall's first flick deserves much praise for cleverly combining horror and comedy as other films have done so well in the past. I am so pleased with his directing and writing skills for this flick. If this is what he offered on his first outing, then I can't wait to see what he has for us with more experience. When watching it, I can't help but feel that there is a very tongue-in-cheek aspect to the film. I mean, who, in this world, would have a bareknuckle fistfight with a werewolf? Pertwee, one of the main characters, spends much of the film clutching his stomach trying to hold in his own guts, having has his belly torn open by a werewolf near the start of the film. Now that's something you don't often see in your average horror flick. Also, the action takes place on the same night that England's footballers demolished Germany 5-1 in Munich, and there are lots of humorous references to football and some of the hunted soldiers are determined just to stay alive long enough to find out what the final score was. The excitement during the siege of the remote farmhouse is so raw that you'll probably bite your nails down to the quick.The film is fun, funny, scary and contains some of the most gruesome scenes I have ever seen - sure its been done before - but who cares?! Its a great movie and well worth hiring if not adding to your own collection.",Dog Soldiers
60,screenman,Just A Dog,2,11 May 2010,"I thought 'The Bunker' was bunk, though it had an occasional moment or two; but this - this was something else.I'm trying to think of the reasons why I have awarded it even 2 stars and frankly I don't know what they might be.A bunch of po-faced woefully uncharismatic young soldier-characters become trapped in a farmhouse by some werewolves. What they have to do then is think up all manner of sublimely silly ways in which they can each be picked-off by the beasties.The lighting is primitive rather than imaginative. The sets are simple rather than believable. The sound-effects are insubstantial. The acting is as wooden as the worst made-for-TV-on-a-limited-budget drama imaginable - around late 1960's 'Doctor Who' vintage. For some reason each character is required to speak in monotone, like premiership footballers or Daleks after public-school elocution lessons. If there was a director, I saw no evidence that he ever visited on set. The creatures themselves are so absolutely tacky that we only ever glimpse them. Freeze the frame and you'll laugh out loud. Just compare and contrast with the ancient Lon Chaney movies or the still-benchmark shocker of 'American Werewolf', itself almost a generation older.But the real bete-noir has to be the script. It is Godawfully wretched. As the movie progressed I found myself reaching ever more often for the remote-control 'mute' button. Finally, the last 20 minutes or so became a silent movie.An armed group under siege from monsters inevitably invokes memories of the scene in 'Aliens' when Ripley and the surviving marines are holed up waiting for the creatures to get around the automatic machine-guns and break in. 'Aliens' is a generation older, yet this pap doesn't even begin to come close to it in any aspect.I recently watched 1950's 'Quatermass 2' and was thoroughly entertained despite its cheapness and great age. But this - well; it's the movie that's the real dog.In Britain, we appear unable to make a decent B-movie shocker any more.",Dog Soldiers
61,mjw2305,Just Another Werewolf Flick? Think again!,9,15 March 2004,"American Werewolf in London, was always my favourite werewolf movie. well, this is better!The cast are not widely known, familiar faces, but no star names, yet they all give first class performances. The dialogue is slick and realistic and the plot and characters build very well.The gore is truly realistic and looks painful at times, similar to some of the scenes at the start of Private Ryan.Most of the characters are rock hard nutter's, and they spout off cheesy lines like 'Come and ave a go if you think your hard enough!' and 'I Hope i give you the Sh*t's, you F*ck*n Wimp!' said just after a great fist fight with a werewolf and just before he is about to be eaten.At no point does this movie try to take itself seriously, and that's why its so good. It really is very funny and at the same time pretty realistic (for a werewolf film). If you like the genre you simply have too see this film, if you don't your missing a treat.9/10 Great fun",Dog Soldiers

63,mentalcritic,An interesting premise let down slightly,7,8 January 2005,"The premise behind Dog Soldiers is simple enough. Stick a bunch of soldiers in lands patrolled by werewolves and let nature take its course. The story starts out with the suggestion that the Dog Soldiers of the title are in fact, some kind of super-bred dog designed for hunting down soldiers. Unfortunately, this relatively unused idea is soon discarded in favour of werewolves, a subject that has not been done better since the Landis masterpiece, An American Werewolf In London. Perhaps this is because AAWIL bothered to set up the werewolf character in a manner that makes one care about them. Dog Soldiers' heroes have a few pop culture references, but that is about it.To the credit of the filmmakers in this case, they manage to make the comedic one-liners, a facility that has been run into the ground by Arnold Schwarzenegger, work. They even manage to take one of the most irritating, pathetic lines of The Matrix, and make it funny. There's no outright belly laughs here, but proceedings once the soldiers make it to the farmhouse are amusing enough to keep the audience focused for a while.Taking a cue from Night Of The Living Dead, much of the film concerns itself with keeping the werewolves out while searching for a way to escape them. There's even a scene involving an attempt to retrieve a truck that goes awry. While none of this is presented as brilliantly as NOTLD, Dog Soldiers does manage to hold its own in an overcrowded slasher film market. Perhaps it is the strong build-up of the characters, played ably by such British greats as Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, and Emma Cleasby. The soldier characters in particular get to form a bond with the audience, which gives the outcome a weight that has been missing from many films of this variety that aren't The Evil Dead.The werewolf effects are also fairly impressive. Rather than take the easy way out with CGI, the filmmakers opted for body suits with stilts or animatronics. Rather than showing us too much a la Alien 3, or too little a la the 1998 production of Godzilla, the makers of Dog Soldiers got their creature effect balance just right. There is one shot in which it simply appears that someone out of frame blew steam across the focal point, but the sound effects and dialogue make it work far better than any hyper-realistic CGI shot. The transformation effects are a little overdone, and come nowhere near Rick Baker's awesome work in An American Werewolf In London, but they're passable in light of the film's B-grade origins.If there is one problem with Dog Soldiers, it is that too many conclusions are reached without adequate setup. I like to call this the Jackson effect, after Peter Jackson, who probably regards Stephen King's bastardised example of Hansel And Gretel under this effect as a masterwork. Dog Soldiers has too many scenes where we are told that something happened, or someone made a choice, without being shown any of it. The inconsistencies of timing with the transformations in some sequences also makes for a big problem that is thankfully overcome by the entertainment factor.I gave Dog Soldiers a seven out of ten. I was originally only going to give it five, but I watched it again and found that it had more redeeming qualities than I gave it credit for on the first viewing. It's not a classic, but nor is it a complete waste of time.",Dog Soldiers
64,phubbs,Dog Soldiers,7,27 October 2014,"Could this be the British werewolf equivalent of 'Aliens'? a group of soldiers forced into a tight space, trapped and being taken down one by one, it does feel like it when you watch. But lets not take anything away from this film, its a low budget basic thriller which works beautifully utilising all the right tricks in the book. The werewolves are kept out of sight for much of the time, lots of shadows and darkness, a good barren wilderness location, tense sweaty and claustrophobic with some good amounts of gore, not overblown.Marshall really has taken a leaf outta Cameron's book, a leaf? nay...a whole flippin' bush! as previously said the film really is 'Aliens' with werewolves but its so damn fun to watch (and British made) that you have to forgive the blatant concept rip off. The small group of soldiers really work well together and you do care for them as Marshall wisely builds the characters before hand, you know they're all gonna die but never sure which one will remain in tact at the end. Of course everyone is rather clichéd and predictable with their dialog and portrayals, Cunningham is the nasty outsider (Burke) who obviously will die but calmly growls and snarls his lines of doom to the rest in the mean time...just asking for it really.Some brilliant sequences that go from outright horror to dark gallows humour such as Pertwee having his bowels/intestines super glued back inside him after a nasty attack. Things get quite tense towards the end as the lycans get too close for comfort and we start to see more glimpses of the pretty solid effects used. Men in suits of course, they do look original in design but a little like overgrown Alsatians with hairless bodies. Some good mechanical mask work but again they don't actually look overly ferocious or scary to me, I really didn't like the hairless muscular body idea.The werewolf vision was pretty neat though, not exactly original these days but at the time it was sweet. A simple steadicam with a wide angle and a slightly undercranked film speed gave a decent eerie beast- like POV.Its gritty dirty bloody basic effortlessly British, has a cool movie poster and you want Cunningham to die right from the very start after he kills that poor doggie. At times it does feel like it could use a bit of Hollywood sheen to really make more of an impact for some sequences and the score seems a tad lackluster. Overall this is a great human vs werewolf flick that really does show what 'Underworld' could of been.7/10",Dog Soldiers

The film is about a group of soldiers on routine patrol in Scotland come across what seems to be a group of man eating beasts that turn out to be warewolf's and do their best to fight of the constant attack by the flesh eating beasts. What i like about the movie that while it has a good blend of horror and action it is also very amusing in parts to and unlike most hollywood horrors it it funny when the director means it to be!

67,jluis1984,A movie like horror movies used to be...,9,24 March 2006,"""Dog Soldiers"", written and directed by newcomer Neil Marshall, is definitely one of the biggest surprises of the decade, as it is a movie that summons everything the horror genre is about and mixes it in a gripping roller-coaster that just grabs you from start to end. Neil Marshall creates a powerful movie in the werewolf sub-genre and easily demonstrates how horror movies should be done and quickly establishes himself as a very promising talent with a bright future in film-making.The plot follows a group of soldiers of the Scotland's Army, during a practice deep inside Scottish forests. Suddenly, they discover that they are being hunted by a group of enormous wolf-like beasts. What started as practice becomes a war for survival between the soldiers and the werewolves that will put to test their skills and their team work.""Dog Soldiers"" successfully mixes horror, suspense, and action; in way very similar to what ""Alien"" did before, although with a small dose of dark humor that blends perfectly in the mix. Neil Marshall pays homage to the genre he loves and at the same time he delivers one of the most original movies of the genre. Along with the Canadian ""Ginger Snaps"", this movie ranks among the best werewolf movies and it seems that this decade will be remembered as a renaissance for the genre.One of the strongest points of the movie, is the skillful use of its limited special effects. According to many sources, Marshall intended to use CG effects, but after the poor results, he decided to use the traditional effects of make-up and prosthetics.While this may sound like a bad choice, Marshall manages not only to present one of the scariest and most intimidating werewolf design to date; his mastery with the camera and the lighting allow him to give more power to the image of his wolf and hide any flaw the special effect may have.The acting is surprisingly good, with Sean Pertwee and Kevin McKidd in the lead roles, as Sgt. Harry Wells and Pvt. Cooper respectively. They carry the movie perfectly and Sean Pertwee has great scenes in his role as the grumpy Sgt. Wells. The whole cast has enough chances to shine, as the script is very well developed and the characters are more than bi-dimensional soldiers. Each one has a story and a defined personality, something rare in modern horror movies.The direction is flawless, and the story very original; the least that can be said about ""Dog Soldiers"" is that it will become a classic as it marks the debut of one of the most promising directors of the decade. 9/10",Dog Soldiers
68,stamper,Worth while,8,4 September 2004,"This one is the best werewolf film I've ever seen. I must admit that it hasn't got the greatest special effects or the biggest names in the acting business attached to it, but the film succeeds in doing what needs to be done: it keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride and it doesn't let you go for one minute. Other than that, the actors are pretty good and there are also some good comedic moments. If you want a nice night of entertainment, suspense and scares give this one a try, because despite not being the most original or inventive film out there, it does not only promise to deliver IT DOES SO!!! I just know that I especially (and two others) highly enjoyed this low budget horror flick.8 out of 10",Dog Soldiers
69,ivo-cobra8,My number 1 the best werewolf horror film of all time a true classic masterpiece,10,16 October 2016,"Dog Soldiers (2002) is my number 1 favorite best werewolf film of all time, a true horror classic! I love this film to death and it is my favorite action horror werewolf film in the horror genre! It is number 1 because it is simple, it is soldiers and werewolf's and they fight! Well directed and written by Neil Marshall who directed The Descent and Doomsday, I still have to watch Doomsday. I never saw before The Descent and I am not planning too. Dog Soldiers is my all time favorite werewolf movie because it reminds a bit on Aliens, instead of Aliens is werewolf's. It is practical I didn't noticed any CGI in it, I like the werewolf's they are tall and giant monsters. I like the cast you have Kevin McKidd as lead, you have Sean Pertwee as his commander the name of the character is Sergeant Harry G. Wells. Kevin McKidd is Private Lawrence Cooper. Liam Cunningham is Captain Ryan the human bad guy in this, he is the guy we don't trust. I also like this guy Darren Morfitt who plays Private Phil ""Spoon"" Witherspoon. Thomas Lockyer is Corporal Bruce Campbell the name and the last name from the actor Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead trilogy). This THE BEST WEREWOLF movie of all time! It won in 2002 the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film's Golden Raven, so you get an idea.""Do you think it's all over? It is now."" Plot: A British Squad is sent on a training mission in the Highlands of Scotland against Special Operations squad. Ignoring the childish ""campfire"" stories heard about the area, they continue with their mission and come across the bloody remains of the Special Ops Squad, and a fierce howling is pitching the night sky... With two mortally wounded men, they make an escape, running into a zoologist by the name of Megan - who knows exactly what hunts them. What began as what they thought was a training mission turns into a battle for their lives against the most unlikely enemies they would have expected - werewolves.This is actually British film it is not an American film, but I absolutely love it to death! THIS is how you do action horror movie with gore, suspense and most of all action. 100% fun and one of the movies that never gets boring. I specially liked the ending and I mean at the part where Wells sacrifices himself and blows up the house killing entire werewolf family excellent bad - ass scene ever!!! Neil Marshalls best film hands down. This film is so much fun and the werewolves look so bad ass. Love the fight scene at the end. A classic movie and a perfect example to every movie maker out there on how you can make a fantastic film on a low budget! It would have been awesome to see Statham take on these werewolves. But I liked the lead actors, great action, environment. I enjoy Dog Soldiers! Jason Statham as the main lead would be a bad ass seeing him kicking werewolf's ass! There is a lot of this movie that I like: it is a true horror film, you see people get's slashed and ripped off, you see a lot of blood and so on. I love the line when Cooper (Kevin McKidd) says a line Do you think it's all over? It is now and bum he blows to pieces Ryan/werewolf (Liam Cunningham) with a shot gun. I love that there is one sole survivor in this movie, entire squad get's eaten by werewolf's. You have a lot of gun fire power, soldiers are using a machine gun Heckler & Koch MP5A2 which is awesome. I love practical digital visual effects for werewolf's the animatronics by the company image FX were fantastic and the best one I ever saw! The physical-effects supervisor and stunt coordinator Harry Wiessenhaan was great and brilliant he knew how to make a werewolf for making this movie. Neil Marshall written and directed this movie so well and he really did made an excellent job making a horror film.Dog Soldiers is a 2002 British action horror film written and directed by Neil Marshall, and starring Kevin McKidd, Sean Pertwee and Liam Cunningham. A British production, set in the highlands of Scotland, it was filmed almost entirely in Luxembourg.Overall: Splitting the difference, we get an 10/10 -- an outstanding score, I absolutely love this movie to death, it is original and it is brilliant horror action film my number 1 favorite werewolf movie!",Dog Soldiers

Dog Soldiers is an above-average horror flick with solid performances and genuine respect for the genre. The monsters' increasingly dangerous attacks are tense and fun; the script features a nice amount of humour. Pity editing in action scenes is way too frantic.The werewolves' appearance (practical effects) works well, as CGI beasts wouldn't fit this kind of visceral horror, where creatures need some physicality. When the towering monsters break in, all claws and fur and dripping jaws, one gets a thrill of the Rick Baker/Stan Winston/Rob Bottin old-school variety.A few years later, the already promising Marshall would show further growth with the masterful The Descent.7/10",Dog Soldiers
71,juliankennedy23,Werewolves... The second scariest thing that happens once a month,8,15 May 2005,"Dog Soldiers: 8/10: There are a lot more vampire movies than werewolf movies. (According to an IMDb keyword search 677 vs. 195) This shouldn't reflect badly on our hairy nocturnal lycanthropic friends. It's a matter of F/X. For a vampire all you need is some pancake make-up, some dime store false teeth, and some Goth clothes and your good to go. Werewolves on the other hand actually require some special effects. I've noticed as a result independent B-movies that feature werewolves tend to be more competently filmed, tighter scripted affairs. (Think Ginger Snaps) Dog Soldiers fits that bill in spades. Really a combination of Predator and Rio Bravo, Dog Soldiers does not have one boring moment, one unnecessary scene, one bit of extraneous padding so often found in films today. The Werewolves look pretty good, the gore is plentiful and the movie overall looks great. There also isn't a groaner moment where someone acts out of character or does something remarkably stupid. (No we found three dead bodies lets go skinny dipping moments.) If anything the characters seem to become more resourceful the worse the odds get. (And they get bad fast) The werewolves also truly terrorize both our protagonists and the audience.(The werewolves are big and strong and formidable fighters). It's bad odds for our heroes though not impossible. Of course this being an independent British production there is a good possibility the werewolves will win. (Not as likely needless to say in Werewolf the remake starring Brandon Fraser and Kirsten Dunst and rated PG-13)Once again exciting movie on a tight budget, and when the characters that had been injured start healing a little to fast Did I mention it's also a little like The Thing?",Dog Soldiers
72,gregsrants,A good mix of horror and old time story telling,7,6 December 2003,"I can't explain why I picked up the DVD, Dog Soldiers off the video store shelf.  The box art consisted of poorly drawn wolves and there was a tag line that read `From the producers of Hellraiser'.  Normally this combination would have me wiping down the cover in an attempt to remove any evidence that my fingerprints were interested in pursuing the rental.  But, somehow, Dog Soldiers worked its way into the Saturday night rental pile and once all other options were exhausted, there I was, reluctantly putting the DVD into the player and hoping that there would be enough of anything to entertain me until bedtime.Dog Soldiers opens in Scotland, where two love struck campers are attacked by some creature in the middle of the night.  Cut ahead a few weeks and we are introduced to a group of army trainees that are left in the woods as part of an exercise against a team of Special Forces.  Lead by Sergeant Wells (Sean Pertwee) and motivated by Private Cooper (Kevin McKidd), the squad is surprised upon their first nightfall in the wild by a mutilated cow that is thrust into their campsite.  Following the bloody trail of the animal, they are soon led to the massacred remains of the elite Special Forces team that was stationed in the same region.  Evidence of a struggle was everywhere, but no bodies were immediately evident, except for the ramblings of the sole survivor, Captain Ryan (played by Liam Cunningham) who was severely injured during the night.  Within moments, the group is besieged by wolf-like creatures and run for their lives towards the tree line, where they are fortunate enough to cross paths with a young woman that takes the remaining soldiers to a remote farm house.  As night progresses, onslaught upon onslaught is countered by the soldiers as they fight to keep the werewolves out of their new fortress, but some, one by one, they fall victims to the creatures hunger.Dog Soldiers is one of those rare horror movies that actually works.  The creature effects are better than most bigger budgeted werewolf movies States side, and there are a few genuine good scares and tension as mounted by writer/director Neil Marshall.  What I also appreciated from the film was its sense of humour, or rather; it's lack of it.  In today's horror genre, we are subjected to countless Freddyisms' or inside jokes that make the Scream series such a box-office bonanza.  However, Dog Soldiers checks its humour at the door and focuses on the characters and claustrophobic feel of being trapped in a surrounded country house.  Actually, the only chuckle you will get in this film will is mixed with extreme horror and gore.  It occurs in a scene where the family dog pulls on the intestines of the living Sergeant Wells and he fights with the dog for his innards while the troops fight off a wave of attacks by the wolves at the front door.  You'll find yourself smiling and then grotesquely repulsed by the same scene that put a smile in your cheeks.  I am not saying that Dog Soldiers is perfect.  Not by any means.  But horror films have never really gotten any better over the years, as Hollywood still tries to recapture such terror as identified in The Exorcist or Alien. However, Dog Soldiers will entertain and isn't that all we are looking for?",Dog Soldiers
73,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Terrific genre flick,9,29 January 2008,"As far as genre pictures go, you can't expect to much complexity or elaborate special effects and set designs. What you can expect, however, is something that doesn't take money to create, something that can be made from thin air, if done right and that's suspense/tension. ""Dog Soldiers"" is basically a movie just like that. Good, though not spectacular production design, but a great sense of tension.I guess it has been done many time before that soldiers (or just people with guns) find themselves trapped in a small space from something awful lurking just outside that would happily munch them. Here we have soldiers that during routine exercise are chased into a cabin by hungry werewolves that we can only presume are hungry. Naturally the production has its limitations and perhaps the logic of events some lapses, but the film strives to be clever and not cool. End result is: it actually ends up being quite cool. The special effects seem to be solely aesthetic meaning no crappy CGI and they are shown in such a way that these limitations can only be presumed. Since for the purpose of the movie they are perfect. They actually seem like big and hairy werewolves with foul hot breath.Really there is nothing more to expect. If there was then the movie would be trying to outrun itself and we'd be left with the classic sense of ""they over did it."" Not here, though. Neil Marshall, who would go on to make ""The Descent"" was in top form even before that great horror film. --- 9/10Rated R for violence/gore and profanity. Ages 13+",Dog Soldiers

It's a non-stop action horror film with a bit of comedy mixed in for good measure, one that can be watched over and over again. Part 'Predator,' part werewolf could be the best description, as it features an elite team of military personnel who come across a pack of vicious werewolves in the woods. There's tons of violence, guns, and enough blood and guts for two films. This is horror movie-making at its finest.We focus on an elite group of Scottish soldiers who are out in the woods for a military training exercise. They stumble across a gruesome scene of what seems to be the remains of a special forces unit that was packing very high-tech equipment and enough weapons to take on another country, which includes tranquilizer darts. Unaware of what has happened, the find one sole survivor, Captain Ryan (Liam Cunningham) who can only muster out the words, ""There was only supposed to be one."" As fast you can say transformation, the soldiers are ambushed by werewolves. But these werewolves run on two legs and stand over 9 feet tall, and are quite muscular. They have very long claws and very sharp fangs and are only out for one thing. Blood.Though it seems like the entire soldier squad is about to meet their untimely and grisly doom, a truck pulls up driven by Megan (Emma Cleasby) who rescues the surviving soldiers and brings them to a cabin in the woods so that the soldiers can regroup and tend to their Sergeant (Sean Pertwee), who has had his guts ripped out by one of the werewolves. It is here that the rest of the film takes place with few showdowns between man and werewolf. From here on out, the giant werewolves try to break in the house while the soldiers think of new ways to escape with their lives.Each character is given a good back story to distinguish each of them throughout the film with the Captain, Sergeant, Private Cooper (Kevin McKidd) and Megan being the main leads. Much of the banter between the soldiers is comical as they discuss girls and soccer games, as well as unique ways to kill werewolves. Neil Marshall's directing is impeccablee.The climax has quite a few twists and turns that you won't see coming and one brutal scene involving a sword and teeth. I'll never get that image out of my head. 'Dog Soldiers' is a an absolute crowd pleaser. The costumes and make up on the werewolves are top notch and still look like some of the best monsters I have seen to date. There was no CG in this movie. Everything is organic and real.

I go to the video store and purposely rent the most ridiculous one I could find and this one was it and it did not disappoint. I just don't understand how people actullay thought this was good.The acting was not good at all despite what a lot of people think and the werewolfs looked absolutely silly. The only good thing about this movie was the gore effect.This movie is about a military group on a training excersise in the woods when they are stalked and attacked by a group of werewolves.This movie was not good at all. It was good for a B movie just to laugh at but other then that this movie can not compete with real horror movies.,Dog Soldiers
76,gigan-92,Great Horror Movie,9,23 May 2012,"This movie ranks up there with the original ""Wolfman"", ""An American Werewolf in London"", and ""The Howling"". Directed by Neil Marshall, the man who was at the head of the equally great ""The Descent"", this movie serves up a tantalizing feat. Starts off with great characters and very well acted to boot. The way the action is played out makes for very good suspense and thrilling horror. I can only compare it to the 1986 film ""Aliens"" in a sense (not to over gush), in that it is one of those rare horror movies where the protagonists are worth rooting for and you actually feel connected to the characters.Another reason I love the movie is the awesome design of the werewolves. These are not the CGI monstrosities of Stephen Summers ""Van Helsing"" or ""American Werewolf in Paris"", this is plain simple good effects work. They are genuinely frightening and all together this movie is definitely not one to miss.",Dog Soldiers
77,moviesleuth2,A solid debut from future master of horror Neil Marshall,7,30 May 2008,"Forget Wes Craven, or the American rip-offs of Japanese horror flicks. Neil Marshall is the master of terror. ""Dog Soldiers"" is the impressive debut of the future of horror. While not as good as ""The Descent,"" it's still good for a good few scares (meaning A LOT).My first introduction to the horror of Neil Marshall was, like many people, when I watched ""The Descent"" a few years ago. Before I watched this, I was slightly worried that this would be some sort of repeat (or predecessor?) of ""The Descent."" Actually, it's closer to ""The Evil Dead,"" though I'm only judging the connection based on word of mouth, as I haven't seen Sam Raimi's cult classic. Still, this has Neil Marshall written all over it.A group of British soldiers are on a routine practice assignment, when suddenly they see a flare shoot up out of nowhere. Suddenly, the soldiers find themselves trapped in a house trying to keep some nasty werewolves out.Comparisons to ""The Descent"" are probably warranted, but altogether, ""Dog Soldiers"" is a different movie. While the ""The Descent"" had a slow buildup and then suddenly pulled out all the stops, ""Dog Soldiers"" lets everything run wild in lengthy bursts.As I said before, ""Dog Soldiers"" is an inferior film to ""The Descent,"" though that's not exactly surprising since the former film came first. This is because there are a few (more) and slightly larger problems with this film. First off, the story is a bit of a mess, and the special effects sometimes look cheap (especially the close-ups of the werewolves). And like ""The Descent,"" it suffers from weak characterization, however unlike ""The Descent,"" characters matter a bit more than they did in his future film.One of the surprising things is that Marshall doesn't use lighting to his effect here like he does in ""The Descent,"" though he shows bits and pieces of his talent for manipulating the light where it is needed. Still, ""Dog Soldiers"" couldn't be much scarier.Thankfully, Neil Marshall keeps the little humor and one-liners to a bare minimum (though there is one satirical jab at the very end, but I can't decide whether that fits or not). What humor there is doesn't detract much (if at all) from the scares, probably because they don't come during the action sequences.Marshall is clearly not afraid of gore. Though not as consistently gory as ""The Descent,"" but when there is, there's usually a lot of it. But unlike less talented directors, he doesn't let it go over the top.If you're expecting a movie equal to ""The Descent,"" you'll be slightly disappointed. However, it's still good for an hour or two of solid scares and jolts.",Dog Soldiers

The publicity likens the film to a bunch of horror and scifi greats like Aliens, Predator and The Evil Dead, throw in a little dose of Ginger Snaps and some adrenalin and what you get is a fun, action and gore-filled romp through the woods.

80,doctorsmoothlove,The best of recent horror.,9,18 February 2008,"Alright, so I was searching through Rotten Tomatoes, and I came across Dog Soldiers. I was surprised to discover that it wasn't a remake of an earlier film nor did it have a negative review. I would say that if more horror films were this quality, then the genre wouldn't be so laughable.What first intrigued me was the opening segment of the couple camping. The werewolves didn't tear the tent open, they opened it properly. This built suspense without gore, which was a great opening sequence to the film. As the film progressed, I was surprised at the level of characterization the soldiers had. Cooper was surprisingly well developed. Some examples include Cooper's aversion to killing dogs needlessly and Sergeant Wells story about his friend being blown up in the Persian Gulf War. These character traits are expressed again in the film, which I found both surprising and refreshing. There are also references to popular culture and the Evil Dead. One of the characters is named Bruce Campbell. Also, in the sequence where Cooper discovers Spoon's remains, Spoon's watch sits on top of his intestines in a most comical way. Now, as I'm sure that most of you would like to know, the horror aspects of the film are superb. This is a rare film that is able to frighten without excessive gore. However, there is a lot of gore, but the gore is not the focus. Most of the film takes place inside a cabin, and when soldiers are killed, we see a splattering of blood but never their actual deaths. This does so much to build the suspense and actually make the werewolves frightening instead of nasty. I particularly love the scene where a soldier enters the car and feels the werewolf behind him and then we just see blood. Additionally, we don't even see the werewolves until the soldiers reach the cabin. This delayed gratification does wonders for the film's effect. Also, this film didn't portray the heroes as invincible like other contemporary horror films. We love these soldiers because we know them and their deaths are tragic. Cooper is the only survivor, when in most horror films, he would have been one of several. In a way, this makes Dog Soldiers very similar to A Nightmare on Elm Street since both films have sufficient gore, but well-developed characters in frightening situations.Again like Nightmare on Elm Street, Dog Soldiers makes you think about its plot. Why didn't Meghan become a werewolf like the family? Why was she able to ask for help? I think that Meghan thought that the soldiers could help her escape but when they failed, she decided to just kill them. What irks me though is that she was killed with a regular bullet and not with silver. Also, what did the British Army wish to do with the werewolves it hoped to capture? These are questions about the film's plot progression and not plot holes. Most modern horror films have significant problems with their plot progression and much is left unexplained. The questions I proposed, by not having a direct answer, only add mystery to the film and further encourage multiple viewings.In case you didn't understand how much I appreciate this film, I'll boldly say that this is one of the best horror films of the decade and one of the best werewolf films since The Howling. The film is strongly influenced by Jaws and Aliens, but at least it recreates the experience from its ancestors (unlike Disturbia's attempt at reviving Rear Window). The only reason that it isn't perfect is the poor costume design and some hard-to-follow aspects of the plot. I haven't been able to find the film's budget, but it is clearly evident that the werewolves are people in inexpensive costumes. If you want a great horror film with macho werewolves and funny British quotes, then Dog Soldiers is your cup of tea.",Dog Soldiers
81,Nightman85,A gutsy good monster flick!,8,10 July 2006,"Exciting and thoroughly well-made werewolf film from Scotland delivers the goods to both horror and action fans!A band of soldiers go into the Scotland country for a training exercise and instead find themselves struggling to survive against a horde of werewolves!Writer/director Neil Marshall does a knock-out job with creating a solid werewolf film that packs on plenty of quick suspense and steely action. Marshall's story is always gripping, building to an explosive climax. He's obviously a genre fan as he references a number of old-school horror films in the process, even naming one character after B movie hero Bruce Campbell. The direction is right on too with plenty of atmospheric spookiness, as well as a feeling of complete claustrophobia even in the sprawling woods! The special FX come off pretty good and provides for more than a few gory scenes.The cast isn't half bad, hero Kevin McKidd (dearly departed Tommy from Trainspotting) and Sargent Sean Pertwee being the best.This film may have flown under the horror radar back in 2002, but genre fans should discover just how good this film is.

82,harryplinkett14,B movie fun,9,14 November 2017,"This is what B movies are at their best. You love this film from the start. It's just so much fun. And the buildup of suspense is nearly perfect. By the time you realise what trouble they are in, and anticipate the roller-coaster that's on the way, you'll be on the edge of your seat. And by the time the werewolf siege starts, you'll be glad you didn't give this film a miss. The film has a worthy ending, very much in a B movie style. It delivers what it promises. Now, there are certain problems with it, which detract from the experience: 1. It is too long. There was no need to make this film as long as it is. 2. The subplot goes nowhere and just irritates the audience. 3. There are certain plot holes that were unnecessary. 4. The film indulges too much in gore and action, losing focus and rhythm at times. 5. The low budget shows at times, and I think they showed the werewolves a bit too much. 6. The design of the werewolves is fine, but I would have preferred something more in the style of The Howling.Other than that, the performances are great, the actors are having tons of fun, and the final result is a genuinely fun and entertaining film.",Dog Soldiers
83,nitzanhavoc,"One of the best Action-Horror films, possibly the best Werewolves film!",9,23 December 2012,"For those of you who only read the beginning of a review - WATCH this film, do NOT miss out on it! I'm not saying ignore the critics, I'm saying watch it and judge for yourself!Where do I begin? I've been an Action fan since I've started watching films that weren't cartoons, and I've been a Horror fan ever since I've been old enough to watch them. And yet, most films that have been tagged as both Action and Horror have always seemed to come a little short in my opinion, and have always been plain Action with a slightly dark motive (mostly monsters). Take ""Blood Creak"" for instance, which is a perfect example of artificially forcing Horror unto an action film. Dog Soldiers is one of the chosen few to have just the right amount of Horror amongst the Action.I've also always been a fan of Werewolves, and as such hadn't been able to help myself but being a little disappointed with recent films like the Underworld series or Prowl (I've heard Ginger Snaps was pretty good but haven't had a chance to watch it yet) because they all depicted the Werewolves as brainless primal mutts. Dog Soldiers kept the primal, but added the natural instincts and intelligence, the cunning brains of true hunters!The screenplay and script were absolutely marvelous, telling the story of a raggedy tough macho group of soldiers who find themselves up against a supernatural phenomenon. Neil Marshall did an excellent job, and also threw in a few well placed jokes as a bonus. The acting was also great, especially Sean Pertwee, one of the most underrated actors in the world. I loved him in Mutant Chronicles (another SUPERB Action/Horror) and in Wilderness, and he was absolutely the perfect man for the role of the Sarge. Liam Cunningham (Capt. Ryan) and Kevin McKidd (Pvt. Cooper) also did an outstanding job.The cinematography and shooting wasn't too original, and neither were the gore scenes (mostly severed buddy parts and internal organs), but who cares? Not everything has to be groundbreaking and original, and Marshall made excellent use of all the tricks for Werewolves films.All in all, I must say that so far Dog Soldiers is my all time favorite Werewolves film, and one of the top Action-Horror films out there. I hadn't had much expectations of it, and I'm happy to say I was very pleasantly surprised. Very highly recommended, a must watch!",Dog Soldiers
84,PyrolyticCarbon,"Excellent movie, great script, dialogue and acting with superb DVD coverage",9,18 March 2005,"When the trailer first came out for this movie I was dead excited, it was a British film with a different slant on a well visited horror genre. It had also received some interesting quotes at it's festival showing, all giving you the impression that it was a good movie.Then time took over and quotes and reviews dropped it down, then I just never got round to watching it. So when my first copy of the DVD was poor and I stopped watching half way through I was gutted, and had to wait a few days to get a replacement.The movie is great fun and mixes two genres really well, that of real soldiers mixed up with a bizarre horror premise of Werewolves in Scotland. As they say in the making of, it's a story of Soldiers and Werewolves, not the other way around. So it is that the story starts out looking very realistic and feeling pretty normal, and it's slowly ramped up and pulled slightly sideways scene by scene until it's pretty much madness.Saying that, the reactions and lines from the characters are all pretty much realistic. There aren't many Hollywood one liners, instead there are quips, swearing and straight denial that you get in real life when people are faced with difficult situations. It all feels like these are real people in a real situation.The script is excellent for this very fact, but the actors lend a tremendous effort too. Sean Pertwee is a sadly under used talent, and he shows his colours here flying through scenes with the greatest of authority, and he's very well followed through by the rest of the soldier cast who all just seem so natural in their roles. All except for the female of the story who feels very much out of place and awkward, her lines all too unnatural.The action and editing keeps going, and there are quite a few refreshing moments when traditional horror films would throw something that the characters, but here it doesn't happen. For that it's quite unpredictable and enjoyable. The action just keeps on coming with very few breaks, the Werewolves are unstoppable.Not only are the unstoppable, they also look great. Big, hairy, scary, there's nothing that looks fake about them and they really do look menacing.Overall it's a great fun film and the experience on DVD is so much better than so many others I've seen. Plus it's British, quite original, full of movie references and with some great actors.I have never enjoyed an audio commentary as much as I have with Dog Soldiers. It's hilarious and the guys involved sound like they had such a laugh doing the movie, never mind the commentary.I've just watched the second audio commentary by the US Producers, and I was surprised again that I've learnt so much more about the movie again. There are so many more hidden references and character\story connections that I'd missed. This truly is the first DVD that I've watched where the audio commentaries are so strong.",Dog Soldiers
85,skybrick736,Dog Soldiers (9/10),9,27 August 2016,"Dog Soldiers, a lot budget gore flick from the United Kingdom is hands down the best werewolf movies around. The two beginning scenes really set the mood and ruthless nature that director Neil Marshall portrayed. The werewolves aesthetically are tall, slender, and menacing, just really bad-ass looking. The kill scenes are really gruesome and credible looking. However, Dog Soldiers is more than just blood and guts, since there is a fair amount of laugh out loud moments and a certain intelligence to the dialogue. One particular scene that comes to mind, which was unsuspectingly hilarious was the scene that involved a hammer and a mail slot. Characters are well developed, have strong personalities and the actors themselves, ordinary looking, were extraordinary for this type of movie. Look for some entertaining scares and laughs out of Dog Soldiers, one of the first movies I saw that got me hooked on the horror genre.",Dog Soldiers
86,charchuk,One of the best werewolf films ever made,8,18 March 2007,"Pretty smart action/horror with a low budget that still manages to be highly thrilling. The werewolves are clearly just men in costumes, but that doesn't stop them from being a great representation of the mythical beast and scary to boot. The story is very sharp for a film like this, with the dialogue between the soldiers feeling incredibly natural and the plot unfolding itself exceptionally well. The actors are all very adept at both action sequences and dialogue-heavy banter, and the contrast between the two works very well in the film. The direction is a bit too shaky at times - indicative of the low budget - and the visual look is too grainy, but the film is great fun to watch and one of the most entertaining horrors in recent memory.

If you like movies that primarily consist of in-your-face gun-toting action, over-the-top violence, cool looking monsters, and intense dudes who are mad at each other - then this could end up being your favorite movie ever made. If you're into progressive plots, character arcs, cinematography, dynamics, and other stuff like that - you might hate it.Though the casting and performances were fantastic, and the werewolves themselves as well as the gore were quite fun to look at, the movie somehow still didn't give me much to remember it by. It felt a bit TOO simple, and though the movie has it's own specific style of cinematography, I didn't exactly enjoy that aspect of it - if you're going to take the time to make a movie with such extravagant gore and effects, wouldn't you want to pull the camera back on occasion and admire them? I mean, I understand that by not doing so, that's what gives this movie it's own identity, but it simply didn't cater to my personal preferences.Regardless, if you're looking for a straightforward, blood-soaked, action/horror film - this is a tastefully crafted one!",Dog Soldiers
88,Cinema_Fan,Hairier legs than the Wife.,9,8 November 2005,"My only regret about this movie is that I never had the opportunity to see it at our local cinema. It is a shame that it was by my second choice, DVD.What a great movie it is, I really enjoyed it. Thought the overall concept is not entirely original, i.e. trapped in a house with enemy trying to get in ploy, but it does deserve praise on its own merit's. The black humour works very well, do you have to be British to totally understand it? Seeing Spoon fighting hand to hand in the kitchen is hilarious, definitely not in a slapstick way, completely original, fantastic, you really feel for the bloke, and you know that even to the very end you still give them the best you have, never surrender, an honourable death, well done. The camaraderie between the English Tommie's is not at all over done, their egos stay in control, as compared to some US' Soldier movies, such as Aliens for example, you felt that you wanted to be on the Aliens side for once, not here.The werewolf make-up is second to none, it really work's, very convincing on a good full moonlight and the 5.1 Surround Sound lifts the hairs on the back of the neck. The only real reference to Scotland in this movie is the helicopter flying over the Scottish Glen's before the lads get dropped off. The actual wooded scenes were filmed in a Luxemburg forest, due to the fact that the film was partly funded by the Luxemburg Film Fund.Yes, if you are a fan of the werewolf genre then put the lead on and take this one for a 101-minute walk. It really is a well-made werewolf / horror / black comedy movie. Intense acting, well staged fighting scenes and an honest language to boot. Fantastic and great all over.",Dog Soldiers

Although there isn't a complete transformation scene the special effects are quite good. It was the characters and story that I had a problem with. *Spoiler* Towards the end there's a good scene where the female lead, a very cute, beautiful woman, exposes her identity as a werewolf. That was a very good scene. I fail to follow all the macho-soldier themes though. What relevance does that have to the horror genre? Someone compared this to Evil Dead and that is completely wrong. The characters of Evil Dead are not soldiers. In the end, Dog Soldiers is just another run-of-the-mill werewolf movie.

90,flingebunt,Sausages.....!!,7,14 June 2005,"There is a little sub genre of horror that involves people with guns vs. monsters. The most famous are of course Aliens, but there are few others (28 days later is another example).Soldiers are the people of our society to whom we give the latest technology for killing, train them in this art to basically make monsters out of men and then their job is defend civilization against the monsters (where it is Osoma Bin Ladin or Werewolves, it doesn't matter).Having said or that, this low budget, but well made horror flick has a squad of soldiers wandering around Scotland on a routine training mission, only to find out they are really there as bait for werewolves.Lots of guns, guts (sausages) and gory glory. Heaps of pop culture references, fine acting, some scares, but lots of action. The werewolves are cool, the military action is authentic enough, and the analogy of the pack of werewolves and the squad of soldiers is a good one. It never had theatrical release in America, but did very well for itself in the UK.Overall a good movie, with some flaws such as plot twists either being obvious (but then I tend to get most of them right away) or just silly and much of the time they are playing the movie for laughs when the audience is more into the tension and is there for the scare.You won't see many horror films like this, so if you like soldier movies, horror movies, low budget movies or just want something a little different, see it.",Dog Soldiers
91,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Really good!,5,20 June 2008,"This lean, efficient horror flick stands well above most bloated blockbusters. Dog Soldiers follows a military squad on a training mission in the Scottish wilds, where they run into a pack of werewolves. There's nothing fancy about the plot--the soldiers hole up in a farmhouse and desperately try to fend off the werewolves until dawn--but the script is full of smart dialog and clever ideas, the direction is dynamic, and the performances (from Kevin McKidd, Sean Pertwee, Emma Cleasby, and Liam Cunningham, among a solid cast of relative unknowns) are strong and committed throughout. Dog Soldiers pays homage to Night of the Living Dead, Aliens, and The Evil Dead, among other films, but the references are woven into the fabric of the movie. An unpretentious, tension-inducing flick like this is a pleasant reminder that even crude special effects can be more evocative than expensive computer flashiness.",Dog Soldiers
92,ExpendableMan,Terrific horror comedy,9,18 March 2007,"Years before he sent six women to hell in The Descent, UK director Neil Marshall delivered this little gem, a similarly gory film about six soldiers attacked by werewolves in the Scottish highlands. Unlike his claustrophobic cave slaughterpiece though, Dog Soldiers is far more light hearted and is just as likely to make you laugh as it is to make you squirm with fright. In that respect, it's closest relative is probably the classic Evil Dead, a film that was a very clear influence here. It delivers gory, bloody violence with a wicked sense of humour and is perfect fodder for a Friday night in with your mates.The reason it works so well can be put down to a lot of things. The script is well written and fast paced, never letting up for a second as violent carnage trades places with snappy one liners. The cast perfectly fit their roles and bounce off each other with natural charisma. There's a slimy, upper class special forces officer who is so devilish you want the other lads to just pop over and blow his head off. It's even rather scary in places despite the rather silly werewolf costumes, but then such is the price to pay when you decide not to utilise CGI. In short, this is one of those rare films where everything gels together to provide a solid hour and forty minutes entertainment.However, the chief reason why it's so successful is because the six bewildered soldiers are so likable. Sean Pertwee as the squad leader for instance is utterly hilarious, delivering a near constant stream of put downs and profanities and also providing one of the funniest/sickest moments when he engages in a tug of war with a dog, using his own intestine for a rope. His natural foil comes in the form of Trainspotting's Kevin McKidd as a slightly more level headed squad member. When he emerges as the squad's temporary leader, he moves with a natural authority, rallying the others round him as if he was a soldier playing an actor rather than the other way round. The rest of the cast do equally well, portraying realistic people in an unrealistic situation without it seeming forced. In fact, only Emma Cleasby's character Megan seems out of place as she is brought down by a few unimaginative lines that nobody would ever say in real life.Dog Soldiers isn't all laughs however and in-between the humorous bickering and pop culture references, it can get incredibly vicious. A pre-credits attack on a young couple camping in the forest gives only a hint of the blood to follow and while it doesn't beat The Descent in this department, it runs it a close second. Men get their heads chewed off, wolves are blown to bits and one poor fellow even winds up impaled on a tree branch in the movies best ""rewind and watch again"" moment.What this all amounts to is an underrated horror that could very easily be considered a classic in a few more years. It has a witty, fast paced script and a likable, engaging cast to back it up. Plus, it's perfect for a beer and pizza movie night as you sit back with your mates, trying to guess who dies next and laughing till your stomach hurts. Blood and guts hasn't been this funny since Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell first went down to the woods together.",Dog Soldiers
93,the amorphousmachine,Fun low-budget B-film!,6,30 May 2007,"Admittedly, 'Dog Soldiers' was completely off my radar until I saw Neil Marshall's excellent movie in 'The Descent'- that made me want to see the director's other works. So, I decided to give this werewolf movie a shot, and see if it lives up to its seemingly cult status.Well, as far as werewolf movies go, I think this, could, err, be one of the best, but then again, I have not seen that many werewolf flicks! Only 'American Werewolf in London' and its sequel, 'Wolf"", and of course old school 'The Wolf Man'. So, I've probably seen more zombie flicks. 'Dog Soldiers' is more a fun take at the genre than anything else, but that said, it's not particularly brilliant, and not even remotely scary. Kevin McKidd and Sean Pertwee are really good in this movie, and the characters have some nice dialogue.MAJOR SPOILERS HERE; However, the film is predictable and has a 'Night of the Living Dead' feel to it with the soldiers being couped up in the farmhouse. You could predict the dog was going to chew on the Sarge's guts, and you could predict that Ryan was going turn eventually, as well as him coming back in the end. And while you knew there was more to Megan's character, it seemed very contrived and nonsensical how she turned out. She obviously tricked them into blowing the farmhouse when she was in human form, but was she with them at any point? And why did she turn after Ryan, and not before? One would assume the broken glass contaminated her, but it seemed she had more control at the point of where she turned. It's a minor quibble in a relatively fun film.'Dog Soldiers' is worth a look, but don't expect to be scared or laughing your ass off either. The film is definitely tongue and cheek, but isn't quite a spoof of a genre like 'Shaun of the Dead', but it does have clever references and shout-outs to 'Aliens', 'Zulu' and 'The Matrix'. The characters, gore, and dialogue in 'Dog Soldiers' make this film worthwhile, more so than the lack of plot and genuine scares.*** out of *****!",Dog Soldiers

95,Jacques98,Best werewolf movie I've seen.,5,3 September 2008,"I don't know guys. Some things about this movie were plain amazing, while others were just . . . not. The 10/10 ratings come from people who are just so hyped about the nostalgia of Aliens and Predator, which the movie is pretty much dependent. Without those movies it wouldn't be as good, but without them it would be more original but a little cheesier.The opening could have been done without. The ending could have been a bit less of a cliché. The middle could have been a bit less boring. The gore effects were sub-par. The plot set up was a bit sub-par, as well. But, still, the movie was good and maybe better than the 5/10 I gave it, but I think the average rating needs to be a little lower. Yes, it was original and smart: two things The Decent totally lacked.It's easily the best werewolf movie I've ever seen, but werewolves really aren't much to get excited about. At least Marshall didn't stoop to the level of Underworld and make the werewolves look downright retardedthey were cool looking in this movie.As a little bonus, the anti-chivalry message made me happy.

96,TheRedDeath30,One of the Best Werewolf Movies of Past 20 Years,8,1 October 2016,"I am a HUGE werewolf fan. Going back to childhood, werewolves were always my favorite little ""sect"" of monsters, more than vampires, zombies, witches, etc. It is a sad fact, though, while Hollywood and indie horror have churned out a plethora of bloodsucking vampires, flocks of mindless zombies and a gazillion ghost stories, they just can't seem to produce a great werewolf movie. In fact, I could probably (truthfully) name about ten movies in the entire history of filmdom that really, truly do werewolves justice. So, when I hear of great werewolf movies I go in ready to devour them. This one is not a let down. This is a great werewolf movie packed full of tight thrills.This came to my attention about a decade ago because of the popularity of THE DESCENT. As I talked with fellow horror fans, everyone kept saying ""you have to check out his werewolf movie"". Wait a minute....a werewolf movie, that people are really digging, directed by the guy that did THE DESCENT? I'm in. I actually bought it on DVD before I ever saw it (something I don't do often) and was more than happy that I did.A group a soldiers out on a routine training mission, deep in the forest, playing war games against a special forces unit. Our gang of soldiers is, suddenly, thrust into brutal action though as something has wiped out the special forces guys, something bestial, something that is now hunting our soldiers. We got only glimpses of fur and claws, at first, amping up our expectations. The unit is ""rescued"" by a young zoologist who is familiar with the area and brings them to a farm house, where no one is home. The soldiers hole up inside the house and fortify themselves against the monsters as the beasts continue to lead an all night assault against the house.One of the things that works so well here is using a group of soldiers rather than (thank god) teenagers or something similar. It keeps the movie unique, but it also presents a very different angle to the movie. There is a bond among these men, a sense of brotherhood that is there from the beginning. Yes, we get some bonding moments as the unit tightens together, but they have each other's backs and that sense of loyalty to each other brings something deeper to this movie than having a random group of civilians being killed would have done. It, also, allows for a fresh take on exactly why these men are really out there in the forest and what their true mission was, even if they were unaware.I really dig the creature design, also. That's ultimately what makes so many werewolf movies fail. Being such a fan of the genre, I have seen MANY werewolf movies and so few can get it right. The classics like THE WOLFMAN just went for the ""shaggy guy"" look and never tried for anything really lupine. There is the really cheap way out, a la THE BEAST MUST DIE where it's just a dog and they eschew makeup effects at all. Recently, movies like GINGER SNAPS and LATE PHASES have his odd look to the werewolves that doesn't have enough hair or enough canine quality to really be convincing. This take an approach that owes a lot to the design of THE HOWLING, they are erect creatures with humanish bodies and canine heads and, in my humble opinion, the best route to take the werewolf design. I will admit, though, that they don't hold up quite so well in close up, but they look fantastic from a few feet back and I PRAISE the film makers for going practical and not CGI.If I have any complaint about the movie and the only thing keeping it from a slightly higher score is that the formula of the plot is a little too well tread. Yes, as I said, I think they add some nice new ingredients with the soldiers and a cast of good adult actors, but we start off with a scene I've seen in far too many movies as an opener. A couple camping in the woods, something is outside the tent, something gets in the tent, shed some blood, roll title. Once we get to the farmhouse, also, the movie is nothing but a clone of the formula that started with THE LAST MAN ON EARTH and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Carpenter stole it, famously, in ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 and a thousand horror movies have used it since. Our heroes are holed up in a house with the monsters outside. Board up the doors, board up the windows and prepare to keep the monsters at bay. I understand that there are really only so many tropes you can follow and all movies boil down to the same dozen or so plot lines, but more could have been done here and I would rather that they kept the action in the forest. I would have like a hunter and hunted movie a little better, but with all of that said, this is still an excellent movie that I highly recommend.",Dog Soldiers
97,FountainPen,"Yeah, worth a look. Some tense scenes but overall not overwhelming !",7,20 May 2018,"A decent, competent attempt at adding to the werewolf genre, considering this is a very low-budget flick with no ""name"" actors. Just relax and go with the flow! Much of the movie is in almost darkness, so be prepared.

98,kooleshwar,Makes sense (Old wine in New Bottle is good thing)...,8,10 May 2008,"Everything about this movie is simple .You are not really going to hire it unless you like these creature horror/Action movies with a B-movie budget (or if you are one of those dumb people who hire what they know they wont like and whine later).Simple.The movie is low budget and simple settings and props are used,the soldiers don't have fancy weapons (most don't), there are very few locations and very few things blow up, computer effects are minimal/non existent, and old fashioned puppetry, make up are used to render the creatures and real explosives are used for the explosions.Simple yet very very effective IMO computer effects are still far away from a real explosion or real people in costumes.The storyline is almost as old as the trees a group of people with guns want to attack deadly creatures but end up being hunted instead.Simple but it has been premise for many good movies from decades.On face value it could be any old wine.But when you combine this with solid, almost superb acting (the people have real conversations not the melodramatic American style crap), some really good dialogues, a great script with a host well written characters THEN WE HAVE ON OUR HANDS SOME REALLY QUALITY OLD WINE.Now i know they say old wine in a new bottle in bad way but LOGIG SAYS WHEN YOU PACKAGE A NICE AGED OLD WINE IN ATTRACTIVE NEW BOTTLE THAN YOU HAVE WINNING COMBINATION WHICH THIS CLEARLY IS.The acting honours are taken by Sean Pertwee but its a well fought out battle.Production are values are superb for a B-movie, it still amazes me how British film-makers are able to deliver such superb work for a fraction of the cost.Background score is tense.Ironically the movies strengths are also its weakness, the very simple storyline doesn't leave much room for further improvement and the few twists are quite predictable (once again i warn you im the best predictor i know so...).A major change here or there would have well been appreciated.The usual qualms about plot holes, inconsistencies also rear its ugly head, especially noticeable are the variations in speed and stamina of most of the characters.Love the very British irony about the news.....WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A British VERSION OF AN WELL KNOWN AND OLD (american?) WINE IN A SOLID NEW BOTTLE.COMPLETE VALUE FOR MONEY.Do purchase if you have a taste for the same.-s inconsistencies, slightly weak ending.+/-s too simple??? +s solid/superb acting, well written characters and script, superb production values.total 8/10 (factoring in the fact that it actually met my higher than normal expectations, once again i remind you if these kind of movies are not your to your taste then don't watch, the acting is superb by action movie standards however if you are the drama loving type don't watch it for the drama/acting and then cry later.)",Dog Soldiers
99,robertguttman,Night of the Living Were-HIghlanders,8,24 March 2020,"A squad of British soldiers is dropped off by helicopter deep in the Scottish Highlands for a routine training exercise that goes violently awry. Pursued through the woods by an unknown number of mysterious killers, they end up taking refuge in a remote cottage to make a stand. Along the way they fall in with a wounded Special Forces officer and a mysterious woman, both of whom know more than they will say and both of whom may or may not be trustworthy. The result is a cross between ""Night of the Living Dead"", a 1980s American mad-slasher movie and ""Zulu"". The story does not aways make sense and some loose ends exist (for example, it is never explained why a dead cow suddenly drop out of the sky into the middle of the soldiers' camp fire). Nevertheless, ""Dog Soldiers"" is fast-paced, violent and keeps it's audience on the edges of their seats.",Dog Soldiers
100,baywoodarborist,Has a cool feel to it,7,26 August 2020,It comes off as a low budget film which I think it is. But the acting is good and the characters create a compelling group together in their survival. There's a twist in the plot. I was pleasantly surprised.,Dog Soldiers
101,freaky_dave,A damn good movie,8,19 September 2006,"I saw Neil Marshall's The Descent not to long ago and decided to give Dog Soldiers a go. I've always liked werewolves and enjoyed the idea of soldiers taking these creatures on. It reminded me a lot of Aliens, and Predator all in one, and I actually liked it, maybe not as much as Aliens, but it was about equal with Predator.The violence is gruesome and the dialoque between the soldiers incredible. They never really panicked under such circumstances, and one of my favorite characters would be Spoon who decided to take one of these creatures on with his fists and a knife. I enjoyed the humor that went along with the horror and found myself pleasantly surprised with this movie. If someone could not enjoy this movie, they simply didn't get the point. It offers good characterizations, a lot of shocks and surprises and a few twists. It was not as scary as say Alien or Jaws, but it had its moments.The special effects weren't the greatest, but a movie doesn't have to have great special effects to be good. Look at Jaws for instance or even Neil Jordan's own movie the Descent. Atmosphere is what makes a good horror movie. That along with suspense which builds up to the final payoff.My only gripe with the movie would have to be with the final battle. I can't really say much without possibly spoiling the film, but if you see it maybe you will get what it is I'm talking about. A werewolf has claws and teeth to kill. Why not use them against your opponent instead of doing other things that wouldn't kill them. Still it all results in a damn good horror movie nonetheless.Like all werewolf movies, I find myself comparing this one to two of the best contemporary Werewolf films ever made, The Howling, and An American Werewolf In London. Where would it rate between those two films? As I think about it, I would put it nearly on the same level as those two films. The Wolf Man from 1941 is still the ultimate Werewolf movie, but these other three I've just mentioned are not bad at all. The Curse of the Werewolf from the 60s was another good werewolf movie. I mentioned this last because I didn't want people to think I had forgotten it as one of the better werewolf films either.",Dog Soldiers
102,bayardhiler,Soldiers and Werewolves? Oh My!!!!!,9,10 November 2013,"At first glance the idea of a movie with soldiers fighting werewolves might sound like one of the most ridiculous and cheesiest things ever. At the very least it'd be good for a few laughs, right? WRONG!!!! 2001's ""Dog Soldiers"" not only manages to combine soldiers and werewolves in the same film, but also does it in way that isn't cheesy in the least. On the contrary, ""Dog Soldiers"" is one of the most intense, action packed, edge of your seat film experience you will ever have. Believe me when I tell you that there is nothing slow about this movie!Set in the isolated Highlands of Scotland, the film opens with a young couple being brutally butchered while out camping in the wilderness. Fast forward a few weeks later and we see that a squad of soldiers, led by a battle hardened sarge, is being dropped off in the same area for what they think will be a routine training exercise. Nothing could be further from the truth. While they're telling spooky stories around the campfire at night, a mutilated cow is thrown in the middle of the fire and the next day, they discover to their horror that the special forces team that they were supposed to be up against is dead, except the mysterious Capt. Ryan, who keeps screaming about those ""things"". They make a run for it but one of their comrades is killed and Sarge is injured in the process. Luckily, they are picked up by a young woman named Megan and are driven to what they think is sanctuary in the form of a simple farm house. It soon becomes their prison as a pack of viscous werewolves encircles them and tries to move heaven and earth to get in. But the werewolves are not the only thing they have to worry about, as they soon discover that not everything is as it seems. ""Dog Soldiers"" works because it's able to combine tension, horror, camaraderie, witty dialog, and extreme gore while weaving together a story with several layers and twists and turns that you won't see coming until it's too late, just like our unfortunate heroes. As for the actors, I can't praise these guys enough, be it Sean Pertwee as Sarge, Kevin McKidd as Private Cooper, Emma Cleaseby as Megan, or Liam Cunningham as the sinister Capt. Ryan. Even the actors who play the supporting roles are memorable and when any of them don't make it, we feel it. And of course, what good would a werewolf movie be without some cool looking werewolves to go with it and boy do we get that here. Unlike many of today's filmmakers, director Neil Marshal resists the urge to use CGI and instead opts to use old school makeup and animontronics. The result? Some of the best looking werewolves since ""The Howling"". These beasts are big, have enormous hands with claws to match, sharp teeth, and a mean streak a mile long. When we see them creeping about in the shadows, there is no doubt in our minds that they are real. The story is also able to capitalize on the brotherhood and camaraderie of the soldiers in their fight against the overwhelming odds that face them. All this, plus a rousing music score, make ""Dog Soldiers"" what it is. So without further adieu, I urge you to check out this awesome movie, even if you're not a werewolf fan and while you're at it, remember to always keep the wolves at bay.",Dog Soldiers
103,LanceBrave,Fun If Derivative,7,20 March 2014,"With ""The Descent,"" Neil Marshall made one of the most viscerally frightening films of the 2000s. Since then, the director has had trouble finding a hit. ""Doomsday"" was a fun but derivative film that didn't resonate with mainstream audiences while ""Centurion"" mostly came and went without much attention. The director has mostly worked in television since then. Maybe Marshall's underwhelming career would have been less surprising if critics looked not to the hugely intense ""The Descent"" but instead to Marshall's debut, ""Dog Soldiers,"" another fun if derivative creature feature thriller.The story is, essentially, ""Predator"" with werewolves in place of an alien super-warrior and the Scottish Highlands standing for the Central American jungle. A platoon of British soldiers are dropped into the forest on a Routine Training Mission. However, as these things usually do in horror films, something goes wrong. Instead of finding another group of soldiers to compete against, the men encounter a pack of vicious werewolves. Soon meeting up with a female zoologist, the boys fort themselves inside a country home. As the night goes on, the men attempt to fight off the beasts, their numbers dwindling, and secrets coming out.""Dog Soldiers"" is a siege film. It's story blatantly recalls other horror siege movies, everything from ""Night of the Living Dead"" to ""Assault on Precinct 13."" The movie's biggest problem is that its middle section drags a bit, the story falling into a pattern of the wolves attempting a break-in into the house, the soldiers shooting at them, and the wolves falling back.The extended attack scenes get a bit dry after a while because the movie is never scary. ""Dog Soldiers"" is more action-film then edge-of-your-seat thriller. The film is at least partially comedic. Most of the soldiers keep a sarcastic sense of humor about the proceedings, even when werewolves are tearing their mates apart. Sergeant Wells cracks joke after his guts are pulled out and, when facing down make-shift surgery, begs the hero to punch his lights out, something the private dryly does. After having his friend's decapitated head tossed at him, and facing down his own mortality, Private Joe cracks a joke about a monster being right behind him. It's not that the flippant tone isn't successful. It actually works quite well, frequently making ""Dog Soldiers"" a blast to watch. Yet the movie's constantly sarcastic atmosphere sometimes deflates any shots at generation tension.The likable cast helps. At first, the thick accents and similar, militaristic appearances can make it hard to get a bead on the various characters. However, especially after a few stakes-raising death scenes, certain personalities shine through. Sean Pertwee stands out nicely as the troops' sergeant. Early on, he has a monologue about loosing a friend in combat and the unusual circumstances involving his tattoo. As things get crazier, Pertwee happily goes over the top, yelling and screaming as the situation grows more unlikely. Darren Morfitt is another stand-out as the childish Spoon, whose mental state deteriorates quite amusingly over the course of the film. These characters certainly stand over the bland Kevin McKidd as the film's hero or the indistinct other members of the troop.As shown in ""Doomsday,"" Marshall has a talent for absurd action. That's were ""Dog Soldiers"" is most successful. The soldiers are incredulous at the werewolves' existence but this doesn't stop them from chopping off limbs with a random claymore sword or shooting holes through the floorboard. The action scenes are frenzied, shot in an at-times incoherent shaky style. When you have wolf claws coming through the window and giant gas tanks nearly falling on heads out of closet, the movie reaches an amusing, fever pitch. That tone peaks at the end, when one soldier goes nuts on a wolf, beating him with his fist, stabbing him with a knife, even whacking the monster over the head with a frying pan.The escalating nuttiness of the last act is so entertaining, and its gas-leak provided explosive finale so satisfying, that a climatic coda barely registers. The small scene exist to wrap up a tedious plot, that old chestnut about the government attempting to harvest the monsters for weapons, and to make the main hero, the least interesting character in the film, look like even more of a bad ass. The last scene swings back more successfully, bringing back a running joke about a soccer game. ""Dog Soldiers,"" with its explicit gore, fun characters, and anything-can-happen tone, was a hit with horror fans at the time. While its not Marshall's best work it's the kind of extended genre spit-take that characterizes most of his films.",Dog Soldiers
104,daggersineyes,Total disappointment,7,10 September 2013,"I watched the movie The Descent yesterday (by the same director) and it was one of the best horror flicks I'd seen in a long time, going straight into my top horror flicks list. So I decided to check out something else by the same director and saw people suggesting Dog Soldiers was better than The Descent so I grabbed that too. What planet are you on if you think DS is anywhere near as good as Descent, let alone better. I should have been a bit warned because some of the reviews praising DS were slamming Descent for having ""chicks"" instead of guys in it and for starting out with ""a bunch of girls having boring girl talks"" instead of ""interesting"" talk like the men did at the start of DS. Really? Interesting talk about how they'd be missing the football match. That kind of talk? Or do you mean all the sexist/misogynistic drivel they threw around in front of the fire just before a mutilated dead cow dropped in from the sky and they all decided to get some kip instead of worrying about how the cow got there and what mutilated it? I suspect the kind of person who automatically thinks movies with girls in them are inferior is exactly who the director was aiming this ridiculous boy-flick at. If you are a young boy who likes pretending to be a soldier, or an adult male who still thinks making derogatory jokes about women is the funniest thing since that time Jimmy farted in church, then this might be right up your alley! For everyone else I'd suggest you give it a wide berth. Bad acting, awful dialogue, TERRIBLE special effects, no understanding of how military exercises are actually conducted, ridiculous ""see them coming a mile off"" plot twists and long drawn out pointless scenes of rambling chats in between long drawn out badly done fight scenes. So disappointing.****major spoiler (not that it matters because it wont surprise you anyway The ""this was so predictable it hurts"" scene where the girl turns into a werewolf there's all this silly cliché chatter between her & the main bloke about women being ""bitches"" (Get it! Werewolf! Bitch! ho ho ho!) and ""its that time of the month"" yadda yadda. It had me shaking my head in disgust at how lame this all was, not just the appallingly outdated sexism & lame attempt at macho humour but the idea that she'd be carrying on a stupid conversation like that while she's in excruciating pain and transforming into a supernatural beast. Plus why did they all sit around watching the transformations of people and never do anything while the things were still vulnerable. Is it some kind of odd British idea of good manners?I fast forwarded a lot of the boring ""fight scenes"" - there's only so much bad fight choreography & stereotypical male posturing/""bonding"" I can take - and jumped to the final scenes, which turned out to be completely absurd.The only good thing is that the nice dog, who looked rather embarrassed to be in this flick at all, survived the whole thing. So I've given it a couple of points for Sam the Collie, a point for the first 10 minutes of the flick which showed promise and another point for the Scottish scenery we saw briefly at the start. Otherwise it's got nothing going for it.Watch the far superior The Descent, or re-watch Alien, The Predator or any other werewolf flick, instead of this pile of excrement. I guess, sadly, I better take the rest of this directors listings of my watch list.",Dog Soldiers

That's the whole plot and it's non-stop action. No stupid love story or silly speeches in this movie. The WWs are scary but look kinda lifeless. This is a cheapie film and they just put some dudes in WW costumes. Lots and lots of blood and gore in this flik. I'm not squeamish but it was too much for me.

106,jrfranklin01,A So-So English Werewolf Film,5,1 August 2004,"As far as werewolf films go nowadays, this film wasn't too bad.  It's an English film that at first, makes you think or associate with an American Werewolf in London, however the plot soon dissipates that thought.  The story is a simple one involving a training exercise in some remote forest land.  It involves a group of ""green"" soldiers fighting a special operations team.  What one of the groups don't realize is that the exercise is being held in a area known for strange mutilations and people disappearing.  Soon the soldiers come into contact with the supernatural as a pack of werewolves hunts them down.The film, perhaps unnecessarily, tries to give itself depth and complexity in adding greater plot conflicts and unfolding the story further and further.  But with a film like this, the audience just wants to see werewolves get blown away; sort of a werewolf version of Aliens.  While it does falter in delivering any remarkable actions sequences, it still does an okay job of delivering a story with adequate action.  I wouldn't worry too much about getting scared in this film and don't expect any glamorous werewolf transformations; costumes were used.  In this respect I give this film added credit though, because while everyone else is out there using CG, this film employs the old-fashioned medium of horror - costume design.",Dog Soldiers
107,extravaluejotter,Bloody. Good.,8,23 July 2006,"I thought that I'd grown out of this sort of film, so I only viewed it for the first time on TV a while ago. What can I say? I really enjoyed it.Let's be honest, the plot's been done to death. Isolated group gets stuck in an abandoned dwelling with scary monsters on the outside and their own tensions tearing them apart on the inside. You can probably think of at least 6 films like ""Dog Soldiers"" without breaking sweat. However, this film is carried forward by a cast that pitches its collective performance very well and a director who doesn't let us dwell on how well or not the formulaic plot is developing. ""Dog Soldiers"" won't change your life or make you a better person, but it is a solid, well-crafted slam-bang thrill ride from start to finish.Gold medals go to Sean Pertwee and Emma Cleasby for their performances. Pertwee is underused as an actor and he clearly relishes his role in this film. Emma Cleasby does very well as the Token Girly, managing to appear sexy, capable, vulnerable and ultimately blummen terrifying as the story moves toward an ending that I wasn't really expecting. Darren Morfitt also does his usual cheeky chappy shtick to good effect and Kevin McKidd manages to to give his character at least double the depth of the paper that it was written on.Neil Marshall is clearly a writer/director of some talent when it comes to gore-splashed, ever-so-slightly self-conscious movie horror.

Dog Soldiers is the kind of movie that keeps you begging for more. The best way I can describe this film is Aliens with werewolves and a lot less slow time. The werewolves look very real and very scary and they look that way without CGI. CGI would have hurt this movie more than helped it because you just can't do gore (not yet anyway) with CGI. Any decent werewolf movie must have a little blood and guts and Dog Soldiers obliges on both fronts. The cast does a good job of being the backed into a corner professionals, and plenty of gunfire should keep this movie at the top of any self respecting guy movie lover's list.

After a few standard scares, the platoon find the special forces unit, only to find they are not so special anymore, and fall under attack.What should have fallen into the category of the mundane, however with a mixture of good acting, clever quips and old school directing tricks lead to a film that is so much more than it could have been. I'd love to go into exactly all the things that make this better than it is, but I'd so risk giving something away and that would be a shame.

111,Lucabrasisleeps,Fast moving action horror with a comic touch,6,10 January 2015,"I admit I had the wrong impression of the movie before watching it. I imagined a slow atmospheric movie. But what I got was an American style horror comedy. Normally I am not a fan of the comedy style but here the comedy is not prominent thankfully. The action scenes are the center. It gets into the action right away with no attempt to build on the atmosphere or anything. There was a predictable twist in the end which was obvious anyway. But the twist is not important, it doesn't really affect anything in the story. The characters are interesting (even if not fleshed out) and you really root for these guys. They seem like normal everyday guys thrown into this problem. They don't seem like the characters in say, Predator where hardened battle veterans are afraid of what's out there. These guys are not all powerful, they are normal and that is why you are encouraged to root for them. Despite that, there are a few scenes which I am sure were dropped into the movie for comedic effect. Like the scene towards the end with one guy trying to fight two of the werewolves. It just seems ridiculous. And there is a scene towards the end (those who watched it will know) which was not necessary at all. So I guess it was just included to up the action content of the movie. I thought it was a fairly good action movie and I was entertained but it has some flaws and unnecessary scenes which didn't fit in.6/10",Dog Soldiers
112,Paynebyname,What a great film,9,14 November 2002,"I love films, love being excited or frightened and giving my imagination a full blown work out. I'm patriotic, I love my country but I admit when I heard the concept of Dog Soldiers I thought great idea but what a shame it's not a hollywood film.  Being a British film I knew budgets would be tight, special effects minimal and the guns and equipment used would probably date back to almost pre war.  How wrong was I, how wondrous was this film.  I was excited, I was scared, I laughed and I was thoroughly entertained.Some have complained it's a rip off of Aliens, predator, jaws etc etc. Who cares ! All fiction can probably be traced back to Shakespeare and Co and all films pretty much follow a central core thats prevalent in most genres so lets stop comparing and just take it as it is.  A wonderful film.I love that it's played straight.  Yes there are subtle winks to other films (Evil Dead, Star Trek II, the Matrix) and displays of black gallows humour that although slightly relieve the tension don't damage the film.  Brits are renowned for using humour in this way and it's refreshing to see it accurately portrayed. I like that it's trained soldiers being attacked and thus you don't find yourself shouting at the characters to stop having sex in the backroom, going to collect wood with a knackered torch or generally bemoaning their fate.  These guys are trained to survive, they improvise others means of defense and just get on with the business at hand.  The fact that they try hard to survive makes you want them to even more.  We don't have to suffer hours of exposition and bemused soldiers questioning where they come from and why they want to kill them.  They are under attack and they employ commonsense ways to protect themselves.Neil Marshall does wonders with his budget.  The uniforms all look real, the guns sound right, we get good explosions and plenty of gore.  We don't get to see the werewolves much but with a good script you don't need to.  The acting, dialogue and characters are top notch.  The sarge and cooper are great but my favourite character has to be Spoon.  A tough patriotic lion that just will not give up.The action scenes really are sensational and prove that you don't need millions of dollars and CGI to create a real feeling of danger.  It's great how the actors convey the adrenaline and fear combination during the tense action scenes with swearing and anger which to me seems all the more realistic and how one might actually react in that situation.  The last scenes in the film with the characters making a furious last stand are fast paced and adrenaline charged to the point of making you want to jump up and punch the air.In all a fabulous film, great script, solid acting and direction and it made me proud to see a Brit director be able to deliver all this with a small budget and not allow the country to become labelled that we are only good at producing romantic comedies, period dramas or east end ganster flicks.  I pray this film goes on to become a cult, the features packed DVD in february makes lots of money and Neil Marshall gets the chance to play with an even bigger budget one day.",Dog Soldiers
113,Jexxon,Just a bunch of guys in suits...,2,16 January 2005,"Basically a werewolf version of Assault on Precinct 13 and similarly themed films. Here it's a couple of soldiers out on an training mission that are trapped in a cottage trying to fight off a bunch of savage canines.There are quite a few problems with Dog Soldiers. Firstly, it's a pretty low budget film, which isn't necessarily a problem, but here it's quite obvious (especially the werewolves, who look like stuffed wolf heads on stilts). Secondly, the story has been done many times before, and it follows the basic outline of the occupied building genre, which leads into point three - characterisation. There's no way to identify with the characters since they're pretty indistinguishable from another. At the end of the day, there just a bunch of guys (read cannon fodder) in fatigues getting picked off one at a time.The acting is decent, there's shooting and some blood, but Dog Soldiers never rises above being a cheap flick were the werewolves most of the time are on screen in the form of a rubbery arm with claws.

The Scottish mist and the dark shadowy countryside is a great setting for a horror film.The wolves are well done in terms of special effects and so are the gore scenes.The wolf attacks are suspenseful and will keep you nervous and on edge as you watch.The dialogue is witty and believable and the acting is first rate.I had basically never saw a good werewolf movie until this one came along.""American Werewolf in London"" was okay but this one is so much better.This movie is one of those little discoveries that make that slog to the rental place so worth it.This movie is one that a horror fan will want to buy and add to the collection.",Dog Soldiers

116,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,Dog Soldiers: Shockingly Original Horror,9,5 August 2019,"I think Werewolves are often in horror cinema not taken seriously enough, not in enough horror, or in really bad movies. And yes, films like ""The Wolf Man"" and ""An American Werewolf in London"" are very famous films, and great ones at that. They are vastly overshadowed by other kinds of horror monsters and films. And in my opinion, this obscure British horror film is easily the best Werewolf movie...Now, I do heavily appreciate films like the ones I mentioned before, but just think this film is better made, and much scarier to be frank. The film centers around of soldiers who on a routine exercise end up getting trapped in the Scotland woods with (of course) Werewolves after them. I prefer this film because, for one thing, it's not about stupid teenagers. And at that, the characters are actually likable people that you can care for, now there not amazing, but we get enough time with them before they encounter the creatures to know them. And the character interactions are just very believable, like real people having a discussion, kind of comparable to ""Predator"" and ""Alien"" in this way. And the movie is also damn entertaining, as the audience gets very invested in the soldiers trying to survive, and the pack of Werewolves are actually threatening.I found myself really enjoying this film. ""The Wolf Man"" may be more of a classic, and the movie is well made, and an essential piece of horror, but I was never really scared of the film's monster. It's the exact opposite with this film, I was thrilled and terrified at the same time. The actors I think do a job as well. The film's premise is also more believable and interesting, and a more entertaining experience.To conclude, ""Dog Soldiers"" is one of my favorite horror films, and in my personal opinion, an amazing piece of British cinema. The movie's interesting, entertaining, and horrifying. Give it a watch. It's worth more than a 6.8/10 on IMDb.",Dog Soldiers
117,AJ4F,Only scary until the monsters are revealed,4,20 July 2013,"I can't fathom why this got such high marks from a lot of people. I went in thinking it might have the sophistication of many European films, but the pacing and storytelling became flawed too quickly.I lost interest once they reached the house, whereupon it became almost comedic. It suffers from the old flaw of revealing the beast too early and too often, plus unrealistic reactions to various situations, e.g. the bovine.It was bad to the point that I found myself fast-forwarding to the end, and didn't miss all that much. The situation with the girl became predictable fairly quickly. It simply didn't scare me or create suspense after a point. Just a slog of waiting for the next wave of dogged behavior.Save your time and skip this unless you like sausagey gore effects and unnecessarily tall, skinny-legged creatures that may cause unexpected laughter.",Dog Soldiers

119,bennyhagen,"OK, good - but amateur!",4,27 April 2010,"This is a fine movie for folks who can appreciate a genuine B movie with all of it's benefits. First, no boring, loser CGI creatures that ruin the whole thing by being overdone and not scary. The cast is good enough to deliver the explosive lines most of the (variably okay) dialog is about and there are a few scenes that are really well set up. I also found the first 20-30 minutes of the film simply great and if we had stopped there, my review would have been something like ""good old solid and simple film making competes where 60million budgets fail""But unfortunately the movie started to let me down a bit, around from where the werewolves came in, I found things kind of ""falling apart"" a lot. While there are some strong moments, the pacing tends to suck a lot and the cinematography and the editing (probably because of the bad camera work) is just plain and totally amateur considering this movie was made 3 years after let's say, The Matrix. But in fact, for most of the movie (until the spoon gag) I seriously did not think for a moment, that it was not from the late eighties. I find it surprising that just 3 years after this one, Sam McCurdy and Neil Marshall managed to make ""The Decent"" which is probably one of the best horror movies of all time and looks great too. I'm quite curious for Neil Marshalls new movie ""Centurion"". 5/10 - It could have been better, with a bit more attention and professionalism.",Dog Soldiers
120,Snake-666,Perhaps a modern B-Movie classic!,8,16 May 2003,"'Dog Soldiers' is a fun and fast paced action/horror B-Movie. And as it refrains from the use of CGI it certainly stands out in that respect against the modern horror films of today.'Dog Soldiers' is a cross between 'Predator', 'Alien' and 'Assault on Precinct 13'. Early on in the film we meet Cooper (Kevin McKidd), a soldier and Ryan (Liam Cunningham), a Special Forces commander. Cooper is attempting to be accepted into Special Forces but after a disagreement with Ryan over a dog he fails. This failure results in somewhat of a small scuffle between Cooper and Ryan with the outcome being Ryan informing Cooper that he never forgets.We then move to Scotland to see Cooper and the rest of his unit, commanded by Wells being dropped into a Scottish forest for the purposes of a training exercise. It becomes apparent though at this point that Ryan is there, and Ryan is watching them...it also seems that something may be watching Ryan.There are flaws with the film, but it is still fun and entertaining. Influences from other movies stand out here, but they still don't take away from 'Dog Soldiers', I feel that they've just used an idea and modified it to produce something new. Much better than the current Hollywood mentality of making a horror - take a half-good idea and drive it into the ground with continuous knock-off after knock-off.It's also quite well acted, I have a suspicion they purposely killed off the weaker actors early in the film so not to weaken the overall film. I think some people outside the UK though might have trouble understanding some of the accents. Direction wise, although for the most part it was good there are some scenes towards the beginning of the film that could almost make you queasy due to the shaky and fast movement of the camera's.
I was a little unimpressed with some of the make up effects though. There are some scenes which are quite high on the gore count but when you look closely the gore looks fake, same goes for the wolves costumes. I'm glad they chose not to use CGI, but on occasion when close to the camera the wolf costumes are a bit suspect. But I suppose you can't have in-your-face action without it actually being in-your-face. And believe me, during some events in the movie the action is extremely fast paced and exciting.For a low-budget movie this is quite a gem. Fans of the movies I mentioned previously should check it out, it's not strictly horror. I believe the director said that it was a soldier film with werewolves, not the other way round, so it could also be classed as an action film. Either way, that is really of no relevance. 'Dog Soldiers' was my favourite movie of 2002, and I am proud to own it on DVD. It is a brilliantly accomplished B-movie that is worth checking out.",Dog Soldiers
121,RomanJamesHoffman,Werewolf slasher which doesn't put a foot wrong.,7,2 January 2014,"Siege movies are always good. Being holed up in a small place defending yourself against an enemy is guaranteed to ramp up the suspense. And if that enemy happens to be werewolves, then you're definitely onto a winner. Such is the solid premise of writer/director Neil Marshall's ""Dog Soldiers"" that it was always going to have to work hard to NOT work well. However, werewolf movies have been done to death, right? Well, a key difference between ""Dog Soldiers"" and most werewolf movies (from the first cinematic depiction in Universal's ""Werewolf in London"" (1935), through the classic myth forming ""The Wolf Man"" (1941) to later must-sees ""The Howling"" and ""An American Werewolf in London"" (both 1981)) is that whereas the protagonist in these movies is the man infected with lycanthropy himself and invariably focuses on his subsequent existential dilemma of Man Vs. Beast, in ""Dog Soldiers"" the enemy is resolutely ""out-there"". So there is none of the tired navel-gazing ""what have I become?"" ruminations and instead we just have high tension from the off as the people that we side with try to defend themselves from an unstoppable enemy. What's more, the film makes this premise really work through the memorable characters who we really care about as the going gets increasingly tougher. In this case, the people held up against the werewolves are a group of soldiers doing a military exercise and while, at first, their various idiosyncrasies (derived in large part from their working-class Scottish heritage, with a dialect that non-Brits may find difficult in parts) would seem to suggest that they are not really fit for the rigours of military life, as the film progresses and the situation with the werewolves heats up they demonstrate courage, loyalty, and self-sacrifice which is genuinely moving. The film is a testament to what can be done with a low budget and a great idea. A cracking movie.",Dog Soldiers

Ryan, who's a bit of a muppet and has previous issues with Cooper. He also has an ulterior motive for getting these men into the field.On a dark, moonlit night, the poop hits the fan and the wolves start to howl and the panicked soldiers meet up with Megan, who lives in the forest near another family, who just happen to be elsewhere, she saves their butts and we have a Rourke's Drift situation.What follows, is loud brash, violent (and that is just Spoon, who is probably one of the best film creations ever!) and funny.

The dialog, along with some good action sequences, is what makes this movie as good as it was.  There are some great action sequences.  I particular enjoyed the one, where the wolves chase the platoon through the woods at dusk.  Another great sequence, I thought, was watching the final two living soldiers as they dug their way through the walls of the house from one room to the other with an army knife.I was disappointed about one thing.

This one was quite an exception!I was surprised at the rating on IMDB for this one...I saw really wonderful reviews and almost equally, horrible reviews, so on a boring saturday night, I decided to check it out.  It was a very entertaining flick that was remarkably well done.Sean Pertwee has been one of my favorties for a long time, which is half the reason why I rented this movie.  He gives a literally, 'gut wrenching' performance as the hardened leader of the squad.  The acting overall is great, which is surprising.  I loved the effects of the werewolves...none of that CGI crap, the animators and artists spent a lot of time to make the enemy look realistic and it truly shows on the screen.  Though there were some stupid and predictable deaths, I found that this movie pays homage to some great horror films (a la Aliens, Predator and a non horror film, Zulu). The action was intense and wonderfully chorerographed and once again, the acting was very good considering the subject matter and the budget.I am so curious as to why so many people gave such negative reviews on this movie, some calling it 'The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen'.  These are the same people who will call any horror movie, which all breach the bounds of reality, crap, and that is not fair.  This was a great movie, very entertaining, and definitely worth repeat viewings!  Check this one out, you will not be disappointed!  Since I gave the movie Aliens a 9, this one gets an 8/10 stars since it was not quite as good as that movie (the one it most closely resembled), but it was very fun to watch in its own right. You'll be surprised how a b-movie film can be so well acted and have such stunning direction and visual effects.  Don't be fooled by the front cover art of the box, it is really a gripping a suspenseful tale of courage and gut wrenching horror at its best.  The only reason I give it an 8 was b\c of a little confusion in characters and plot, but overall, it is a wonderful popcorn flick.  Check it out if you love horror films, or if you love movies that feature soldiers dripping with adrenaline shooting anything that moves. Highly recommended!  8/10 stars.",Dog Soldiers
129,Ben-Hibburd,Dog Soldiers Review.,7,3 September 2017,"Dog Soldiers is written and directed by first timer Neil Marshall, and is a low budget, stripped down British horror film, that sees a military unit embarking on a routine training exercise in the Scottish highlands. Things soon take a nightmarish turn when they encounter a pack of werewolves hellbent on ripping through them.When I picked up a copy of Dog Soldiers from my local film store, I thought the film looked pretty goofy, but the title of the film piqued my interest enough to buy it. Going into the film I didn't have a-lot of hope, but what I ended up getting out of it was one of the best werewolf films I've seen. The core group of soldiers all had good chemistry between them, despite not being given much depth to work with. Sean Pertwee and Kevin McKidd both give standout performances, though they are given the most to do.The main gripe I had with the film, was the tone of it. At times I felt the film was trying to be too serious for its own good. Whilst there were a couple of moments of levity, it didn't feel enough, and the tone in some scenes clashed. However one of the best, and most important aspects of the film was the costume design for the creatures, this is what film hinged on. Thankfully for a shoe string budget they manage to do a convincing job, even if they had to hide the transformations due to budget.The screenplay is fairly standard, and doesn't offer much to further the lore or style of werewolf films. What the film does to it's benefit, is to scale itself down, and turn into a siege movie. The soldiers take refuge in a small run down cottage, where they're constantly repelling the werewolves attacks. Neil Marshall excels at this style of film- making, where tensions rise in enclosed spaces, something in-which he would later go on to perfect in his career with 'The Descent'.Over-all Dog Soldiers does have a few small issue's, at times the camera can become overly shaky, especially in the beginning of the film, which makes it hard to see what's going on. There are also a couple of plot elements that felt like they came out of left field. Whilst these issue's slightly bothered me, Dog Soldiers is a well executed genre film, that's not afraid to be gruesome when it needs to be, and that makes for fantastic entertainment.",Dog Soldiers
130,Teknofobe70,My god ... a GOOD werewolf movie!,8,6 April 2005,"The concept for this movie is perfectly described in six words, which are lovingly splattered all over the posters -- ""Six Soldiers. Full Moon. No chance."" Like most great werewolf movies, it's not subtle ... but we love it. It starts off with a couple camping out in the Scottish highlands, and the girlfriend decides to give her boyfriend a silver dagger as a present. Hmm. They then proceed to get gruesomely slaughtered by an unseen beast. The real purpose of this opening scene is to let us know straight away that this is a werewolf movie, because for the next twenty minutes or so we are plunged straight into an ultra-realistic soldier movie instead. In director Neil Marshall's own words, this is a ""soldier movie with werewolves"", and not the other way around. But that's exactly what makes ""Dog Soldiers"" so great.I can promise you great visual gags, entertaining dialogue, identifiable characters and most of all, brilliant werewolves. And it doesn't take place in some fantasy world -- these people are real soldiers stranded in a cottage doing their best to deal with a supernatural threat. Neil Marshall, along with a first-rate team of actors, keep the blood pumping and fill in the gaps with realistic conversation. All of the principal cast are great -- the leading man Kevin McKidd, Emma Cleasby, Liam Cunningham, and most of all Sean Pertwee, who excels as the squad sergeant.The special effects could easily match any big-budget Hollywood movie, if only because of the way that they are utilised and shot convincingly. Most of all there's a sense that genuine love and care went into the making of this movie, and everyone involved understood what it was about and intended to make it the best it could possibly be. It references films like ""The Evil Dead"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""The Matrix"" -- and of course ""The Howling"" and ""American Werewolf"".If this movie has any flaws they are it's own lack of ambition. It's sets out to be a fast-paced, exciting Friday night movie about soldiers fighting werewolves, and that's exactly what it is. There's no real subtext or exploration of the werewolf myth, just full on carnage from start to finish, and the execution of the concept is spot-on. Some of the dialogue may be a little difficult for non-British folk to follow, but the level of slang is fairly realistic -- unlike in many British films where it feels forced and false. It also may be difficult for some people to believe that they'd actually still be worrying about the results of an England v Germany football match while being stalked by a pack of werewolves, but, well ... we would.""Dog Soldiers"" is a movie for anyone who's after a howling, snarling, throat-ripping good time.",Dog Soldiers

However, when you consider all of the CONTINUOUS Horror, Suspense, Action, Mystery, and slight doses of dark comedy in ""Dog Soldiers"" you have, in my opinion, the most perfectly crafted lycanthrope movie of all time. There are no dull moments. Every scene has you wondering what's going to happen next. All directors could learn from this type of story telling.

They run across a survivor, who happens to be a special operations person, and just had his men wiped out by a group of werewolves. The special operation person's rank is captain, and he has a deep wound so they tend to him and try to radio for help but the radio is busted so make camp. They try to get information from the captain but he is incoherent.They are on the move but soon they are aware something is pursuing them and they try to evade them but it is no use. They hear howls and shadows in the woods. The werewolves come after them and the soldiers shoot but it does not seem to stop them. They keep running and some of the men are killed but others managed to survive when they flag down a passing car and escape the werewolves' attack.They head to a deserted house where the occupants supposedly left for somewhere else. The person who was driving the car is some sort of zoologist and it seems she is helping them but she is too calm. The movie shows, what seems like, a telepathic communication between the werewolves and the woman. This is so because she is actually a werewolf. These werewolves are the family who reside in the house where the soldiers have sheltered themselves in. It seems she has the ability to control her transformation because it was full moon and she did not turn into the werewolf until the end.********************END SPOILER*******************I am going to stop here but the rest is just shooting at the werewolves by the soldiers.

I was awestruck by Neil Marshall's ability to bring to the screen such a great werewolf movie on a really small budget. He not only wrote a clever script with believable characters who react in credible ways, but he creates a visual experience that is at once horrifying yet beautiful in its simplicity. We get caught in this charming and inviting house along with the characters and Marshall keeps us there, intensifying the isolation by never leaving the locale of the single cottage in the woods. Without much money for special effects, Marshall's werewolves still are such muscular, hungry and cunning brutes you can almost feel the heat of their breath on the back of your neck. If you love intelligent horror and you long for suspense with a few surprises and characters you really care about, this movie is for you.

There's a wonderful black humour that flows through the whole thing, many lines are definitely quoteable. McKidd (an underrated actor) is great, with Pertwee right behind him; in fact I cannot think of a single wasted performance. No cannon fodder here - each indiciindi is memorable.Any filmmaker or genuine horror buff would do well to find this - a screenplay of this calibre just blows away the endlessly stale cycle of zombie and found footage flicks we've all grown accustomed to.

Dog Soldiers goes back to making werewolves evil, grumpy and most importantly SCARY again. One of the reviews on the copy of my DVD calls this movie ""Predator meets Jaws"" and that's an apt description. I won't go into depths so I don't ruin anything for people who haven't seen this awesome lil fright flick yet. But if you haven't, what the hells wrong with you. You are definitely missing out. There is plenty of gore, and for the most part, it's realistic. My only real complaint about the movie is that sometimes, the accents of the actors are really heavy and hard to understand. For most of the movie, when the werewolves are shown, their mostly hidden by shadows. When we do actually get good shots of what they look like, we can see why this is. Although not horrible looking, they do look pretty fake. All in all, this is an awesome lil indie flick. You'd do yourself a great disservice if you never gave this a chance.",Dog Soldiers
142,james_corck3,The evil dead...with werewolves!,8,23 January 2006,"There is one thing that nobody will deny. Horror movies make great directors. Steven Spielberg with Jaws. Sam Raimi with The evil dead. Peter Jackson with Braindead. And now Neil Marshall with Dog Soldiers.This amazing, full of rhythm horror movie gives you gore, bumps and laughs. Six soldiers in the Scottish Highlands and a bunch of werewolves. There is the story, we don't want to twist your mind, we want to scare the s**t out of you. And they did. The really did.Right from the beginning the red element appears and doesn't leaves the movie until the very end. The roars, growls and clutching sounds of broken bones are also more relevant than the scared faces of the poor characters. The relationship between every of the soldiers is really strong, they look like old friends. And the humor component, mixed with the really achieved atmosphere, makes it very unique.The comparisons with The Evil Dead are impossible to avoid. A cabin, an unknown enemy, a pretty woman that then looks not so good, many blood, lots of screams and true fear. Now if you watch it with a couple of friends and some beers, you will have the fun of your life",Dog Soldiers

The movie sometimes relies on campy humor and features a shallow plot but the atmosphere in the latter half is surprisingly thrilling.

Sean Pertwee, Kevin Mckidd and Emma Cleasby play the three main characters.Dog Soldiers originally appealed to me because I am a horror flick guy, and the movie has good scenery and a well thought out set. I failed to realise until I began to watch that it was a British film which I am not often a fan of, I thought I'd give it a shot.I stand by my statement this film had a good build up and I never really new what was hunting them until it was reviled to the audience which was good suspense, BUT these actors were not believable as being fearful of the creatures hunting them the action scenes and special effects were lacking for a film with this build up, and it just crumbled to a disappointment, could have been so much more! see for yourself.",Dog Soldiers

I have to say seeing it in 2005 I was pleasantly surprised (or horrified!). It really is rather good and certainly deserved a wider audience on its release. Its low budget yes, which perhaps causes a couple of minor production flaws ? but the script is fresh and exiting, the atmosphere is just great and the'wolves' are very believable and scary.

147,badfeelinganger,"A Cult Classic.A werewolf movie with a funny bark and a severe bite.Just about the best straight-up, old-school horror film of the last 15 years.",10,30 October 2014,"British director Neil Marshall's directorial debut Dog Soldiers resurrects and embraces the low-budget horror-comedy. The film is spooky when it needs to be. The sense of isolation and desperation is real.Many horror fans will be pleased to note that this film supplies its due amount of blood and gore,it's very easy to like, and makes for an entertaining night of viewing.So why is this movie so great? Well, it's not necessarily due to its originality. Every major plot element in this film has been done somewhere else in films like Evil Dead 2, Aliens, Night of the Living Dead, Southern Comfort, and about half a dozen others that I can think of off-hand.But if I may paraphrase a quote I once heard - steal one idea, you're a plagiarist. Steal them all, you're a genius! In the DVD ""making of"" featurette, Director Marshall says ""I set out to make a soldier movie with werewolves, not a werewolf movie with soldiers,"" and that's an important distinction. It is the soldiers, and the bond between them, that makes this film stand out.There is a difference between comedy/ horror and horror/ comedy just compare ""Shaun of the Dead"" to ""Dog Soldiers"". ""Shaun of the Dead"" takes the zombie genre and has fun with it whilst ""Dog Soldiers"" delivers a werewolf, survival horror and throws in a lot of British humour, lashings of blood, gore and intestines. It means that ""Dog Soldiers"" not only delivers frights and gore but then will have you cracking up and that makes things hard for a movie reviewer because there are so many great scenes you would love to mention.Dog Soldiers doesn't transcend genre -- it embraces it, energises it and takes big bloody chomps out of it. One of the best, coolest, most action-packed horror films in years. Just about the best straight-up, old-school horror film of the last 15 years.Eric Allen announced that a prequel and another sequel are in the planning stages, and Fresh Meat will be released on 20 December 2014",Dog Soldiers
148,TM-2,My opinion,9,6 November 2002,"Just watched the DVD and really enjoyed the movie.I liked the way it was played 'for real'.*****Possible spoilers*****:This movie was an amalgum of several different movies. The obvious one to ZULU is made in the movie and by several cast members. However, it was reminiscent of STRAW DOGS also. In addition it had many parallels to ALIENS and the EVIL DEAD. There are more I could mention.Spoilers over.I liked the 'let's go for it and play this for real attitude'. Atmospheric and reasonably gory - you just can't get enough gore into a horror movie these days. Remember when you had to look away. Some scenes had significant squirm factor.105 minutes of pure fun.",Dog Soldiers
149,asandor,Dogged film that soldiers on nonetheless,5,30 April 2020,"Dog Soldiers follows a group of British soldiers on a routine exercise in the moors of Scotland, who run into a deadly pack of werewolves hungry for their flesh. After they save a special forces officer, the enemy becomes less than straightforward.Dog Soldiers has a well deserved following, and it probably safe to call a cult classic at this point. It is certainly one of the more enjoyable werewolf films made to date. The group of soldiers has a Predator-like quality, all being enjoyable and likeable in their own way. The action can be fun oftentimes, and the horror elements are solid. These ups meet some notable downsides, in my opinion.The CGI and animation in this film has not aged well, showing the weakness of this medium, in my opinion. I say this often, but practical effects in cinematography are lasting, but the CGI werewolves in this film look quite poor, and this detracts from the film. Characters stare blankly at what is clearly not there, and grainy paws and silly looking werewolves jaunce toward their targets. This movie tries a bit to do the show, don't tell, rule, but there are scenes where the werewolf is fully in view, and looks just awful. Couple this with a somewhat mediocre story (soldiers in the woods has been done before hundreds of times, and there are better examples - Predator, for example) and you get a somewhat fun, somewhat dull viewing experience, in my opinion.This film is not terrible, and certainly has charm. But the CGI detractions, coupled with an average story, do not in my opinion elevate this film to a favourite of mine, or even a go to. I do not regret watching it, but certainly will not go out of my way to see it twice.",Dog Soldiers
150,j-penkair,What A Perfect Pack!,8,4 December 2015,"This is what real movie-making is. Not the CGI. Not the show-off soundtrack. Not the handsome but meaningless faces of the so-called actors. Not exaggerated advertising. ""Dog Soldiers"" is a film made by and for horror film lovers. The script should be regarded as one of the best. Not too much but just enough explanation. Excellent paces all through. It was written, directed, and edited by the same person: Neil Marshall. The ultimate credit can't go to anybody else. Watching this film is like being told a good story by a skilled storyteller. He never raises his voice. Never uses different tones to give cheap jump scares. Never cheat. Marshall simply tells a story evenly and calmly, even at some most vivid and breathtaking scenes. His as-a-matter-of-fact tone is ultimately scary because it brings realism and horror in the face. You soon believe that this nightmare can really happen and you are so trapped you want to just let them eat you cold. The werewolves in this film are believable. Sometimes they are just animals and sometimes they are much superior than human beings. There is no wasteful part in this film and every bit gets used. ""They work as a pack"", said Megan. And with her statement we see the dedication of a werewolf determined to throw a dinner party for her folks, including a suggestion that they are to destroy the last hope for an escape. Only one or two scenes are really bloody and graphical. However, they stay with you, and your fears for the werewolves are imprinted, at least to the end of the film. All in all, it is a horror film without any wastes and pretence. Only the British can do. Economic or low-cost filmmaking is indeed their natural tendency.",Dog Soldiers
151,Finntroll,Cool but not really scary.,7,17 July 2004,"Werewolves. You just got to love them. Furry things with fangs and a kick-ass attitude. Simply irresistible. ""Dog Soldiers"" is a British horror movie about these lovable crossbreed between wolves and humans and just like werewolves, it's not subtle at all. If you want tense atmosphere and mysteries, go and watch ""Ringu"". This is a highly cynical gorefest of epic proportions.This movie won't win any prizes for originality but it's solidly crafted with good actors, fine settings, splattery gore and some rather awesome costumes. The werewolves really look great, in fact I sometimes couldn't believe it was just costumes. The only problem is the fact that this movie seldom scares me. But really, if I want to get scared, I don't watch anything called ""Dog Soldiers"", this was just a solid piece of gory madness and it's fine at being that.7/10",Dog Soldiers

153,azcowboysingr,Makes my list of Top Five werewolf films ever!,10,14 December 2005,"I've loved werewolf films ever since I saw Werewolf of London & The Wolfman (Lon Chaney Jr) on late night TV back in the early 50's, I think I might be able to say that I've seen every one ever filmed, some cheap & cheesy, some scary as Hell, some really great, & even a few that were hilarious. ""Dog Soldiers"" made my list of the Top 5 werewolf films ever! It has it all! First, the werewolves are fantastic! Probably the best ones I've ever seen & worlds better than that mangy Chow dog looking excuse for a werewolf in ""American Werewolf in London. Second, the acting is solid and believable. Third, the plot actually makes sense. Finally, there is gore (almost as much as in The Wild Bunch), comedy, & characters that you actually care about. If there is one flaw it's that the girl character never shows us any skin...would've loved to see her taking a shower or something...hehehe. I really loved the line where she says, ""You think all women are bitches, well, I'm the real thing!"" then she turns into a werewolf. There are so many gems like that in this film that you really have to see it yourself...preferably with the lights off & a storm raging outside. Oh, what ARE my Top Five? OK, they are: ""The Howling"", ""Siver Bullet"", ""Dog Soldiers"", ""The Werewolf"" (1956 version with Steven Rich), and of course, Lon Chaney's ""The Wolfman"".",Dog Soldiers

157,The Terminator,Sensational,10,22 May 2002,"Rarely do we ever get to see a film like this in cinemas so if you haven't seen it yet, stop reading this comment now and go see it. Now.Dog Soldiers is, in a word, fantastic. It has a wicked blend of horror, suspense, fear, comedy and action which you rarely get in horror flicks of today and it all adds to the films pull. It is high on blood and guts but it's there for a reason - unlike other Hollywood horrors. The acting is great and director Neil Marshall creates characters who we like - unlike other Hollywood films. The special effects were awesome and the crew did not resort to sub-standard CGI, common in all Hollywood movies. Without giving too much away, this is one of the best horror films of recent years and hopefully will go on to inspire many more like it. Although it has its bad points - notably excessive dialogue scenes - it is fantastic fun, so don't waste anymore time contemplating whether or not you should see it. See it NOW!",Dog Soldiers
158,michaeljharvey,Highly regarded by many... I'm not sure why.,4,12 July 2008,"The premise of this movie seems solid. A group of British soldiers battle werewolves in the isolated, dimly-lit forests of the Scottish highlands. If you're a fan of horror movies, this sounds like a winner. Sadly, from the beginning, this movie disappointed me.It's very much a stereotypical soldier movie with some werewolves thrown in as the ""bad guys"". There's lots of macho male bonding. Nearly every character is one-dimensional and virtually mindless. No character rises above the level of complexity one would find in a bad video game. It's very easy to pick out our hero, bad guy, traitor, etc... On top of all that, the movie has an oppressive, irritating soundtrack that seems to be lifted from every 1980's soldier movie you've ever seen. The music is simplistic, clichéd and pulls the viewer out of the story.This is a low-budget movie and the director does a good job handling the werewolf effects. They're done with people in wolf suits and only shown briefly in dark lighting. A big improvement over the computer-generated nonsense we get in many movies nowadays. At least the werewolves look real and threatening. They are the true stars of this movie.The plot would be right at home in any made-for-cable sci-fi movie. It's your standard nonsense about the military wanting to study and control the werewolves, but things go horribly (and predictably) wrong. While there is plenty of shooting and no shortage of battling the werewolves, the movie lacks tension. I didn't really care if the main characters made it and found myself pulling for the werewolves. Always a bad sign in this type of movie. After a while I was exhausted by the endless stream of bullets and macho dialogue.Interestingly, the sci-fi masterpiece Aliens used a similar formula (a group of soldiers being besieged by monsters) but with much greater success. In Aliens we had interesting characters, tension-filled action and humor that worked. Dog Soldiers is inferior in every respect to that classic film.This movie might best appeal to male teenagers who fantasize about being soldiers. It could be a recruiting video: ""Join the British Army, get a really cool gun, and kill the werewolves!"" For someone hoping for a movie that's a little more mature, and actually frightening, Dog Soldiers falls far short.",Dog Soldiers

160,Unicorn-9,Nothing special,4,26 December 2002,"I'd heard a lot of good things about this movie, so I'd expected to be impressed: unfortunately all I got was a cliched, predictable low-budget 'Aliens' clone with that awful intro ('um expositional dialog, that's original... and hey, a _SILVER_ knife, I wonder if that's going to become important in a story about werewolves, what with being _SILVER_ and all and werewolves not liking _SILVER_?'). Oh, and the DVD decided to turn on Spanish subtitles at one point, which was a bit distracting, and I won't even mention that 'Matrix' line.Which is not to say it's a particularly bad movie, just that the only reason it stands out in any way is because most recent horror movies have been much worse. It's not a bad idea, competently made, well-acted by low-budget standards and has some entertaining moments... but I spent much of the movie figuring out which 'Aliens' characters they were meant to be, given how close the story was. The other big problem I had with it was similar to 'The Bunker'; because they were in uniform and most were very similar other than the three or four main characters, it was hard to keep track of who was alive or dead at any point... something that Cameron got right in 'Aliens' by making the main characters very distinct both physically and psychologically and killing off the rest early on.So I didn't particularly love it, didn't particularly hate it, and in a few years I suspect it will be very much forgotten. 'Ginger Snaps' is still way ahead as the best recent werewolf movie as far as I'm concerned.",Dog Soldiers

Even the ""money shot"" of werewolf films, the transformation from man to werewolf, is not as convincing as Bill Bixby's ""Hulk-outs"" from that old 70's TV show.  Don't buy the hype that this is a great horror movie.  Like ""Blair Witch Project"", ""Dagon"", ""Below"" and ""Equilibrium"", the fan-boy internet hype on this film is more entertaining than the movie itself.",Dog Soldiers
162,Gideon40,GREAT film,10,17 July 2002,"Dog soldiers is a terrific horror movie. While the plot isn't anything special, it is well crafted to suit the overall idea of the movie: a werewolf flick with guns, gore, explosions and plenty of frights. The direction is excellent, the use of a house in the middle of nowhere in order to inspire a sense of isolation and hopelessness is great. A lot of the camera angles give you the impression that at any moment a werewolf will crash through the windows and grab the next unsuspecting soldier, leaving you to cover your ears and brace yourself throughout much of the movie. This movie got an nc-16 rating here, and its mostly because of the gore. And a movie gets an nc-16 rating in singapore because of gore, it usually is VERY VERY violent. Dog soldiers is no exception, as there are many scenes of sustained gore and blood. I'm used to seeing such carnage, but the faint of heart will probably faint when they see the sarge first gets attacked. There isn't a lot of background music, and this is good as it helps with the suspense. On the other hand the characters are very developed, almost resembling the people from Aliens and Predator. The sarge is the tough, fearless person of the team, cooper is the corporal hicks of the film, spoon obviously resembles Hudson/Mac and so on. There are some elements of the film that require you to have a little knowledge on werewolves, but even if you don't I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie for the perfect fright night.",Dog Soldiers

The story was interesting and although I had some of it figured out, parts of it had me guessing until the end.Positive #2: The acting was great! Maybe I just like the accents, but I thought the acting was well above par in terms of this genre. Perhaps the soldiers were a little too stereotypical, but this is hardly something to complain about.Positive #3: The werewolves in the movie looked really good. Bravo to this production team for keeping CGI to a minimum.This is a must see movie if you are a horror fan (especially a werewolf fan) at all. There's plenty of gore too for the blood hounds in the audience. I think the mass appeal of this movie will ensure it is enduringly popular on DVD.

As they flee for their lives they spot a road and a SUV passing by. The driver picks them up and takes them to a nearby, yet isolated, house. The werewolves follow and the soldiers end up in a battle for their lives against the encroaching beasts.This movie is part horror and part comedy. The movie would fail if one looks at it from only one of these genres, but taken together the movie works just fine.In the first part, the isolation of the wilderness and the mist of the night provide a good sense of apprehension. And, the initial chase through the woods is entertaining. But it is in the second half, when the soldiers hold-up in the house, that the characters are really fleshed-out and the comedy kicks in.The story line is predictable; a three-year old could see these plot turns coming way in advance. And, up close the werewolves look pretty goofy, but at a distance in the night mist the towering images of these monsters provide a decent sense of danger.

In fact, the imperfections are what make it perfect.The story revolves around a group of soldiers on a training mission in the middle of nowhere Scotland, which is already humorous because Scotland is just not that big, and they're being hunted by werewolves. It's a run of the mill monster survival movie, with a twist at the end and a dash of camp for a good laugh.Don't go in with high expectations. The makers of this film knew they weren't making a perfect movie and just wanted it to be a gory and exciting ride, which it certainly was.

I give it the edge over Ginger Snaps because this gives us tons of blood and intestines and I'm a sucker for that.

171,hamburgerman,decent werewolf movie,6,12 August 2002,"I read about this film in the Los Angeles Times Calendar section (for the Sci-Fi/Horror film festival at the Egyptian Theater), and was intrigued. What drew me in was the articles comparison of DOG SOLDIERS to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  This comparison is not a fair one because the only thing similar was the fact the whole story took place in the woods. 
I went into the film not knowing anything about it, which is rare these days.  The newspaper article didn't really explain the concept of the movie, just briefly mentioning these British soldiers go into the woods and begin disappearing.  I wish the guy that introduced the film didn't say the word WEREWOLF, which blew some of the surprise.Now to comment on the movie itself.  While i enjoyed the movie very much, it already had two strikes against it (no fault of the filmmakers, though.) The problems I had with the film are simple:  I don't like the potential victims to have that much ammunition!  All of the gunplay kind of takes the fun out of it.  The other problem I had with the film is that, in my opinion, it may have been more suspenseful if the opening scene with the campers was eliminated, allowing the audience to discover the creatures as the main soldiers do.   What was refreshing about the film was that no computer special effects were used (to the best of my knowledge.)  It was a good old fashioned horror film (with lots of guns.)  The werewolves were very effective, tall and intimidating.  And solid acting all around.I understand DOG SOLDIERS is not getting a U.S. theatrical release, but will be released on DVD in the U.S. in November.  Definitely worth at least rental, and probably worth purchasing for horror fans.",Dog Soldiers
172,Syxiepoo,Riveting,10,22 April 2017,"Since 2002, I have watched Dog Soldiers maybe a dozen times and I find it just as good every single time.It's as real and visceral as a Werewolf movie can ever be. It benefits greatly from being located in Scotland and from its British cast, all of whom are, quite simply, excellent.The werewolves are brilliantly conceived and brought to the screen. The script and action are so engrossing, I feel myself believing that they are real, at least for the duration of the movie. This is the suspension of disbelief to the maximum.Someone on here made a comparison with American Werewolf in London, another excellent, classic horror thriller. However, I feel that Dog Soldiers is an even better thrill ride.I'm a movie buff, but not a complete purist. I've considered every aspect of the movie and I cannot find anything about it worthy of the slightest adverse criticism.My apologies if I sound somewhat of a fanboy about Dog Soldiers, but, for me, this may be the best film of its genre that I've ever seen ... and I've seen a good many over the years.If you're reading this and haven't yet seen the movie, drop everything and do so now And if you've seen it before ... you know you must see it again.",Dog Soldiers

174,ernesto-garcia,A Genuine Review of Dog Soldiers,9,8 February 2013,"Dog Soldiers is an excellent British horror film from mastermind director Niel Marshall.Dog soldiers is a perfect blend of horror,comedy,and action.I would like to start off by saying that my only problem is that some of the jokes and slang were a bit hard to figure out,but other than that this is a 10 point film. Dog Soldiers is about a group of British soldiers that embark on a routine training mission in the wilderness,only to be attacked by a brutal pack of werewolves. The film has an original concept,great gore,great acting,and great direction.The wolves look top notch and have a nightmarish quality to them.This is what you get if you splice Predator,Aliens,and An American Werewolf in London together,with a nice splash of Evil Dead to boot. See this flick if you like a good horror film that has true heart put into it.Skip it if you don't like fun horror films with a serious bite. 9.5/10",Dog Soldiers
175,webjunk-62635,The best Brit werewolf film?,8,30 October 2020,"I can only assume the low result for this gem of a ""horror"" film was made by those who had trouble with the accents (London, Geordie, Scottish), Brit idiom, and most of all Brit humour. There are many script moments you would NEVER hear in a US film.
An original idea and premise.
Well worth your time watching this.",Dog Soldiers
176,kingmonkey,outrageous fun!,8,8 January 2007,"Dog Soldiers is often referred to as being ""the best werewolf film since An American Werewolf In London"". considering how few decent, even watchable films about werewolves have been released in that 20 year gap that perhaps is not as saying as much as it could be.Borrowing more from 'Predator' than any other werewolf film, a platoon or brigade of reserve soldiers are doing their thing in a Scottish forest when they are attacked by some ""unknown force"", later determined to be werewolves. A simplified plot for you, but often the most simple premise gives you the best tale.The emphasis is on a mixture of fun and gore, and the balance is perfect here, probably for the first time in a horror film since Evil Dead 2. The cast, relatively unknown, are fantastic, and the effects are a treat - gone is the plague of CGI, here you get special effects that people have worked long and hard to produce and make look convincing.The Descent, from the same director, may be the superior film in regards of shocks and scares, but one should not overlook this gem. funny, violent and the occasional jump out of your seat moment, Dog Soldiers belongs in the collection of every self-respecting horror film fan.",Dog Soldiers

I wish I could erase them to spare others from wasting their time. After the first scene I wanted to turn off the DVD. I didn't because I did not want to miss the good stuff that - according to the reviews - was in there somewhere. Well, it wasn't. This movie is not realistic, scary, interesting or even funny.

When I bought the ticket, I didn't expect too much. But what a surprise! After a slow start, the film really delivers. It's got everything in it you need for good entertainment: blood, gore, a decent plot with some nice twists, okay acting, you even got character development. And most of all: good British humor. Some scenes of the film are really funny. In the cinema I was in, the audience was even applauding at some parts of the movie. Although the film has apparently not cost very much, it is well done, the camera work is good, even the werewolves look quite okay. The setting in the middle of nowhere is excellent. You get a feeling of isolation and helplessness there. If you like good horror flicks, go see it.",Dog Soldiers

I came away in all three instances with a ""that was much better than I expected AND was much better than most movies being cranked out nowadays"" feeling.The special effects are excellent, reminiscent of Rob Bottin's work. The script, as well, is first rate, with smart characters and realistic reactions. There's also some snappy dialog which, I confess, is difficult to understand sometimes due to thick British accents.Stays fairly true to mythological theory without being at all cliché.Highly recommended. 9 out of 10 stars.",Dog Soldiers
181,mbgdowska,A Dogged movie.....,8,15 November 2021,"Right. Love this movie so much I have taken time to write my fair and honest review on Dog Soldiers. Firstly I like John Pertwee and his dad (Worzel Gummidge).In this movie the story was good. Very funny comedy and at the right times!I was very surprized to see Sgt. Wells very well after been sliced by a lycanthrope. Twas funny at first but with these types of movies you want realism maxed out. That didn't happen. Director forgot and was more focused on pushing forward the story. !
Spoiler: I'm glad dog survived.Another gripe (and there's not many!) was the back story of how the family became lycanthropes. That was the icing on the cake for me. Even if it was a brief story. Better than no story.I think character of Cptn Ryan was not malevolent enough.Meaning (after been captured) he was quite placid but he was the main antagonist. Disappointing there.Overall slightly predicable but fun movie and I felt for everyone including Ryan.Watch and enjoy. Shame there wasn't a sequel/prequel to tell us the back story of the lycanthropes.",Dog Soldiers
182,Sawyer-4815162342,A Movie That Punches Above it's Weight Class,7,15 October 2017,"This movie has no right being as good as it is. It's not great, but by all means it should be terrible. And it's not. Things I liked: -The effects are practical, not CGI. And they only show glimpses of the werewolves until the end of the movie so one doesn't get tired of the costumes. I think they did a better job with the werewolves than many high budget Hollywood movies would. -Sir Davos Seaworth, the Onion Knight, does a great job in his role. The rest of the cast did pretty good with their acting too. -The plot moves along quickly and sustains a fun tone throughout. Negatives: -I did find a couple of minor plot holes/things that don't totally make sense. Overall this movie is much better than one would expect. Sure it's kind of cheesy and it's clearly a low budget effort, but they make the most of what they have to work with and it ends up being surprisingly good.

183,aktowfik,Back to atmospheric horror,9,29 June 2006,"This movie uses a commonly used theme in horror: The birds - The night of the living dead. Here they are in their last stand, hiding in a house surrounded by werewolves, and the usual sequences occur: Attack from upstairs - Trying to start the car - The danger can be among us - etc.... However, the movie deals with this premise in a fresh way, trying to avoid all those Hollywood archetypes. U really feel scared, and U do care for the characters and identify with them. Gosh !.. These guys know how to build the atmospheric horror. The most important point here is that there r no CGI effects at all. I hate CGI creatures. They move strangely as though they have no weight, like shadows. As Barry Sonnefield said about MIB-1:"" Those CGI guys are very professional in computer, but they know nothing about life"". That's why he used animatronics in most of MIB-1. That's why I liked ""Howling"" and ""Dog soldiers"" very much, while I loathed ""Under world"" and ""Van Helsing"". Here, werewolves are huge, hairy and scary. U really believe them. Actors are excellent. As a whole, if U haven't seen this movie before, I promise U will spend a very rewarding evening.

184,fabulousrice,Good Saturday night B-movie,6,19 April 2006,"It's Saturday night and you're looking for something to watch/rent with friends? Go for Dog Soldiers! It's not a masterpiece, I'll have to give you that. But the good thing about this film is, it NEVER PRETENDS to be one. Okay, at first you might be startled by the ""two hours before"" - ""four months later"" jumps in time. Try to get over it. The screenplay and dialogs are amazingly inventive considering it's such a small-budgeted film, and every gap left ajar by the scale of the production is filled with the proper plot twists, clever editing (the film is edited by the director, which is something I would prefer to see more often in modern cinema!), very quick pace of the action, and rhythm that never lets the viewer down. When it comes down to action sequences, they are very ballsy and though, bloody even when the plot demands it, as one would expect from a ""SOLDIERS FIGHT MUTANT DOGS"" type of film. We can also note how the cinematography, light effects or camera angles palliate in a satisfactory manner to poor special effects (they do have stroboscopic cameras, though!). The virile action sequences (which don't exclude female characters! I applaud) are also cleverly backed-up by the textures of each character's personality, and the fighting of their beliefs and ideals. References to other films such as Zabriskie Point also denote good influences on the filmmakers. The end credits are mixed with funny still shots which also prove the second degree with which the project was treated, and which is present throughout the film (as in the gut-gluing surgery sequence for example). To sum up, this film would be a total piece of crap if the people who made it hadn't had the good flair and cleverness to simply do what they were here for: action, wolves, and especially not take themselves too seriously or it would really have been lame. Enjoy it with friends, debate whether the special effects ruin the film or not, argue with them that the fast pace of the action and the rhythm never allows you to think twice about the weaknesses of the film, and forget it in a week or two.",Dog Soldiers
185,kensai-5,"Considering the high rating and positive reviews, read this for a fair warning.",3,13 May 2017,"Objectively, Dog Soldiers is a fairly bad movie, with hardly any of the scenes making sense, very shallow humor, low-brow writing and a pitiful excuse for action. The film crew and actors manage to provide some credence, but I assume that the ""so bad, it's good"" factor would work a lot better if they hadn't.Let me give you a spoiler-free rundown of what the first 30-40 minutes of the movie *looked like* to me: A group of adult men are playing a group of twelve-year-old boys who are running through the woods, shooting with their toy guns at imaginary enemies, while shouting nonsensical stuff that preteens assume adult soldiers might say. Since none of the material the camera captured had any resemblance of tension, generic but frantic action music is playing, while the actors are pointing their rifles into the depth of the wood, shooting wildly at absolutely nothing. When not shooting at air, the group of men-playing-children is sitting around a fire or walking aimlessly through the woods and having some of the most boring and dim-witted conversations you could hope to find in a movie...in my opinion. After that, the scenery switches but nothing else improves much.The acting is fair enough and occasionally loosened by exaggeration. Author/director Neil Marshall isn't generally awful either, but rather brought to the limits of his wits when it came to creating tension or action with a bare minimum of a budget. Almost everything that happens is laughably ridiculous and hardly given much thought. A lot of cheap tricks serve in visibly veiling the lacking quality of the action. The music is basically carrying every scene. Without it most viewers might question whether anything is actually happening at all. Choppy editing is used to help the music along, creating an audio-visual mess. One scene features a single soldier attempting to block a door from a werewolf, while also reloading his rifle. Nothing exciting is actually happening. The soldier is crouching in front of the door, fumbling with his gun, while we see little bits of an ugly, static wolf mask lightly moving around in the door's window. If the camera held still, the scene would be laughable to look at, without a trace of tension. To circumvent the obvious absence of action, the scene switches between 2 different camera perspectives, every second. In one angle the camera keeps swinging around, like the cameraman was heavily drunk and just about to run off to the toilet, jerking around on the spot, unable to concentrate on his job, only barely capable of keeping the camera held on the scene. In the other angle, the camera appears to be lying on the ground, after the cameraman finally ran to the bathroom. In his despair he didn't even mind placing the camera straight or orderly. The soldier is seen in the top right corner, while 3 quarters of the screen only show the ground and the wall next to the door-frame. Additionally, the camera is slightly tilted, giving the impression that the house is about to tip over to the side. Now imagine the scene altering between those two camera angles once per second. In effect it's a lot like watching a video of two elderly men, quietly playing chess, while frantic action music is playing and the camera view is doing what I described above - wildly moving around. And that's exactly what the majority of the movie is doing, adding music, shaky cam and bad editing to otherwise boring and nonsensical events.I won't pretend that my assessment of the movie would or should feel the same to everyone. Regardless of that, I think you might have the best chances of enjoying this movie if you belong to the group of men who are easily excitable by soldier uniforms, firearms and thoroughly meaningless, childish expressions like ""Owned you!"".",Dog Soldiers

This movie is so simply brilliant, it could not have possibly come from those studios. A group of British soldiers that, despite being mostly unknown to American audiences, you can't help but grow to care about and root for the entire movie, is doing maneuvers in the Scottish Highlands, when they stumble across a real life-threatening emergency their training never prepared them for. But they go after the threat with all they have, and it's a ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. No fancy special effects, no ravishingly handsome heroes and damsels in distress, just hardcore grit and action from start to finish. Plot twists, some predictable, some not so much, keep the storyline fresh and your attention glued to the screen to the very end. I hope that if the Movie Gods decree a sequel, it's done by the same dastardly talents that spawned this amazing slice of celluloid---PLEASE don't let SciFi Channel get a hold of it (only to air it)! Very few movies merit a place in my DVD collection (I am THAT cheap), and this movie more than deserves its spot, right next to both ""Kill Bill""'s and the Romero Dead Trilogy.

189,jhjenntex,Excellent Work!,10,25 September 2005,"While I generally don't like the horror genre, I caught the last three fourths of ""Dog Soldiers"" on the SCI FI Channel and found it EXCELLENT! I had heard of it before, but was miffed at the theft of the title from the (non-horror) novel by Robert Stone, which was made into another excellent film, ""Who'll stop the Rain"", with Nick Nolte and Tuesday Weld.While I am an American, I have trained with British infantry in Europe, and read a lot of their military literature since, and I really appreciate how hard the film makers worked to get the weapons, tactics, and British Army slang right. (I have a few quibbles on the weapons, but they are the sort that specialists LIVE to belabor at length. I the main, they got it right!) ""Dog Soldiers"" does what I wish EVERY horror or sci-fi film would do, which is, REALISTICALLY show how real soldiers would fare in encountering the an exotic foe, featuring real weapons and tactics. This is very good work! The beasts are truly frightful, but more important, this film has solid character development, and very solid story telling, ignored in too many films, regardless of budget.There are no unwarranted surprises, there is subtle fore-shadowing of all that ensues.Over time, I will find a good DVD copy of ""Dog Soldiers"" for my library.",Dog Soldiers
190,jrpa,Taking the bookending scenes and giving an opinion on that and the werewolf makeup,8,20 September 2020,"In the first scene a girl gives her camping mate a silver knife (letter opener or something.) and then a few months later, the human bad guy Ryan (Liam Cunningham) kills a german shepherd for no reason.
(apparently the werewolves who ate the campers saved the letter opener and it came into the possession of Cooper while they were besieged.)
In the end scene, Ryan who has turned into a werewolf, is about to kill Pvrt. Cooper (Kevin McKidd, who refused to kill the dog for no reason in the opening) ---
So, at the end of the tale, a small long-haired shepherd-like dog who has decided that Cooper is his BFF, jumps on the back of Ryan the werewolf and distracts him long enough for Cooper to stab the werewolf that Ryan has become with the silver blade, which, following classic werewolf lore, kills him instantly.
--- In other words, the story came full circle.
The makeup of the werewolves left them man-like in several ways which added to the terror of being attacked by them. They were about 7 feet tall and walked upright and their arms were largely unchanged except for the hands.
It really was a great movie.",Dog Soldiers
191,severin72,Excuse the hagiography but...,9,17 December 2006,"...Neil Marshall deserves one. Three years after ""Dog Soldiers"" Marshall would mature in to a truly superior talent with ""The Descent"" but even with this, his first feature effort, he was clearly something special. Marshal is one of those writer-directors who is first and foremost a fan just one with a camera and a budget and he makes the very best use of both. His fellow fans in the audience can live vicariously by counting references and spotting the influences as they enjoy the ride. Marshall has been at pains to say that ""Dog Soldiers"" is a; ""soldier film with werewolves not a werewolf film with soldiers"". He's right and the fact is perhaps the most important reason the film works. A squad of British soldiers on a training exercise in the highlands of Scotland (filming actually took place in Luxembourg) find themselves up against something much more than they expected. Holed up in a remote farmhouse they struggle to survive the night against a seemingly un-killable enemy. Marshall takes great care developing the squaddies as characters and involving the audience in their fate. Despite the minimal budget there are excellent effects on hand (these are perhaps the most formidable werewolves ever put on screen) but Marshall is smart enough to know their limitations. He never over-reaches. If you get to watch the DVD check out the cast and crew commentaries. You'll find that the film is such fun partly because all the participants are having such a blast. The action sequences are thrilling, the characters and their reactions are believable. Mckidd, Morfitt and Pertwee in particular are exceptional and by the end you'll be surprised how moved you are by the heroism they display. Yet the movie never loses its sense of fun. There's an undercurrent of absurdist humor that reminds you no-one's meant to take the whole thing too seriously. Marshal pulls this off without resorting to the kind of leaden canned witticisms that are Wes Craven's sad legacy to modern horror films. If there's a failing in ""Dog Soldiers"" (aside from it being a very ""nationalistic"" film - if you're not British you're not going to get everything) it's Marshall not yet being as meticulous a storyteller as he would become with ""The Descent"". Good luck figuring out the story behind Emma Cleasby's character. Watch it the first time and enjoy the ride then watch it again and have just as much fun picking out the little tribute touches.",Dog Soldiers

193,dalbuc,Excellent Low Budget Horror,8,19 June 2005,"Simply put this movie is very slickly done. In large part I think because the makers eschewed the over-use of CGI and used actual costumes for the werewolves. The decisionpiays off as the wolves look very, very good.The film, as a plot, actually holds together pretty darn well for what is basically a remake of Zulu with werewolves. The people in the film act rationally and don't make the sorts of boneheaded mistakes most people make in horror films that leave me rooting for the bad guys. The fact that they behave well and that their parts are acted well mean that you give a furry rats-backside about what happens to these people. The plot is not without holes and things you'll go, ""Wait, why don't you do X"" but they are mostly small and easily overlooked.The action in the film is pretty well done. The action scenes are well shot and paced nicely so that there is a constant tempo of action despite a lot of downtime between the fight scenes for character development. There is some resort to the ""enter Sandman"" style of shake the camera action but by and large you can see the action very well.Finally, the film is gory. The makers got their money's worth on stage blood. If you are queasy this film isn't for you since there is a lot of blood flowing and some pretty gory effects of disembowlments but, if you can handle that (and it is no worse than something like Saving Private Ryan for that matter) this is really a film you'll enjoy.",Dog Soldiers

195,ian_bell,My deepest sympathy to all werewolves . . .,1,4 May 2010,"Watching this well-meaning but deeply flawed exercise I was reminded of a classic John Carpenter film from 1976. Inspired by Rio Bravo, Carpenter decided to make a modern-day equivalent to that western and came up with the genuinely thrilling Assault On Precinct 13.My point in mentioning this is there is nothing wrong in copying an idea from someone, just so long as you put your own stamp on it.From what I've seen of Neil Marshall's films, this director - gifted though he is at staging action set-pieces - appears to have no idea of how to put a genuine stamp on anything.Dog Soldiers is what you get if you go into the editing rooms of Predator, Alien, The Howling, the aforementioned Assault . . . and a dozen other action/thriller/horrors.There is nothing remotely original about it. Not to labour the point, but in Assault On Precinct 13 the twist of that Seventies thriller was two implacable foes - the law and the criminals - being forced to pull together to withstand the siege of a Latino gang upon a Los Angeles police station.Here there is no such twist, nor any such tension. Well, there is, but the twist when it comes is not so much a surprise as inevitable, or at least should be if you know anything about the werewolf myth.I'm tired of British film directors who seem unable or unwilling to go that extra yard and come up with something genuinely original. Can it really be that hard?This is the British film industry, folks, not Hollywood. It would be nice if we could find more directors such as Paul Andrew Williams (London To Brighton) whose films capture a mood and an originality alive within British cinema, rather than simply trying to cash in on a craze which seems to have started in a video arcade or in a Hollywood mall.I suppose I'm in for a long wait.",Dog Soldiers

197,bmyatt_uk,miles better than trashy american horror.,10,31 March 2003,"having been one of the few people in my area who was supporting this movie from the very start, I am glad to say that my support was never unfounded. this film had me gripped from the very beggining, with it's non-stereotyped characters, and atypical action.although the plot does very closely resemble ""aliens"", it never once felt cloying, and the same tense atmosphere that made ""Blair witch project"" so watchable is used to far better effect here. you rarely see the actual werewolves themselves in more than two second flashes, and for this reason their badly made costumes never really dissapoint you. the fact that the film uses very little, if no CG effects in no way detracts from it.even the ""wolf-vision"" camera, which would be corny as hell in another film, feels right here, because through it you still manage to empathise with the actual characters of the film, and you do feel like you're being hunted.once the actual action starts, the film only improves more. the fact that black comedy prevails all the way through the films is part of it's immense charm, and rather than detracting from the action, the nervous comic banter only serves to draw you in even more. you genuninely feel for these characters.even the more corny scenes (fistfightin an 8-foot tall wolf, anyone?0 fell good, because it's a desperate situation. this moveie feels exactly how it should feel, and proves that you can have a horror movie that doesnt involve a bunch of whining teenagers getting killed by the person who everyone could blatantly see was the killer from the very start of the movie.10/10",Dog Soldiers
198,lilac_point_burmese,Great Film,8,16 September 2003,"There is a lot that can be said for this film. Firstly I want to mention its failings - the film is fairly predictable, gets lost in parts and the werewolves are slightly on the fake side. However, to defend those points this film was made on a low budget with a no-name cast - which is by no means necessarily a good thing - but they certainly ""pull it off"" with Dog Soldiers.This is not your typical werewolf movie. I wholeheartedly agree with the person that mentioned the refreshing lack of sexy stupid teens. How refreshing for a horror movie! In this one we are dealing with gung-ho army guys in more the style of ""Aliens"" than ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"".People stuck in a deserted mansion being hunted down one by one by creatures of the night is certainly not a new concept. In fact to describe the plot to someone who has not seen the film would probably discourage them - ""its been done before"" is what immediately comes to mind. Being a horror buff, I tend to support whatever is released and coaxing my partner to see this film ran along the lines of what I have just said, however, despite all that we both found this to be a fantastic film.The film is fun, funny, scary and contains some of the most gruesome scenes I have ever seen - sure its been done before - but who cares?!

199,DarrenHorne,British Horror at its best. Thoroughly enjoyable.,9,7 March 2005,"At last, a horror film with no sign of teenagers or CGI heavy effects. Writer/Director Neil Marshall uses a meagre £3.5 million budget and comes up with the perfect blend of horror, action and comedy in this superb British werewolf film. The opening scene sets the tone with a bloody and brutal attack on two hikers, as the moonlit woods of the Scottish Highlands echo with howling. Four weeks (28 days?) later, an army squad is dropped into those same woods on exercise, led by the stern, yet patriarchal, sergeant Harry Wells (Sean Pertwee). The lads become immediately likable thanks to superb squaddie banter. In fact the dialogue is spot on throughout and, combined with excellent performances, creates a group of distinct characters that we quickly care about. Pertwee is probably the only actor you will recognise making it impossible to guess who will die next when the body count starts to rack up.The squad soon come across the mauled and mutilated remains of a Special Forces unit that appear to have been on some kind of safari. Captain Ryan (Liam Cunningham) is the only survivor and keeps babbling ""there was only supposed to be one"" over and over again. The tension builds as the bewildered squad arm themselves with the live rounds and the weapons of the slaughtered Special Forces unit. Darkness falls, the full moon hangs high in the sky, and the woods fill with howling. The squad are immediately on the move in an edge of the seat, pulse racing, running battle. Superbly shot, with jerky, frantic camera movement and only fleeting glimpses of the big howling things that hunt them.They are rescued by zoologist Meg (Emma Cleasby), who leads them to relative safety in the form of a nearby deserted house. This is now a classic horror scenario with a small group of survivors franticly trying to fend off the evil that lurks outside. As ammo runs low the lads ravage the house for any form of weaponry, this leads to Spoon launching a dazzling pugilistic assault that will have you cheering at the screen.Every scene of tension or horror is immediately interrupted by outrageous humour, to superb effect, leaving you constantly unsure of whether you're going to die laughing or soil yourself. There are also several hilarious fairy tale inspired lines such as when Wells says, ""Should little red riding hood turn up with a bazooka and a bad attitude, I expect you to chin the bitch""The use of tight camera angles and close ups mean we emote with the characters, and feel as confined and claustrophobic as they do. The werewolves are kept in the shadows and smoke, probably because of the low budget, which helps to enhance the fear factor. Dog Soldiers borrows heavily from a variety of sources and creates something better, the whole being much more than the sum of its parts. There are references to a plethora of films, particularly Aliens, Predator, Evil Dead (one of the characters is called Bruce Campbell) and the Matrix. Every single scene is excellent and will leave you no opportunity to pop off to make the tea. It is destined to be a cult classic and is my favourite film of the year. Neil Marshall is one to watch.",Dog Soldiers
200,ctilly69,One of my favourite horror films,8,2 January 2021,"I love this film! The story is simple, the action is fun, but most of all, it's very British. The little bits of humour really make it worthwhile, and i love how, even during a crisis, there's always time for a brew.",Dog Soldiers
201,monkeybone,Monster werewolves against squaddies. COOL!,8,26 November 2002,"Isn't it great to see a horror movie that doesn't have the usual dumb teenagers running round screaming, having sex and doing the usual things that you're not supposed to before being sliced and diced by some masked maniac. If that's what turns you on in a horror film then don't bother watching Dog Soldiers as this is probably the best genre-busting debut since Sam Raimi brought us his seminal horror classic The Evil Dead. While on a war games exercise in the Scottish highlands, a group of squaddies comes across the remains of a special forces operation with  only the captain being the sole survivor who is barely hanging on. It appears they were attacked by someone or something that killed the entire squad with effortless ease and extreme power as no ammo was fired and no bodies to be found with only a few intestines strewn around. Soon the squaddies are running through the woods being chased by what appears to be large wolves. While on the run, they are rescued by a zoologist who appears to know what is going on. She lets on that they were attacked by werewolves which the squad finds difficult to believe at first, but as the night draws on they have to come to terms with the fact that it's either fight, or die.For first time director Neil Marshall this is solid stuff. Using modern day tactics and pitting it against an ancient force of the supernatural is a great premise, which is why the film works so well as it is something that most people refuse to admit to in such an advanced society.Performances from the cast are superb all round encapsulating what is typical of most British men. Sean Pertwee as the sarge is superb giving the film some great humour which is again typical of what the British are like. Kevin McKidd puts in a great performance as Cooper who takes over from the sarge after he is attacked causing certain parts ""...to vacate the premises.""Hopefully Dog Soldiers will help Marshall establish himself as a great director and he will follow in the footsteps of Sam Raimi and Peter 'The Lord Of The Rings' Jackson.",Dog Soldiers
202,nemo183,Just shown on Channel 5 - looks just as good!!!!,7,29 June 2005,"One of the best British horror movies to be released in the last five years. Despite it's tiny budget - i.e. seems to have no CGI, plus special effects of big explosions do look a bit dodgy - I suspect the blowing up of some quite small models - this movie works because by about a third of the way through, you actually care about what happens to the characters.Another weakness concerns several of the plot lines, which are perhaps a little too well sign posted.Despite this, the film still does well to create tension virtually from the start. The interaction of the British soldiers, initially sent on exercise with blank firing standard issue SA80 rifles, is accurately portrayed, as is their reaction to reacting to a real threat.I don't know if there was any overdubbing for the US release, but the use of colloquial English (and Scottish!) might make some of the dialogue somewhat incomprehensible for anything other than a UK audience. However, even if very word isn't understood, the acting makes certain it's meaning is.The cast of werewolves perform outstandingly, and their performances are enhanced by the use of great camera work - we see enough, but not too much.It's also good to see a horror film that rejects the mould of the Hollywood ""slasher"" genre, and takes us in another direction.I guess this film will mainly be compared to the classic ""American Werewolf in London"" on the one hand, and ""28 Days Later"" on the other.It doesn't have the humour of AWinL, but it is equally engrossing in other ways. Although 28 Days features some superb cinematography, it comes nowhere near to Dog Soldiers as a complete horror film.",Dog Soldiers
203,aussieukangel,worth watching,7,19 December 2005,"Being a horror fan, I rather liked this movie. I went into the video store wanting to find a classic horror movie and found this one instead. It had a good storyline, action and plenty of horror to keep everyone involved. A few twists and turns, that I will not mention ( don't want to spoil it for those that haven't watched it yet ) made it interesting. Very good camera work, angle shots lighting effects etc. The special affects were quite good, made the monsters pretty believable. I didn't feel like I had wasted my time watching this and came away feeling that I had watched a pretty good movie. I don't think you will be disappointed if you are not faint hearted that is.... Worth watching 7 out of 10",Dog Soldiers
204,megagurka,Worth watching,6,12 July 2003,"Pretty good werewolf movie. The acting isn't great (but not bad either), the story is a bit predictable and the special effects are cheap, but that's part of the charm with movies like this. If you're put off by things like this, don't watch this movie!The movie starts off pretty well with the werewolfs chasing the soldiers though the woods. This part is somewhat similar to Predator, which is good. Unfortunately when they get to the cottage it seems the story writers kind of ran out of ideas and added some scenes that are very predictable and tedious (""Are they really werewolfs?"", guy standing in front of window etc.). That part of the movie lowers the rating. But I was pleasantly surprised by the gory and action filled ending. It remainded me of great films like Evil Dead. Super stuff!Overall rating 6/10",Dog Soldiers

Actors make good work, especially Sean Pertwee as sarge(known from Event Horizon). Spoon (Darren Morfitt) acts in the most memorable scene, boxing against werewolf. The Plot is very hard to understand, but when you watch it again, it gets clear. Music is something I won't never forget. It sounds almost as good as in the Rock, almost. Very succeeded movie from Britain.",Dog Soldiers
207,hobgoblinlol,Dog Soldiers,8,10 September 2012,"I simply love the film. In my opinion, it's one of the best Werewolf films ever made if not the best. Great atmosphere, good acting, and great character development along with decent action and intense moments. It's a great movie and i hope there will be a sequel one day. The character development in the film is just great. It makes you care about characters.I am also very glad that they didn't use CGI and used suits which is million times better.

It is simply excellent British film-making.There is subtle British humour (which, lets face it, the Americans just don't get) and a good British cast which many people would recognise from television. Neil Marshall's direction is fantastic and the writing even better. There have been many films about werewolf encounters, and Dog Soldiers plays on that perfectly. Great performances came from Spoon (Darren Morfitt) and Wells (Sean Pertwee).Dog Soldiers deserves a lot of praise for being funny, scary and very entertaining.",Dog Soldiers
209,sneakyshooter,A Fun Ride From Start to Finish,9,25 September 2018,"Dog Soldiers is pure popcorn entertainment and its one of my all time favorites. The great mix of comedy and action is very well done for how low its budget seemed to be. The performances were fantastic, especially Liam Cunningham's (captain Ryan) one evil expression he maintains throught the movie. Tremendous.The film's heavily inspired by Aliens but I honestly didn't mind. It came off as the homage it was intended to be and not a ripoff. From ""Short, controlled, bursts"" to the creatures cutting the power, its a great nod to one of the best ""marines surrounded by smart beasts"" movies ever.There are of course small plot holes and cheesy lines, but the charisma of the actors completley overrides all of that. They are giving it thier all and really having fun with it. It shows throughout the film.A side note, I also appreciated the cheeky not-so-subtle foreshadowing with Cooper being told to kill the dog in the start of the film. Little does he know the amount of ""dogs"" he would be killing later.All in all, this films great entertainment, and should be given a fair chance by all movie fans.

Better than Evil Dead, at least. It just never gets quite good. Not exactly as clever as it should be. There aren't many werewolf-movies, so if you're a fan of the genre, you'll want to see it.

216,ace_ryan,Soap MacTavish VS Werewolves,9,25 October 2016,"Horror movies are usually not something I watch, this was always due to the fact I have a bit of an over active imagination but I was hooked on this movie when it was on TV one night. It finished incredibly late so I watched the rest of the movie on DVD and boy was it a good British horror movie. There are some parallels with the real life Battle of Rorke's Drift (depicted in ""Zulu"") and scenes from ""Aliens"" which blend together well with our usual dark humour (I am British myself). So the basic plot is a group of soldiers on a training mission deep in the British countryside are hunted by a pack of bloodthirsty werewolves with a mysterious and wounded Captain Ryan with a secret agenda of his own. One by one the men are taken and torn apart by the beasts leaving a single soldier to prove a point put to him at the beginning of the movie; can he kill a dog? Watching the movie, all that was going through my mind was I was seeing Captain ""Soap"" MacTavish from the ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare"" series fighting werewolves which was a cool concept to me, the creatures themselves looked incredible, so real and terrifying I was genuinely on the edge of my seat numerous times watching wondering who was the next to become a dog's dinner and growing attached to them, the deaths and blood effects were gruesome but very well done and I liked how it was all set around a small farm playing on the idea that what they think is safety really isn't. One of my favourite points in the movie is the intelligence of the werewolves when they managed to trick the soldiers in a couple of moments. Overall this is a very well put together British horror movie and I do highly recommend it to anyone",Dog Soldiers

218,dukee44,Good mix of werewolf horror and rugged humour,8,8 September 2007,"I enjoyed this film the first time I saw it on Scream (a Canadian horror/suspense channel) last year. I caught it again just last week on the same venue. Working with what may have been a tight budget, the British crew behind this film did a great job of combining an interesting horror film with wry humour. The testosterone level is high, being as the main characters are all gung-ho (albeit green...except the sarge and the captain) British soldiers. Emma Seamsby as Megan (who alternately helps, then betrays them) is a pleasant female addition to the main cast. Being impervious to most regular weapons, the werewolves (which are effectively done, by the way) are very difficult opponents. The young soldiers therefore have to hole up in an abandoned farmhouse, waiting for dawn.There are some very funny lines: Sarge(who's just been ripped open by a werewolf): My guts are out! Soldier: I'll put them back in! Sarge: They won't FIT! The Sarge makes the supreme sacrifice at the end, just as he's becoming a monster himself. I found it very moving.I hope to find this on DVD.",Dog Soldiers

220,davehbrown,A very good action/horror film.,8,23 December 2002,"I really enjoyed this movie. If you like the Alien/Predator/Thing/Tremors style of movies, you should enjoy this as well.So what made this film work for me? It was well paced, and moved along at a good clip throughout, it was never boring. The characters were all likeable. Unlike most horror films, the characters never did anything that was blatantly stupid. The action as good, well filmed, and well edited. The movie never took itself too seriously; there were some pretty funny jokes sprinkled throughout. The final joke at the end was very funny.",Dog Soldiers
221,nickname1,"Well, _I_ thought that it was the best action film I've seen in ages.",9,26 July 2003,"I saw this film last night at a friend's house and was very impressed, despite not liking horror/suspense films.The things that I liked included1) Characters that were very plausible (the soldiers that is :-) ). 2) With few exceptions no character behaved brainlessly or made laughably crass decisions. (It seems that horror films always require a few bad choices to bring on the plot but this film wasn't packed with them.) 3) Action/humour/nice plot twists (esp the female character's role). I am still recalling nice little twists and lines 24 hours after seeing it. 4) REALLY nice to see a film with British characters, British humour, regional accents & colloquial slang. I'm not anti-American but watching a film without any 'foreign accents' was refreshing.I see that most reviewers here mention American Werewolf in London/Night of the living dead/Assault on Precinct 13 and occasionally Zulu. It also reminded me of Southern Comfort insofar as a fractured but fairly cohesive band of highly trained and heavily armed men take on the great outdoors and its denizens.I liked this film & maybe you will too.",Dog Soldiers
222,LanderRei,Quite possibly the best werewolf movie ever,10,30 July 2002,"Take the best type of monster ( werewolves of course) give our heroes guns and throw them into a small house in the midst of nowhere, and you've got a very, very good movie.I've always loved werewolves. Movies like Silver Bullet and An American Werewolf in London are classics to me. However, very few werewolf movies are good. Thankfully, Dog Soldiers is one of the good ones.For those interested in the storyline, its not too complicated. A squad of British soldiers are on a training exercise in Scotland, when they find themselves facing off against a group of werewolves. Yay!The dialogue was good ( Some good humour in there) and acting was just fine. Spoon was the man. I also really liked how the werewolves looked in this movie, pretty freaky looking especially since they were so tall.There is plenty of gore for the bloodthirsty, and Im talking about when its on the Sci-Fi channel! If it was cut, I can only imagine how bloody it is unedited. We've got torn-open stomachs, decapitations, impalations, and a boxing match between a werewolf and a soldier. Sweet.If you like werewolf movies, or even just horror movies you must see this. If you havent seen it, keep an eye out for it, you wont be disappointed.",Dog Soldiers
223,DeadpoolX,"Fun, smart, gory horror/comedy",8,17 April 2003,"Dog Soldiers is a rare beast - an independent British horror film.  The basic concept has been done to death, but Dog Soldiers shines in its execution.  The dialogue is intelligent and funny (if sometimes nigh unintelligible to American ears), the action is great, the humor is vicious and the property damage is astounding.  The joke at the end of this movie (stick around for the end credits) made me laugh until it hurt.  Sean Pertwee, one of my favorite actors, plays a great badass sergeant (upon seeing his own exposed intestines he exclaims, ""Sausages!""), and the other soldiers are downright admirable in their dedication to one another and their tough stoicism in the face of insurmountable odds.  Dog Soldiers is hardly great cinema, nor is it stupid or insulting.  It's enjoyable, witty and not at all for the squeamish.8/10",Dog Soldiers
224,farne,That time of the month...,7,26 July 2005,"I sat down to watch Dog Soldiers with relatively low expectations, but was very pleasantly surprised. It's rare to find a film which knows its audience so well and which hits its targets to squarely. Unlike its contemporary 28 Days Later, Dog Soldiers has no pretensions to make statements about human nature or to capture impressive money shots of deserted London landmarks. Instead, we have an all-out, action-packed, if jokey, horror film based around that reliable old standby of a disparate group of characters thrown together in exceptional circumstances. The characters here are a group of British soldiers on exercise in the Scottish highlands, who end up barricading themselves into a deserted farmhouse under siege from an army of werewolves. Although ostensibly a horror film, Dog Soldiers has much in common with films like Aliens and Zulu, and even references the latter film at least once. Unlike 28 Days Later, the portrayal of British soldiers is also surprisingly believable; their banter, the way they react under pressure, even their language and army slang all seem just about right. Among the cast the stand out is Sean Pertwee, as the foul-mouthed but sympathetic sergeant in charge of the motley group. Writer/director/editor Neil Marshall has produced an enjoyable, funny and fairly gripping film on a relatively limited budget, and Dog Soldiers must rank as one of the most solidly entertaining B-movies of recent years.",Dog Soldiers
225,josephmonaghan-34145,Brilliant just brilliant,10,23 February 2019,"Great plot and storyline great effects and acting need more werewolf films like this and werewolf in London and the howling, what makes it even scarier and thrilling is the plot twist at the end.",Dog Soldiers
226,Hammy-5,The fur flies,8,17 May 2002,"When I hear a film termed low budget and independent, I immediately think poncy, arty farty crap. We all have our prejudices, and that is mine. However, I do have enough smarts that I can also say that possibly, just possibly, it might offer something new to what could a rather stale and over done subject matter.Neil Marshall brings us tale of an army exercise that goes wrong. Sort of 'Bravo Two Zero' meets 'Assault on Precinct 13' with Werewolves. Yes, I said werewolves. What seems to be a difficult task, an exercise against Special Forces, goes totally pear shaped very quickly and requires our Soldier heroes to use all their know how to try and make it through to dawn. They find themselves holed up in secluded Farmhouse quickly running out of ammo and desperately wait for dawn.That is it. I am saying no more about the plot, for one very good reason. That there isn't much of a plot would usually be a negative but Neil Marshall keeps it simply. We have no history of werewolves, no 'but these are people during the hours of daylight' talk. In fact, most of the horror genre conventions have been dispensed with. We have a compacted, tight script that has a precise and explicit focus. That focus is, what happens if six ordinary squadies experience the extra-ordinary. Extra-ordinary not supernatural I might say. It is only on reflection that it occurs to me that there is virtually no supernatural element to this film. The werewolves are just creatures, bloody scary creatures, but creatures. Similar to the way vampires were redefined in 'Blade'.Neil Marshall is not only to be commended for the script writing he also shows himself to be adept behind the camera as well. Remember, he does not have a lot to work with here. A small cast, limited locations, limited finances and the majority of the movie is set at night. Yet, the guy keeps things moving, it has pace and carries that on throughout the film. If there is a dip in the physical action, you can be assured that there is something on the screen, verbal or visual, that you should be paying attention to.The, all British, cast are convincing in their roles. Special praise must be given to Kevin McKidd (Trainspotting) who I thought was very good as the no nonsense hero of this action packed yarn. I have to say though, some how I just don't believe Sean Pertwee (Event Horizon, 51st State) as the seen-it-all-before Sergeant. He does his best but I think he might have been more convincing in one of the other roles. That is me being very picky though.This is a very enjoyable film. If you are squeamish about blood and gore, don't go. It is an in your face affair. Very little is left to the imagination dismemberment wise and just enough with regards to the Lycanthropes. Enjoy!",Dog Soldiers
227,Mr_Jackhammer,Not too bad for a B movie.,10,15 November 2002,"I have to say, this movie was not nearly as bad as it COULD have been. The acting was actually surprisingly good, and although much of the dialogue was cheesy the actors did much to salvage the hopeless script.  The overall atmosphere was actually quite well done, with the creepy effects not overdone like is common in many such films.  The movie didn't degenerate into the usual sex, screaming, monsters and morons routine either. Although the movie did get quite slow and boring at times, it at least made a good stab at being different, and I applaud it for that.  I've had enough of the ""teens in scary place being eaten alive"" movies, and the military characters are a welcome change.  The weapons effects are very effective for some reason, they just sounded and looked badass, I don't really know why but the weapon sound effects are singularly convincing.  There are some moments of gore, and personally I don't think it fit particularly well in the storyline, but it didn't last for more than a few seconds at a time and although it will doubtless turn a few stomachs I think it was actually toned down compared to some B movies I've seen (Carnasaur for instance, one of the worst films ever. Roger Corman is one of the kings of bad cinema). Overall, this movie is far from excellent but it was not a total waste either.  It has a tendency to get tedious at spots but I managed to watch it through without falling asleep and I think others will too.  The plot has some severe holes (for instance, monsters that one minute rip a man in half with a sneeze are getting beat down in a boxing match the next) but don't take the movie too seriously or pick it apart too far and you might have some fun watching it, even just for some good ammo wasting scenes.  I rate this movie a 7, because it's good for it's B movie genre.",Dog Soldiers

Emma was great at her job, I liked the line ""It's that time of the month"", lol.

230,tarpalantir,I didn't know what was in store!,9,2 April 2003,"I picked this film based on what I had planned for the evening (nothing) and because of the dearth of new movies worth seeing.  If there was a cinematic lottery, I had won it.  Excellent acting, tight story and engrossing action all combined to make this movie one worth a few viewings. The filmakers don't try to distract you from their substandard script or dreadful acting by running an endless series of special effects at you. There's just suspense, acting, suspense, action, gore and more suspense. On top of all that, the characters are very likeable (or hateable). In the current cinematic climate, where movies seem to be video game cinematics starring a few actors, this movie was absolutely refreshing. If movie watching is on your mind, put down that copy of Star Wars II: George Lucas' Apostacy and pick up Dog Soldiers!!  You will not regret it!",Dog Soldiers
231,firetop14,Now my favourite werewolf movie ever!,9,30 June 2005,"Yes, I just caught this and couldn't believe it had taken me so long to get round to watching it. There's some fantastic dialogue in there, especially if you're a movie buff. My favourite line has to be ""there is no Spoon"", just because it was thrown in right when I was scared out of my wits and also grieving for poor old Spoon ... perfect timing. Applause.Another thing I love about this film is that a lot of the time the victims don't just scream, get eaten - The End. Because these people are soldiers, they're Scottish, and they are ticked off. More than once a victim actually tries to have a fist-fight with the werewolf attacking them before meeting their grisly demise. Right up to the point of their deaths the characters spit insults at their enemy - literally in some cases! And well done to all the actors as well. The sheer frustration felt by the soldiers really shines through.Although this is a horror movie, it could almost be perceived as a war movie. It has soldiers fighting a guerrilla war, a lot of bullets being fired and a lot of blood. We have a battlefield - the cottage that they are hiding out in - and a limited amount of ammunition. The characters treat it like a battle and unconsciously so does the viewer. Admittedly a slightly one-sided battle, but a well-fought one nonetheless.Some people have complained about the special effects, particularly about the werewolf costumes. I have no quarrel here. I'm just glad that they chose to have real costumes instead of CGI. CGI monsters do nothing for me. You don't have nightmares about Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd for a good reason. This is the main reason why American Werewolf in Paris failed miserably in frightening me. Computer generated images can't compete with the real thing, and I found the werewolf costumes in Dog Soldiers sufficiently chilling.Summary - like I said, this now qualifies as my favourite werewolf film, even managing to beat Ginger Snaps (which was a challenge). Sean Pertwee was fantastic. There was a good mix of horror and dry humour. Not suitable if you don't possess a strong stomach but other wise, a bloody good watch!",Dog Soldiers

My favourite film of all time is Predator and there are a number of similarities with Dog Soldiers, unseen (to start with) predator killing off soldiers in a forest, even a deserted camp with lots of gore and no bodies ! Dog Soldiers also has elements of Aliens (smart, lethal un-killable predators working in a pack). It is a British (hurrah!) movie so the budget isn't huge but for all that the werewolves are pretty cool, on two legs like The Howling although not that scary. Also one of the main reasons for seeing this film is the humour, from black humour and sarcasm it goes into an Evil Dead style slapstick mode at the end of the film that creased me up. I'll probably go and see this again (it's that good). As an added point is Kevin McKidd related to Alistair McRae (Mitsubishi World Rally Driver)?",Dog Soldiers
233,noirlover,"Yay, no CGI! Very good & scary werewolf flick",9,1 November 2004,"I found ""28 Days Later"" extremely overrated and a waste of a good premise so I don't agree at all with people who prefer that movie to this.I'm actually not really a big fan of gore or military films but somehow this really worked. It's like ""Aliens"" or ""Predator,"" but with werewolves. You can imagine the rest. And be prepared to cover your eyes four or five times at least.(Mild spoilers) What's good: Great characters that you care about, very tense scenes, & excellent, very scary werewolves. They way they tower over the men and the way they stand with their long arms (forepaws?) and claws makes me think of ""Nosferatu."" Very effective. So nice not to have CGI monsters. These are sooo much better than those ""Mummy"" films or some crap like ""American Werewolf in Paris.""What's not so good: You can see most if not all of the plot twists coming a mile away. Also, with lots of cupboards and big furniture sitting around the farmhouse, why don't they put them all in front of the windows? That's what I'd be doing and I have no training as a soldier! Still, very, very satisfying rental or night out at the movies. Highly recommended to all fans of horror & suspense who don't mind a lot of blood and guts. (Literally).I'm now a big fan of Sean Pertwee. He is excellent as the gruff sergeant. And Kevin McKidd has changed quite a bit since Tommy in ""Trainspotting."" Here he's very believable as a hardcore soldier. And I can't believe that the dastardly Ryan (Liam Cunningham) was the perfect papa in ""A Little Princess."" Good acting all around.",Dog Soldiers
234,james-337,Excellent Film,9,7 June 2002,"This has to be the best werewolf film I've ever seen. It's not entirely accurate militarily (e.g. the British Army has eight-man sections, not six-man squads), but it's witty and it's well-made and it's nice to finally see a sympathetic and accurate portrayal of modern British soldiers, complete with realistic language. Ignore the people who say it's rubbish (they obviously either didn't see it, saw it with the wrong expectations or just got out of bed on the wrong side) and see it!",Dog Soldiers
235,dzk70,Finally! a good werewolf flick,10,15 June 2002,"Hey film fans we have a winner in the horror category. ""Dog Soldiers"" is a gory, action packed, quick, straight to the point werewolf movie. wonderful location (set in the backwoods of Scotland) that would put the European landscape of ""An American Werewolf in London"" to shame. I love British actors! Their dry humor and acting styles have always intrigued me. The movie is about six British soldiers who are sent on a training mission set in the backwoods of Scotland. All seems well when they come up upon their fake enemy's campsite and see that it has been ransacked and blood and guts are everywhere. From there they find one survivor (a British special ops commander)and the mystery of the massacre unfolds. They end up fighting strange creatures and try to survive until dawn. Now, the reason why this movie is so good is A: very good action cinematography B: It's simple and sticks to just people outwitting the creatures. C: keeps the characters' back-story a secret until the very end and D: ITS A HORROR MOVIE! any true horror movie fan doesn't need anything more. The rank of true good werewolf movies go as follows (to me anyway) 1. An American Werewolf in London 2, Silver bullet. and for number 3 I can't decide on this new found gem or ""The Howling"" I'll have to buy it on dvd and and break both of the movies (""The Howling"" and ""Dog Soldiers"") down and rate them that way. All in All if you like gore, and horror flicks like yours truly then definitely check this movie out!",Dog Soldiers
236,portia-1,It was worthwhile to write about a truly good horror movie.,8,3 January 2003,"I rarely enjoy modern horror films because they always seem to fall flat at the end.  Dog Soldiers is simply the best that I have seen in a long time! The fact it was an English film made it all the more plausible. The atmosphere was perfect and the soldiers seemed so believable, almost as if they were filming a documentary at times. Sean Pertwee as the Sergeant was the archetypal leader of men and was such a contrast to the evil Captain Ryan.  The werewolves were excellent, so much better than others from previous films of the same genre. I must mention that it is a very gory film, does not leave anything to the imagination - but so what,  once in a while a bit of blood and guts  is okay providing people know what to expect. Anyway it was not gratuitous the plot needed the gore. Go see this movie and enjoy. It is a thriller which in my view  has an excellent, unforeseable ending that will not leave the audience wondering why they bothered to sit through it.",Dog Soldiers
237,KelticKarma,Army Pants,1,24 October 2002,"MINOR SPOILERSThis film is a very good example of why a lot of British films are not taken seriously outside the UK.What we have here is a mish-mash of ""American Werewolf in London"", ""Predator"", ""Alien"", ""Blair Witch"", and ""Way out West"". And it just doesn't work, sorry.A team of RADA (Posh English Acting School) rejects are dropped into the Highlands of Scotland (pretending) to be soldiers on an exercise. These (pretend) soldiers have no radio or medic (!), are apparently equipped with no live ammo (as is standard on a Trainer), and they have no night-sights. Big mistake - the director's that is, not theirs.Now things get interesting. We leave the nice aerial shots of the real Scottish Highlands behind, to be replaced by what is obviously an English Woodland Park. The director has to save money, you shout ! Well, fair enough, but aren't we paying him ?Then things get really scary. No, not the plot, which is as predictable as rain on Friday. At their first camp, a dead cow is slung at them. Private Hardman takes a look at it and says ""those aren't entry wounds, they're claw marks"". You would expect some perturbation at this stage from the poor RADA squaddies, but no; instead they decide to bed down for the night, with no further examination of just WHY a dead cow has been thrown on their campfire. No guards posted, no search of the area. This level of reality is relentlessly pursued throughoutYou may now say to me, well, this is billed as a thriller, and also a ""black comedy"" - wasn't this scene meant to be comedic ? NO. The words ""black comedy"" are overused in British film. They are employed to fight off criticism of this type, which says ""This film is no good"", by impliedly responding ""well, it was meant to be funny"". Think of pulling the chair away as your Granny sits down to her birthday lunch - you get the idea. There was nothing intentionally funny about this disaster.And the film just goes from bad to worse.No-one thinks to ask just what manner of beings the attacking creatures are, none of the RADA misfits seems to be in the least surprised to be under attack from other RADA misfit ""werewolves"" (in the worst costumes you've seen since the Muppets); there is no surprise when they are rescued by a bonny lassie (with a nice English RADA accent) and taken to a ........ wait for it.... deserted farmhouse. Need I say more ? I hope not. I think we all grasped the plot within three seconds.What really annoyed me about this film is this; I didn't expect to see a Schmoozeberg movie, with high production values, good acting, believable interaction between the ""actors"" etc, but what I DID expect to see was a good comedy take on the films I mentioned above. This is how the film was advertised, and advertised very strongly, I might add.There is not one intentional comedy moment within this sad film. However, there are many unintentional laughs, to be derived from:(i) the acting: just watch it, you'll know what I mean (ii) the direction: even worse than Guy Ritchie -no suspense whatsoever (iii) the plot: ??? (iv) the people conned into investing in this howler.So inspired was I by this film, that I have arranged that my mates and I are going to do a remake. We have bought some sheepskin rugs, red felt-tip pens, and old army surplus gear. Bet we make a better film !!British cinema deserves better than this.1/10",Dog Soldiers
238,dementia13,I'm never going in the woods again,8,1 October 2004,"This is one of the best werewolf films ever made, and one of the best horror films to come out recently. The only real knock against it is its predictability- you pretty well always know what's coming next. But that's more than made up for by its intensity. This is a very intense movie. People from the '40s talk about how much Lon Chaney's ""Wolf Man"" scared them: well, if this movie had come out in the '40s, people wouldn't have been able to deal with it. They would have just dropped dead in the theaters, and the film would have been banned. The werewolves in this movie are much more swift, powerful, and savage than anything seen previously, and partially-consumed victims mean a very high gore level. Plot? Not much to speak of: just survive the night, and no twists that you won't see coming. When you consider how much this movie telegraphs all its punches, it's amazing how scary and suspenseful it still winds up being. The quality of the dialogue and character development are more in line with a good war movie than with most horror movies. The characters feel real and speak very naturally. If you've got the guts for this movie (and you'll see plenty of guts in it), you'll love it. Just don't make my mistake, and watch it at midnight and have to walk the dog afterwards, if you live next to the woods.",Dog Soldiers
239,Fuzzbomb,Woof!,7,26 May 2002,"British werewolf movies seem to have a strong pedigree (pun not intended), what with Company of Wolves, An American Werewolf in London (sort of British, anyway) and the 70's oddity The Beast Must Die.  All of the above have a sivable twist on the genre, and Dog Soldiers is no exception.Sadly it doesn't really live up to it's promise fully, It's got it's share of amusing lines (mostly down to the British slang, which I'm hoping will introduce the word 'Tw*t' to a wider audience), decent gore, and some half-decent monsters.  Despite this it really does go on for too long when the protagonists reach an abandoned farmhouse, and unkillable werewolves, despite the non-stop shooting and screaming, do wear a little thin after a while.Still, it's always nice to see a well-made British genre film, albeit one with no real horror.",Dog Soldiers
240,ronansdad,could have been a classic,3,9 September 2007,"it could have been great, but it is let down it is not the macho soldiers with guns being gun ho blokes, in fact shawn makes an excellent sargent and the lads are sadly very believable.its not the half man / half border collie, although they could have kept a little mystery but the lack of cgi was good its not the sound track, the score sounds expensive the problem is ego.well , maybe but the writer and director being one and the same always seems to cause problems. the lack of plot is the writers fault, the first part was very good. (except for some very dodgy post production. There is a button on avid to do automatic colour correction, and do not do night shots with blue skies, do them with diffusing cloud. but hey what do I know?). The second part was predictable, how much action can you squeeze into a cottage? And the comedy was so lame. But it could have been great if the Ego had asked others what they thought.

This idea that dogs are so sacred in the western culture that it is better to feed, house and clothe one that it is to help a fellow human being. True my disgusts comes from real-world examples and this is just a move but gawd!I saw the review by the Critical Drinker on YT and decided to check it out.

Films like Dog Soldiers and 28 Days Later are a good display of the desires of a more exclusive, discerning and mature audience to view quality horror films.I will not attempt to summarize the narrative behind this film (as it has been done in other reviews and member comments), but it is sufficient to say that although not 100% original, it is nevertheless a refreshing and surprising re-take on the werewolf genre and I fully applaud the director's and actors' courage and skill in undertaking this roller-coaster of a film.A great British werewolf movie!",Dog Soldiers

244,Billius44,On careful consideration - pretty much the best werewolf film ever.,8,12 September 2004,"Why is Aliens the best action SF film ever? One of the reasons is because James Cameron took the time to build up the characters in the squad to the point where you actually cared when the grunts started to get shredded.Dog Soldiers does exactly the same, and features some great Brit dialogue to boot.The region 2 DVD features an extra commentary not found on the Region 1 DVD - basically this consists of the director, the co-producer, Kevin McKidd, Sean Pertwee and Liam Cunningham getting hammered on Stella Artois and producing a brilliantly funny commentary which sounds like a bunch of mates getting drunk while watching the movie. Which was exactly what it was, except that this particular bunch of mates actually made the movie. Genius!!! Liam Cunningham - spectacularly stiff upper-lipped and evil in the film - turns out to be a very droll Irishman with the gift of the gab. ""The Uamhunn.... The Uamhunn.....""One of the film's strengths is its gritty portrayal of British infantry in action, both in word and deed. I particularly enjoyed the cast commenting on how much they relished dumping those ""crappy plastic guns"" (the SA-80s the squad carries at the start) and getting a chance to charge about with MP5s. As Kevin McKidd put it: ""So, you want me to run about the woods with a machine-gun, firing it all over the place. And I get PAID for this?!!""",Dog Soldiers

Story is a little weird, but any horror or werewolf movie fan will like it i think.  Its sorta a evil dead type of feel to the movie, not a strong way, but some resemblance to the way it was done. Some people will flat out hate it im sure, but being a tv movie on sci-fi and as far as i know only coming out on dvd, it was a nice surprise. not sure if it made the movies in europe.",Dog Soldiers
246,claytonators,What do you get when 'Assault On Precinct 13' meets ' American Werewolf In London'?,10,25 November 2007,"You Get this! The best darn Werewolf movie ever! DOG SOLDIERS revolves around a squad of British soldiers on a training mission in the Scottish highlands. Soon strange things start happening. They encounter a badly wounded Special Operations officer, whom they take with them. Attacked by werewolves, the squad suffers the first casualties but manages to make a narrow escape with the help of a young woman. After reaching a remote farm, things turn from bad to worse when their car is destroyed by their furry foes. Besieged, with no radio or phone connection, desperately trying not to panic and running out of ammo, a fierce fight ensues with the almost invincible werewolves.This film draws inspiration from the very best elements of many horror/SF films and successsfully wraps them around a lycanthropic theme. The werewolves are top notch---some of the very best ever depicted on screen (no kidding...and no CGI, either! )---and the acting is superb. What a rare and wondrous combination to find a film that simultaneously forces the viewer to love its antagonists (in this case, the lycanthropes)and identify with the very human protagonists (the soldiers). This is a remarkable effort, and I can only hope to see a sequel of equal intensity in the near future. As far as effects go, It's ""Assault On Precinct 13"" meets ""An American Werewolf in London"" and a refreshing twist of everything in between. Truly inspired horror for die-hard genre fans and casual viewers alike.P.S. I must also mention that there are no bloody teens in this movie either. I think some of the film makers in the US should take a look at what the British are doing with their horrors and take some notes. 10/10 Excellent",Dog Soldiers
247,ZombieFlanders,"Finally, a new & original werewolf movie.",8,17 May 2004,"Lycanthrope lovers rejoice! With a genre that can be so hit and miss, it's refreshing to say that director, Neil Marshall, has made a film that will appeal to werewolf lovers and flat out horror lovers equally.There certainly are a handful of nay-sayers about this low budget flick, but any true horror fan will recognise that viewed within it's genre and with it's budget constraints in mind, this is a great achievement. It's necessary to mention that a film that (so obviously) ultimately develops into a massive 'Night of the Living Dead/Evil Dead' homage is still one that has it's own 'feel' and energy enough to stamp it as a true original within the genre. That'd be the werewolf genre.I won't go into the plot too much as that's what the synopsis here is for, but I will say that Neil Marshall (a lover of WW films judging by his comments on the DVD) has assembled a cracking cast and the script is quite easily one the best within the genre in the year of it's release. Amazingly funny at times and with the acting top level (regardless of a lack of a big name star) this really is one of those rare horror films these days that is actually one where, leaving your brain at the door is a NOT a positive thing and is populated by believable, convincing characters that you WILL get behind and are not just 'cannon fodder' so to speak.What really nails it is the fact that (apart from the opening scene) you taken fully into the world of the 'soldier' before it establishes itself as balls-to-the-wall action/horror - which it most certainly becomes - it very effectively involves you with the initial characters and their background, and then all of a sudden your with them, fighting truly monstrous beasts.So my final word will go to the beasts themselves, then, 'cause their look, for me, is truly an original look for a werewolf film. They're not straight up dogs (like some films), nor do they look like simple, two legged dingos. People complain they look low budget, but the effect when they finally get full screen treatment is none the less startling anyway. NOBODY has done a decent CGI werewolf yet, so until that can be done, these are really a treat for a fan. I'd liked 'Ginger Snaps' a lot, but this I feel, is a better werewolf movie...damn these Brits, along with the very impressive '28 Days Later', they've proven, they KNOW how to make horror and are a definite pony to bet on come the future of great horror movie-making!8 out of 10.",Dog Soldiers

250,JustinK-2,This is what I call a werewolf movie!,8,30 May 2002,"A British movie that doesn't have a luvvie in sight, a horror movie without CGI or teenagers; how can it possibly succeed? Well it succeeds through having good characters, great atmosphere and real edge of the seat tension. And quite a lot of blood!This is what I call a werewolf movie! This film doesn't hark back to the Hammer days but looks instead to more recent action horror movies for its inspiration; this film is much more Aliens than Alien. In fact the film can be likened, sometimes too closely, to Aliens with the former even paying homage to the latter with a 'counting the ammo' scene and call for ""short controlled bursts"" which again (of course) goes unheeded. Replace the colony complex with a claustrophobic farmhouse in Scotland (actually shot Luxembourg) and the aliens with werewolves. Add a non-Hollywood edge (you have a lot less idea of who is likely to be next), stir in couple of small twists and mix with a good amount of dark and 'military forces' type humour and you've got a fair idea of the basic outline. Oh, and talking of humour, look out for the in-joke of the piano piece that gets played  - answer at the end of this review if you don't want to work it out yourself!The characterisations are well rendered, though a little clichéd, with each of the soldiers coming across as tough, though believable, people each standing out in their own way so you actually cared about whether they lived or died. This was backed up by good acting by a cast that seemed to me to have been given very good advice on how real soldiers spoke and acted. Watch out especially for Sean Pertwee [51st State] as the experienced sergeant, Kevin McKidd [Trainspotting] as the Special Forces reject and Darren Morfitt [Grafters] as squaddie 'Spoons'. Even the weapons handling seemed to be, for once, realistic (something that I, for one, really appreciated).
Of course it wasn't perfect ... many have commented on the similarities to other films, though they often disagree on which films - Aliens, Evil Dead, Assault on Precinct 13, Southern Comfort; actually it doesn't sound like a bad set of films to be compared to does it? Being an independent they didn't have the massive budget for state-of-the-art special effects, though they did a damn good job with what they had and good direction and camerawork helped add to the threat of the creatures - no CGI here though excellent use of surround sound! No depth was gone into about the why's and how's of the werewolves and some scenes didn't seem to flow as well as they could though it this seemed to me to be where some cuts had been made for pacing and really didn't detract that much. I wonder if the DVD will reveal more ... and come out in at least 5.1 for that great sound... and retain a 15 certificate despite the realistic language and large amounts of blood!Whether, as is often the problem with horror and thriller movies, it works as well a 2nd or 3rd time around I don't know. The tension of who'll live, who'll die and what happens next will of course diluted by prior knowledge, but I think that this film is as much up to the challenge of repeat viewing as Aliens or any of the films it's been compared to. Whatever the result it's definitely worth going to see at least once!You really can't ask for much more from an action horror movie than this; real bite.8/10

From the off, the movie is riddled with ridiculous swearing for no reason and the actors are useless. I was trying to remember where I heard the name Neil Marshall before, and during the film I recognized the directors 'style'. He also directed that excuse for a movie, 'The Descent' which I shelled out 20 quid on! As with it, the acting was absolutely woeful with useless special effects. The storyline wasn't up to much either. I don't know who gives this guy money to make movies, but they are wasting their time... and ours! You'd find a greater sense of drama in watching an episode of 'Rug rats'. Terrible acting, awful dialect.... Excessive Swearing is used primarily to try and create drama, and fails miserably! Basically, just about as good as all of Marshall's other films..... it's Horrific alright, but for all the wrong reasons! I'd say 'The Times' had a field day with their review for this movie.

Being from Britain i think its fair to say that i hate the film industry in this country. They get good ideas and absolutely ruin them. In this case, its possibly trying to be every other movie around. Firstly it mimics Predator, Evil Dead, Jaws, aghhhh, i cant continue or i'll drown myself in disgust. It was like an episode of Casualty gone wrong. It was so pathetic, it didnt even have me laughing at its untalented story and style. Even TROLL 2 did that. What is wrong with my industry?? If its not films about coal miners, sappy rom-coms its rubbish like this which is basically british film makers trying to be american film makers. Which is almost as ridiculous as the film.

I am very glad that I did. This is the best werewolf film since the original Howling!

It is a real shame that this film did not manage to get a theatrical release. I look forward to what director Neil Marshall has in store for us next!",Dog Soldiers
259,nate878,A well-done werewolf film executed to terrifying effect,10,29 October 2009,"(only mild spoilers involving aspects of the film)The werewolf genre doesn't usually yield classics but they do come occasionally every decade or so. Finally, Dog Soldiers serves up to being another memorable lycnathropic experience that hasn't graced audiences since the days of American Werewolf in London and The Howling. It's also among the few films to capitalize on the potential fear factor of the werewolf genre by implementing not one but an entire pack of intimidating wolf-men. Helping this fear factor, is the fact that the squadron of soldiers that play victim throughout the film are not only memorable but likable, adding to the sense of fear as you concern over characters such as the genuinely likable and comedic character Spoon. Further exaltations could be on the focus on realistic and well-crafted make-up and suit designs over the usually impractical use of cg. The werewolves effectively project all the scariest aspects of a wolf and a powerful anthro-morph with the use of proper design and animatronics, although the head designs were at times easily recognized as being too big in some scenes. No transformation scenes were implemented but they would've slowed down the otherwise fast, action-packed pace of the film.Ultimately the combination of smart, likable characters and truly deadly beasts presents an otherwise near-perfect action-horror film complete with the themes of comradery and the aspect of humanity that separates one from their savage tendencies.",Dog Soldiers
260,armo_852,There is no spoon!,8,15 November 2003,"POTENTIAL SPOILERS Horror in the past couple of years has really struggled. It has had to resort to remaking classics (Texas Chainsaw Massacre)or trying to combine horror icons into one picture (Freddy v Jason). Some of these can be good but they can never go down in history as landmark horror like the films that inspired them.Dog Soldiers is not a classic but it does what it sets out to achieve sublimely. This film is totally original and brilliantly British. There are countless references to other great movies from 'The Evil Dead' (the closing shot through the doorway) to the ingenious 'Matrix' quote, 'there is no Spoon' when the character Spoon is splattered all over the cottages kitchen.Neil Marshall's first flick deserves much praise for cleverly combining horror and comedy as other films have done so well in the past (Scream, the first and best at doing this, The Faculty, which included sci-fi as well, and even the near perfect Donnie darko, which had so many genres it was a baffling masterpiece). 'Deathwatch',with a fellow first time Brit directing, tried almost exactly the same formula as this and certainly failed as he couldn't to create tension and had characters you basically couldn't care if they lived or died.The acting is first rate,particularly Mckidd and the ever excellent Sean Pertwee, and this helps to create characters us British can really relate to. I'm not surprised it was not received too well in the States as the British values, such as football, shine through on numerous occasions. Immensely enjoyable 8/10",Dog Soldiers

""Dog Soldiers"" is a testosterone-fueled film with an interesting assortment of characters and some good monsters, a nice remote setting and a whole lot of blood and guts (""sausages!?"") - and all for just a fraction of the cost of the SFX-loaded, big-budget bombs which are force-fed to American horror lovers.  This was a labor of love for Neil Marshall and it shows.  He directed, wrote and edited the film; and more than likely came up with the terrific tagline, ""Six soldiers... Full moon... No chance.""  With a more impacting and memorable title, this ""Dog"" might have been a bigger hit here in the States.  (""Night of the Werewolves"" was also considered and it wasn't much better.)",Dog Soldiers

There was a lot of cheese and cliches as someone else said but they added to what this film was, pure, genuine and memorable entertainment. It wasnt trying to be anything else, from the opening to the end i was laughing, jumping out of my seat and almost shouting 'Yes!' at certain times. I love these smaller films were you can tell the cast and crew enjoyed themselves whilst filming not knowing how much money they would make and purely doing it because they want to, not because someone told them to. Of the films out at the minute i couldnt recommend this more, its scarier than 'Panic Room and' funnier than 'Showtime'...have to wait till Thursday for a certain space wars or something film to come out to see if its my fave of the month! Anyway, a must see for all horror/comedy fans, and anyone fed up with boring films that dont go anywhere, overall 8/10. Lets have some more of these boys!!",Dog Soldiers

265,thecrow22,Truly a Great Movie.,10,21 October 2006,"On quite a few occasions I have caught bits and pieces of Dog Soldiers on the SciFi network thinking the movie had some potential, but not seeing enough of it, I could never say that I liked or disliked the movie.While browsing Blockbuster I came across the DVD of the movie, and remembered the bits and pieces that I had seen and figured that I might as well give the rest of the movie a chance. Well, did I hit the jackpot. The overall plot of the movie is that a small squad of British Soldiers are on a training exercise in the forests of Scotland. They find a special ops squad campsite completely torn up and bloody, with one survivor. They are stalked through the forest by werewolves and are found by a woman who takes them to a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere. In a nutshell, the have to stay there for safety, but need to find a way out.The special effects(if you want to call them that) are for the most part on the cheesy side, as I couldn't see any sort of CG work. While not too realistic, the effects didn't hurt the movie much, if at all.The acting was phenomenal, each soldier had their own personality and most definitely showed it. The dialogue is one of the shining aspects of Dog Soldiers. The conversations between the soldiers, however meaningless the are and how ever little they have to do with the actual plot, are made to seem important, and can be quite a comedic break at times when it is getting a bit intense.Dog Soldiers is a movie that any horror fan can enjoy. Easily one of my favorites of the genre.",Dog Soldiers
266,rich_jc,Don't believe the hype,1,10 May 2002,"I went to the cinema with an open mind having heard nothing about the movie but came out thinking I had seen one of the worst movies of all time. Some of the acting was terrible, the script was even worse (there are several possible nominees for ""the worst movie line ever""). If you're into badly made no-brainer movies then this is for you.",Dog Soldiers
267,roger_for_nntp,"Not suitable for Americans, otherwise pretty funny.",7,23 March 2003,"Since ""The Howling"" series there has been something of a tradition that werewolf movies should be cheesy black comedies, and this movie is no exception - which isn't to say there's anything wrong with that, as I quite enjoyed ""Dog Soldiers"". However, judging from previous American reaction on IMDB to British films, I expect this movie to do badly in America simply because most Americans will understand neither the accents nor the style of black humour. This is a pity because this movie is pretty darn funny.I have worked with British soldiers, and I have to say that the language and characterisations are spot on, but pretty well everything else military in this movie is completely off beam. To give just one glaring example, in the British Army the small subunit we see is called a 'section' not a 'squad' (or even platoon at one point!), and is led by a corporal, not a sergeant. The reason these sorts of things are significant is that there are, in fact, a number of clues in this movie as to what is going on, but it is difficult to interpret them when each 'clue' could just as easily be a scriptwriter's error.On the minus side, the werewolves looked pretty good but the werewolf transformations (via a couple of scene cuts!) were 1950's standard. ""Werewolf-night-vision-cam"" effect was nice, but why did they have to keep reusing the same footage - surely this effect could not have been expensive.Finally a couple of quick rebuttals: Superglue really is used as an emergency wound suture. I have no idea if it was used in Vietnam, but at the local emergency clinic they use it especially on small children and the elderly, to avoid suturing very soft skin.Secondly, the dog was not tugging on Wells' intestines: it's a bandage. The director has had to come out to explain this but frankly I thought it was obvious, since it looks like cloth. It's amazing how many people jump to conclusions.",Dog Soldiers

Dog Soldiers was released in the UK in 2002 and never made it to a theater release in the United States. I don't know why, but we all missed out due to that decision in this short lived, one-time franchise. (I say franchise because I can hope, can't I?) This is one of the best low budget monster movies I've ever seen and it furthers it's own genre. It's superbly written to showcase the desperate battle of the characters as they fight to survive as long as possible.The monsters are portrayed in a mix of shadows, outlines, steaming bodies at the edge of the light. In what I think is the perfect presentation, after being teased for a while, we get to see them full on in the light and these beasts are awesome for all their simplicity. (No CGI!) It's a great ride. It's on Sci-Fi every few weeks and it's worth the replay view.",Dog Soldiers
272,jon-gwynne,Excellent but could have been great...,9,8 January 2004,"I can't really say much about the content of the film that hasn't already been said.  Yes, there are no points for originality of plot in this film. But that actually a negative.  It is a homage made by a lover of horror/suspense movies FOR lovers of horror/suspense movies.  As such, it succeeds brilliantly.The acting is top notch - even characters who are killed early on get a chance to develop themselves and, consequently the audience begins to care about them.It is a scary, funny, touching and overall worthwhile film.  The only thing that bugs me is that it could have been one of The Greats.If there are any negatives here, they belong to the American producers. After listening to the producer's commentary on the US DVD-release, I now understand what I guessed about this film when I saw it in the the theater.It COULD have been great but the producers (especially the one who talks all the time during the commentary track - I think it was David E. Allen) seemed to be doing their level best to ruin it.Mr. Allen (or whoever was responsible for what I'm about to point out), this film could have been another ""Alien"", ""Terminator"" or ""Sixth Sense"".  It could have been a legend...  the sleeper horror film of the DECADE.  But you didn't have faith in the script, the director or your audience.  The over-the-top gore and you insistence on cutting key character-development scenes because you didn't understand them and because you wanted to hit this absurd 90 minute time target left this film a shadow of what it could have been.Do you know why ""Silence of the Lambs"" got recognized at Oscar time?  It wasn't because Anthony Hopkins is a great actor (he is, of course) but because the film had a director who knew how to tell the story without resorting to cheap tricks and producers who stayed the hell out of his way and let him do it.Your juvenile obsession with ""arterial spray"" and repeated insistence of ""more gore! more gore!"" not only cheapened this film but I bet you'll find that it closed doors for you in terms of getting a theatrical release.
(warning! spoilers ahead)Look at Alien.  The infamous ""chest-burster"" sequence was so horrendous because the rest of the film was almost devoid of bloodshed.  It is called ""contrast"" - have a filmmaker explain it to you if you don't understand what I mean.If you had come up with one or two real shockers near the end and left the other attacks more along the lines of the attack on Ryan, more emphasis could have remained on the tension.  Just as you claim to believe CGI detracts from the atmosphere and story, so does childishly-overdone gore.
When you showed Sgt. Wells' guts out, you were telling your audience that you thought they were too stupid to imagine the details of a mortal gut-wound and that audience is left thinking ""That looks like a handful of leftovers from a butcher's counter lying on his belly - how fake!"" and the horror they should be feeling is not only diluted but they are reminded how low the budget for this film was.Think how horrific that scene would have been if we had been allowed to imagine his guts out rather than being shown some old meat scraps lying on his uniform.You know what the best scene in the film was?  The transformation of Captain Ryan.  Why?  Because we never actually see it happen.  It is merely alluded to and that is enough.  Another is when Sgt. Wells mutely loads his pistol during Megan's final speech.  We KNOW he knows what's coming and it never has to be pointed out to us.Anyway, if it hadn't been for the stellar cast and crew to rescue it, it would have been garbage.  This film wasn't great because of you, it was great in spite of you.You owe us a director's cut at the very least.Whoever you are, I sincerely hope you learn from the mistakes you made on this film.  If you can, you can go on to produce a great film someday. If not, well... Hollywood is filled with producers who don't trust writers and directors as well as the writers and directors who hate them...",Dog Soldiers
273,kaelnin-1,"Nothing Unique or Original, but Still Very Good",8,17 June 2002,"To start off, my biggest regret about this movie is since I live in the United States, I had to see it on the Sci-Fi channel in Pan & Scan instead of seeing it on the big screen. I am sure they edited out more than language (thankfully, they did such a bad job with editing that the dialog lost none of its snap, just the occasional missing word that was fairly easy to figure out). Now on to the review. While the film borrowed heavily from such movies as ""Aliens"" and ""Assault on Precinct 13"", not to mention ""Evil Dead 2"", I still really liked it. What separated it from most other films in the genre was the fact that it had witty dialog and great interaction between the characters. It also had a decent amount of twists and turns (some of which I saw coming, but even when they happened I found myself thinking they were still very clever), and once it started, it never slowed down. The tension on screen was also very riveting, and the fight sequences between the soldiers and the werewolves were tightly edited and as realistic as could be believed. I truly loved one scene in particular where a soldier cornered in the kitchen of the house the soldiers make their stand in by a werewolf uses everything he can grab as a weapon to beat the stuffing out of one of the creatures. Having been in the Army and having gone on many training exercises myself, I sympathized with the group's original plight of missing a big football game by having to go out in the first place, and their original attitude of not taking the whole exercise seriously. The initial fear and confusion over what they were up against was handled very well, especially as they were running around in the woods with no idea as to what was chasing them. While initially it leaves many more questions than answers, it does a very good job of wrapping them up by the end of the film. At first I was a bit upset that they didn't do a very good job showing off the creatures at the beginning of the film, but the gradual reveal goes well, explaining more about them before you actually see them, almost as if like the soldiers, you initially have no idea what they are up against, and when you find out you start to realize the hopelessness of the situation they are in. The only other real comment is that while I heard this film was supposed to be a comedy, there were only a few scenes that I was actually laughing at. And I don't mean that in a bad way. It was just so tense at times that I found it hard to lighten up when you realize that letting down one's guard could result in jumping at the next scare. To end, I would like to say while that this movie will never win an Oscar, an overall solid and believable performance by the great cast and lots of well-paced action make this movie well worth seeing if you are an action or horror fan. I pray that the Sci-Fi channel will release it on DVD, or at least some one will in a Region 1 format, so that I can see it unedited or at least a theatrical version of it, and hopefully in widescreen. It ranks as one of the best werewolf films ever made, and while I may hate myself in the morning for saying this, it was even better than last year's ""Ginger Snaps"", another cool take on the werewolf myth.",Dog Soldiers
274,kaelnin-1,A pleasant surprise,8,2 April 2004,"When I first heard about this movie on www.aintitcool.com, it was described as Aliens with Werewolves.Naturally, I had to see it.Boy, was I surprised.First of all, it was a movie that relied more on prosthetic effects and men in suits than CGI. Considering the state of the industry, that is almost like going back to the Bronze Age and taking the chariot to work instead of driving in your car. Admittedly, the effects are not ground-breaking or overly impressive. A lack of any real transformation sequence is kind of a let down, but when you are on a shoe-string budget you make due with what you can. Also, the gore kind of gets a bit out of hand in points, especially when bodies are ripped limb from bloody limb. Not that it is bad thing, but it is not for the very squeamish.And I had also recently heard that British actor Jason Statham of Snatch'd and The Transporter fame was up for the role of Cooper, played in the film by Kevin McKidd. Too bad for Statham, because these guys looked like they were having a ball making this picture.What makes this film work for me is the dynamic of the cast. As I stated, these guys looked like they were having one hell of a good time making this movie, and they meshed well on screen. Their good humor was infectious, because I had a blast watching it and I felt genuine sorrow when each and every one met their bloody end. And when I made the rounds to show it off to my friends, they had a great time watching it as well.
The story centers on Private Cooper (Kevin McKidd), a soldier in the British Army who wants to join the Special Forces. I am assuming they mean the S.A.S. (Special Air Service), for that is the only British Special Forces I ever heard of, but what do I know. I am not from Britain. When Cooper fails to finish his final exam by refusing a command from Captain Ryan (Liam Cunningham) to execute a dog that had cornered him during a training exercise, he humiliates Ryan by punching him when the Captain shoots the dog in front of him and he is sent back to his unit. Unfortunately for him, Ryan is not very forgiving, and when a team of soldiers is needed for ""bait"" to hunt a very special quarry in the Highlands of Scotland, Ryan pulls strings and has Cooper and his squad ""volunteered"" for the assignment.Enter Sergeant Harry Wells (Sean Pertwee) and his six man squad of infantry soldiers. Wells' second in command is Corporal Bruce Campbell (played by Thomas Lockyer and named for The Man himself, Bruce ""The Chin"" Campbell), and the four riflemen are Cooper, Witherspoon (Darren Morfitt), Joe (Chris Robson), and Terry (Leslie Simpson). Right away we feel for these guys as Joe announces he has much better things to do than be in the woods playing war games as the most important soccer match in his life is on the tellie that night. Wells rallies the men together, gives a hilarious motivational speech about what to do should they encounter the enemy (which they assume is Ryan's special ops team), and off they go.Things take a turn for the worst as strange happenings befall them. From Cooper's humorous tale of something causing hikers to disappear in this neck of the wilderness to a fireside surprise as the troops encounter a dying bovine, we know where this is heading. Sure enough, they stumble upon what is left of Ryan's encampment and the nearly dead Ryan, who is babbling incoherently about there only supposed to have been one. Wells' interrogation to find out one what is cut short by an unearthly scream coming from the rapidly darkening forest and the action starts in earnest.After fleeing Ryan's camp, the squad encounters and is saved by Megan, a lovely young zoologist who lives in a nearby glen. She takes them to a friend's farmhouse to escape the terror in the forest, only to be surround Assault on Precinct 13 style by a pack of werewolves.What follows is a throughly enjoyable horrorfest that fully embraces the rules of lycanthropy while adding some interesting twists to it. It becomes a desperate fight for survival to just make it to the sunrise in a house cut off from the outside world and being attacked by a supernatural threat. The action sequences are well executed and the dialog is often witty and full of nods to other genre films from Zulu to the Matrix. The performances all around stand out, and no one's talent is wasted. While Kevin McKidd did a stand out job here (I had only seen him as Tommy in Trainspotting before and he did a hilarious turn as a Scottish rock musician in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), I was glad to see Sean Pertwee, who is often given a lack of due respect as an actor, shining bright as Wells. A former soldier myself, I would have followed him to hell and back with his performance as Wells, a man out for his men first and putting their safety ahead of his. McKidd's Cooper is a realist who doesn't believe in the supernatural, even when he is confronting it head on, and doesn't panic under the stress of facing off against something he doesn't understand. Cooper is a survivor who thinks on his feet, and McKidd is admirable in the role.I have heard rumors that there is a possible sequel to this film in the works. I fear that any sequel to this movie would not do the original justice, and those who are involved with the potential sequel will have big hurdles to overcome if they want to make it as charming, witty, and appealing as this movie was.I would rate this movie 8/10, failing to get a higher score only for the fact that I feel as a lycanthropic film, at least one full transformation sequence should have been on screen. However, the money more than likely did not allow it, and the director (Neil Marshall) did a very good job with what he had to work with. Thoroughly enjoyable.",Dog Soldiers
275,statto4ever,A British Werewolf film that bites.,8,18 June 2002,"Dog Soldiers is the kind of British film that almost never gets made. For a kick off it's a genre film and the only kind of film British studios seem to want to make are either costume dramas or another 'Bridget Jones' style comedy. So it's all the more refreshing when something like Dog Soldiers comes along from a UK studio. Shot in Luxembourg, but set in the Scottish Highlands (Most likely because of the UK's silly taxes on shooting in this country, Braveheart was filmed in Ireland.) Dog Soldiers takes the baton from last years 'Ginger Snaps' and continues the rebirth of the Werewolf movie genre. Debut director Neil Marshall has taken his ludicrously low budget and crafted one of the finest Werewolf films since 'An American Werewolf In London.' Forced through budget constraints to use practical effects for the beasts and shoot them in low light and with fleeting glances past the camera. This style makes them all the more effective and about ten times more convincing than the terrible CGI animals that were created for 'An American Werewolf In Paris'.Marshall creates a real claustrophobic feel for the film and drips it in atmosphere. The early scenes in the forest are frenetic, with fast moving camera's that leave the viewer breathless, trying to keep up with the action. The later scenes in the house slow down as we (and the army team) are given brief respite from the beasts. However when they strike again the ferocity is ramped up and the viewer is again bombarded with high paced action.The many action set pieces are handled well and a good bit of originality and invention has been used to lift the film above standard horror fare. The film boasts a wicked twist in the tail (pun intended), that I certainly did not see coming. It's a nice touch that completely alters the last half hour of the film. I thought I had the ending pegged, but my assumptions were turned on their head by this plot turn.Marshall's script is sharp and witty, stuffed with many genre references and sly, cheesy one liners. Sure, the plot borrows heavily from the likes of Aliens, Predator and The Evil Dead, but the director clearly has a great love for these films (One character is called Bruce Campbell). The film is definitely more of a schlock, comedy horror affair as apposed to straight out horror. Gore and blood are thrown about with wanton abandon and the practical effects are very impressive given the films uber-low budget.Again probably more an effect of the low budget than anything, the cast is made up for the most part by unknowns. A relief for me as I hate nothing more than watching a British film and spotting about a dozen soap opera actors peppered throughout the cast. Aside from Sean Pertwee and Kevin Mckidd, I had not seen any of the actors before. The quality of acting is very impressive for this genre of film. The camaraderie in the army unit is very convincing, you actually believe that these guys have lived together and fought together. So when one of them is killed the viewer feels it as much as the other members of the unit.I'm not a big fan of Sean Pertwee, he was in the risible 'Soldier' and has been in a few Brit-stinkers in his career. He goes a long way to redeeming himself here though. His work as 'the sarge' is very good and he delivers his many funny lines well and shows a previously untapped potential for comedy. The cry of 'sausages' is as funny as it is disgusting. Star of the show however is Kevin Mckidd. The last time I saw this guy was as Renton's doomed weightlifting buddy in 'Trainspotting'. He gives a commanding performance here and I expect big things from him after this film.It's a real shame that Dog Soldiers has not secured a US distribution deal. And, it looks increasingly unlikely that it will either, as it was recently shown on the US Sci-Fi channel (albeit in a severely cut form). I urge all in the US to track down a copy of this film, you will not be disappointed in this ironic and fresh take on the werewolf movie genre.8/10 for Dog Soldiers.",Dog Soldiers
276,IanTheGenius,One of the best films of the year,10,12 May 2002,"I have to say that this is the best film I've seen in the cinema since ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"". I haven't seen ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" yet though (it seems popular to have colons in movie titles these days).Earlier this year I developed this strange love for classic horror films. It's clear to see that the films that have made the most impact on cinema are low-budget/high-terror horror films that have occasionally cropped up from the pile-of-s**te Hollywood ""event"" films that come out every week. ""Dog Soldiers"" is truly one of those rare gems among the jagged rocks that will remain a classic for years to come.This film is deliberately reminiscent of many films in the past: ""Zulu"" (""This reminds me of Rourkes Drift""); ""The Evil Dead"" (One of the characters is called Bruce Campbell and he meets his end in a gruesome way that involves a tree); the list goes on. This doesn't detract from the film at all. Through all its references it is never once derivative. The naturalistic dialogue makes us believe that the characters in the film are as aware of these references as we are.Geordie director Neil Marshall's first feature is nothing short of excellent and I will be watching his career with great interest. Hmmm... that was a Star Wars quote. It seems that this is going to be a good year for films. With ""Spiderman"" coming in June and ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" coming in December, and let's not forget the occasional rare gem .....like ""Dog Soldiers"" for example.

279,a_forbes,A fun little movie,7,12 August 2004,"Dog Soldiers is a fun little horror movie that accomplishes what it sets out to do. It borrows heavily from other films, but it is all done in such loving fashion that we forgive it as homage rather than theft. What it lacks in originality and plot it makes up for in energy and fun-factor. The story is this: a small group of British soldiers are on manoeuvres in the Scottish wilderness and get attacked by werewolves. That's essentially it. What follows is a fairly straightforward chase/barricade movie with a lupine twist. Think Night of the Living Dead with fleas. Some of the humour falls flat (one character seems to be written exclusively so that his name can be used for a rather lame pop-reference/one-liner) and a few of the story's contortions are poorly explained (Lon Chaney Jr. could jump through most of the plot holes, with room on both sides), but it's still a fun little flick with a shnazzy Brit feel. Best of all: the filmmakers understand that men in hairy costumes are more frightening when seen in heavy shadow and in fast cuts. Recommended for the horror fan with a spare bowl of popcorn.7/10",Dog Soldiers

What a fantastic experience.  Dog Soldiers is so well-crafted, exciting, funny, suspenseful, scary, and well-acted, it's a shame it didn't get U.S. distribution.  I can't WAIT for the DVD to come out in November.  One of the best horror (and werewolf) movies in years.  It was a thrill to see a really GOOD movie for a change, let alone a good horror movie!  I have nothing bad to say about Dog Soldiers.",Dog Soldiers
281,scawt,Restored my faith in horror movies.,9,25 December 2002,"Let's face it: Horror movies have been on a long slide downwards.  All of the 90's ""slasher"" films were boring, repetitive, and totally unimaginative. Dog Soldiers threw all that garbage away.  Werewolf movies are few and far between, and this really makes them something special.  See this movie, even if you are American, and can't understand it all the time; there's plenty of gore to entertain you.Oh yeah, and big surprise that it didn't come from Hollywood...",Dog Soldiers
282,PlayaHayta,Horrible fun...,8,27 July 2003,"This and ""Ginger Snaps"" have breathed new life into the werewolf genre. ""Dog Soldiers"" is a nice blend of humor, action, and horror.  The creature designs are damn good, but execution of the effect falls short.  This isn't too distracting, though, because they never give you a good clean look at the thing ala ""Jaws"" or ""Alien""...which I dig.Well directed, well shot, well played.Could use some naked chicks, though.",Dog Soldiers
283,pixelpusher2001,fright flick,9,5 January 2007,"I was looking forward to watch DOG SOLDIERS ever since I read a very favorable article about it in a British horror film magazine. When I spotted the DVD here on amazon, I immediately ordered it. DOG SOLDIERS revolves around a squad of British soldiers on a training mission in the Scottish highlands. Soon strange things start happening. They encounter a badly wounded Special Operations officer, whom they take with them. Attacked by werewolves, the squad suffers the first casualties but manages to make a narrow escape with the help of a young woman. After reaching a remote farm, things turn from bad to worse when their car is destroyed by their devilish furry foes. Besieged, with no radio or phone connection, desperately trying not to panic and running out of ammo, a fierce fight ensues with the almost invincible werewolves... WOW! WOW! And again WOW! To my point of view DOG SOLDIERS is one of the greatest horror films of all time, exceptionally well written, fast paced with a strong storyline and likable characters, who are not the mere monster fodder as usual. You actually care for the sympathetic guys ( with the exception of the special operations officer ). It is a real pleasure to watch a fright flick without the usual cast of annoying teens. I also found it refreshing that DOG SOLDIERS lacks the silly humor considered indispensable by so many directors. The plot is very inventive and makes good use of the locations. DOG SOLDIERS is relatively violent and gory (the disembowelment of the Sergeant made me wince) but it is not splatter for splatter's sake. And a horror movie without CGI is a real viewing pleasure in itself. Some remarks on the DVD: You can choose between a wide screen and a full frame presentation. As for extras, you have an audio commentary, a featurette and two trailers, the international and the domestic one. The international one is wide screen, quite good, but gives away too much of the film, while the domestic one is presented full screen and doesn't do the film justice.",Dog Soldiers
284,David-Kappel,great stuff,9,17 May 2006,I watched the movie and didn't expect anything. However it turned out to be a damn good horror flick with good actors and lots of action. Though the movie looks as if there wasn't much money spent on it that doesn't trouble the atmosphere. The storyline surprises the watcher a couple of times but everything seems to fit together. The ending is hell good and makes one feel glad - even a German ;) Everybody who'll watch this movie will feel sympathy for each member of the group. There's no meaningless victim in the movie. Everybody stands his ground and that's what makes watching the movie being so much fun! So go and watch it!,Dog Soldiers
285,nodisalsi,Who won? I'm still not sure ;),10,29 July 2005,"Upto a point in the film there seemed to be nothing new to expect from the werewolves - but the army boys were still full of surprises! In some respects - and in spite of the Army-style ""no chance"" advertising campaign in the run up to this movie - it becomes clear that both parties are pretty well matched! I don't know what was more scary - the werewolves or the squaddies. Because when it comes down to a square fight, the soldiers turn out to be as lunatic as the paranormals they were engaged against.BTW The term ""Dog Soldiers."" is reserved in the UK armed forces for the platoon of unwanted misfits, analogous I think, to the US use of the term ""Wild Card."" As for the patter between the soldiers and the tactics they employed, I will echo a comment made by someone who served in the army for 25+years: ""well researched.""",Dog Soldiers

It may have been because my tastes were different back then (i.e. I had no taste), or it could have been that this is the type of film you only watch once before you dislike it, but the second time I watched it, which was quite a long time after the first, I really didn't like it. There was about one good actor, the music didn't suit (although thats just my opinion) and it seemed to be more ""cheese"" than horror. But, I would recommend you watch this once, because you might like it, and I'm not keen on horrors anyway, so perhaps this film would be understood and enjoyed more by someone who does like horrors.In conclusion, a fairly poor film, a few chuckles, and lots of lovely gore!",Dog Soldiers

This is the best since 'An American Werewolf in London' and dont let anyone tell you otherwise. Ok 'Ginger Snaps' was good, and 'Brotherhood of the Wolf' is very good( Even though its a Lion!),'A Company of Wolves' a luscious, dark Fairytale, but if you want 'Aliens' with Werewolves, 'Dog Soldiers' is the business.Its scary, very Funny and the monsters are just what you want to see; Big, mean wolves on two legs.There's a plethora of great European character actors too. Kevin McKidd, Sean Pertwee and Liam Cunningham as good as they usually are in straight drama. It has an exciting opening, a gruelling middle and a tense finale. You also have some of the cheesiest one-liners, gory set-pieces, major firefights that add up to a Classic White knuckle 100 mins in the Cinema. I was lucky enough to see it at a test screening in Sept 2001. It will be a tragedy if this goes straight to Video. I'm sure in the States it will do well on the back of 'Brotherhood of the wolf'.",Dog Soldiers

291,maxxx-1,"Fun, but hardly great.",4,1 January 2008,"This is the classic example of a movie fun because of its sheer fun factor. The visual effects are mostly very badly done and consist of dozens of ""hairy clawed arm sticking out from a hole in the wall"" type shots, the ""villains"" prosthetics are clichéd through the roof, blood spatters around like ketchup from a bottle someone stepped on, tension and possible scare points are so typically placed that an avid horror fan could well guess them in advance... So, if not for the ""other ingredients"", the movie would be a very, very bad example of how a horror movie should not be done.And yet, this movie manages to somehow redeem itself... with true, classic, flawless British humour. There are multiple crowd-laughing-in-fits one-liners and numerous comic scenes almost bordering on slapstick. This movie is not a comedy, mind you, and yet these points add some undeniable flavour to the overall experience. How about newspaper cutouts reporting the movie story on the ending credits? Or, a character valiantly nailing a door shut, interrupted by a supposedly scary clawed arm entering through the mail hole, never breaking his hammering pace and just moving to bang on the arm instead of the nails? Oh, oh, and how about Matrix or Star Trek references? All in all - if you expect a good, scary werewolf horror movie, get ""The Wolf"". If you want a shallow teen slasher werewolf movie, get ""Cursed"". However, if you're out for a movie that may be mediocre, but needs to be well done in the tongue-in-cheek department, for a late night beer-and-popcorn couch session, ""Dog Soldiers"" is there for you.Still, I cannot fathom how this movie managed to get such ridiculously high ratings. It's a fun movie, true, but that's all it is - it's not too well acted, its visuals stink, its scenario is laughably bad, it's just ""fun"" and that's all there is to it. It shouldn't get past 4.5, and yet there it is in the almost-seven zone... One of the mysteries of the universe, I guess.",Dog Soldiers

I am not a particularly big horror fan and just picked it up at the video rental place as I liked the sound of the title. For a film I had never heard of before I was impressed. Very impressed. I just loved every minute of it, the characters were all quite convincing and come across so well you do actually like them (except for Ryan) and the werewolves actually looked scary and likely. I found this to be a refreshing change from the current vein of horror films (not American, no annoying teenagers etc...) Obviously there are comparisons made to Predator, Aliens and other films but the basic idea is not exactly fresh anyway, all the film makers could do was find a different edge to it. They succeded.

293,ZRambeau,Great Flick,8,28 May 2008,"This is one of the best Werewolf films ever produced. Its got a certain intangible swagger that muddles with an ""Aliens"" feel. Not just a horror film, Dog Soldiers is unflinching and brutal. There's really nothing like it in modern horror. The Werewolfs are absolutely macabre and the heroes are a rough and tumble group of soldiers who are trained to handle just about anything. Somewhere between telling war stories over a fire and the discovery of a ravaged animal the soldiers realize that there routine training mission has taken a turn for the worse.Not only will this film make you jump but it has great plot twists and even a not so subtle love story.

295,BooFez,This movie covers all the needs of a horror watcher and is highly recommended,10,26 April 2013,"I am a huge werewolf fan and have been for awhile. I stumbled across this movie looking through a bin at wal-mart and picked it up for $5. With the title being ""Dog Soldiers"" I wasn't expecting much, just another random low budget werewolf flick where you probably wouldn't even see the beast attacking. I was horribly mistaken. Dog Soldiers quickly became one of my top 5 werewolf films and my go to choice for a late night fix.Sarge (Sean Pertwee) takes his squad of men to the highlands of Scotland where he was supposed to lead them on a training mission against a special ops group. They quickly realize they are up against something else when they find the group all torn apart.Director Neil Marshall quickly sets the mood and the exact nature of the characters but keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the clip. You never actually know whats going to happen until its done. Pvt Cooper (Kevin McKidd) gives you the straight forward take charge attitude that prevents utter chaos between the platoon. He really exploded in the role as you got the feeling he really cared for the rest of the group and would do whatever it took for them to survive. While all the mayhem, shooting and strategy was taking place, Spoon (Darren Morfitt) provided the comic relief. Still being a soldier and doing his duties in a professional manner he was able to throw in remarks throughout the film that would take you from being on the edge of your seat to on the floor laughing. As for Megan (Emma Cleasby), she was the innocent photographer looking for a way out. Truly believable throughout the movie, exceptional performance.Now for the good stuff, the werewolves. These werewolves are not your ordinary run of the mill werewolves. They are vicious thinkers. They will take you of your game and when you're least expecting it, snatch you up. All the werewolves and gore are authentic and look as real as you can get. I am pretty picky on werewolves appearances and after seeing these effects, if I didn't know any better I would be locking my doors and boarding my windows at night.The movie perfectly found the medium between fast paced and slow paced. They got the story across while keeping the action high and threw some gore in there because it is a horror film after all. This movie covers all the needs of a horror watcher and is highly recommended.",Dog Soldiers

This werewolf film is a genuinely refreshing break from other 'stuck in house/farm/office with x outside hunting for blood'The twists, although predictable, still have a certain surprise to them. The werewolves are better because they are not CGI's I think they have a more menacing aura surrounding them. The actors portraying the soldiers well and some parts are even quite amusing.Overall, Dog Soldiers is a very good film, let alone an amazing werewolf movie.

This movie in my opinion, however, should not be described with the adverb ""mere"". I have never been a fan of the werewolf genre and as most my age, I can truthfully say I have not been scared by a movie (other than ""The Exorcist"") since I was a child. But...This movie was a breath of fresh air. It had moments of being truly chilling. I watched it with a friend with whom I served in the Marines 1967-1969. He told me ""I would rather have laid comm-wire along the whole DMZ than face those critters"".My one problem was that, as an American, I couldn't pick up some of the more rapidly spoken words of the British cast.My regards to the whole cast and crew.

301,everyonesacritic-1,"Here Doggy, Doggy!",8,11 December 2006,"Werewolf movies are notorious for being sub par, to say the least. Dog Soldiers is not.I usually don't hand out stars like candy, but I think that this movie deserves all 8 for being an original in its genre. The plot is actually quite good, the acting is of course fantastic, and there's no sight of the mandatory sex/nude scenes they typically add to distract from the lousy plot and to wake up the bored teenage-boys who have nodded off in the audience. It takes guts (pun intended) nowadays to skip the sex scenes, and to let the story stand on its own. For this I applaud the makers. Bravo!*SPOILER ALERT*This could have easily been a 10 star movie, that illusive *perfect werewolf movie*, if it wasn't for the werewolves themselves. I was slightly disappointed to see them walk on two feet, and the masks really looked like... well, masks. All in all, they were not very scary, and the morphing scenes left out the best bit (I really wanted to see a ""An American Werewolf in London"" type transformation with popping joints and stretching limbs. The works). There were also some slight plot holes, the worst (IMHO) being the female character's delayed morphing, but the plot was otherwise good enough to allow that little oops. Another thing that bothered me, was that there were shots where a bright light shone into the house through the windows, when it was supposed to be hours until sunrise. I don't know what that light effect was, but it looked a lot like bright sunlight to me. My suspension of disbelief groaned under the weight of some of these continuity errors.*END SPOILER ALERT*I tend to whine a lot, so it bears repeating that no matter what I said the movie lacks, the actors (et al.) did a really good job, and this is absolutely the best werewolf movie I've ever seen.I recommend Dog Soldiers to my fellow werewolf fanciers ;)",Dog Soldiers
302,kittylee55,Good to watch on a dark rainy night,6,26 October 2009,"I only watched this movie because I'm a fan of Sean Pertwee. I found the production a bit disappointing, obviously done on a very low budget - the werewolves live in this tiny old cottage - the film would have looked better if they had used a larger cottage - all those soldiers and werewolves living in this tiny space is unbelievable. The story has interesting parts, and the actors put in good performances in this film. The cheap look of this film reminds one of older horror movies - the werewolves walk on two feet and are exceedingly tall - I prefer werewolves that turn into real wolves, but these werewolves looked like people wearing costumes.There are truly scary parts, and the werewolves are creepy and disgusting. The film was shot in a forest, and the scenery adds to the mystery of the story.",Dog Soldiers
303,d-madar,Proud to be British...,7,13 May 2007,"OK this film is cheap, with limited effects and a relatively unknown cast. It just proves that you don't need allowed of money or Hollywood to entertain somebody for a couple of hours. I was sceptical before viewing this movie but i must say it was surprisingly enjoyable and original.Some guys are doing an army exercise in the woods of Scotland, when they are stalked and chased by werewolves. They manage to escape the woods and reach the only house nearby, where they end up desperately fighting for their lives against some savage beasts.This is by no means a straight out horror movie. There is a lot of action and even some moments of comedy. There is also a clever twist towards the end and the audience is kept guessing who will survive and who won't. The men act like true heroes in the fighting and I genuinely felt for them - unlike in so many horror films.Another thing I particularly loved about Dog Soldiers is that it's so British. I'm tired of so many good American horror movies! The setting in Scotland, the dialogue and the men are very British. Although its not completely original many elements of this film are. Admittedly the effects aren't great and although a bit jumpy at times I didn't find this one scary (though that isn't its main aim).A refreshing and entertaining film; OK its not a classic but i still recommend it. If you liked this check out the Descent (by the same director) with a bit more cash",Dog Soldiers
304,invisiblespike,It'd be bone to miss this.,9,30 May 2011,"Dog Soldiers caught my attention and I initially thought a werewolf film released straight to DVD would be terrible so i went in with a critical eye and I was pleasantly surprised by a new take on an old classic. Varous films have attempted to recapture the old magic of American Werewolf In London but as far as I can see Dog Soldiers is the only one that has succeeded.The casting is inspired with Sean Pertwee at the forefront as the bad ass Sergeant Harry Wells and his interplay with his men is like a combination of Black Watch, Apoclayse Now and Full Metal Jacket. Kevin McKidd as Private Cooper is also an extremely engaging performance and Darren Morfitt as Priavte ""Spoon"" Witherspoon allows for great comedy value. The best performance though is by far that of the primary antagonist Captain Ryan by Liam Cunningham. His deadpan humour combined with a truly sadistic nature is a treat to watch. The only acting part that doesn't deliver is that of Emma Cleasby who plays a zoologist named Megan, who catches Coopers eye right before Wells shoots her in the head as she starts to transform into a werewolf.Speaking of which the werewolves were spectacular even though you see very little of them until the final climactic scene where it's just Cooper, Wells and Spoon up against the entire pack. Whoever did the creature effects is a genius because the werewolf seemed also human, particularly when Spoon is throwing anything that's handy at one. The backdrop of the frankly spectacular Scottish Highlands didn't do the film any harm either.The director Neil Marshall however was the star turn, doing a bang up job by filming it almost entirely with hand held cameras in order to get a close quarter perspective on the action and to take advantage of the massive levels of gore. Believe me, this film is not for those of a weak stomach. the soldiers are ripped in half (Joe), beheaded (Terry) and reduced to a bloody mess (Spoon) so those of a nervous disposition should give it a miss.All in all, Dog Soldiers is an excellent take on a highly simple but truly inspired premise and the acting is first rate as is the direction and creature effects. In fairness to Emma Cleasby had she not been surrounded by such a stellar cast she probably would been a pretty good performance, especially with her final line; ""It's just that time of the month.""

305,Fence,Great Opening Scene,8,7 December 2002,"Anyone who doesn't appreciate that zip slowly opening shouldn't watch the rest of this film.Blood, guts and gore. That is what this film is about, that and fantastic one-liners. Now I had heard good reviews but was more than prepared to be disapointed, but I wasn't. This kept me jumping and laughing the whole way through.Not the usual po-mo horror we have been fed, but a serious fright-fest, with brilliant one-liners. Was a bit worried about what the werewolves would look like, but they are fine. Not as fantastic as some would like you to believe, but good enough.Memorable for many reasons: the opening scene I already mentioned, the wonderful stories the squaddies tell before being interupted by a falling cow, and most memorable of all, the most well-thought out one-liner in the history of film.

Unlike recent entries into the genre, Dog Soldiers is a straight down the line werewolf movie - it's not trying to be clever, not trying to mix genres and not trying to be stylistically distinguished.  It's just out to entertain - and to my mind at least succeeds on all fronts.  With the right amount of thrills, self parody and plain laugh out loud silliness (disembowelment hasn't been this funny since Braindead), it deserves to roundly trounce the stagnant fayre we're usually force-fed by Hollywood.

308,jtuss,I don't get it...,4,12 March 2005,"Went down to my local video store last night and picked up ""Dog Soldiers"" on DVD. I hadn't heard much about it except when it got Movie of the Day here on IMDb and I read the subsequent reviews--most of which were very good. After finishing it I DO think it had a chance of being excellent--the dialogue was generally good and the characters did have some semblance of a personality. The gore scenes were also effectively used (except for the cheesy ""rolling head"" in the barn). The movie did suffer, however, from several critical flaws that were instrumental in maintaining the believability of the story...""SPOILERS""1. The car. Werewolves are smart enough to destroy the car after the soldiers board themselves in the farmhouse. O.k. I can get that, but later on, after SEVERAL attacks and several hours of wondering what to do, the woman kindly mentions she has another car in the barn right next door???? Thanks for mentioning that sooner!!?!...Their ""plan"" to get the car is to drop someone out of the second floor window to run around with a flare while another guy gets the car and pulls it up to the farm. All of a sudden the werewolves get REALLY SLOW and the guy is able to outrun them and climb back up the rope(?!) with one of them right on this A** the whole time. Anyways, apparently the 'plan' had some flaws in it since the werewolves are also right outside the door with the car (what did they expect) so when they open it to get to the car several of them are killed and the door is slammed shut again. End of plan. Oh, the werewolves are apparently not smart enough to destroy this second car as it sits outside for a bit (No don't give me the ""they were luring them back out bit either).2. The werewolves themselves. I thought they looked pretty stupid...they're heads were waaaay to big and looked cartoonish--NOT scary at all. Plus, they seem to be very limber and smart at certain times, and very slow and stupid at others. After attacking the house for a bit they seem to always decide to quit for a while to keep the plot rolling along--even though they probably could have finished them off in one attack since bullets only seem to annoy them. They can tear a metal car to shreds in seconds, run very very fast, take massive amounts of ammo to the face, and yet still can't seem to manage breaking down a wood door. They also seem to get really perturbed when you throw glasses, pots, pans, and fisticuffs at them. Or when you block them out with some empty suitcases. Never mind the ammo and grenades fellas...3. The soldiers attitudes towards the werewolves. After they have been attacked for a good few hours (and had the werewolves RIGHT IN THEIR FACES at the doors and windows) they still act like the idea that they could be something other than human seems ridiculous to them. We get the standard ""Cmon, there's nothing supernatural going on here they're probably just escaped lunatics..."" Never mind the fact that they have been plugging these ""lunatics"" chock FULL of machine gun rounds AT CLOSE RANGE for almost two hours now and they look suspiciously like bobble head wolves. 4. the ""special ops"" guy. He sits there, tied up, annoying the HELL out of the soldiers with his pessimistic comments over and over, but NO ONE thinks to gag him or take him out of the room? They just get madder and madder....and madder...and madder...etc..etc...5. The woman mentioning that ""wolves are pack animals and that they'll probably want to go somewhere warm like the barn--and go ALL TOGETHER."" HUH? There's some logic for you...Meanwhile the soldiers explode the car (which the werewolves forgot to tear up a second time) precisely because they bought this line of reasoning. They reply to her, ""Huh. You must be right. They ARE pack animals, so they MUST be in the barn."" Okaaay...Overall, the movie had real potential, but you just CAN'T be successful when you ask the audience to accept ludicrous gaps in plausibility and character motivation. Yeah, I know, its a 'werewolf' movie and thus not meant to be realistic, but in order to have the audience ""feel"" like they're there you have to have the characters behave in a somewhat believable way. Dog Soldiers was ultimately trapped by the ""Hey, lets split up and wander off alone"" syndrome that all too many horror films fall victim to... 4/10 stars",Dog Soldiers

Loads of guns, loads of guts, loads of laughs and loads of really scary vicious looking werewolves with big pointy teeth.

310,ploader1,Truly dreadful,1,9 September 2007,"Truly dreadful movie concerning group of soldiers pitting their wits against werewolves. What makes the film so awful is the terrible, terrible 'gung ho', ""do it soldier"" style dialogue accompanied by the worst sort of macho sentimentality and posturing. This is a film for young boys who want to be soldiers. If only the whole bunch of them would get eaten by Werewolves (thankfully most of them do.)The film is devoid of any attempt to explore character or human relationships in anything but the most perfunctory way. People are just there to embody qualities such as ruggedness, loyalty, determination etc Sub themes include some ridiculous 'man's best friend' stuff about dogs (the hero of the film at one point refuses to shoot a dog and is later rewarded by a dog coming to his aid) and some crap about football - one of the soldiers is a football obsessive (cue lots of remarks like 'I should be watching the match'.) Tellingly the villain of the movie doesn't like football or dogs - a sure sign he is not to be trusted. The worst scene involves the hero killing the last werewolf whilst spouting the line ""You think it's all over - it is now""It's sooooooooooo bad..",Dog Soldiers

Neil Marshall is a writer/director to keep an eye on. The plot is well scripted and the characters are all smart, and believable. No foolish falling over their own feet in this little gem. Yet, they play as human, not super-human which ads to the films value.The acting and production values are all high. We not only get to see the werewolves, we see them long enough to enjoy the care taken with their creation. Recommended!",Dog Soldiers
312,Lance Premier,Howling Good fun,9,15 May 2002,"I throughly enjoyed this film, from the gruesome first scene, to the nerve-wracking finish.  The cast and crew have done extremely well with the obvious lack of funds, and have in fact produced a very scary and very funny movie.Kevin McKidd was the true star of the movie with a solid performance as a squadie rejected in his special forces selection. Sean Pertwee may have been a bit hammy in his role as the squad sergeant but this isn't a film to be taken seriously so who cares.I am not a huge fan of werewolf movies but this was great, I can't remember being as tense since Aliens (which this film is vaguely reminiscent of).Dog Soldiers may not appeal to everyones tastes, but if you enjoy the horror/sci fi genre you won't be disapointed.",Dog Soldiers

The plot is so-so, the special effects are decent, but what makes this movie stand out are the people in the story.  I can't praise enough the performances of Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd and Liam Cunningham.What helped also was the humor, it never seemed to take itself too seriously, and I enjoyed all the little insider jokes.  For what I thought was going to be just another low budget B horror movie, I was thrilled to find something that rose above the mundane and captured my fancy so richly. Oh, and did I mention I like Werewolves?  Thanks to all concerned for making this little gem!",Dog Soldiers
314,robnolymurphy,"Brilliant Werewolf, adventure.",10,29 August 2021,"I revisited this excellent horror from the early 2000s and was reminded of just how well it works as the perfect late night horror jaunt.A group of likable, rough and ready British soldier's are faced with the task of surviving the night, in the misty, isolated Glens of Scotland, as their training manoeuvres devolve into a real world fight for survival against a family of Werewolves.Filled with dark comedy, and gore, it holds your attention with ease as you're pulled into the dark night and the story of the fight for survival. The writer/director uses the first ten minutes well, introducing us to the six men in question as they swap joke's and stories over a camp fire, establishing a creepy atmosphere, as we get to know our six protagonists, before the action swings to life, and it's pretty relentless once begun.Many aspects come together that make this one of the best horror mysteries of the past few decades, the acting is perfect for the tone of the movie, the isolated setting, the gore and humour, make this a must watch for horror fans.I couldn't finish without mentioning the Werewolves, which were designed magnificently. Tall, menacing beasts, no CGI, and shown sparingly on camera, until the later scenes. And the later scenes do not fail to deliver, as our protagonists defend their refuge, a rural farm house, with ever dwindling ammo, enemies within are exposed, as the beasts keep up their siege of the house.Utterly enjoyable fare. Especially for the werewolf and horror afficionado. And is well suited for repeat viewings. Everything one could ask of a horror movie.",Dog Soldiers
315,mattress01,"Finally, someone makes a great horror movie! A flick to look out for!",8,15 June 2002,"I had heard about this movie through Fangoria and was thrilled to see it on the Sci-Fi Channel.  Being a real horror movie fan, I haven't been too keen on the latest batch of horror movies to hit the screen in the past 10 years. Oh, there have been a few but they were far and in-between ""great""...until I saw this movie.From the very onset through to the climactic ending, I was clenching the armrest of my recliner.  The action was top notch and non-stop, the special fx were awesome for what they worked with, the characters were real, and the gore was awesome.  Even the werewolves looked and acted 'real'.  I was actually surprised that the 'Channel' deleted the cuss words but allowed the bloody gore.  (Hmmm, good for them and us!)A particular point that I liked was the realism of the characters; they were soldiers and the actors portraying them seemed to have a bit of real army training; their tactics were sound and their human reactions were how I, or probably anyone, would act in those harrowing situations.I would highly recommend this flick for any true horror or action movie fan's DVD/video library.  I can't wait until it comes out on DVD so I can see if anything was deleted (were scenes deleted to fit the time slot) as well as all of the other extras.

I did a quick check here on IMDB and hey, 7,3 graded...not bad, at least thats what I thought.This movie is AWFUL!, I actually wasnt registered before on IMDB but now I just had to register to say this.Reading some other comments on this movie makes me wonder if people really have such a god-awful taste in movies, or if the people who praise this movie is doing it just for a laugh and to get others to watch this piece of crap.It was only really scary at one single point and that was just one of those sudden changes of pace in the early part of it. Then it was just downhill from there, lots of gore and screaming but come on, this isnt a scary movie, its definitely not a good movie.Seriously, dont watch this...",Dog Soldiers
317,martinbarrett63,Damn Good,10,14 May 2002,"This is the most entertaining film I have seen in a long time. It has some excellent individual components:1. Things exploding2. Automatic weapons with unreasonably large quantities of ammunition3. Werewolves4. Gore5. A joke every 90 secondsBut it's also much more than that. It has real menace in places, and the rapport between the members of the squad is palpable and real. There were gasps of horror and laughs in equal measure in the cinema when I saw it, and it's a rare film than can achieve both.You know the plot is unlikely, the twists predictable, and the very existence of werewolves dubious, but somehow you really end up caring how it ends for the people making their last stand in this isolated farmhouse. And you really, really want to see Captain Ryan come to a painful end.There's even something in it for the film buff, with a sequence that's an hommage to the hospital escape scene in Zulu, but funnier.And just to make sure you don't leave thinking that in the ending the film started to take itself seriously, there are some treats in the end credits that should keep you in your seat.A rare ten out of ten to this film, for achieving magnificently exactly what it set out to do. How many times a year can you say that?",Dog Soldiers
318,ramblebob,A great werewolf movie on a budget,8,21 February 2003,"This film was highly entertaining and a enjoyable watch more then anything. The plot was predictable but that added to the entertainment of watching with the feeling of better knowledge then the soldiers. It was different to a lot of werewolf films because of the hunting in pack instead of the one werewolf. This made it feel like it was a true military stand off. The characters where great and felt real even if the acting isn't to the high Oscar standard people want, these felt like British military in an unbelievable situation.To sum up, this film is well worth a watch, it might not shock but it entertains and also will make you laugh immensely",Dog Soldiers
319,harry0266,Should have been titled Dog's Bo**ocks!,10,18 June 2002,"This movie was stylishly directed and has a 'well produced' feel to it. I understand it was shot on a very low budget, but don't let this put you off if you've heard the same. It's an absolute roller-coaster ride from start to finish .... without any dips. You WILL scream, but not just in horror or fear. After the initial opening, (which is polished to say the least) there's a lot of base humour/humor (for you yanks) dialogue going on. This will draw you in and make you feel part of the character group. You may even forget the reason you are watching the movie. This was 'Dog Soldiers' ace card. For just as you feel comfortable, you are reminded. If you can accept the occasional 'dodgy' werewolf clip (only one or two) then you'll enjoy this film, I PROMISE!

It combines its scares with great direction and solid effects. The writing is witty and effective and the acting is natural, and combines well parallel with the music. Sean Pertwee stands out, although the supporting cast are all equally solid in their roles. Great, satisfying action and inventive and genuinely funny dialogue are the highlights of this phenomenal British classic. If you are a fan of horror films, different from the predictable slasher, and enjoy likable characters and good action, Dog Soldiers fits the bill perfectly, and begins to show how good a hand us Brits have at filmmaking.",Dog Soldiers
325,Wolfman1181,The Birth of a Horror Genius,9,22 January 2007,"Let me clear one thing up about horror films, they all follow a specific plan. Very few straying away from the guidelines, surely for the simple fact that people are afraid of change. They are afraid that they will be hanged in the industry if they don't stick to the flight plan. Neil Marshall takes a step back and looks at what he wants to do, then he steps up to the plate and knocks it out of the park. For those who have seen the Descent along with Dog Soldiers should know that Marshall doesn't settle on making just simple horror movies. He makes excellent movies period, films that take a hold of you and give you emotional attachment to its characters. Emotional attachment that even some of the best dramas fall short of. Plain and simple, Marshall is not just a master of his domain but he also knows how to craft great artwork, and Dog Soldiers is no different. Hands down the best ""werewolf"" movie I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. Thank you Mr. Marshall for bringing me back to that night when I was 6 years old watching ""Aliens"" for the first time in the middle of the night.",Dog Soldiers

You'll know what I mean if you've watched it ;) One of the most realistic werewolf movies I have ever seen, watched it over 5 times since it's come out and the plot is so clever and you will be shocked at the ending, bit of well thought of comedy one liners as well. it's definitely one of the top British films before they became more Americanised with their horror and comedy",Dog Soldiers
327,steve-1882,It's not that I mind it being made...,2,9 September 2007,"It's just not my kind of film. It didn't strike me as especially original or excellent in its retreading of the genre, so I really don't understand the approval it's been getting. But that's kind of not the point.For whatever reason, it made some money, and that justifies it's being funded.It just seems sad to me, when there are so many really powerful voices in British drama, that the money the industry makes from low-brow, bang-bang stuff like this can't then go on to finance a lot more films that are risky, experimental or downright odd. So long as the quality is kept high, surely there is room for a percentage commercial failure.We do get the occasional good British film - but when was the last time anyone saw a British feature film that really blew them away? Something that maybe didn't quite work, or failed commercially - but was really inspiring and new?The way to get a vibrant, powerful film industry is to maximise the invention. Get the soup going - keep it liquid and bubbling. That means getting away from the cramped, fingerless-gloved mentality that we see seeking out more Dog Soldiers.",Dog Soldiers
328,theresan-23740,A pleasant surprise,7,22 February 2017,"Honestly, when I first decided to watch this movie I wasn't expecting to like it too much. I was expecting a stereotypical, low-quality, werewolf movie that you'd find on Syfy to waste your time watching. However, the movie proved surprisingly good, especially after I found out it was a low-budget horror-comedy film. The movie did a great job of making the audience feeling like they're a part of the film with all of the up close shots and camera shots from the werewolf's point of view. The ""gore"" and different soldiers contributed to the comedic aspect of the movie and the ""gore"" and surprise of werewolves made the movie somewhat more of a horror movie than action. Many parts within the movie had me upset because some parts were confusing and upsetting, especially when the characters come up with resolution when it is no longer needed, which left me upset and screaming at the TV. I was always wondering what would happen next, and the few holes in the plot (especially at the end) left me a bit unsatisfied, questioning and wanting more background and resolution. This is not you typical cheesy werewolf movie; it has action, comedic and horror elements, and an end leaving you questioning everything that has passed and would come following it.",Dog Soldiers

We were excited because we figured thier would be good movies released on SyFy channel. Boy, were we wrong!! It's a pity that this is one of the few SyFy channel's released movies that are worth watching!! It's a different concept with a great cast, setting, and story.

330,Vantek,More of a comedy than a horror movie,5,30 September 2008,"Having recently seen The Descent (same director), which was a great thrill, I decided to check out Dog Soldiers as well. I knew it was going to be a weaker flick, but I did expect more than it delivered.The film didn't manage to scare me much. The beginning felt promising, but from then on it's clear the makers didn't quite play on horror, as there was a lot joking going on which definitely made it impossible to get actually scared. I don't understand the comments that claim that Dog Soldiers is scary. It's just not.Well, this could not have been such a bad thing, I enjoy mindless monster slaughter as much as the next man. But the film wasn't just not scary, it was at times silly to downright absurd. It was stupid how the soldiers were feeling safe in a regular weak-walled house like it was a fortress despite having clearly too few numbers to secure the perimeter, while for some mysterious reason the superhuman strength and invulnerable werewolves actually did fail to take over the building even though deciding by the strength they displayed in some situations they should have been able to do so without breaking a sweat. Either the werewolves should have been a lot weaker, or the soldiers should have had a much better defensive spot. The plot felt artificial and not a logical progression.That being said, Dog Soldiers had good-looking scenes, some even great moments, made me laugh, and overall, I guess I can say it's watchable. But just barely. Won't be seeing this a second time.",Dog Soldiers

The werewolves, even thou they are a bit under-done still actually resemble wolves...makes a change. The main point i love about this film is the fact that all the character are brilliant...their not just cannon fodder that u can guess which will die within the first 15 mins of the film like most horrors but u actually want them to survive i.e. Spoon = balls of British steel! p.s. Sausages!",Dog Soldiers
333,greggy-7,What words can even begin to describe....?,9,11 August 2003,"What can I really say about this film that can adequately describe the impact it had on me. I was (and to borrow from the British) Bloody floored by this film. Not in the blood and guts, not by the simple description on the back of the DVD case (this movie was NOT released in theaters in the USA I am sorry to say), nor even by the idea that I was renting a horror movie, but I was in awe of the creation of a movie that had me speechless from the very beginning. To put it in simpler terms, I thought this movie to be a movie fan's dream come true. I am not a reviewer of movies, I just love watching them. This happens to be the first time I have ever commented on one online, and I can tell you that this movie was absolutely stunning. First and foremost about what caught my attention was the acting. It was pure enjoyment to not just see actors portraying characters, but to actually be drawn into a movie by the characters themselves and that is due to the outstanding cast (and crew) that this film was able to have. I had the feeling that I was part of the film, that I was running and scared s******s just like the people in the movie. I felt like I was surrounded and being chased by (until you find out) whatever it was that was chasing them. I love the little tributes that the film readily and often gave to other films and even actors. This film was incredible. I loved Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, and Darren Morfitt's acting and they also played my three favorite characters as well. What more can I say. I was pulled into this movie and felt like I was dragged along with all the other soldiers trying to fight to stay alive and sane. In effect, I felt like I was part of the movie, alomost like I was the one holding the camera and capturing all of this on film. Even the title alone is great. DOG SOLDIERS. But, unlike the 'B' horror movie I THOUGHT I was renting, this film turned out to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Incredible acting, great directing, stunning cinematography, excellent script and dialogue, and outstanding horror special effects (no CGI for this one - that's what makes this one even better than most) makes this movie not just a movie, but a cinematic adventure. By all means, go and rent (and then buy) this movie. But if you do, you might want to have some silver with you, just in case :)",Dog Soldiers
334,lizard-28,Not a classic - but good fun,7,14 May 2003,"I enjoyed Dog Soldiers for the following reasons.1. It was quite exciting, although not really scary.2. It made me laugh - sure the jokes were corny, but that was part of the fun.3. It was a pleasant change to watch an all British ensemble in an action/horror film.Those that complain about lack of realism etc are, I think, missing the point. It's a horror movie after all.To sum up, just a B movie, but one directed and acted with verve and a real sense of fun. You could do a lot worse than rent this for an evening.",Dog Soldiers
335,bowmankcmo,Expected More,5,17 September 2009,"I found this film to be very mediocre, which was disappointing considering how many positive reviews I'd read here and elsewhere.I think I'm a pretty good judge of horror movies, in fact, it's probably my favorite genre. And I'm not young, so I got started on classics like Night of the Living Dead, the Exorcist, Jaws, the original Alien, the original slashers like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street, etc. And I've tried to catch as many horror movies as I can as they've come out over the years.All that said, I expected Dog Warriors (again, after reading a lot of critiques), to be a slick movie in the vein of 28 Days Later or the like, and instead, found the movie to be what I call ""television quality"".I can't fault the acting or dialogue, both are pretty tight. But there are times that the plot just feels a little ... ridiculous. For instance, there is a scene where our military protagonist group is sitting around a fire sharing spooky stories, when suddenly, out of nowhere, an enormous, savaged, bloody cow carcass plops down right in the midst of them. About 10 seconds later, the commander tells a few of the boys to stand watch, the rest ... hit the sack. Uh. Yeah. Right. They just apparently had a cow carcass hurled at them, but let's go ahead and get some shut eye.The movie lacks any kind of significant special effects, which in this day and age is a little odd. I absolutely don't mind a lack of FX if the movie is geared around psychological terror, but this movie isn't geared around psychological terror, it's a straight-up werewolf movie.So when you see your fifth or sixth pile of guts, it's like (yawn) ""oh look, another pile of guts"". Speaking of which, there is a scene where a character gets disembowled, has his guts spilling out of him, yet still manages to run along with the rest of the group. Yeahhh...If you can suspend your disbelief in places, you're treated to a wholly average werewolf film. Nowhere near the creativity of an oldschool movie like An American Werewolf in London, nowhere near the spook factor of The Howling, nowhere near the effects of the Underworld sagas.With a little censoring (and if it were American), I could see this movie being a feature film on the Sci Fi channel. In other words, it's pretty lame.This of course is all just my opinion, but I felt the need to offer a counter-critique to all the rave reviews here. The movie had the same effect on me as drinking stale pop. I like the idea, and the acting and script were satisfactory, but I got tired pretty quickly of seeing guts all over the place, watching the same ""chase-cam"" in so many scenes, and just generally being bored, even while the movie was trying so hard to scare me.I'm still waiting for that perfect werewolf movie, but it definitely hasn't hit yet.",Dog Soldiers

Originality at it's best. They took the time to give you some background on the men involved without dragging the film out. They made most of the characters likable so that you cared when they got eaten. The fighting sequences between the werewolves and soldiers combined with great camera angles really left you on the edge of your seat. If you pay attention to the beginning of the movie, you can see the foreshadowing and know what is going to happen later on. There are some great moments for laughter and human compassion. There were a few feet of tape left on the cutting room floor that I personally feel they should have left in but it didn't take away from the movie. Overall definitely worth watching and enjoying.",Dog Soldiers

Maybe it was my low expectations or just the fact that this is a great horror movie, but i loved this movie. Its a character driven movie rather than a monster movie, which gets you more involved. And it just happens to have ferocious monsters in it. Best werewolf movie i've ever seen. So many others are so cheap and obviously fake.

This is pure entertainment at its horrific best, its basically the story of a group of soldiers up in the Scottish Highlands on a routine training mission who happen to encounter a bunch of very angry werewolves. Thats all you need to know. No one takes the film seriously and its that one point alone that makes this film really work. What could of been another routine horror flick becomes the most ridiculous and funny Brit flick since Lock Stock. Everyone involved is quite clearly having a great time, the dialogue is hammy at best, the set pieces are ridiculous but somehow it all sits together perfectly to make a hugely entertaining film. Even the graphic gore is played for laughs. So in summary, a hilarious film that should be enjoyed for what it is, a superbly entertaining horror comedy that feels as though its straight out of the 1980s.",Dog Soldiers
343,Madd_Mann,Not as great as they say...,3,2 September 2009,"Score: About an hour in I was thinking of rating it a ""5"", but by the end ""3.5"".It just seemed that the longer the movie went on the more the ""actors"" began to grate on me. Don't get me wrong, I love British humor, and thought that ""Shaun Of The Dead"" was one of the funniest movies I'd seen in years. But the humor in this movie seemed strained, the acting non-existent, and the whole ""twist"" at the end with Megan? Gah!I especially hated how in one scene the werewolves are running, snarling, ripping beasts, and in the next they're tip-toeing around, silently waving their hands in the air as if they were interpretive dancers. (The scene where one crept through the window on ""little cat feet"" to sneak up on the sleeping Sarge had me LMAO!) And if you're a werewolf with claws, teeth, enhanced strength and animalistic fury why would you just bounce your victim around the room before tearing him apart? Is that to tenderize him before you chow down?Personally, I'm still waiting for a GREAT werewolf movie. (And no, it's not ""Underworld"" or any of its sequels!) I used to think it was ""The Howling"", but I first saw that when I was 18, and haven't seen it again in 20+ years so I'm not sure how well it would hold up to my scrutiny today. And though I tried like the dickens to enjoy ""An American Werewolf In London"", David Naughton made that difficult with his overacting.Some view this as the greatest werewolf movie EVER(!) but for me, that movie has yet to be made.-Slaughter",Dog Soldiers
344,basszje,"Unserious, stupid and great!",8,5 August 2002,"Finally after a load of would be horror movies with all the serious plots a movie which nothing serious except humor.A movie with dry humor, scottish accents and gore.

345,puchta,Cheap copy,3,27 May 2002,"I went to the cinema, expecting a feast of blood and gore, and what I got was a feast of plagiarism. Nothing against reshaping and improving a good idea, but everything I have seen in this film I have seen far better in other films. The basic idea of the film is standard, a group attacked by monsters in a place where they cannot escape. There is the mean guy from the government, who knows more then he says, there is the mysterious girl, and there are the soldier/victims who have no idea what is going on. Beyond these cliches, there is no characterization. Most of the action scenes look like a low budget movie, a lot of shooting at invisible enemies. And they should have stayed invisible, for the costumes are pathetic. Far from the menace of ""Alien"", or the creativity of ""From Dask Till Dawn"", the werewolves look like relics from the stop-motion-era. The close-ups of drooling muzzles are shaped after Alien, the resemblance makes them look even more miserable.",Dog Soldiers
346,gdunagin-1,Excellent and am looking for the next one.,7,31 January 2005,"I have been unable to write reviews for some time so I thought I'd better get back into it.I saw DS for the first time this past weekend and thought it was great! No CGI!! Yea!! Real actors and real acting. Good drama, character development and easy to follow. Yes, our British family has done an outstanding job on this one, for sure. I also loved the ""Zipper scene."" excellent transition. People should learn from this picture; one does not need mega bucks and CG to make a great movie. I am looking forward to DS 2: Fresh Meat.Greetings to all :-) My quote, which I wrote ""You can count your true friends on one hand, with fingers left over.""",Dog Soldiers
347,Nine18Pictures,Very Well Done,8,25 January 2003,"The werewolf subgenre has never been a consistantly good one. There is what I refer to as ""The Holy Trilogy"" of werewolf films, which consists of ""The Wolf Man,"" ""An American Werewolf in London,"" and ""The Howling."" Except for those three films, there have been very, very few good werewolf movies, ranging from the poor (I was a Teenage Werewolf) to the bad (The Howling sequels) and the utterly contemptable (An American Werewolf in Paris.) The last couple of years, however, I've seen a small but respectable pair of werewolf films. The first one was the clever ""Ginger Snaps."" The other one is ""Dog Soldiers.""This is easily thr best werewolf film in over a decade. This film has everything a good werewolf film should have (except for a cool transformation scene - the one in the film is brief) including blood, guts, splattters, etc. The film also has flashes of such classic horror as ""Aliens,"" ""Predator,"" and ""Night of the Living Dead.""The plot concerns a group of British soldiers who encounter some bloodthirsty lycanthropes in the Scottish wilderness. Soon enough they find themselves shut in an old farmhouse inhabited by the mysterious Megan. The rest of the picture concerns the small band's attempts to stay alive, all the while uncovering the truth behind these attackers.One of the most exciting aspects of the film is the use of tangible effects as opposed to CG. Throughout the first act of the film we see the creatures only in flashes and quick cuts (for budgetary reasons as much as anything probably) that are extremely effective and very creepy. When we are finally shown the monsters in their full glory, we are treated to a most unusual looking werewolf. Ultimately, like with any horror movie that uses animatronics as opposed to GOOD (I stress GOOD, not like most recent films)CGI, the effects look a little like what they are. However, it does not detract from the film. If anything, it adds to the fun that is ""Dog Soldiers"" knowing that there is actually something there in front of the actors. The gore effects, which there are many, are a lot of fun and keep in the spirit of the werewolf subgenre.I have only seen the film a few times, but I feel that this will be one that I'll return to in the future, when I'm in the mood for a well-done werewolf picture other than ""The Holy Trilogy.""Three and a half stars.918",Dog Soldiers
348,lartrak,"Definetly good, but I was a bit disappointed...",7,21 November 2002,"After reading a vague reference to this film in someone lamenting about the decline of horror films (he stated this was the best horror film in many years), I decided I had to look this one up.  Finding many more glowing reviews, I decided to rent it.  It was quite enjoyable, but I must admit, it was not as great as the reviews made me think.The plot is described in many other reviews, so I will not bother retreading that.  The storyline is simplistic, but very effective.  It's the same setup as countless other films, with people trapped in a building assaulted by many.  It goes back to the 30s, and is best characterized by Night of the Living Dead.  As far as I know, this is the first time this kind of plot has been used with werewolves.  Being a big fan of werewolves and their movies made me want to see this movie almost immediately after reading about it.The werewolves themself are good, while it is obvious they were working on a limited budget, the werewolves are quite well-done considering.  Most reminiscent of the designs in The Howling, they are thankfully not the 'Wolfman' type of thing, where it's a guy with little more then a beard. The gore effects (plentiful, but not as many of them or as extreme as some reviews would have you believe) are also well executed.
The actors, pretty much across the board, are excellent.  Especially the Sarge, he was great, as well as being the only actor I recognized.   The only weak link I saw was the girl, she wasn't so great.Some of the characters are memorable, I especially liked Spoon.  Everyone seems to like him though, he gets the best line in the movie as well as the best scene.  Towards the end, when he gets trapped with a werewolf about to break into a room, he holds up his fists like a bare knuckle boxer.  Then beats and stabs the heck out of the werewolf.  It was hilarious and superbly executed.  Good stuff.Now, all the good above, why was I disappointed?  The reviews seem to proclaim this as the next Evil Dead 2 or other such landmark film.  This is just not true.  The whole film is well-done, but it just seems to lack the genius and flair of, say, Evil Dead 2.  I can't quite put my finger on why I feel this way...  It just wasn't quite the sum of its parts, I guess.
Overall, I give it a 7.5 out of 10.",Dog Soldiers

If you ever find yourself watching films and thinking ""why on earth in that situation would you do that??""  then this is not the film for you.  That said, if you still really wanna watch the film, then read no further coz theres some minor spoilers comming up.Ok, so your a soldier on an Exercise in some woods in Scotland.  You've set up camp, and your about to go to sleep.  Next thing you know, a mutilated cow falls out of the sky, and lands right in front of you.  Personaly, i would want an explanation for why this had happend. However, whoever wrote dog sldiers thought that the natural response would be to say ""thats odd, lets get some kip and find out what happend in the morning""  Its just plain stupid, and similar examples crop up time and time again through the film.Other problems with the film, to name but a few include; a wittless script, werewolves that look quite literally like a man, with a wolf's head and a woefully predictable plot (""thank you for this gift of a letter opener its lovely"", ""well look after it, its REAL SILVER"" hmmmm i wander if that comes in handy later)I really would urge everyone who reads this to avoid this film like a poorly concieved and produced werewolf movie.",Dog Soldiers
353,imperfect_soul,One of the best horror movies since The Evil Dead,6,26 April 2003,"Chances are most people will come across this movie like I did.  Walking through your local video store looking at shelves for something to rent. Dog Soldiers caught my eye, and I picked it up, looked at it, and laughed. When I found nothing else in the store, I walked back to it and decided 'what the hell' and decided to rent it.  When I got home and watched this movie, I was surprised to find out I had rented one of the best horror movies since The Evil Dead.The premise of the movie is about a squad of troops that enduring survival training in the middle of nowhere (never a good sign), when they come across a rival squad that has been decimated, except for the leader who is badly hurt.  Now throw in the typical chase/shooting/lets go in that house scene and you've got yourself a horror movie!Some of the violence may be over the top (like when Cooper has his stomach sliced open), but the acting is suprisingly solid with some sassy british wit thrown in.  Add that with some great scenes and decent werewolf design, and you've got what a horror movie should be, chilling, not special effects.8/10",Dog Soldiers
354,Knat,Old-Shool horror at its best,9,11 May 2003,"I'm a bit late with my comment, because i saw this movie very early at the ""Fantasy Filmfestival"" in Germany/Frankfurt last year. I sat there with tons of other movie freaks not knowing what's coming at us. The audience got really excited during the run, lots of loud laughs and standing ovations/applause at the end. The final joke really pushed me out of my chair, esp. as a german.. That british accent was so refreshing even so i had problems catching every line as a non native english speaker.thanks ! finally a movie managing to catch up with those great old 70s/80s horror flicks.and similar to ""The Cube"", this film is probably the best you can get with such a slim budget. So don't be over critical with the special effects.

I didn't understand it then, but when I purchased this movie a few years ago, I truly appreciated it. For one, the acting is very well done, and nothing to complain about. The action is pretty good. My favorite is the scene where the main character has the sword in his two front teeth. The house is beautiful, and the area is a nice setting. This and Big Trouble in Little China (another childhood movie), are and will always be close to my heart. If you are in the mood for the Wolfman with a twist, I highly recommend this movie. You will get a lot of bang for your buck, instead of Prom Night or the remake of a nightmare on elm street.",Dog Soldiers

I know some people will say ""yeah but it's kind of a B-Movie"" and my response would be ""yeah, so what?"".The story is great and the characters are awesome. Sgt Wells is another great role for Sean Pertwee who I've seen in a few of his other roles. He is a passionate leader who truly does care about the young men under his command and is willing to die for them. I also really enjoyed Kevin McKidd as the reluctant leader when he has to step in for the inured Sgt.The fur suits in my opinion are just great. I know the creators didn't want to go the CG route when they made this film and I think the results speak for themselves on how well suits can work for a movie.All in all, I would have to say that if you don't mind taking the time to check out this movie, you won't be disappointed.",Dog Soldiers

The creatures are not too exposed ( like in later Alien movies ) and the present of the creatures is very much like in ""The Thing "".How can a man/wolf been taken serious ? good question, but this has been in the tales for many hundred years over whole Europe and even Asia. So the topic is not dead yet...... Futheremore the horror is combined with morbid humor ( British , when it is good ). And your are not sure how this really ends, anyway the end is not good for neither parts ,soldiers nor wolfs.The storyteller give also time for us to learn the soldiers,and we feel bad every time one have to ""check out"".

I watched this movie with my wife last night and we both laughed and were thoroughly entertained!The acting is top notch! The featurette is definitely worth a look at.A lot of things come to light after viewing the movie in the featurette which makes one appreciate the film all the more. I loved the fact that there was little computer generated special effects! You are slowly drawn into the story and you care about the characters.

360,Loki16757,I like it,7,27 May 2005,When I first saw Dog Soldiers it was on SCI FI channel I was a little skeptical at first but as I continued to watch and I must say I was quite impressed by this movie The Movie plot was excellent in my opinion and the special effects were good for such a movie of this category I like the character all very well rounded characters the move depth was excellent I like the dark feeling of old horror movies. The camera work was another aspect I liked the werewolves them selves were quite impressive I like that look of Monsters Ex (aliens) the movie dialog was over all good but left room for some improvements as well as some of the action senescence as well as the acting this movie I recommend to fans of such movies as Night Of The Living Dead and Aliens This movie should be seen by those who love good action horror films.

362,richard_585,Good scare,10,13 November 2005,Saw this on Sci-fi channel but never on DVD until now. I must say it's a breath of fresh air to see a good horror without annoying teenagers in it. I always found British horror much more scarier than American made ones. The atmosphere in the Scottish forest was good enough and the movie didn't have all those CGIs that often distracts from the story. Just the sight of seeing one of the characters with his intestines hanging out was enough to lose my lunch. LOL. There were no sex scenes (who would want that when you're busy fighting for your life with a pack of werewolves anyway?) I found myself getting caught up with their struggle to survive and you can actually care for the characters. This is one of the few werewolf films I highly recommend.,Dog Soldiers
363,verity_farseer,Best Horror Flick In Years,10,19 March 2006,"This has got to be the best supernatural movie i have ever seen. For several reasons.1. The werewolves do actually look like wolves, unlike films like Underworld where they look like a cross between a bear, a black leopard and a wrestler. They are WOLVES for gods sake how about they look like a wolf for a change.2. Its not some cheesy heroic American bullshit. The acting and writing is awesome and realistic with each character having their own problems and personalities. There's not cheesy crap to ruin it.3. No love interest. There is no love to confuse the story line and make it hard to understand how the characters react tot he situation and get in the way of the story unlike most modern movies.4. Location. The idea of placing it in the remote area of the highlands is a stroke of brilliance. Its completely believable that this could happen. If you've ever looked at a map of the highlands or been there you will know what i'm talking about.If you you are considering not watching this movie because its low budget, then forget about it, just because its low budget doesn't make it bad, in fact it makes it better cause you know that the werewolves are actually people and there is hardly any special effects.Oh and by the way its a ""Soldier movie with werewolves"" not a werewolf movie. Watch the extras and you will know what I'm talking about.",Dog Soldiers

Negatives in the film is it's rushed too much, bullets don't even scratch the werewolfs, they just tickle them which is stupid.... Positives are a sword actually hurt them lol and explosions do too, they hate fire. To much macho acting and bitterness and swearing but plenty of violence. Overall a good film but very silly. 8/10",Dog Soldiers

I finally saw it in an air on TV and was pleasantly surprised.The movie has menace, action, and good acting. What I like most is that the werewolves were not campy despite an obviously lower budget than other movies featuring werewolves. The movie lets the viewer see just enough to supplement imagination to make the horror work.For cons, there are obvious holes in rationale in the story; easily ignored. There really isn't much suspense. Plot twists were easily foreseen, especially for an avid horror movie watcher.Definitely worth watching.",Dog Soldiers
366,Canadacatdejected-1,Not bad but not brilliant either,6,15 February 2006,"Neil Marshall's debut film is an average film that neither thrills or is a complete disappointment. It's premise has been done a million time before, however, that is not the biggest fault of this film. The film's biggest problem is that it is not that interesting or that scary. Horror films have also had a problem when it comes to how to make the film interesting. When the genre has been done a million times before how do you add something new? The main reason why the film is not scary is because Marshall decides to have his heroes hide out in a house, which is also a good of reducing the tension. The only time that the film creates any meaningful tension is when the soldiers are out in the woods opposed to the elements. Then the audience is unsure when an attack is going to happen. However, this is changed once the soldiers go inside the house. Another problem is that the characters are not that interesting (apart from Kevin Macidd's character)since they come over as nothing more than cliché' war characters. This is the true reality of Dog soldiers is that despite its horror premise it is actually nothing more than just a war movie and who wants to see one of them again!",Dog Soldiers

369,Puddums,Buy the soundtrack!,10,25 September 2002,"This review is dedicated to someone just as obsessive as me - you know who you are!To be honest, when I went to the cinema with a couple of my friends, it was more a social occasion than a desire to see this film. I did, however, return to see it again after leaving totally delighted.Dog Soldiers is a witty blend of humour, gore, a certain amount of slapstick, touching relationships and adventure. What makes it stand out from other small release, mickey taking films is its ability to find exactly the right balance between spoof and serious action.The cast was perfect - relatively unknown, realistic looking actors that gave the film the gritty yet slightly insane atmosphere it carried off so well. The characters were well-realised and well-rounded, from Sean Pertwee's reluctant hero, Sarge, to Darren Morfitt's totally bonkers 'Spoon', and the moving bond between Sarge and Cooper added a more human touch to an inhuman story.A POSSIBLE, EVER SO SMALL SPOILER... There are also some utterly hilarious one liners, noticeably Sarge's anguished ""They won't f*****g fit!"" But I'll leave the context of that quote to you and your viewing pleasure... THE POSSIBLE, EVER SO SMALL SPOILER HAS NOW ENDED...Only a couple more things left to say. Firstly, the soundtrack. Brilliant. Mixes variations on a folk theme with pounding drum rhythms and shrill passages that accompany the various chases. I went out and bought it (correction, manipulated someone into buying it for me) within the next week and it has to be one of my favourites. The music is done to perfection - it achieves that immortal effect where you ARE aware of it, but only subconsciously, and yet can remember it long after the film's finished. Secondly, watch the credits - a laugh out loud moment there that perfectly satirises the questionable priorities of our modern society.Although the film only received a short run at the cinemas and was never widely publicised, despite having all round good reviews, it is released on video within the next few weeks, so I advise you to rent it, love it then buy it!

Some glaring plot holes take away from the action, but no one makes these movies expecting to win an Oscar. It's not particularly well acted and definitely should have been edited better; it's at least 20 min too long. Over an hour of the movie is them trapped in the farmhouse, and it just runs out of steam at this point. Everything that happens after they get to the farmhouse is REALLY predictable. Don't get me wrong, I liked it for what it was - a low budget action/horror movie, but it didn't do anything unexpected or to make it stand out from the rest of the genre.

372,Rynodinson,Best Werewolf movie I've seen,10,13 May 2006,The Best way to describe this movie is the Howling Meets Evil Dead 2. It is fast paced but still develops all of the characters so that you know and feel for each of them. There is hardly if any CGI effects in this movie which works to its benefit because it draws you more into the story and the utter eeriness of the upper Scotland woods. It is very hard these days to find a good horror movie that will make you jump then laugh a second later. Don't let the fact that there are no big name stars in dog soldiers let you miss this one if anything it adds to the feel of the movie it makes you feel as if you are one of the soldiers sitting around the campfire with them. It is one of the best horror movies out there and quite possibly the best werewolf movie ever made. Note: If you have the opportunity get the DVD with the making of extras and cast interviews it will give you not only a good look into what it takes to make a good horror movie but how to tell a story right from beginning to end.,Dog Soldiers

377,derenk66-1,Great action-horror combo,8,18 January 2007,"Excellent low-budget British film features a small squad of soldiers on a training exercise in the Scottish Highlands who find themselves battling bipedal, 7-foot tall werewolves that have already slaughtered one platoon. After their tough sergeant is badly wounded in the first encounter with the beasts, the soldiers barricade themselves in a remote farmhouse with a female zoologist and try to survive the night. The soldiers do have live ammunition, but the werewolves are not easy to kill. As the plot synopsis might indicate, this movie echoes ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Aliens"", and the original version of ""Assault on Precinct 13,"" but it has enough original touches so that it does not seem like a ripoff. The seven-foot tall bipedal werewolves are impressively scary and are not seen clearly until late in the film. Some reviews call this a horror-comedy, but the emphasis is definitely on the horror (as well as action), with comedy limited to a few throwaway lines. This does not have the jokey tone of ""An American Werewolf in London"" nor the sympathy-for-the-werewolf sensibilities of ""Wolf"" or older werewolf film such as ""The Wolfman"" or ""Curse of the Werewolf."" Though I usually like older, more subtle horror movies and am not fond of gore, this movie was exciting and suspenseful enough to overcome those objections. I can hardly wait to see Marshall's next film, ""The Descent.""",Dog Soldiers
378,luke2578,Pure entertainment and well used effects!,9,11 May 2002,"Having watched numerous horror movies and not been scared a bit, it is delightful to find that this movie scores its scare points. Disappointed with the Scream series, bored with Halloween and fed up with waiting for Evil Dead 4, Dog Soldiers is a rivetting film, with masterful editing to really scare the crap out of you.There is plenty of blood, violence (cartoon-style and normal) and ridiculous one-liners that are so funny you'll be laughing out loud to keep you entertained for the entire duration of the movie. The actors are just great! Kevin McKidd does a great job of grounding the movie, while Sean Pertwee (who has been a personal favourite of mine ever since his dry one liner in Event Horizon of ""This ship is f***ed"") is a true movie star and is able to bring comedy to the movie in the most frightening of situations.I have found that many horror movies have relied too heavily upon the cheapness of CGI to create their monsters. Anyone who has seen the disaster that was Resident Evil will know all about how computer generated monsters just don't have presence enough to scare you because, deep-down, you know they aren't there. The short flashes of imagery of the werewolves from the very beginning of this movie, in their animatronic form, add to the fact that you know they are there and that they can do real damage. Even with simple effects such as breath behind a soldier and showing only silhouettes of the beasts is more mentally frightening than a CGI shot of a werewolf. It seems to be a case of what you can't see makes it even scarier. Your mind fills in the blanks.All in all, it has been deemed as Aliens meets Evil Dead 2, which absolutely true. There is comedy, action, horror. This film is probably one of the best horror films I've seen in recent times and deserves to do well. Whether it will do well in America is an entirely different matter seeing as the first 5 minutes contains a lot of dialogue concerning football (or ""soccer"" so as not to confuse any Americans who might read this). However, that is not imperitive to the story. The most important factor is that this movie is genuinely scary and a whole lot of fun. Sean Pertwee is the British Bruce Campbell! Long live Sean Pertwee!!!",Dog Soldiers
379,originaladster,"British version of Aliens, best lads film in years",9,16 May 2002,"This has to be one of the most purely fun, quotable British films, nay, action movies, I've seen in a long time.  Yes sometimes the ""serious"" sections of the script are a little lacklustre, but the cheesy one liners, pitch black comedy and pure British humour more than make up for it(Darren Morfitt (Spoon) is actually from my town....He's a 'Pooly through and through!)Darren Morfitt (Spoon) in my and all my friends opinions completely stole the show and had the best line of all, but I won't reveal it as my friends did to me, I'll just let you enjoy it when it comes around :) That isn't to say the other actors don't give superb performances, Kevin McKidd was probably the most ""human"" character (no pun intended), with Liam Cunningham's Special Forces operative absolutely seething with evil, why he isn't up there with Alan Rickman as a great Brit Bad guy is beyond me... Also special mention should go to Sean Pertwee's cockernee Sgt. who (in my opinion) is always good even if the film is the most dire piece of offal (Anyone but me actually see ""Talos the Mummy""?)For the relatively tiny budget of the movie (3.5 million) the cast and crew have accomplished sooo much.  The werewolves look fantastic and, despite what some reviews say, we don't see too much of them, fleeting silhouettes etc are all we see for the most part which really adds to the tension and as the film progresses the werewolves come more and more into view as you would expect.One thing this film does accomplish though is that we actually WANT the main characters to win and kick the sh*t out of those hairy b*stards. Which Spoon does very well towards the end of the film...good ol' local boy :D we're very proud of him here in Hartlepool, brings a tear to the eye :').So, go and see it, with mates, drag the girlfriend if she's into this sort of thing, it's got machine guns, shotguns, explosions, intestines, nine foot tall werewolves, more intestines and some of the blackest humour since Peter Jackson last touched the genre.

382,nowtas,"A Bitch of A Movie? Yes, but also a demon of an Evil Dead clone...",8,26 May 2002,"The scenario to this was pretty decent - squaddies go out on routine training only to discover they are being used as bait for some nasty furballs in the remotest woodland Scotland has to offer. And worse - the only person around to help is involved in the horror far deeper than she wants to let on, and the only back up they could have had were so busy waiting for the monsters to pick off the hapless heroes that they have already provided themselves as a light snack before the main course. The survivors of the first few hours slowly start to be picked off inside a not particularly sturdy house, which the werewolves seem to know rather well. Oh, and the man responsible for setting the squaddies up has survived the initial attack, but is starting to become even more monsterous than the others are prepared for.I went to see this thinking it was a serious horror flick, which was a big mistake. Like Evil Dead before it (and in MANY ways), this is a comedy that just happens to involve some decent splatter. For a film rated 15 by the BBFC, it is VERY gory, with some lovely long shots of a major character having his guts hanging out for much of the movie. The special effects aren't very special, but the explosions are done well enough, and the weak werewolf make up doesn't matter much, since the actual ""look"" of the monsters is at least a little more impressive than in most such movies, with the camera work fast enough amongst the shadow environments to not focus on the weaknesses too much.With it's remote shack in the woods and surrounding monsters, this shows off the film makers admiration of The Evil Dead rather too loudly, the fast spins and pans of the camera not helping cover this any better than the sick sight gags. The variable acting is an unintentional dedication too, though the two male leads are fantastic, knowing exactly when to ham and when to play their roles straight (but it is a shame that the sole female in the cast has to make the scenery look more animated than herself, but whatever). The only way in which this film lags behind the genre classic is with the shoddy, needless romantic subplot, which it quickly establishes as being set to end in bloody tragedy anyway. In actually making the deaths of the supporting characters quite so tragic, this film actually carries more emotional resonance than The Evil Dead anyway.Still, the gags are sick enough to provide some laughs, the task of using superglue to fix a severe stomach wound being a personnal favourite. The story rules then, the visual and audio side of direction coping well with the low budget (it being a BRITISH horror movie and all, I guess the cast and crew had little to work with), and the needless but still smugly enjoyable coverage of a recent international footie result is one of numerous clever little touches that establish the films national credentials without losing sight of what is important here - insane amounts of blood and guts and screaming men.

The characters are thoroughly unlikable all across the board, the script is completely hackneyed, the performances don't help, the camera work is annoying, and the editing makes this feel like a B-movie from the 70s.

The newspaper headline ""Werewolves ate my troop"" (or words to that effect) was hilarious for two reasons.1. Anyone remember the actual tabloid headline ""Freddie Starr ate my hamster"" ?? 2.

Reminded me somewhat of the first Highlander, or even Terminator, when those franchises hadn't gotten ""slicked up"" yet. If you can suspend belief long enough to watch a werewolf movie, you can overlook the weapons/strategy gaffes, and the really ultra-cheesy tent scene at the beginning. I enjoyed the ""footy"" talk, and the different accents among the men showing they were from different regions of Britain/Scotland. Glad the border collie behaved. That might have been too much to take. Also glad they didn't try to show you exactly what the werewolves looked like, that also would have spoiled a decent little movie.",Dog Soldiers

In fact, Dog Soldiers tells a story of a suburban commando of Her Majesty who trespasses into the Highlands where a complete family of werewolves is lurking. Combined by worthy special effects in action scenes but a drudge director, the special makeup on the monsters is totally ridiculous. Gory scenes are extremely expected: the monsters are behind the windows or sitting in the back. Poor spectator! It's a bad lousy sequel of Predator The First One with Arnold. For the passionate, the beginning is a little slow, but once it gets started, it doesn't stop (fortunately): enormously litters of blood and pretty little red guts.

Which they're not. The plot is pretty standard - a group of people stranded in the woods, with the obligatory chick. The dialogues are forced, the bad guy is being treated as one before actually doing anything bad (except a minor thing in the beginning), characters in general can't take bad news calmly and rationaly and must over-react by cursing and beating each other up. The werewolves must've been bothered from a nearby geriatrics center because they sure showed no sign of being the blindingly fast predators which they are supposed to be.

It's innovative and doesn't stink of the ""re-make"" boom of today, which quite frankly I'm getting a little miffed with because it says to me that Hollywood is going through a stale period where all they can seem to do is ""re-make"" classic movies because they don't have any originality to make a NEW film.Anyway, the story of Dog Soldiers is basically a film about Brit squadies with werewolves in, and I was very impressed with the dialogue because it is actually how Brit soldiers really act. The Special Effects of Bob Keen really capture the essence of terror and realism with peoples insides being ripped apart by hungry and very realistic lycanthropes. Not that I know what a real werewolf looks like as I've never met one. *chuckle* When watching it, I can't help but feel that there is a very tongue-in-cheek aspect to the film. I mean, who, in this world, would have a bareknuckle fistfight with a werewolf?

All the ingredients for success are there, but it is so poorly formatted that it is painful to watch.  The story line could have been elaborated on a little more, but with something to make it more unique. A community of werewolves?  Brings back memories of The Howling, but afterall, there are only so many directions you can go with a werewolf movie. But the worst part of all had to be the werewolves themselves.

The actors are spot on and the dialogue sharp and witty and for once without the use of computer effects, the wolves looked pretty scary. I also liked this movie because it uses genuine British actors who don't need to use typical ""stiff upper lip"" accents like Americans like to use for us. I'm from the North East of England and particularly liked the use of the Geordie lads who make up most of the comedy by talking about a footy match that they should have been watching.

So lets take this from a true Brit perspective as it was meant to be taken shall we! This film is one of the best flicks to come our of the UK in a good while. There's no cheeky cockney wide boy gangsters and so on, and more importantly, no effin Vinny Jones! All there is, is an assortment of easily relatable Brit blokes stuck in a wood with Werewolves after them.And so begins the gratuitous violence. And yes, it is gratuitous, but would it be a Brit flick without it? No. You could dress it down and throw in the odd blood splatter on a wall, but Dog Soldiers isn't going to do that. It's going to show you some chap with his intestines dangling round his mid rift because its not trying to be a Hollywood film, its trying to be a British film. It embraces the more in your face attitude of European cinema and sticks two fingers up to the over blown censorship that seems to blight Hollywood these days. (Anyone who feels i'm wrong with this comment should probably sit down and watch Alien V Predator and see how they turned two good adult franchises, into nothing more than a lame kiddies movie.) The humour is cut throat in places. Best line (Spoiler ahead) comes when one of the soldiers is about to be devoured by a werewolf, and gets in his face and says ""I hope i give you the shits!"" I mean come on, this is what we want. Real men not fannying about, but giving it some balls. And its this slightly warped laddish humour that carries this film through what is to be fair an average plot, and turns it into the sort of film that you can sit and really enjoy. It's no horror film by any stretch of the imagination. Its more a black action comedy than anything else. There's plenty of gore, plenty of swearing, and it works for that fact. It's a real mans film. So if you're planning on something that'll make you think and so on, forget this.

Not many movies these days are something original, It's either a remake or based off a book of some kind which even if the movie is really good, that does get kind of annoying just like this long review I'm writing. Another thing I love about this movie is the HUGE lack of CGI... that makes me so happy to see how much work and effort this team put into making this movie awesome! I honestly don't care for CGI, and if I ever make my horror script into my own film, it WILL NOT have any either, all makeup and props only. The only thing that I don't agree with on this movie is how fast a Dog Soldier can heal. it's like, instantly. Other than that, I don't think I have too many spoilers, but I rather be safe than sorry... I just wish they would make that Fresh Meat sequel I've been reading about for the last decade.

There are no CGI affect so the werewolf costumes aren't so realistic as one would hope but you almost never see them only all the blood and guts they create.The best thing the ending everyone dies and one soldier lives and during the film thers been a soccer match between England and Germany and at the end a front page of a newspaper shows up and the big headline is ENGLAND 5 Germany 1 and in the down right corner thers a small window were it says 'werewolf ate my platoon' It was so funny I actually started to laugh when I saw it.",Dog Soldiers

407,geeseegee,What is everyone talking about?,1,23 April 2004,"I've just read everybody else's comments on this film, and to be perfectly honest, I couldn't believe my eyes.  I can only assume that all these people who posted reviews were cast/crew, or friends/family of them.This is, undoubtedly, the worst film I have ever seen.  As horror films go, this is even worse than Cabin Fever.  With the sole exception of Liam Cunningham, the acting was appalling.  Absolutely appalling.  I have seen better at my niece's Christmas panto.  Secondly, the characters were 1 dimensional and entirely uninteresting.  I couldn't care less what happened to any of them, (even the really ""brave"" one who had a fistfight with a werewolf!  What the hell is that about?), hence absolutely no build up of tension at all.Thirdly, the effects.  Oh boy.  From rubber balloon ""intestines"" to stuffed terrier looking werewolf heads, they were hilarious.  You will find yourself laughing at loud.  Especially at the ""gruesome"" and ""horrific"" sight of a pet dog eating a soldier's innards.  Good god.Fourthly, the editing.  I presume this whole waste of 90 minutes was written, directed and edited by a handful of bored 14 year-olds studying for a GCSE in Media Appreciation.  This film should be shown as an exercise in how not to edit.  In an attempt to convey a sense of urgency and action, we are ""treated"" to some staggering montages of quick succession cuts.  These do not work at all.  It is like watching an episode of Mighty Morphing Power Rangers.  On amphetamines.I could write a whole page on the loopholes in the plot.  Perhaps the best example of this is the werewolf family who have no silver in the house, but think it would be a great idea to drag a silver letter opener all the way from one of their kills, and hide it in the basement. Clever.Basically, this film can only be described as horrendous.  Do not see it. You will regret wasting an hour and a half of your life if you do.  And if, by any chance, anyone involved in the production should be reading this, you should hang your head in shame and get a job down McDonalds flipping burgers.Thank you and goodnight.",Dog Soldiers

It actually gives you a feeling of dread about sitting through the whole thing - fantastic.It goes for the subtle images rather than expensive special effects and it suits the mood set by the rest of the film.Also some amusing bits in where another film and a famous event are referred to which all add to the amusement - especially for us english people!Top quality.",Dog Soldiers

They are bad and they love human meat. Good luck to a British army assault troop that went there to learn how to chase enemies and, indeed, became chased.And forget also the excitement of the true natural world. Camping in solitary woods could be the most of romanticism but if monsters are in your way, maybe the best is our quiet and boresome home. And, lastly, be not fascinated by these old and pitoresque styles of life dating from decades ago. Maybe they hide something hazardous.",Dog Soldiers
410,martin.mckenna,"""What happened?! We were attacked by huge ****ing howling things, that's what!""",8,20 November 2002,"Much has already been said about the various horror movie influences on 'Dog Soldiers' and its similarities to other films, horror or otherwise ('Straw Dogs' etc.).  For me it recalled the pleasures of first viewings, long ago, of films such as 'An American Werewolf In London' and 'The Thing'. Importantly for me I was very pleasantly surprised by just how good the werewolf effects are, perhaps having expected far worse.  At their best, particularly the almost subliminal glimpses of werewolf silhouettes early on, they're among the very best werewolf effects I've seen.  Some shots prove less convincing, but overall the creature costumes are remarkably effective (that said, some glowing eyes would've been nice!) - recalling the great early-'80s days of Rick Baker and Rob Bottin.It's very nicely filmed indeed, the shaky camerawork and the editing of the various action sequences having a definite 'Saving Private Ryan' realism about them.  Great atmosphere.Overall the performances and dialogue have conviction, from Sean Pertwee and Kevin McKidd especially, and provide a fairly convincing portrayal - it seems to me - of soldiers in action.  The characterizations definitely appeal for once to entirely British sensibilities.  Too bad if you don't appreciate the very British humour; I suppose its not really intended for universal appeal, which in itself is refreshing.Most of the basic plot devices hold together well, but quite why Megan (Emma Cleasby) helps the soldiers throughout, given the eventual (predictable) revelation about her character, is a total mystery.  As is the strangely civilized existence led by these werewolf folk in general - they own a pet collie?? It may be nonsense, but it's good old-fashioned monster movie nonsense, the like of which we've not seen for a while - and it's British, which makes a wonderful change.  Even British television productions haven't touched on fantasy subjects, and certainly not horror, in a very, very long time.More like this....please!",Dog Soldiers
411,Mr_Brown,Werewolves in Scotland?,9,17 November 2002,".. thats what I thought when I read about this movie. But who doesn't like campy monster flicks with dudes in costumes running around strangling amateur actors. Boy, was I wrong. Far from being campy, this is one of the many horror films that take themselves seriously, but only one of the few, that succeed. This movie has tight action, scary werewolves, good acting (Kevin McKidd of Trainspotting fame) and many plot twists. True, there are a lot of clichees (""I won't leave you to die""), but they are so well executed and fit so nicely into the whole concept, that it's a joy to watch. One-liners a la Evil Dead are abundant, as are blood and guts. The latter put even genre kings like Tom Savini to shame. The action is nicely framed by a truly scary prologue (never go camping in Scotland) and a great National Enquirer style ending.One of the best monster movies right up there with From Dusk Til Dawn. Skip the edited version that the SciFi channel has been airing and rent this movie now. 9/10",Dog Soldiers

The first time I saw this movie it really freaked me out I could picture one of those werewolf's walking through my door!!!! I take my hat off to the writer Neil Marshall I would like to Thank him for such a great movie and yes it is better than those American movies by far. The acting in this film is fantastic I will now look for more of Neil Marshall's films.

414,Poison_Ivy-1,What a monstrous masterpiece this werewolf movie is!,10,22 July 2006,"By all means a positive surprise.I've watched many a horror movie in my time, so I'm always skeptical whenever I either go to the movies or to the video store. However, this movie just made my jaw drop; I watched this movie very late at night all by myself and I was so scared! However, I do have a slightly hyperactive imagination, but still...WOW! So why is it so good? Well, first of all the acting is really good. You really invest in these characters. Second of all, the werewolves are NOT CGI! The way they look is just so utterly creepy, especially because they have a very original design (at least in my opinion). Thirdly, the script is great; it's nice to watch a horror movie where the cast isn't a bunch of teens you couldn't care less about. The dialog is at times very, very funny. Not involuntarily funny, but funny because the writer intended it to be so.You should watch this movie if you like horror films that are a bit untraditional or if you want to see a convincing werewolf movie with great acting.IMPORTANT! I've heard the US TV version has been trimmed horribly. Therefore I must insist you see the DVD version. The region 2 DVD version also features one of the most hilarious commentary tracks ever recorded in DVD history, which makes the region 2 version the most recommendable version of all.",Dog Soldiers

Even a bit of humour in there. I think its easily the best werewolf film ever. Why? Because the Spoon's humour mixed with the superb plot makes a perfect horror film. But did any of those six soldiers survive the full-moon? Did any survive the night? Did they survive to find out England beat Germany 5-1. Who knows. And who is Captain Ryan really? Special Ops, or something deeper? Joe, Spoon, Terry, Sarge, Cooper and Bruce vs a Pack of hungry bloodthirsty Werewolfs?

418,cskuza,not bad but disappointing - high expectations,5,3 October 2006,"From what I have heard about this movie I was really curious and were looking forward to see it. A bit of Aliens, Predator, ..... . That is what it is. It has its own atmosphere, its own speed and charm. But still I was disappointed. I was disappointed because I heard so much about it and because I have seen many horror flicks like this one. If it had not been promoted as ""the best werewolf movie ever"" and ""one of the best newcomers like evil dead"", my expectations would not have been that high. But unfortunately I could not find anything new in the film, nothing that would make it into a movie, that plays in the same league as aliens or predator do. It is too predictable and to stoic in some scenes so that slapstick takes the lead over fear and action many times - it is important to give background info and to create atmosphere and that is what it is trying to do by all means. Maybe wanted to much by this film. The acting is moderate; the sergeant and cooper are good but the others do not all contribute to a cool mixed team as it is in alien or predator. Especially the other soldiers in cooper's team look too similar to each other. The action scenes are quite good and the werewolves look good too but there is real strange changing difference in their speed and movement. You will see it when you compare the speed they have from their perspective and the speed they have when you see them in a long shot or close up. The music is OK too but could be more energetic and not so monotonic in the action scenes. So all in all the movie is not bad but not as great as some people suggest, especially the producers, who claim it to be outstanding. If I had not seen all the advertisements, the claims, .... it would surely have received a better rating.",Dog Soldiers
419,dark_days88,i love this film!,10,6 November 2006,"And why you say? simply because: 1) I am Scottish and OK it may not have been filmed in Scotland but the idea of werewolves found in one place and that being Scotland is very respectful because as anyone who has ever been in a forest in Scotland will know it can be scary, and you definitely don't feel alone!2)My second name is WOTHERSPOON which is pretty darn close to witherspoon.3)My first name is MEGAN also a character in the film!and i know what you're probably thinking it's probably ""yeah right she's so totally lying just so this all fits and she becomes someone special"" but seriously it's all true.plus the acting is top of the class in my opinion. I have to admit the only reason i ever got to see this film is because my brother and his friend were into the army and wanted to join (neither of them have) so they found this film and watched it but i decided to as well (much to the disappointment of my brother he's not gay if thats what you're thinking he just doesn't like me being there when he has friends round) and at first i thought ""why am i watching this? i don't like the army and im not that interested in werewolf film"" but needless to say i so utterly glad i did i rated this film 10 out of 10 purely because it kept me on the edge of my seat and brought the highs the lows the joys and the sadness that a great classic film should.

420,Hirsch-2006,Dog Soldiers,10,25 October 2006,"Dog Soldiers is one of the best werewolf movies ever made it's up there with The Howling, the werewolf customs are great realistic and the story was good. I like that there was no big actors in the movie which made you focus on everyone I love that it was set in England Highlands and that all the actors where English, I like the setting in the middle of the forest not in some city which is stupid I don't mind a small town with a forest near it but otherwise forget it! I also like that they didn't use cgi, and that made the werewolves more real because of natural movements.Great movie and there making a second Dog Soldiers called Fresh Meat which I read the storyline and I think it's great if they don't change the werewolf customs and stick to the same settings in the forest and keep it an English Style movie great.Also finally they mention they may make a third Dog Soldiers which may be a Prequel which would be better then making Dog Soldiers into a Vampires & Zommbie Vs Werewolves which would absolutely suck. It would be good to know were it all started how the the girl and her family turned into werewolves.Thanks very much watch the movie it's great.",Dog Soldiers
421,rich386,An action film with bite!,9,17 May 2002,"As the director says, this is really a film about soldiers, with werewolves thrown in for good measure.And it works.  The werewolves aren't the centrepiece of the film, though obviously they are essential to the story.  Sean Pertwee and Kevin McKidd play intensely believable roles and Liam Cunningham portrays the bad guy right from the start.The film has great pace from beginning to end, helped by impressive cinematography.  The sense of isolation and confusion builds up well, making the soldiers' responses all the more believable as they fall back on training and discipline to see them through the initial werewolf attacks before having time to attempt to comprehend the supernatural aspects of their situation.This is more an action film than a horror film, with plenty of gunfire, blood and guts, but that's not to say there isn't a strong element of suspense.  No time is wasted in attempting to present an origin for the werewolves; they simply exist and their motives are clear and immediate.Some of the plot twists are perhaps predictable, but equally there are a few red herrings to keep the audience guessing.  And thankfully there is only the one ""Hollywood moment"".9/10 (I could only give ""Aliens"" a perfect 10 in this combination of genres).",Dog Soldiers

Given that I've seen ""Mindhunters"" this year, that's a fairly big statement.""Dog Soldiers"" seems to fancy itself original, but it's as tired as a sixth ""Aliens"" movie and as believable as Shatner's toupee. The special effects are atrocious, the creators of the film asking us to feel sick at the sight of cherry gelatin tubes and frightened over people on stilts, wearing wolf-like makeup and hair. The fast motion camera shtick that British films have been using lately is quite prevalent and I suggest not looking directly at the screen for fear of headache.I would rather sit through an unedited version of ""Gosford Park"" than see anything from Neil Marshall again.",Dog Soldiers

426,maddog1916,A lot of cheap fun,7,13 May 2002,"Its about time england started making films that dont dwell on the fact that their english. Dog Soldiers is an english film but would fit perfectly in a video shelf beside evil dead or the exorcist, unlike Billy Elliot or Four weddings which might as well have an english flag on the cover. These films try to entertain us using decisevly british characters as the center of attention, and hope the audience are amused by those english folks antics. Dog Soldiers lets the story entertain and the characters deliver. Made for 3.5million, Dog Soldiers is cheap as hell, and also entertaining as hell. The story revolves around a group of soldiers unknowingly being used as bait to catch a warewolf deep in the woods. After an attack by what must be half a dozen eight feet tall dogs with teeth like knives they take refuge in a house. The first half of the film are the least impressive, probably because all the money went towards the second half, and it was well worth it. Lots of very stupid, gory, and entertaining action happens in the second half with the audience never been given a minute to rest. This is what first time director Neil Marshall does best. He sets up lots of scenes full of tension, action, and gore and lets his actors really shine when there confronted by the beasts. One character, a short guy from newcastle, is up there with bruce lee and luke skywalker as becoming one of my favourite heroes in a film after he takes on an eight feet tall warewolf by himself with his barehands. Whether he wins or not i wont ruin for you, but the adrenalin he works up for the audience is amazing. This scene is one of the most enjoyable i've ever seen as the whole audience is cheering for the little guy and get so much delight every time he lands a punch to the werewolf. I doubt Tobey Maguire as spiderman can get the audience behind him as much as this guy in the 80million spiderman. The script is nothing special, but they never are in this kind of movie. Also the budget is sometimes noticeable with many lighting mistakes. Overall though, i think Neil Marshall has potential and i look forward to his next, hopefully with a better budget. Stupid as it may be, Dog Soldiers is one of the most enjoyable horrors in years and deserves a lot of success.",Dog Soldiers

As others have commented, this was not a comedy, rather a tear wrenching movie comparable to Saving Private Ryan. In fact, in the director's commentary (which is a must see), the director stated as much. The director's cinematic vision was to create a masterpiece that did not have to stoop to using unnecessary CGI effects, but rather focused on amazing costumes and complex plot, savy character development, and cinematastic dialogue. Yes, if I had to use one movie to teach children about the consequences of war and werewolves, I would vehemently choose this one.

It harks back to the cult movie ethos of (fairly) unknown actors, top notch acting, low budget effects and octane driven action, proving that Hollywood should return back to these roots. Great one liners, coupled with an incling of squaddie behaviour, show an attention to detail, missing in a few so-called blockbusters we could mention.

All the way though the film I was captivated, I'm not sure whether it was the humour or horror aspect but they managed to get it spot on, parts of he movie had me tense whilst other parts had me laughing until it hurt!All in all I think for anyone who enjoys comedy/horror this is a must see, best movie I've seen in ages. Can't wait until it comes out on DVD!Go see it!!",Dog Soldiers

Although I liked it a lot, since it was funny and gory and exciting, I was very annoyed with the bad technical quality of this movie. As soon as the action gets ""tough"" (i.e. fast), you get the feeling that they shot not enough pictures per second. The images get blurry and/or clipped. And the wolves just looked ridiculous to me. If they had spent more money on the technical effects, this movie would be hilarious! What I also found very interesting was that this movie was rated ""15"" in the UK. It´s really gory and might be quite scary for juveniles (heck, even for adults). I don´t know what they thought in not rating it ""R"". But all in all, I´m glad I saw it. And for fans of the genre it´s a must.",Dog Soldiers

But when the dead cow fell to the ground, so did the movie. There are so many scenes and so much dialog and plot twists that just don't make any sense.the werewolves must have some kind of multiple personality.. one is intelligent and hunts like the predator, and can sneak into the house without anyone seeing them. The other is so stupid it tries to crawl into the house through the mailbox.And why isn't the girl a werewolf when the moon is full?Anyway.. It's a dumb movie and i only watched it to the end because I paid for it.All the ""scary"" scenes are way to predictable.. There is not one single surprise in the whole movie.

452,odonnellp,Proper British patter at its best,9,5 November 2002,"I really liked this film, mostly for the dialogue. This is the first film I've ever seen with proper English 'patter', meaning banter. Two of the actors and the director were from the North East of England and it really showed. Some of the jokes that I thought were hilarious would have been totally missed by someone not from this area of England, or at least from the UK. For example, the simple 'Cheers mate' when somebody is saved from certain death by the timely arrival of Kevin McKidd, the 'come and have a go if you think you're hard enough' bit. The first 10 mins had me in stitches, with non stop micky taking at high speed. With 90% of the films we see being American it is quite rare to see one and get every joke, every reference, every mannerism and expression. This was right up my street. I'm not sure if it will travel well though. A uniquely British film. Its just a pity it was filmed in Luxembourg, not Scotland",Dog Soldiers
453,Jack_McG,"Comedy, action and horror! What more could you want?",10,2 October 2002,"Dog Soldiers is a fantastic film and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun film which requires little brain power to follow.

I take pride in watching every horrible monster flick on SciFi and assumed ""Dog Soldiers"" would just be another notch on my belt. Little did I know I was about to see what has become one of my all time favorite movies. The dialogue, the effects, the characters, everything about this movie kicked butt. I loved it so much I hunted down the DVD as soon as I could; I just had to see it unedited.In the years since I picked up the DVD I have watched Dog Soldiers numerous times and it never gets old. This movie doesn't rely on computer generated fakery, which puts it well above the bulk of werewolf movies that have come out in the last 10 years or so. You can really imagine one of these 9 foot beasts crawling through your bedroom window. If you want a good werewolf flick that doesn't use cartoon looking dogs, has a sense of humor, and a decent bit of gore, you should check out Dog Soldiers.",Dog Soldiers
455,michael_moller,"Not bad, but not great either !",7,12 October 2002,"I just saw the flick ""Dog Soldiers"". I was ""warned"" about it being a lowbudget film and had read several reviews before i saw with a couple of mates. I think its a decent werewolf-film with a few problems :1) The characters are a bit shallow with a few exeptions, and that makes you a bit indifferent about whether they die or not (its difficult telling them apart in their camo-outfits).2) There is not enough fear being displayed in our little group of trapped soldiers. I know there are tough british soldiers, but still, it would add to the suspense and general ""hey what a s***** situation""-feel, if we saw more fear in the troops. The jokes some of the soldiers find time and mental capacity to let out under attack is a bit misplaced (if it was me i wouldnt stand and think of oneliners, when a 7 foot werewolf was standing in striking distance...but hey thats just me !).3) The film ""borrows"" a lot of material form other films, especially ""Aliens"", but also ""The Howling"" and a lot of other films.When all that is said, it is fair to say we had a good time with a ""thats a good old-time werewolf-film""-feeling, with no state-of-the-art computergraphics (THANK GOD !!), and if you take a look at the budget and what these guys had to work with i/we think they made a decent job of it, producing an entertaining flick suited for a videoevening with the mates on a gloomy autumm-evening.

This movie for some reason was never released on the big screen in the USA and I can't understand why? This movie is a cross between American Werewolf in London and Predator! It has wilderness,a British Platoon, an old farmhouse, and lots of werewolves... I wont go into details about the movies plot, I'll leave that up to you to see it .. the basics are a british platoon goes in the far woods on a military training mission, they stumble across another dead platoon and find themselves running from shadows chasing after them..finally they find refuge in an old farmhouse where they prepare for the worst. I must say after i saw this movie I wanted to own it, it is the best werewolf movie since An American Werewolf in London. There aren't that many werewolf movies out there that are top notch..but this one satisfies.. The actors are british, so there are no big stars that we here in america recognize... the werewolves are the best...no CGI... but scary enough for you to leap off of your couch..

It's on the top of the werewolf movies list on http://listverse.com/2007/11/27/top-15-best-werewolf-movies/. There are some reasons for that: it's not a uninspired Hollywood movie, the movie budget was only a few million $, but the director made what most of the directors can't make with half a billion dollars, the atmosphere reminds me of 'Aliens'... I like old school horrors like Evil Dead, Braindead, but this is not that type of horror. Only thing that connects old B-horrors and Dog Soldiers is a brilliant director. This is an example that just a little imagination is enough to make a great movie, not a lot of money. In conclusion, great action horror movie.

462,ZXoftheDarkness,A Big Surprise!,8,27 November 2009,"--Dog Soldiers Review--I was bored one night and decided to flick on the sci-fi channel and see if I could find myself a ""funny"" B-Film to watch. I saw that dog soldiers was about to start and i'm thinking to myself. ""Oh god this is gonna be hilarious"".It was hilarious, not in how bad it was though, in how good it was. I was completely surprised. I would like to point right off of the bat that all of the actors that were in this movie were amazing and a couple were hilarious. Another thing I would like to point out is that the werewolves were amazingly well done, as this film was reportedly low budget. The plot had an unexpected twist at the end when the girl transformed into a werewolf, which completely surprised me. The film also knew it's budget limits. Such as when the special ops in the black uniform was transforming into a werewolf, he fell behind the table and the transformation stayed out of site, which was good it made the film seem more professional by not having the low budget special effects shown.This movie, while it had a clever script and some very funny lines, was also scary. Some parts made me jump right out off my couch. Also the gore, as expected of a horror film it was very gory. There were guts taken out.... and put back in. Some of the gore parts were hilarious, other parts added to the sincerity of the film. I really think that this film was quality enough of a low budget film to receive a mainstream release, it should have.Plot: 7/10 Werewolf Designs: 9/10 Acting: 9/10 Script: 8/10 Directing: 8/10 Set Design and Lighting: 7/10Overall Rating: 8/10 (Recommended)I Hope You All Find Some Usefulness From My Review",Dog Soldiers

464,DrJ-72,A rare gem.,10,28 March 2003,"Well, to say I liked Dog Soldiers would be an understatement. I fully believe that this one will become at the very least a cult classic.Anyway, here's my attempt at an objective critique (starting at 5 out of 10): Fair to good story (+1), excellent setting (+2), realistic interaction between the soldiers (I'm in the military) (ie. above average acting (mostly)) (+1), good to above average special effects (+1), no serious continuity blunders (that I noticed) (no points, this should be standard), some classic funny bits (+1). AND I liked the ending (fairly important, for me) (+1). Total points: 12 (max is 10, so 10 out of 10).There is a genre that I feel should exist: low-budget/non-hollywood brilliance. Dog Soldiers is now part of my list of movies included therein. Some of the others are (in no order) American Werewolf In London, Terminator, French Vampire In America, The Castle, and The Professional to name but a few.I'll leave it there, otherwise this would become a bit of a rant.",Dog Soldiers

So the cast get picked off one by one depending on how big they are in Britain. And you always know who survives before the end of the titles.

Taking its influence from such great classics as American Werewolf in London, Evil Dead, Aliens and Zulu.What I liked best was the good representation of the North Eastern members of the squad who come across as real life geordies, with the typical wit and sarcasm one would expect.The plot is thin but thats not important, the basic premise is that a squad of British (mainly Geordie) soldiers are on an exercise in Scotland when they encounter a family of werewolves. What follows is a kind of Zulu / Aliens / Evil Dead defence against the nasties senario.The action is cracking and the interaction between the leads brilliant using good examples of squadie humour and northern grit.The effects for the werewolves is poor but don't let that put you off, and there are loads of brilliant scenes as the squaddies are chewed up on by one.

Horror, werewolves, ultra-violence, gore, great writing, great acting, wonderful dark humor, terrific special effects and of course, a babe.I won't bore you with a play-by-play but I'll just say it is brilliantly original from start to finish.

A great film does not need to be unique, as Dog Soldiers has been criticised as it is not unique.  For example, James Bond has been greatly influential for other spy movies which have done extremely well.  Uniqueness is not the key aspect for an all time classic. A perfect film has great cast of characters, a continuously suspense-filled plot line, and excellent performances.  Dog Soldiers embodies all of these and more!

Okay, I watched it in an almost-empty theatre, with a great sound-system, so each time something howled right under my butt, I couldn't help but to flinch.But besides, it was a great ride. The GB-style and setting added this one some credibility, the tongue-in-cheek approach saved it from becoming cheesy, and the action goddamned DELIVERED. Not exactly a horror movie, but then again, you can't do credible horrors these days, even The Ring was more a psych thriller.. the populace needs more than just a scary monster to get tied. However, as an Aliens 2/Predator 1 ""tough squad against impossible odds"" all-out slugfest, this one works surprisingly well. Would have been a lousy Hollywood flick, but without deafening music, OTT hero stunts (Spoon aside:), and stupidity explained only by the needs of the drama (greetings to The Rock and other ""military"" crap) Dog Soldiers is some great time.

This usually leads to me being able to laugh at terrifically horrible acting and plots. However, I was blown away when I saw this movie. I'm amazed that it hasn't been given any mainstream recognition. Werewolf movies are seldom done and when they are they are generally not very good (See American Werewolf in Paris)
The makeup effects in this film are a testament to the true art that is being lost to the modern age of computer generated imagery. The things looked downright scary.

As if it was shoot with video-cameras instead of movie-cameras.Besides that it's hard to watch a movie where people do not communicate with each-other, just to build up the suspense.

The fact that it was on sale didn't help, but I braced myself and got it figuring that if it was bad, I'd bury it in some deep deep cave and never let it out. But the movie got me out of my seat with excitement and enjoyment at the action and the thrills. I remember checking the time on the DVD player and wincing at the fact I had only half an hour of film left to enjoy. True, I have seen better special effects. And true some things aren't very realistic (and the producers acknowledge those things).

Were the werewolves the best? Probably not. But they weren't bad. No crappy CGI which ruined Blade II, the Hulk, Van Helsing, and the list goes on...I think the director said it best when he said they wanted to make a military movie about werewolves, rather than a werewolf movie with soldiers.

I saw the most popular werewolf movie of all time according to many "" An American Werewolf in London"", I like it and I was like great, a really good movie for its time in 1981.But, after watching Dog soldiers I was like, Wow! It didn't have the transformation of the werewolves like in "" An American Werewolf in London""!But who cares,the werewolves in ""Dog Soldiers"" were more scary , more ferocious, more taller and even smarter and less vulnerable.And the violence,blood and gore and action and everything was first class for a werewolf movie. The acting and the script was great, and the actors too ,I didn't find any real flaw in the movie , but only one thing that the story was much simpler and could have been a little better, but who cares, I liked it very much and I think this movie is much underrated for its standards, It at least deserves a 7.4 on average because I recently saw some garbage action flick movie getting 7.7 and I felt bad for some more deserving ones like this one.The actors in the movie were less known except a few, but one should consider their acting and performance rather than their reputation or fame.Well, I gave it a 9 as werewolves are my favorite mythical creatures and this one is the best movie in this category and deserves it.",Dog Soldiers

But when they find the special forces torn up, the movie quickly pulled up its socks and provided entertainment.This movie is a mixture of Aliens and Predator with werewolves instead of alien or predator. The marines actions are actually believable and smart, unlike most horror movies (in which run from killer, fall and killer catch up and kill) The reactions of the marines are realistic and the makeup and costumes are....different. The werewolves were not as scary as i thought they would be, but still very nice. By the end of the night, the marines do not fear the werewolves and stand up to them instead of run.Personally, my favorite character was SP (spoon). He was always ready for action and went out fighting, if only he lasted another 10 minutes...he would of survived.Still, the movie proves to be very entertaining, fun, and packed with action,suspense and thrilling consequences.9/10",Dog Soldiers

Especially about the character, Spoon. At one point he finds himself without a weapon and face to face with a werewolf. He takes a deep breath and then actually ""puts up his dukes"". He goes toe to toe with a werewolf and puts up a pretty good fight. He loses, but he gave it a run for it's money. Considering your dealing with fantasy, the action and re-actions of the characters are VERY believable. The only thing that they screwed up with is that, if the first team knew what they were trying to capture, ( they had to since they had gone to the trouble of hiring a zoologist and brought tranquilizer guns and everything) why didn't they come when there wasn't a full moon and capture them while they were still people. Megan said that it was the only farm house for 50 K. It shouldn't have been hard for even the so called ""Military Intelligence"" to figure that one out. Even with that little inconsistency I liked it so much that after having seen it a hundred times on various TV stations, I finally broke down and bought my own DVD.",Dog Soldiers
487,jordan-aslett,A treatise on why you should hire a real editor to cut your movie,7,19 April 2005,"The movie was good as far as digital shaky British movies go. The plot was convoluted and hard to follow towards the end, but hey, it's a werewolf movie so I'm not going to complain too much. I really appreciated the fact that they relied on make-up for the wolf costumes, I will never stop saying how much good costumes and make-up, even if they don't look ""REALLY REALLY REAL"", always trumps even some of the best CGI garbage that comes out.All in all I liked it a great deal, this fact notwithstanding, I need to comment on the editing, specifically during the non-action scenes.My views can be summed up in one sentence: When two or more people are having a conversation during a slow moment in the film, it is not necessary to cut to a close up each time someone chimes in.This makes your film look silly. I wanted to hunt down the director and feed him some Concerta and/or Ritalin. I do not have attention deficit disorder and I CAN pay attention to a scene shot in mediums and over the shoulders without 3 cuts per second.Anyways, I liked the movie, but next time I hope this guy hires a real editor.",Dog Soldiers
488,boarhunter178,A classic howler...,10,16 July 2006,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Unlike most horror movies that involve military elements, it does not make them out to be the 'bad guys.' There is a conspiracy, but it is not on a 'government' level, and the perpetrator seems to be a bit of a rogue who pulled a fast one on both his superiors and subordinates. This is not an effects-driven movie with no plot, with a lot of pointless gore to make up for it. This movie definitely deserves a full ten: no major plot holes, no 'the end?' finish, no pointless story elements, no exaggerated acting. Somehow, this movie had a 'believable' quality to it.I recommend this movie to all viewers, horror fans or not. I hope the upcoming sequel does not ruin the greatness of the original.",Dog Soldiers
489,Steel_Spider,the dogs bite back... well for a while,10,11 May 2005,"I saw this film by accident, what can i say? a cold wet night with nothing to do but the local cinema. I now believe in destiny. For anyone who has an appreciation of forces humour, for all those that love the nods to well loved films, if you ever shout ""i don't believe they're doing it"" in horrors, this is it. The plot is simple, but then again most good ideas are, the characters superbly played and the action builds to a crescendo that has you cheering (or booing depending on your affinity with lycanthropes) along.The photography is perfect for the film, in fact that sums this great piece of cinema, everything fits, it compliments itself beautifully to allow you to wallow in gore, laugh nervously, and hope for the best.Got to run, kettle's on.",Dog Soldiers
490,hanna-burman91,You can never grow tired of it,10,15 October 2014,"When I saw this movie for the first time I was 13-14 and it nearly scared me to tears. now I'm 23 and loving every minute of it. You can never grow tired of this movie, regardless of how many times you watch it, you can always find something new. Just the right amount of scare, just the right amount of laugh, just the right amount of everything. Although I don't love the main character that much,I find him rather flat and that the movie focus too much on the fact that he is a good guy and ""could go so far in the military"", which they don't show, just tell us about. But it makes me more invested in what happens to everyone else. The actors play it straight for the most part, even when it's funny. The costumes are amazing and when you know the secrets in the scenes, you will never see the movie the same way again. Watch it in the dark alone, watch it with directors comment and watch it with your friends, so many hours so much fun. This is a must see for anyone who calls them self a horror movie lover.(I apologize if anything is misspelled, English is not my native language //Hanna)",Dog Soldiers
491,Iain_Stoneroses,Not the dog's B******s!,4,15 April 2007,"I would have to say that this film is more of a comedy than a scary werewolf film! I had been told by a few of my friends that this was a great film, and from the start i knew they had to be joking! The acting is simply terrible and the werewolf's (if thats what you want to call them)looked like a few guys who had went to the fancy dress shop and picked out a fairly poor set of costumes!. However i did manage to watch the film in its entirety only because it was so bad it was funny! Take my advice if you want to watch something scary don't bother yourself with this title as you will end up wasting 1hr 40mins of your life that you will never get back!",Dog Soldiers
492,anicetopereira,The best werewolf film i've ever seen,10,17 June 2005,"I love good horror films.. the kind that you see at night and though you know werewolves aren't supposed to exist, you do a quick turn on the way to the john and peek over at every sound.. that's when you seen the good stuff.. My favorite werewolf films are just three 1. The Howling.. - John Sayles creepy script and Joe Dante's brilliant direction where a furry claw has more scare value than a hokey costume.. 2. Ginger snaps - puberty and the moon cycle.. and 3. Dog Soldiers... a killer premise.. I've only seen half the film - the rental DVD was to scratched to play the other half.. gonna buy the damn movie just to finish watching it.. Not going to tell you the premise except that six soldiers during a highland training exercise run into a pack of werewolves.. all hell breaks loose.. Nuff said",Dog Soldiers
493,p-mcgloin,Great film!,10,10 December 2018,"One of my favourite films, it gory and funny!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Dog Soldiers
494,thepolack_,Awful; one of the worst films I've ever seen,3,29 June 2005,"If I'm honest, the only reason I wrote this was because of the reviews previously posted. Honestly, have half the people registered here ever seen a film other than this, that didn't star Ja Rule?Somebody pointed out that there's character development. Sure, we find out that one of the characters liked football, after he died. He makes obvious references to ""The game"" (thanks for being specific on that one; I love ambiguity in the morning) throughout. This isn't really ""character development"" so much as ""a bad attempt at a film."" The acting was mediocre, and at times, acceptable, but ""great costumes!!1!1""? Hello, eyeballs anyone? Did you see the bloody costumes? They looked like they were held together with sellotape and good will.If the heads hadn't been, ooh, I don't know...about twice the size of the bodies supporting them, maybe it would have been believable. If the werewolves hadn't been skinny bitches, and maybe had a little muscle definition, instead of lovely plasticky smooth, hairless costumes. Hell, even a little fur wouldn't have gone amiss. A hairy head and shoulders, but not fur anywhere else? Please.Sure the storyline was okay, and it was entertaining, but...This film blew. Do not see it.",Dog Soldiers
495,mjaginoz,Its so bad it makes me cry,1,13 March 2015,"this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my LIFE.let me describe a scene in this movie that represents it as a whole pretty well: a squad of British soldiers are on some kind of patrol in the bush, they split up for who knows what reason and suddenly one of the guys hear something in a bush, he wastes a whole mag into the bush then throws his gun and screams like a girl and runs into the forest, away from his squad and successfully straight into a tree...which impales him on a limb""nothing these soldiers do makes any sense, trying to understand this movie made my brain hurt",Dog Soldiers
496,sidsghost,Dog Soldiers 2002,10,3 October 2005,"Top rate. CGI would have only hurt this video. All the actors played their part perfect. I've watched this film over and over including the producers comments. The acting, the writing, the directing all together make this my favorite movie. Way to go guys, I love it when you get it right. I'd like to see more movies like this. The friendship displayed among the troops and their ability to pull together far out classed other movies like""Southern Comfort"". This is a movie that I've added to my personal collection. The language is a bit much for children, but I'd recommend buying this one to any adult.All the best, Joseph Oliver, West Tennessee USA",Dog Soldiers
497,mark-eder,Gripping tale of low budget Horror,9,19 December 2005,"I'm usually the one who will pick the ""B"" movie, and my friends will blame me for the mediocre evening they've just had. Well... this one made me hero for a night! There have obviously been a LOT of werewolf movies made over the course of time, but Dog Soldiers had the intensity to rivet you to your seat from the word GO, until the credits appear. Despite an unknown cast, and the obvious lack of special effects displayed in many of the other man to beast transition flicks, there is just something about this movie that puts it right up there. Based on a simple plot of being secluded in the Scottish wood for a training mission, everything seems to break loose quickly, with a creepy ambiance.Highly recommend this for 1.5 hours of blood curdling entertainment.",Dog Soldiers
498,Joww,"British black comedy with Werewolfs worthy of the ""American Werewolf.."" series!",8,7 February 2006,"From the director of 'Trainspotting', 'Dog Soldiers' Is chaotic British black comedy at its best. Some of the characters are memorable for playing similar roles in other movies, i found this to be comforting while watching. Apparently this was intentional. The actions of the werewolves in this movie seriously cracked me up. I love the way the director has avoided wonderfully, the idea of spoofing werewolves, how bad would that be? The movie develops this versus feel between the monsters and the soldiers protecting a fort. The soldiers treating the werewolves as any other foe, makes for true hilarity in their reaction to the gore.x Joww",Dog Soldiers
499,david-2878,Terrific!,8,26 February 2006,"A great British horror film which succeeds in being genuinely scary, despite - or possibly because of - its low budget (apparently they hadn't got much money left over for the werewolf costumes, so you only catch glimpses of them).As with all good British films, this has threads of humour running through it, but don't expect another ""American Werewolf in London"".I also think it shows the most accurate depiction of a group of British Army squaddies ever seen in a film.This would have to rank as one of my favourite horror films of all time.",Dog Soldiers
500,muscleactivator,No redeeming qualities,1,10 January 2019,"They kill a dog by shooting in the head in one of the opening scenes. There are no redeeming qualities in this movie. If you enjoy juvenile dialog, bad jokes, and predictable plot development, then this is the movie for you. I've seen better practical effects in movies from the the eighties. I don't understand the positive reviews.",Dog Soldiers
501,janrats2,excellent film,10,21 March 2006,really good film been a fan of were wolves since was a child cant get enough of it its the best werewolf film I've seem in years but is Megan a were wolf from the start I'm not sure and who really was the mysterious captain Ryan /agaion was he one form the start? I've weathered the film time and time again looking for clues and i cant get it or maybe that is the reason that they did it like that not to let you know the outcome not sure really Sean pertwen I've heard is the son of john pertween is htis true he also starred in the film solider with Kurt Russel i hearty recommend this film even though it is a couple of years old to watch it if you love a good horror and film and best still its British made,Dog Soldiers
