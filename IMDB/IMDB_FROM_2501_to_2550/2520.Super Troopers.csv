0,SnoopyStyle,relentless attempt at humor,6,5 October 2014,"Thorny (Jay Chandrasekhar), Mac (Steve Lemme), Rabbit (Erik Stolhanske), Foster (Paul Soter) and Farva (Kevin Heffernan) are Vermont state troopers stationed near the border under Captain O'Hagan (Brian Cox). They are a bunch of wacky prankster cops in danger of losing their 50 miles of highway to the rival local Spurbury P.D. A dead woman is discovered and they let Chief Grady (Daniel von Bargen) of Spurbury take the case. Foster is infatuated with the lone woman cop Ursula (Marisa Coughlan) at the Spurbury P.D. The guys stumble onto a big shipment of marijuana which could be related to the dead woman.The five guys call themselves Broken Lizard. It's a lot of deadpan wacky humor. The guys have a nice charm about them. The jokes are mostly scattershot hit and miss. They are throwing everything on the screen but the guys' flat delivery takes much of the energy from the wackiness. The jokes don't land that hard but I really appreciate the relentless attempt.",Super Troopers
1,claudio_carvalho,Overrated Brainless Comedy,6,20 April 2005,"In Vermont, the budget of the City Hall is not enough to maintain the highway patrol and the police force, and one of them is to be terminated. When the two troopers are disputing their survival, the highway patrol arrests a huge load of marijuana. However, their apprehension is credited to the police department, enhancing their dispute. Yesterday I saw this VHS on sale, and after reading many favorable reviews in IMDb, I decided to buy it. My son and I laughed a lot of the silly and very dumb jokes, and ""Super Troopers"" is nothing more than an overrated brainless comedy. However, call it ""future classic"" or ""one of the best comedies ever"" is such an exaggeration and I can imagine how is the taste of such a viewer. ""Super Troopers"" follows the same type of low-level jokes and satires of the ""Police Academy"", which is better and better. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Super Tiras"" (""Super Cops"")",Super Troopers
2,Quinoa1984,"The laughs aren't always there, but there are sparks about",6,15 February 2002,"Broken Lizard, a comedy troupe I never heard of before until I started seeing trailers for this movie months back, has a movie out now called Super Troopers, an engagingly stupid cop/state trooper comedy.  The plot involves a dead body, over a hundred kilos of grass, but that's just the baseline for the troupe to stage skits somewhat connected together (along with co-stars Marisa Coughlan, Daniel Von Bargen, and surprisingly Brian Cox who delivers some of the best lines of the movie).  At times I saw what the film was trying to do to inspire laughs and indeed I did grin at a number of things throughout, and even burst out laughing in some scenes: the first drug bust scene, the fast-food scene, and one of the most disturbing gags I've seen in a number of years, the bear-f***er gag.  But it fell flat at too many points where it could've been funnier.  Still, Lizard has done the best with what they could've done, topping nearly all of the Police Academy movies, and delivering better than I expected.  Grade: (a strong) B",Super Troopers

4,dbborroughs,Something Different,8,5 June 2004,"You would think that a film about a group of state troopers trying to save their station from closing due to budget cuts would be old hat and cliched, and you probably would be right a small part of the time. In the case of this movie I think you'd be advised to put your expectations of a cliche filled film away and prepare yourself for a very funny, very off beat film that looks at things in a different way.The joy in this film is that everyone is very real and they handle things in ways that are for the most part not very movie like. The film was made by the Broken Lizard comedy troop and on screen they act and behave like they have been together for years and it shows. Their ways of handling situations are not restricted by movie-doms rules so while a good deal of what happens maybe sophomoric, its not stuff you've seen a thousand times, the opening way of handling drugged out speeders for example. Things don't always work perfectly, the pacing is off in places and some of the jokes fall flat, but if you want a good comedy thats not like a thousand others you've seen watch this flick.",Super Troopers
5,anaconda-40658,Troopers Not Super!,5,29 April 2015,"Super Troopers (2001): Dir: Jay Chandrasekhar / Cast: Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Hefferman, Brian Cox, Marisa Coughlan, Paul Soter: Here is a comedy where the funny parts are featured in its trailer. It is about cops that are pushing harder to become better cops. When a major drug bust occurs four cops seize the opportunity to solve the case thus gaining the governor's favour. A murder victim has a tattoo of a cartoon monkey, which is the emblem seen on particular marijuana bags. Concept had potential yet structured as a series of situations that climax with an outright brawl. Director Jay Chandrasekhar handles the film's everyday feel effectively but characters are flat with the exception of officer Fahrber played by Kevin Hefferman. He is the one officer who holds interest as he becomes the bunt of jokes after an incident involving a school bus. This joke is addressed again in the conclusion where Hefferman again demonstrates why he rules this film. Chandrasekhar leads the rest of the ensemble including Brian Cox, Paul Soter and Marisa Coughlan but despite the efforts none of these characters are remotely interesting or funny for that matter. Some may compare it to Police Academy but that film found great comic potential within the various training sessions. This is a satire of cop reality programs that is basically a series of staged moments resulting in a comedy that is far from super. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Super Troopers
6,movieman_kev,Meow THIS is what I call funny,8,6 May 2006,"5 bumbling, prank loving Vermont State troopers need to shape up to avoid being out of the job due to the rival police department of the same town as they reside in. This small film is hilarious and single handedly put the Broken Lizard comedy troupe on the map and rightfully so as the film is highly quotable, extremely re-watchable and the comic timing of everyone involved is simply remarkable. Sadly, their next movie ""Club Dread"" wouldn't be nearly as great as this one is. If you ever find that any of your friends that don't laugh at this film then it's really time to get some new friends meow.Eye Candy: Maria Tornberg gets topless (and again in the Deleted scenes section of the DVD extras) My Grade: A DVD Extras: Commentary with director Jay Chandrasekhar and and actor Erik Stolhanske; Second commentary by actors Kevin Heffermen, Steve Lemme and Paul Soter; 6 minute Making Of featurette; 2 minute 'Road trip Newsrap' featurette; 14 outtakes & extended Scenes with optional commentary; Theatrical trailer; and Trailer for ""Kung Pow: Enter he Fist""",Super Troopers

8,Mr-Fusion,"""But our shenanigans are cheeky and fun! """,8,20 September 2016,"I have a list of movies that, when airing on TV, I tend to get sucked into. ""Super Troopers"" is absolutely one of those. This thing's hysterical. It's sophomoric to the core, but it'd be a disservice to chalk it up to your run-of-the-mill immaturity. On paper, pretty much all of these jokes should fall flat; but this group of players is extremely well-suited to the material - which is really just a long series of memorable one-liners. And then they throw in Brian Cox and Danial von Bargen, and there's no weak link in this cast. But it's really the stupid things these guys resort to when they're bored. Sometimes I think we should all incorporate cat games into our everyday.I love this movie.8/10",Super Troopers
9,StevePulaski,"Has the continuity of an SNL episode, but is fun, genial, and good-natured",7,4 April 2012,"The Broken Lizard comedy team is very hard to hate. They have made several films that I dare call traditional and unique at the same time. Traditional in the sense that their films follow a commonly used formula, yet unique in the sense that they don't take themselves too seriously or act like they are doing something extraordinary. They lack indulgence and cockiness, which I believe has been the reason for their success. Their films are simple, genial humor that usually generate a cult following. This is a cult I can get into.This is Super Troopers, yet, another film in the ever-so-winded buddy cop formula. But this time, the formula comes off as vaguely fresh. We are placed in the town of Spurbury, Vermont, where the Vermont state troopers are more concerned with tomfoolery and pranks rather than actual police-work. The cops are veteran Arcot ""Thorny"" Ramathorn (Chandrasekhar, who also directed), collective Jeff Foster (Soter), funny-boy MacIntyre ""Mac"" Womack (Lemme), rookie Robert ""Rabbit"" Roto (Stolhanske), and obnoxious Rodney ""Rod"" Farva (Heffernan). All these men are run by a hilarious Brian Cox, who is easily agitated by the groups' lackluster performances.The vague plot that is strung along centers around a drug-smuggling operation that could potentially sky-rocket the troopers' reputation and respect, but due to further incompetence and laziness, they find themselves in competition with their rivals, the Spurbury Police Department, and are faced with numerous budget cuts.I almost forgot the film had a plot. It plays like a no-rules Saturday Night Live episode with rowdy characters, ridiculous setups, and quotable lines here and there. The film doesn't seem to have much discipline as a comedy, but it has control, and knows when it is going on for too long.It's difficult to recommend, let alone review a film like Super Troopers. Some instances are funny, some are not, but the result is fun, lively, and good-natured. The characters are all likable, the script is nice to listen to, and the direction is smooth. Broken Lizard went on to do a horror-comedy film two years later called Broken Lizard's Club Dread, a film I went on to greatly admire and find devilishly entertaining. I don't believe Super Troopers is as funny or as attentive and witty as that, but I can see why it has developed a loyal fanbase and enthusiastic response from people from all walks of life. It's positive and fun to watch, and sometimes, that's good enough.Starring: Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, Erik Stolhanske, Brian Cox, and Marisa Coughlan. Directed by: Jay Chandrasekhar.",Super Troopers

11,thesar-2,"Head to Reno, Instead",3,22 April 2013,"About a year and half following the official US release of Super Troopers, Reno 911!'s first TV season debuted and lasted for another five seasons and one movie of their own. In Super Troopers' defense, I began with Reno 911! first and watched all seasons, at least once, and the movie, Reno 911!: Miami, before I just now got around to fully see Super Troopers.I say ""fully"" because I've tried once before, approximately 4-5 years ago, but gave up 10 minutes into it when I wasn't laughing one bit. I also gave up, because what they presented to me in that opening shot – concerning three potheads being harassed by juvenile-acting highway police officers – looked like it had such potential, but instead had two dozen missed opportunities. And, that was just the first 10 minutes!Well, finally, just yesterday, I got a chance to see the whole and overlong film through to the end. And my first impression was: ""Man, I am missing out on some incredible inside jokes. These guys lack both any tiny little bit of charisma or humor. What am I missing here?""Don't get me wrong; I understood the jokes. I got where each one was headed from the beginning of each scene, I just kept thinking that this kept missing the mark everywhere.And noI am not comparing it to the incredibly superior and similar Reno 911!. I let this movie stand on its own, but maybe that was a mistake since both the TV series Reno 911! and its movie took this concept, in addition to mocking the long-standing series, COPS, and improved in every step of the way.But, that's unfair to the movie, so, again, I watched it on its own merit.The very basic synopsis of Super Troopers is: a bunch of wise-cracking boys in men's bodies are somewhat trying to hold on to their Highway Patrol jobs when budget cuts loom. So, after a long series of hijinks, the movie settles in on a plot (yeah, it took awhile to get there since I'm now referring to the third act) of proving themselves, albeit it's juvenile, once again.While the movie wasn't incredibly stale and unfunny, I didn't care for the cast whatsoever. There was no one I could latch onto, root for, care about. They may all be friends, or a group in real life – hence the inside joke I failed to get, but they were incredibly blah. Each and every one of them. Combine that with jokes that were ho-hum, it was a displeasure to get to the end.At least a childhood favorite of mine, Lynda Carter, showed up in a tiny, but welcoming part and there was a shower scene with the bear of the group. Finally, I got to two parts that made me, um, sit up and notice.Overall, while not the worst comedy I've seen, it's not recommended. Just stick with the incredible, talented and charismatic cast of Reno 911! instead.",Super Troopers

13,bowmanblue,Strangely watchable,7,14 August 2018,"Super Troopers' is - almost literally - a 'car crash.' It's a comedy about four (or was it five?) state troopers who spend their days generally winding up motorists (and occasionally catching criminals). However, their days appear to be numbered when local government threatens to shut down their unit in favour of another 'better' department.I say 'four or five' troopers because I couldn't really tell them apart. One was black. One was stupid (or even more stupid than the others - if you can believe that!), but the other lot were pretty interchangeable (maybe it was the abundance of moustaches?). Basically, the film has no recognisable stars (unless you count Brian Cox and Linda 'pre Gal Gadot Wonder Woman' Carter's minor roles.The comedy throughout is definitely of an 'adult' nature, so expect daftness and bawdy male humour. I don't know whether it was just me, but I didn't laugh that much during its run-time and you may be forgiven for thinking that I didn't enjoy it. Despite its lack of stars, maturity and (obvious?) jokes, it was strangely entertaining.I think you have to be in the mood for something like this and know what you're getting. If you're looking for something even slightly intellectual then steer well clear. There's no brainpower required to watch this, only an appreciation of severely low-brown humour. And, I obviously was in the right mood when I watched it, as I'm actually quite looking forward to the (belated?) sequel which I can only hope entertains as much as this one does.",Super Troopers

Super Troopers is a really funny movie that provided me with some great and really unexpected, laughs (the delousing being one!).This seems like a strange comment but the cast just felt really relaxed (maybe because they are all mates) and it made the film more like watching those friends hanging out instead of a 'movie'.I think outtakes would be mega funny as well.Its simply a good time :)",Super Troopers

16,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A huge notch above all other immature comedies,8,4 August 2008,"""Super Troopers"" is a great comedy because it's hysterical yet there's nothing recycled about it. There aren't any actors who have been in too many comedies or a plot that's just about setting up gag after gag. This is a true ensemble comedy, and although it may be easy to dismiss as immature, it's sharp and clever immaturity. There are plenty of interesting and amusing characters and there's even some mystery to keep your interest.The film is the first hit by the Broken Lizard group, which is led by director/writer Jay Chandrasekhar. It's basically about a group of state troopers who are literally so bored that they result to making bets and playing ridiculous games that result in hilarity. The mystery starts when the begin to uncover a crime and are trying to outdo the local police department.There is a lot of drug humor and use as well as plenty of immature sex-related humor. It's pretty classic immature humor, but it's not forgettable. The opening scene is a great tone setter for the film and really illustrates how Broken Lizard is a bit more clever and less formula-dependent as other immature movies that use similar comedic tactics. The other reason this film is better than others of the genre is that these actors have talent and create interesting characters. It's not just about gags, but about the way the characters behave. That's all that can be said as to why this film is better than similar fare without ruining the movie.The most memorable character is probably Farva, the stupid cop who takes his job the most seriously and is the butt of everyone's jokes, played by Kevin Heffernan. Brian Cox is also great in his only comedic role I can remember as the foul-mouthed captain.Very few movies will offer you mindless entertainment like ""Super Troopers"" does and actually capture your attention and convince you it's worth watching again and again.",Super Troopers
17,Anonymous_Maxine,Failed movie titles: Highway Patrol Academy.,5,4 August 2003,"Wow, someone must really have had a bad runin with the police or with the Highway Patrol, since they're both made to look completely ridiculous in this movie. I can't say that the movie is entirely without laughs, because there were several scenes during which I was laughing so hard that I just about fell off the couch (`Hey, I got an idea! Let's pop some Viagra and issue tickets with raging mega-huge boners!'). I guess the movie is about what law enforcement would look like if the police force and the Highway Patrol were run as though they were fraternities instead of government run entities. The police and the Highway Patrol are rival fraternities fighting each other over state funding, since one of them is about to be shut down and so they better make some heroic drug bust or something right before the budget hearings in order to stay in business.This plotline sort of falls to the side for the majority of the film in favor of freaky antics and games played by the cops as they pull people over and try to see how many times they can get away with saying Meow without being caught. This is the type of humor that might have done well had it been more prevalent, and the most extensive, seen in the film.
The problem with Super Troopers is that it just goes too far at many points. It's perfectly believable to have a lot of guys on the police force who screw around in the locker room, playing practical jokes on each other and trying to do some goofy routines like the Meow routine while on the job, but the film also has them busting a teen party and then getting smashed with the kids themselves and forcing the kids to do humiliating fraternity hazing rituals, something absolutely certain to land them in court, as well as to immediately cost them their jobs, the importance of which drives the entire plot.If the movie had been something of a behind the scenes of law enforcement comedy that let us see an entirely different side of the police force than the stolid one that we usually see peering at us disappointedly through our driver's side windows, it could have been a smashing success. But instead it decides to display full frontal nudity of fat men covered in powdered sugar, a toothless redneck having sex with a bear in the woods, two cops trying to go undercover in a semi truck that they don't know how to drive, and a lot of other idiot cops doing a lot of idiot things. Given the fact that the movie is all about two law enforcement agencies trying to save their jobs by actually solving a crime (notably something entirely out of the ordinary for them), the least the movie could have done is provide us with at least a single person on either team that we would actually want to see driving a patrol car and wearing a policemen's uniform.
The movie is the product of a goofball comedy troupe who call themselves Broken Lizard, but who don't realize that if you want your audience to root for your characters to keep their jobs as police officers, it might be beneficial to keep in mind that police officers have power over the general public. Personally, I'm not too thrilled about the possibility of being pulled over by someone who is going to demand my license and registration and then call me a chickenf**ker.",Super Troopers
18,elshikh4,"Next Time, Make Movies While You're Sober, Guys !",1,20 February 2009,"Of course it's supposed to be enjoyable, but it really isn't.The plot seems copied from many police Academy movies, though the comedy is taken away. The intended mad spirit is missing, since it's not originally cartoonish, ironically realistic, or superficially serious. The situations are so badly made. The jokes aren't droll, rather boring and ridiculous. It fills itself with too many sexual humor; for little instance, the monkey masturbates, the officer's son masturbates, another officer masturbates himself, to an extent where you must ask why they didn't call it Super Masturbators then! At one moment, an officer tends to have sex with a woman on the road in front of her husband and his own friend's child as well (???!!). This is nasty, rather monstrous, bad tasting which does not make you smile (maybe puke instead!), representing perfectly the poorness of this movie.The pace is drunken. And it got the word artless all over it. The direction was awfully lazy to an extent where you might feel there wasn't one in the first place. Director (Jay Chandrasekhar), who co-wrote it also, was leading everything and everyone like several short improvised sketches, or a home made video of bachelor party's shenanigans, without being initially cinematic, making the driest humor I have ever witnessed. Actually what's harder than a stand-up comedian who says the silly jests and laughs lonely at himself! It's exactly the same case here.All the cast was pathetic, delivering the weak moments weakly. I hated the actors, their characters, feeling all the time nothing but ""how silly"" and ""how alleged"". (Brian Cox) is the main disappointment, how he did it as blank as this? It's a big proof that this is a stupid movie which turned even the good element into bad.Unfunny comedy is a waste of time. However, unfunny comedy that thinks itself so comic and - more than that - excels in making you disgusted is a torture. (Super Troopers) is such a glaring example for a movie that was written and directed while most of its makers were under the influence of heavy beer, or that what seemed eventually. The line: ""You crapped on my heart"" is just a summarization of the whole thing; it wasn't funny, or said in a funny way!",Super Troopers
19,drqshadow-reviews,"Great Stoner Comedy, But It's Missing a Plot",6,8 July 2013,"A seriously thin, mindless exercise that has no right to be anywhere near as much fun as it actually is. The Broken Lizard guys basically use this as an excuse to wear trucker shades and sunglasses, then just ad-lib their way through a dozen identical situations with a broad variety of results. At some points, like the ""busted stoners"" opening spot, or the infamous ""meow"" exchange with Jim Gaffigan, it's uproariously, tear-streakingly hilarious. In just as many others, though, the crew overreaches to stay in character and their quips fall flat. Brian Cox pulls off a great Rip Torn impression as the reluctantly strict station captain, but his officers pay him so little heed that it doesn't amount to much more than a gag role, while basically everyone else on-camera seems content to play themselves. With just the faintest hint of an arching plot line and a weird non-ending before the credits, this is best seen as a series of interrelated sketches and nothing more... which makes it perfect for fans of a particular attention-sapping intoxicant.",Super Troopers
20,Chris_Docker,"Woeful, not even funny woeful",3,24 November 2002,"Sometimes I hear the critics and IMDb readers panning a movie and I think, I know in my heart, I will still like it. That ""so bad it will be good"" feeling, the conviction that I alone, and a select few weirdos, will actually like a movie that is so crass, so vulgar, so bad taste, that it stands out like a testament of rebellion against accepted values. Sometimes such movies are a massive hit ('There's Something About Mary'), sometimes they will have a lesser known cult following ('Bad Taste', 'Toxic Avenger' etc). Occasionally I have a problem even admitting my own grudging respect ('Ichi the Killer'). Super Troupers, a slapstick comedy about a dimwitted bunch of highway patrol cops playing silly practical jokes with each other and their motorist victims whilst competing with the local regular police force, falls into none of these categories. Really. It is bad - not remarkable bad - not so bad you enjoy it after lots of alcohol or hash - not clever in an illicit sort of way - just bad.

23,aidanratesmovies,"Stupid, but by all means a fun time",9,5 April 2020,"Although at times it can seem incredibly juvenile, Super Troopers brings the much needed fun element back to cop films like itself, and though it is not perfect, it thrives well enough to remain a cult classic. At times the script can seem incredibly simple and more like a series of gags loosely tied together than a movie itself. However, that isn't to say Super Troopers isn't a blast. The film brings back the much needed joy into comedy spoofs of earlier generations, and is easily one of the funniest cop films ever made. The performances are not great, but the actors are fully committed to the roles they are playing, and it's a joy seeing them have so much fun doing so. It's an entertaining ride that has its awkward moments to cringe at, but has enough going for it to satisfy in the long run. In the end, Super Troopers may seem like a stupid film, but is stupid nature is what makes it so enjoyable, and almost brilliant.

It has that same casual, we're-insignificant-and-enjoying-it, anti-establishment attitude that seems missing from contemporary comedies.

Same goes for the whole Jackass franchise, it's just not for me.Super Troopers is a kinda weird mix of the two. There's lots of drug use, there's crass behavior and yet I love this movie. It's so hilarious to me and, maybe more importantly, it's almost endlessly quotable.

One of the differences is that the State Troopers in this movie want to be funny, things are not simply happening to them. The Troopers are Thorny (Jay Chandrasekhar), Mac (Steve Lemme), Foster (Paul Soter), a rookie named Rabbit (Erik Stolhanske) and the weird outsider Farva (Kevin Heffernan), all under the leadership of Capt. John O'Hagan (Brian Cox). The movie is set in Spurbury, Vermont where so little is happening they play games to have some fun. Their victims are the people they turn over. They also have a constant battle with the local police.There is a story, although it is more like a framework for gags. The Spurbury State Trooper department is about to be closed due financial problems. A dead body is found and it seems that there is a connection with some drugs, found in a truck. A great bust could help the Troopers. Of course the local police wants the same bust causing more problems between the two departments. A sub-plot involves Foster and a girl from the local police, Ursula (Marisa Coughlan), who are dating although that is against the rules. Of course Ursula might come in handy when it comes to who will solve the crime first, the Troopers or the local police.But like I said, the story does not really matter here. It is divided in funny segments, one a little funnier than the other, but all quite entertaining. Especially the verbal jokes dealing with some drivers they have pulled over will give you some great laughs. It is especially funny because at first we think the Troopers are just very dumb and talk in clichés. But then we learn that before they walk up to a car they decide which joke they will try, simply for their own amusement. Of course the movie goes over the top at some points, especially with the Farva-character, but it is not distracting because almost every comedy these days has a character like his.This may not be a great movie, but is an entertaining from start to finish. It made me want to see the other films from these comedians, their group is called ""Broken Lizard"", including 2004's 'Club Dread'. Since it is hard to top this movie at least in this particular genre, I am not sure whether I should, but that says enough about 'Super Troopers' itself.",Super Troopers
28,Spleen,"Goof-off comedy made for ADULTS, for once",7,26 November 2002,"A comedy about people slacking off and abusing their authority, in which much of the humour derives from people being humiliated; and yet ... why, it's actually good-natured, with not the slightest trace of nastiness about it. If you're one of those people who actually care for the hundred or so teen comedies that have been made in the past half-dozen years you might like to try a more mature version of the same thing, without the sour aftertaste, and with as much genuine humour as the rest of them combined.Take the gross-out scene earlier on. We wince as we watch competitive drinkers force vast quantities a certain substance down their throats - but the substance is not semen, not urine, not blood plasma, not even hard liquor, but ... maple syrup. Technically, this DOES qualify as gross-out humour, but of a strangely witty and not unpleasant kind.Obviously I'm not claiming that this is the most brilliant comedy ever made; just the best (or one of the best) in its own particular territory. It's a movie that makes me suspicious of people who don't enjoy it. Quite frankly, if you don't find at least some of its jokes (""It's Afghanistanimation!"") amusing, then you have no soul.",Super Troopers
29,rosscinema,UNFUNNY,1,17 September 2002,I sat through this mess waiting for a funny moment and it never came. Just god awful. Totally unfunny. I wondered where they got so many unknown actors and later I found out that they are a comedy troupe called Broken Lizard. A complete waste of time. At the end they show outtakes and it appropriately ends with a vomiting scene. Why is a talented actor like Brian Cox in this piece of tripe?,Super Troopers
30,eric262003,"Good, But Only For A One Time Viewing",6,25 September 2017,"""Super Troopers"" has that feeling sort of like a high-school film project where you follow a few instructions, and then you annex a few others, but still succeeds in maintaining its charm. Picture a group of Vermont troopers cajoling around on the job treating their profession like they are the hosts of ""Candid Camera"". And pictures these troopers to feel like their ambitions are more lenient towards stand-up comedy. And they thought that their training was by watching the box-set of the ""Police Academy"" movies. And that they are the leading protagonists. That's what this movie feels like.Set in Sputbury, Vermont where very little criminal activity happens,this causes a bit of a rift between the state troopers. Under the leadership of Captain O'Hagen (Brian Cox) and the city police under the leadership of Chief Grady (Daniel von Bargen). When a deceased corpse was discovered in Winnebago and drug smuggling seems to be behind it, the police and the troopers compete in their investigation for clues and evidence, suspects and for funds. The state troopers are also under pressure of getting shutdown, by the budget-minded governor (Lynda Carter).The troopers may be on the brink of becoming obsolete because as a unit they're really not taken very seriously. They seem to pass their time interrogating passerbys, instruct truck drivers to pull over with their megaphones after the drivers have pulled over and even going meow while striking conversation with the curbed driver. O'Hagen is clearly besides himself in stress over their erratic behaviour as he fears his job and his troop will be out of a job. This drug bust is the key to save their jobs, but the guys are quite out of league about the whole operation.There is a hint of romantic entanglements where a beautiful cop Ursula (Marisa Coughlan) starts dating one of the troopers named Foster (Paul Soter) which doesn't sit very well both the police and the troopers, but might still have some potential that might bring this case together. Foster not playing with a full deck decides that he and Ursula should get in the back of a cruiser. Foster forgets that once placed in the back of a cruiser, someone has to let them out.During their breaks at greasy spoon establishments, the cops trade discussion almost like you would hear from comedy factions like ""Trailer Park Boys"", ""Kids in the Hall"" or the cast of ""Clerks"". Which is fitting because they happen to be a comedy troupe known as Broken Lizard who were also credited for writing the script and under the direction of Jay Chandrasekhar who plays the role of fellow trooper named Thorny. Vermonters know he is of an ethnic minority, but can't tell what he is and keeps it sworn to secrecy. They assume he's either Mexican, Arab, Muslim, Hindu or anything.Broken Lizard started their journey as undergraduate students from Colgate who raised $200,000 to make a film called ""Puddle Cruiser"" and presented it as part of campus tour. Here in ""Super Troopers"", they might collaborate by transforming this movie into a sequel next year in which I hope has something good to offer there.As a whole, ""Super Troopers"" works well on several levels. It has a story going for it, which wraps up quite nicely when its done. But it still feels like a series of skits with a laid-back charm going for it. The atmosphere is at the most feel-good with a level of confidence that you don't find in a ""Police Academy"" movie. I can't say that it wasn't a terrible movie, but I think there shouldn't be any reason to see it again after one viewing. It's a good watch, but it isn't anything all that special.",Super Troopers
31,brando647,Meow!,9,28 April 2010,"This is one of those comedies that I'll never get sick of. I wish I could say the same for the other films I've seen from Broken Lizard but they got off to a great start with their first nationally distributed project. The comedy is off-the-wall without going too mindless and the characters are fun. The story focuses on a small Vermont highway patrol station that is at risk of closure due to budget cuts. Unfortunately, the team are a bunch of pranksters and are more concerned with messing with the citizens they pull over or battling the local cops to do anything about it. The patrolmen are given their chance when a murder occurs on their highway and leads to evidence of a marijuana smuggling ring.SUPER TROOPERS is definitely a dumb comedy, but it's not overly stupid. The jokes are funny and the gags are clever; it's vulgar without relying on the vulgarity to carry the humor. The humor is completely derived from the oddball characters and their shenanigans. It's tough to pinpoint my favorite scene in the movie but one of the top contenders is when Troopers Farva (Kevin Heffernan) and Ramathorn (Jay Chandrasekhar) stop for lunch on Farva's first day back on the road after a lengthy suspension, and Farva erupts on a wise-cracking burger kid. Freakin' hilarious.The majority of the cast are the members of the Broken Lizard troupe. Chandrasekhar pulls double duty as the lead trooper and as the film's director. All of them are hilarious and their existing chemistry (their group's been together since college) plays out well on film. Heffernan as the team's black sheep is great and a good sport for some of the crap they put him through. And I've got to say, Brian Cox was terrific in this movie. It's not a role I would've ever thought he'd play but he is great as the head of the highway patrol station, Captain O'Hagan. This was a surprise hit for me in early 2001 and I never expected I'd love this movie so much but no matter how many times I've watched this and laughed at the gags, I still do.",Super Troopers

I only laughed once and smiled throughout.  Certainly isn't that funny.   The last good funny movie I watched was Rat.  Golfballs is better than this movie.  I didn't fully understand why it's got an R rating either.  So I would suppose that 1.  you have to be in the mood to watch below the belt humor, or 2. watch so few comedy's that this is actually good.I don't know if it would be better to watch the second time round, so I'll leave that as a question.3/10Quality: 0/10 Entertainment: 5/10 Replayable:  ?/10",Super Troopers
33,jaredmobarak,It's AfghanistanimationSuper Troopers,8,25 August 2008,"Ah, Broken Lizard. I would say that this is the movie that started it all, but of course it is not. That mantle is held by Puddle Cruiser, a little seen at the time, (self-distributed across country, college campus to college campus), released to DVD upon the troupe's burgeoning popularity that has some charm if only showing what was to soon come fro. Super Troopers is the film that brought the group into the mainstream consciousness. The jokes may be crude, the humor a little lowbrow, but the movie as a whole is just plain funny. Some of the gags fire on all cylinders, utilizing wordplay, physical comedy, and well played cameos. These boys are certainly close-knit and unafraid to try something new or make fools of themselves. They write it all together and go out in front of the camera to make the audience laugh, even if that viewership consists solely of them. Not quite a pot comedy, nor a strict spoof on law enforcement, Super Troopers is a grab-bag of laughs that come often and fast, disguising a flimsy premise with its flash, one-liners, and shenanigans.I will admit that I'd love this film if the final hour was acted out by sock puppetsthat's how good the first scene is. ""Littering and littering andlittering and"" When Jay Chandrasekhar (Thorny and the movie's director) and Erik Stolhanske (Rabbit) take on the duty of pulling over a trio of drug-addled frat boys on the freeway, you will miss moments because of the loud laughter. From the moment they come on screen until Steve Lemme (Mac) ""hijacks"" the cop car they are being held in for a trip to Mexico, you will have tears in your eyes. Hopefully I am not playing this sequence up, I truly believe anyone will find it hilarious. Geoffrey Arend steals the scene by far as he completely freaks out from the amount of drugs coursing through his body.As for the actual plot, basically, the Vermont city they are in is strapped for cash and looking to dissolve either the state troopers or the city police. The troopers are played by our stars and while partaking in antics and games on the job; they do actually seem to work when needed. Whether they play the ""repeater"" game, try and say ""meow"" as often as they can, or any other crazy activity to infuse some fun into the daily grind, they'll still write the ticket and put the bad guys behind bars. Even when a couple of German swingers offer their bodies for a warning, Thorny knows that they must be brought in because the car is stolenhe can always bring them home to spend some time with he and his hippy wife anyways, moustache rides free of charge. But I digress, the troopers attempt to crack open a case of drug smuggling in order to prove to the mayor that they should stay open while the city cops try and do the same. The two sides clash often and even find a bit of romance between them before all is said and done, but in the end, one must go the way of the dinosaur.Credit must be given to Brian Cox, yes that venerable Scotsman, classically trained on the stage. This guy has no shame and just has fun with a group of jackasses, letting loose while still bringing his trademark professionalism. He boxes, while drunk, soon after urinating on a pulled-over carclassic. And besides those already mentioned, Paul Soter is great as Foster, whose ""biker"" snafu with Ursula (Marisa Coughlan) is a standout moment, and Kevin Heffernan steals the show as Farva. I knew this film had hit big and crossed into the American lexicon when, while working at Ted's Hot Dogs here in Buffalo, a police officer came in for dinner and asked for a liter of cola. I had to smile as he returned one of his ownwe both knew the joke and kudos to him for having a great sense of humor.",Super Troopers
34,mattymatt4ever,With more consistency....this could've been a comedy classic!!!!,5,3 March 2002,"After seeing the lame previews for ""Super Troopers,"" my hopes weren't high. In fact, it looked so crappy that I thought to myself, ""Who would actually watch this?""  Is it much better than I expected?  Definitely!  But all in all, it's an OK comedy.This movie doesn't suffer from the same flaws as most contemporary comedies: it's not silly, annoying or unbelievably gross.  The problem?  Most of the gags are dull!  I wasn't cringing and I wasn't laughing either; but I did roll my eyes a few times.The actors all seem talented.  I understand they're all part of a comedy troup.  And if they ever decide to make another movie, I'll probably get in line to see it, because they definitely have potential.  The only known actors are Brian Cox and Marisa Coughlan.  Brian Cox shows off his hidden comic talent.  In one scene, he gets drunk and urinates into someone's car. Yep, this is the same dude who played Hannibal Lecter.  Marisa Coughlan has never looked hotter!  She provides great eye candy for the (most likely) predominantly male audience.Now, why do I think this could've been a comedy classic?  Because there are a few hilarious, hilarious scenes that had me rolling with laughter!  In fact, I'm still laughing thinking back to those moments.  When Farva went up to that old couple in the car and spontaneously yelled out ""chickenf**ker,"" I was laughing for at least three minutes straight!  And there are other classic moments, including the opening scene in which a stoner devours pounds of marijuana and one where a cop straps on a bulletproof jockstrap and has his fellow officers shoot at his crotch.  Now that's comedy!! During those few scenes, I laughed harder than I have in years!  Which is why I feel it's tragic that the writing wasn't more consistent.  I feel bad giving it a score of 5, but that's what it deserves.  Just like if I see a good comedy with a few truly awful gags, I'm not going to give it a bad review.So I am definitely suggesting you check out ""Super Troopers"" on video. Those funny moments are worth indulging, and you can always fast-forward through all the dull scenes.My score:  5 (out of 10)",Super Troopers
35,hall895,Reasonably amusing,6,20 September 2006,"Super Troopers may not be an all-time comedy classic but there are certainly enough laughs sprinkled throughout to make it worth your while. There's not much of a plot but there are definitely plenty of antics. Some of the gags misfire but enough hit their mark to leave you reasonably satisfied.The plot, such as it is, follows a group of Vermont state troopers who face the prospect of having their squad shut down due to state budget cuts. When a drugs-related murder occurs this could be the break they need. Solve the case, save their squad. Unfortunately, much to the chagrin of their squad captain, our heroes are much too consumed with their rivalry with the local town police and with their own never-ending antics to make any serious headway. But that's OK, this movie is much more about antics than plot anyway. Our cast of mostly unknowns careens from one gag to another, doing nothing by the book, doing anything to amuse themselves. At times, especially whenever an attempt is made to be even remotely serious, the movie lags. But eventually something preposterously funny will happen and you'll forgive the filmmakers for their less inspired moments. There are no real standouts in the cast, there is hardly any plot to speak of and too many of the jokes fall flat. But in the end there are enough great comic moments to make it all worth it. A comedy classic? Nope. A comedy worth seeing? Yeah.",Super Troopers

It's set in the great state of Vermont featuring Highway patrolmen warring with local cops who are threatening to take over their turf. It's unpredictable, crude, and funny, although watching it with children might be awkward (or not, considering how ""advanced"" modern children are). I don't know when it came out in 2001, but, given how grim the world has gotten and how light this movie is, it obviously was ""in the can"" prior to 9/11.

Still, something was missing. The movie makes you smile constantly, but laugh out loud-moments are hard to find.

That's what I did with Super Troopers. It's a misguided non tour-de-farce that has no idea where it's going. In fact, to make the obligatory pun, this movie could be called Super Poopers, since that's what this movie basically is and what most of the `jokes' consist of.The slim-to-none plot is about highway patrolmen who like to mess with the people they pull over. However, the `evil' state police men are going to take over their highway (gasp!) so they must save it.The bad guys were all too clear-cut, not leaving any mystery or suspense for us to follow. Of course, my DVD player did go on the fritz twice, but I don't think I missed anything. In fact, I'm glad it did. There's so many things wrong, what should I begin with?First, I'll go with the non-jokes. In the beginning I may have chuckled around twice, but soon fell through a giant hole. There are constant drug and sex jokes that aren't funny. The slapstick wasn't even funny; I usually fall for that. It all seemed a bit too rushed and tried to throw in a meaningless plot instead of making this an `SNL-movie'. Personally, I think an idea like this would work better in variety show cases. The `one-joke' premise got wasted early on. Plus, the movie seemed to run out of steam in the end.I also thought that all of the swearing was added in to try to attract a larger audience; it certainly wasn't necessary and definitely seemed not to fit in. Too many characters were thrown in, just like all of the unoriginal movies like this. How are we supposed to keep them straight if we don't know anything about them?I didn't buy any of the chemistry between the troopers and the police; in fact, it was laughingly bad.

Teeming with energy and inventiveness, if somewhat unsophisticated, this feature debut of US comedy troupe Brohhyytken Lizard gleefully draws inspiration from the likes of Monty Python, Porky's, and Cheech And Chong. Thus it possesses a gag hit-rate that most gross-out comedies would kill for, even successfully handling bestiality.
The cast play inept Vermont State Troopers who are religiously dedicated to their jobs: playing tricks on unsuspecting drivers (the opening sequence with a bunch of stoners is a classic). When the rival local police want to shut them down, a huge marijuana bust offers the chance to prove themselves to their put-upon chief (a wonderful Brian Cox).
Thin plot aside, the running gag of harassing drivers keeps things uproariously funny. Unapologetically goofy and oddly sweet, this can genuinely lay claim to being one of the funniest films of 2001.If you're on the wavelength, very funny indeed.

Normally I'd say that the movie would make me remember the director's name to avoid his work in the future, but after this he went on to direct episodes of the awesomely funny TV show ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT so I'd say it was the writing that sank this project.If I had a chemical dependency problem I'd have enjoyed the endless drug references.

Some people find a lot of this movie not so funny which I simply cannot comprehend. They want a real movie with meaning but that's not this – this is just for laughs! There's some hilarious stuff here! This is one of those that I have a hard time rating based on how actually good of a film it is.

The beginning scene had promise and I did laugh at the ""moustache ride"" joke with the German couple, but the rest...it is boring. A joke where two cops just repeat each other? A pig in a RV joke? Ramrod? Bear in the woods sex? The script is boring and makes no sense. The acting is horrible too and everyone in this just seems to be getting jobs for Broken Lizard projects and nothing else.

57,hippiedj,"A pleasant surprise, and a festival of facial hair!",8,20 October 2002,"While a film of this formula would have been more successful theatrically in the 1970s and early '80s for it's drive-in theatre appeal, Super Troopers is still a nice surprise and just right for enjoying on home video. Highway Patrol VS. the local cops is the theme here, and I was quite surprised it actually had a bit of substance to it instead of being a lame-brained comedy. Will these troopers save the day? Ah, how could you expect any less? And some have found this film to be an insult to cops in general, but I didn't at all. Just take a look out there in the real world, and there are people behaving a LOT worse than this, and I'm referring to the local cops in the film (the Highway troopers really were good guys!).Instead of trying to work a film around reasons to show naked women and excessive drug humour, there is actually a lot of concentration on a story here, and the shenanigans of the troopers were accent enough to add to the fun. Sure, the yuks weren't always there, but just look at the Police Academy films and you'll wonder how so many of those got made. While the cops were rather dimwitted in the Police Academy films, the officers in Super Troopers were no dummies (except for the obligatory one like Farva). I didn't mind that that gags weren't being forced at you every second, I actually found myself interested in the plot. The rest of these comments that follow here are what I feel set Super Troopers so apart from the usual drek of raunch comedies:MAJOR KUDOS SECTION! There are a few rather unusual qualities about this film that set it apart from the others of this genre. FIRSTLY, the Highway troopers were likable guys and all rather good-hearted. You really find yourself wishing you had more friends like these! They weren't pulling stunts just to be ""crap disturbers"" or hurt anyone. The ""shenanigans"" they pulled on people were obviously well deserved. The opening scene where they mess with the minds of teens smoking pot in a car is a hoot.SECONDLY, many films with this level of testosterone usually go the gay-bashing route, and in a wonderful turn, writer/director/actor Jay Chandrasekhar shows us some scenes of male bisexuality in a positive light, not using it as reason to make fun of one's ""masculinity"" but rather showing everyone has fun side if they let themselves experience it. After all, Jay's character Ramathorn is the one who asked the swinging bisexual German couple ""Who wants a moustache ride?"" in which both gleefully exclaim ""I do! I do!"" Great to see who I considered the lead role to be that open-minded. It's refreshing to see this level of open-mindedness in a comedy. No gay stereotype jokes at all, and if anything, this film shows something that many people deny is REALLY going on in the world of ""swinging"": where both male and female partners are of equal enthusiasm and participation! Big points to Chandrasekhar for that! I know some of you think this is strange to comment about this aspect, but it really is important in the big picture of things. There is still plenty of ignorance to enjoy of that nature if that's what you desire by just tuning in to Howard Stern, The Man Show, or Jerry Springer.THIRDLY, it's great to see a focus on story and comedy instead of distracting the drooling straight male crowd with distractions of naked women and lesbian kissing -- there is only one very, very brief glimpse of the German Woman's breasts, but two very visible scenes showing male nudity. I'm sure many guys will complain about the lack of sex and raunch (what's there is definitely R-rated, but not as offensive as one might expect!), but I'm also certain there are plenty of us that were quite pleased that it didn't try to fill time with distractions of breasts to cover lack of wit. There are plenty of ""American Pie"" types of comedies out there, I think it's a welcome sight that Super Troopers didn't wallow in that area.FOURTHLY, it's great to see the whole Broken Lizard team as the actors themselves, instead of using more well-groomed ""hunks"" to play the characters. These guys looked like real folk and played their parts quite naturally. Plus, it's nice to see an ENCOURAGEMENT of facial hair for a change! I liked the scene where they were ribbing a fellow trooper about not having grown a moustache yet like everyone else!I know it's only a comedy, but there really are some nice things about Super Troopers that offer more than just a few laughs. It's a film I'll definitely have in my collection and I thank the Broken Lizard team for making this film possible, as it gives me hope that there will be more films out there that have some punch to them without just trying to appeal to a jerky crowd.",Super Troopers
58,TexasRedge,What? Huh?,1,2 April 2002,"This is one of those movies where that you know its supposed to be funny, but its to stupid to be funny(remember ""Robin Hood:Men in Tights"" had that same effect). This isn't a funny film, its a stupid film. Most of the film revolves around Lame-Sex jokes, Bathroom humor and Drug humor, and even by those standards it wasn't funny. I remember during the fight sceen where the Highway patrol officers get in a fist fight along the interstate with the local city cops, I knew that sceen was supposed to be funny but I didn't even as much as crack a smile, and I looked around me and no one else was realy laughing at it either.

I'm still laughing!",8,28 April 2003,"Waaaaaaaay back in the 1980s, before everyone was on the Internet, we used to log on to bulletin board systems, a.k.a. BBSs.  On a BBS you could post a message and it would be relayed to other BBSs during the night, so it was a bit like email, only with a longer lag factor between sending and receiving. And everyone could read it, not just one person.  Anyway, at the end of each message there was this space, 57 (or was it 58?) characters long. I'm not sure why, but for some reason a tradition developed of putting some random thing into that space.  It (whatever was put there) was called a ""tag line"", and some of them were brilliant (""If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for y""; ""All wiyht.  Rho sritched mg kegtops awound?""). One of them was: ""That's disgusting -- but funny.""That could pretty much be my review of (most of) this movie, which manages to be both in-your-face outrageous _and_ subtle, or at least sly, and you never know which is next, so it's a lot of fun to watch.  No, it's not for kids; I'd even feel awkward watching it with some adults, but if you're alone or with people who can enjoy raunchy humor, this is very amusing.I agree with whoever said the cops in this movie seem more real than a lot of movie cops; these guys seem like just regular guys who happen to be cops, and I enjoyed their story more because of that.  I kept getting the feeling I really was seeing a little snippet taken from the actual lives of some cops somewhere...not that any given set of them would ever do everything in this movie, but somewhere, sometime, I'll bet most of these things really have happened, or at least something along these lines.  ""Broken Lizard"" has a great -- if frequently disgusting -- sense of humor.Funny stuff!!

Which I can't say about the other Broken Lizard movies I've seen, a strange enough fact adding to the 'aura' of Super Troopers.Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that here we are not facing another horny & stupid teens movie, but grownups (some of them have mustaches, at least) acting like horny & stupid teens (but just for the fun of it!).

64,DJ_Shilo,When they come for you...drive,6,18 June 2020,"Broken Lizard is the comedy troupe behind ""Super Troopers,"" a film that will ultimately have you belly laughing in your seat or hanging your head in shame for watching the stupidity unfold. I laughed a lot at this movie's attempt on the buddy cop genre as they try to do something we have never seen before, with cops being let loose on a highway to go crazy and cause havoc for laughs. I'm sure this idea sounded good on paper, but the film is so poorly thrown together that is makes it a cheap but effective comedy. We have seen stupid cop movies before, such as ""Police Academy,"" but nothing compares to this, and that puts this film in a league of its own.It's about five Vermont highway cops, Thorny (Jay Chandrasekhar), Mac (Steve Lemme), Foster (Paul Soter), Rabbit (Erik Stoihanske) and, Farva (Kevin Heffernan)) along with, Captain John O'Hagen (Brian Cox) who are all on the verge on getting their highway station shutdown because only Captain O'Hagan can do his job while his officers favour pranks more than anything. While out screwing around on the highway, they stumble upon what they think is a massive marijuana operation, and Captain O'Hagan sees it as an opportunity to keep their jobs if he can get his officers to behave long enough and do their jobs right for once.How would you expect a film like this to open? A drug bust? A shootout? No, its three idiots smoking a joint while driving to the Canadian border but end up getting pulled over by Thorny and Mac as their station is situated somewhere in the area, and the highway is part of their patrol. Thorny and Mac are deliberately presented as inept when Thorny asks one of the kids,"" you know how fast you were going?"" with the kid nervously asking ""65?"" with Thorny responding ""63."" The attempt at humour is used with situations such as this, and that's all it is throughout. Thorny and Mac screw around with the kid's heads for a bit while one of the kids who had eaten a bag of mushrooms begins to hallucinate. Shortly after, we see them all in a room together where Farva attempts a failed prank with a bar of soap.Speaking of Farva, he is the funniest source of humour for the film because he is fat, loud and obnoxious, and the pranks the cops pull on him because he is quickly hot-tempered will have you in stitches. It almost seems like if they had made a movie that was solely about pranking Farva, it might have worked. Why? Because he is the dumbest one of the group, and the officers use this to their advantage to tease him. He is the kind of guy that never says the right thing, drinks until he pukes and would walk into a room naked and drunk, thinking he is funny when he is making an ass out of himself.For the life of me, I couldn't help but laugh at him and feel bad for him at the same time because he is an A****ie. He is the station's radio operator because he got demoted for something he did involving a bus. He makes the movie funny, and I am sure he will be the cop remembered by those who like the movie. There is one humorous scene involving a scuffle at a restaurant that has Farva flying over the counter. This was pretty funny compared to the rest of the jokes the film offers. Some jokes involve syrup, a locker and, god help us, a fake bear that is used as a distraction, but it's what is happening that will offer a giggle or perhaps a belly laugh.So what does this say about the story? Well, not much. The story is sidelined in favour of jokes. Into the second act, it's a series of pranks until Rabbit does something to piss Captain O'Hagan of and Farva gets unleashed on the community again to belly laughs. What's most annoying is the choices they make in the story. There is nothing left to the imagination where everything is painfully obvious. We know who the villain of the film is as soon as you see the person, and if you have to second guess, you're watching the wrong movie.I did like the movie for what it is worth, but it's truly a case that depends on your sense of humour. Some will be tickled by the stupidity where others will not. I belly laughed quite a bit, but in the end, it's very rudimentary, and we know what is going to happen. They attempt to twist the ending with the idiot teenagers Thorny, and Mac met at the beginning of the movie. The story feels shallow, and the editing feels patchworked from one scene to another. I don't think this is the last we will see from Broken Lizard, and I would be curious to see what they do next since, but I am sure we will get a ""Super Troopers 2"" very soon.

Good plot tension is added by there rivalry with the local cops and there fight over the territory. There are a number of great pranks, in addition to the good repartee between various characters.This is one of my favorite all time movies, and one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.

68,anthonymichaelbangert,Unfunny Stoner Cop Humor,5,1 February 2015,"One hour and forty minutes of comedy, and I only chuckled 4 times. Not exactly what I would call a good movie. This movie is the story of a group of State Troopers who goof off more than doing their actual job. However, when state budget cuts threaten to shut them or the rival local cops, the officers must do actual work. They battle the local cops in a case of marijuana distribution in their town through a series of hijinks and general goofiness. This movie was a mediocre plot put together with mediocre acting and creating a crap movie. Perhaps if I were stoned this movie would be a little more enjoyable.Soundtrack: 4- Most of the time the soundtrack made no sense with the movie. However, there were certain moments that worked.Script: 3- This script seemed to be haphazardly thrown together to make a movie that made no effort to be coherent. The plot had so many holes, that I'm amazed this movie held together at all.Originality: 4- Unorthodox cops who come together to save the day? Seen it hundreds of times. There are some different elements in her, but they have all been seen before. This made the movie very predictable.Cinematography: 3- This was a low budget film that made the best of what it had. It wasn't bad cinematography, but it wasn't really good either.Casting: 10- The actors in this film fit the parts they were cast in very well, so at least they got that right.Acting: 5- The acting in this movie was shoddy.

73,happytoms,Surprisingly a great comedy even after 18 years.,7,10 November 2019,"I remember watching this movie when I was younger and I kinda remembered parts of but I kept procrastinating watching it again now because I kinda loved it when I was younger. So finally came the day I finally decided to watch it and I must say even after all these years it's quite enjoyable.I want to talk about a few aspects of the movie.The story. ( Easy to watch, engaging.
It's set in the beautiful state of Vermont where we are introduced to a wide selection of different characters over the course of the movie but this story is mainly focusing on 5 highway troopers who love to prank everyone and make fun of everything while constantly messing up even if they have good intentions. And of course, everything no matter how bad it gets has a way to be resolved in the end after all. I don't mind it.
This is a comedy so there are quite a lot of comedic and iconic early 2000s moments. I enjoyed some of them but not all of them and it's okay. At first, I didn't liked few things about it but watching it with an open mind, later on, made me thinking who cares. It's just more of everything.
Personally, I enjoyed this movie much more than a few other early 2000s movies who tried to be funny but failed miserably. It doesn't work every time but it did work in this one.Sound design - (Meh. I'm writing this review a few days after I watched the movie and looking back I don't think I remember that much of the sound design. Nothing really stood out to me besides maybe à few songs but nothing too great to remember.)Cinematography (They didn't have a high budget at all to make this movie but what they managed to pull off with this budget is actually pretty good.)Overall I think quite a lot of people will enjoy it and not so much won't. There isn't exactly too many things to hate about it. Personally, after watching it this feels like not the greatest movie and not the worst one so it's somewhere in the middle around 7 out of 10.

This is one, that will actually require a second viewing after wards, either because you're laughing so hard, or you don't get most of the jokes. If you don't understand it the first time around, please watch it again. There are a LOT of jokes and gags here, most of them are fall-on-the-floor funny, and even if you don't get it, the movie will still make you smile. I think this is the perfect movie to watch on a bad day. It will cheer you up instantly.The film follows the ridiculously stupid antics of a team of five Vermont State Troopers, Thorny, Farva, Mac, Foster, and Rabbit, none of whom would really qualify for a bronze medal in the special Olympics (as far as police work goes). These cops' idea of a good time involves playing bizarre, often rude mind games with the speeders they pull over (such as, trying to substitute as many words as possible with the word ""meow,"" and repeating each other's lines), and chugging bottles of maple syrup in the nearby diner. The state cops and the local cops are rivals, and if the contest was for sanity, the locals would win in a landslide. The mayor is threatening to shut down the state troopers precinct, and when a murder that somehow involves drugs occurs on the highway, the inept highway patrolmen find this as a last ditch effort to save their jobs. Yep, the plot highly resembles something from The Naked Gun, and while the film isn't as great as that, the laughs are nearly just as consistent. Once you see the movie for the third time, you will need to pause the movie occasionally in order to let out all your laughter from the last hysterical gag, and prepare yourself for the next one, which will of course, come probably as soon as you hit the play button. The actors who play the five troopers are all really talented unknowns (especially the guy who plays Farva), and they should all get more starring roles. These guys really know how to make you laugh your ass off, and the fact that they manage to keep the straightest faces imaginable while doing it is priceless. These guys need more recognition, because as long as these guys aren't acting, lots of talent is going to waste. This film really makes me want to see the other Broken Lizard movie, Club Dread, just so I can see these guys in action again. The scenery in the film is just plain gorgeous, with the beautiful green New England look. It's a happy setting, that totally sets a mood of impending hilarity. From the hysterical opening sequence involving some stoned teenagers and littering, you'll need to duct tape your sides together to avoid splitting. Quoting another review, this film may seriously impair your ability to keep a straight face while speaking to a state trooper. I couldn't agree more. This hilarious film receives an 8/10.

This unknown comedy troupe called Broken Lizard, who has been compared to Kids in the Hall and Monty Python (I can't imagine a bigger insult to those two talented groups) put together a poorly acted & scripted, rather disjointed film without *any* laughs whatsoever that left me wondering how such a film was ever made. Playing a group of unlikable police officers, the jokes were weak and underwhelming, and made me nostalgic for the days of the ""Police Academy"" films- even the weakest sequel of those was funnier than this movie was (and don't get me wrong, I did not find the sequels to be funny).

The concept of the movie was probably developed while the writers were in a car, stoned, and wondering what they would be like if they were highway patrolmen. They exploit that idea for what it was worth, but then the extra time needed to fill the movie got in the way.However, when viewed as a series of related sketches, it is often hilarious, and usually at least very funny.  The opening scene with the troopers is prodigious in it's timing and content, as is the Cat Game.  Then there are the subtle scenes where the setup is not given enough time for the payoff to be hilarious (the extra gas in the trash, the radar gun pointed downwards...), but on second viewing, one recognizes that Broken Lizard understands comedy at it's core, and emphasizes subtlety as well as farce.Each member of Broken Lizard has their forte, but they all are talented comedians that clearly enjoy their work.  Marisa Coughlin is, to use the vernacular, one hot momma!  I wish should could find work that better demonstrates her talent, 'Freddy Got Fingered' just doesn't do her justice. She is gorgeous, but believe it or not, she also has considerable acting talent.  Comedy is supposed to be the hardest genre of acting, and she was holding her own quite well with some of the best.In the end, when I view a comedy, I ask myself if it made me laugh.  Hell yeah it did, many times.  But there were a few duds, and sometimes the lulls had me checking the watch.  I do recommend it for the hilarity, but don't expect a great story.",Super Troopers

The movie follows a gang of Vermont highway patrolmen, who love pulling pranks on whoever they pull over. To save their outfit from being shut down by the governor, they try and out-do the local police station in solving a big-time crime, and inevitably lots of gags ensue and everyone finds the time to get drunk. Embarassingly unfunny, somebody needs to retire the Broken Lizard team before they do any more theatrical damage.",Super Troopers
81,youdontsmellbad,Unfunny Dreck,6,1 August 2004,"Super Troopers has little going for it. It's got a cast of amateurs with no comic timing plus genius, Brian Cox in a role of which, frankly, he should be ashamed. Cox can play comedy, in the subdued ""Rushmore"" he gets some of the biggest laughs. His role is strictly by the numbers and makes way for the aimless comic flailing and groping of Broken Lizard. they stick mainly to the obvious. drug references: funny. loud voices: funny. occasionally they land on something worth a laugh. when the cop peeks his head around the car to fit in one final compulsory ""meow,"" i laughed. i also laughed at the entire bar of soap in the guy's coffee. i also had to contain my anger as the remaining hour and ten minutes didn't have a single laugh.willfilly being shot in the crotch isn't funny, but the concept yields itself to any number of approaches that would have been. as a method of interrogation it might have been funny... something like that.but most offensive to comedy everywhere is the group of stoners making the worst possible pot jokes on the planet.

83,bkam,Just plain stupid with a few redeeming moments,3,5 July 2003,"There is not much that can be said favorably about this movie. The premise is stupid, the acting unremarkable, the `humor' not humorous for the most part, and nothing else particularly redeeming.  I am all for suspension of disbelief, and I am a fan of stupid humor, but even preparing myself for a silly film I was not really prepared for the idiocy that was Super Troopers. I watched it because my friends often quote from it.  While there are some good one-liners, the situational comedy was not up to par, and was really just an excuse for a bunch of guys to live out their idiotic fantasies onscreen, rather than actually entertain an audience.  That said, there are a very few moments that are memorable.  If you're interested in seeing this film because your friends talk about it, that's about the only reason to see it.  The funny moments, which are sparse to begin with, do not really make it worth seeing in its own right apart from referencing it with your friends (and my recommendation if your friends like this film a lot is to make new friends).  I watched it with my brothers, and while we laughed a number of times, normally when we get together to watch a comedy we can't stop laughing.  Bad sign for a ""comedy."" [3/10]",Super Troopers
84,YbsuhA,This was actually pretty funny.,7,9 March 2021,"I've seen a lot of weird cult comedies. Examples? Wayne's World, Napoleon Dynamite, The Big Lebowski etc... Super Troopers is another underrated and hilarious cult comedy which does a lot of things right, and definitely desrves a try.This is one of the funniest police movies I've seen, and it just hit my sense of humour magically perfect. Not everything in this movie, is funny, but when it is funny, it's very funny. I laughed a while in some scenes. The best scene is probably the opening. It's just hilarious. I've actually watched some of the scenes from this movie before, unaware that it was from this movie. I thought some parts looked familiar.There is almost no actors I know off in this movie, and the only ones, is Brian Cox (X-Men) and Jim Gaffigan (That '70s Show). The rest is unknown for me, but I actually liked them a lot. Everybody's funny at some point.If I should compare this movie to another movie, the other movie would be Zoolander. Both movies serves a lot of stupid humour, the characters in both movies is equalky funny, and they both got terrible sequels (which I try to stay away from) a decade later. This movie is a lot more funnier than Zoolander, which I thought was just stupid. This movie is also funny, and I'd rather prefer this movie instead of Ben Stiller's fashion model.This is a funny comedy I very much enjoyed, and I recommend this if you just want to watch something.",Super Troopers

Brian Cox was great for this role.

All the Police Academy movies sucked and the Naked Gun movies were barely better. That is why I was so apprehensive to see this. I'm glad I gave it a shot, because the ""Broken Lizard"" comedy troupe is my new love. After seeing this movie I put them up there with Monty Python, Kids in the Hall, Mr. Show and SCTV. You sense right away that they have been performing and writing together for a long time, their timing is perfect. Very witty dialogue. This movie was alot of fun and I look forward to ""Club Dread"", their next movie. Don't pan this movie or watch it with any preconceptions about it being a Police Academy rip-off.

92,Visitor_C,Made for an Immature Audience,5,13 June 2014,"Comedy is opinionated, that is a fact. But when making a comedy, one must properly deliver the humor through snarky dialogue and comedic actions. This film those have many instances of funny, stupid action and actions. The best jokes come from the film working with its environment, and not the dialogue. This includes the scene when pulling over the pot heads, which was a pretty humorous scene. The problem comes from the dialogue. Most if not all of the lines in this film lack any essence of true comedy. It falls into the category of failed attempts, in both the story and the delivering of lines. I won't blame the actors (except for Kevin Heffernan) for the terrible humor or line deliverers. Instead I blame the terrible script. This is all opinionated, but it holds some truth after the analyzation, even for a small time comedy. All in all this film failed to deliver laughs, and would be better suited for an immature audience due to the crass and immature humor. The target viewing group for a movie like this would be unsupervised Middle Schoolers, but I digress. In any case, humor is unique to each person, some like moronic jokes more then others.

The acting? Meh. Plot?  Gah! Theme? Don't make me smack you.But g'damnit if it wasn't funny.  Basically the film was an excuse to splice together a bunch of bits involving zany and likeable cops doing nutty things to themselves or others.  On that level it worked very well and was quite funny.
As an aside, I first discovered this movie while stoned with friends.  One of them played the intro and it was amazing how disorienting it was.  I felt exactly like one of the stoned kids in the car, wondering where the cop suddenly disappeared to ... why's he driving away ... oh s*it how did he end up behind them? ... didn't he already tell them to pull over? ... why's he driving right at them?! ... He's asking for their license again? Didn't he already do that? ... etc.  I definately recommend watching the intro while stoned.  I think the cops actions were very carefully planned to have disorienting effects on those with altered minds, whether it be the stoned kids in the car or anyone else watching it from their viewpoint (which is how the scene was shot, the only scene not from the officer's perspective btw)A couple weeks after that I decided to rent it and watch the whole thing (sober).

From the opening sequence with the drugged-out college kids, to the closing sequence with uhh...the drugged-out college kids, this movie was hilarious. I especially enjoyed the running joke of the other characters making ignorant comments about not knowing Thorny's ethnic make-up. The local police think he's Mexican, his own Trooper captain thinks he's an Arab. Not highbrow stuff to be sure, but oh so funny.There's no point laying out the film in any detail. You'll either like it or you won't. It is in the vein of ""Ace Ventura"": paper-thin plot, paper-thin characters, funny gags. I consider it a guilty pleasure that I'm almost ashamed to admit I loved. Almost.
Rating: 8/10 for pure silliness.*MINOR SPOILERS* DVD: the DVD contains 3 different audio commentaries that are all pretty funny.

I actually heard one person comment, ""When are they getting back to the jokes?""  When they did, I found the jokes had the quality of the bad jokes one might make as small talk around the office--certainly not funny enough to hear in a movie.  I honestly did not laugh again until near the end with the scene in the burger place that is prominently featured in the commercial.

105,Grosik_Stim,All about context... a fine addition to the genre,7,26 September 2002,"Many comedy troupes have put their acts on the big screen withmixed results.  The best of them, like Monty Python and MelBrooks/Carl Reiner are pillars of film as well as stage comedy. More often, great stage troupes can't effectively translate their shortsketches to full-length - Kids in the Hall (the best troupe whocouldn't make film work) and most Saturday Night Live offshootsare the obvious examples. Broken Lizard fall somewhere in the middle with Super Troopers. This movie is funniest when taken in this context.  Sketchcomedians are like stand-ups in that they observe the mainstreamand riff on it to find the humour.  This movie does that better thanmost.  In the hands of a good veteren troupe, the idea of beingpulled over on the highway and thinking ""what do these cops dothe rest of the time?"" is fodder for some great jokes.  Lizard provestheir worth by culling enough jokes from that premise to fill 90minutes and that's no small feat!  No, they're not Python andTroopers is not Holy Grail, but they are pretty close to The Kids andthis is better than Brain Candy.  Their personal chemistry showsthrough and it's obvious that they work well together and shareeach other's sense of humour... all making for a great ""feel-goodfun laugh"" atmosphere.  If they can pull that off, I'd love to see themon stage.   They wear their influences on their sleeve as there is a ""PoliceAcademy"" sensibility (but without resorting to ""they're all stupid andbumbling so it's funny"" as the only gag) and the ending is lifteddirectly from the Simpsons ""we're jammin'"" episode.  But that's apretty good mix and they don't fall into the trap of trying to do toomuch.  Light, clever and funny.

I laughed a lot and I don't usually like stupid humour (Ace Ventura, etc.)  It is refreshing to see something labelled as a comedy in which you actually laugh more than once during the film (unlike films like The Royal Tanenbaums, which I enjoyed, but barely laughed once).I didn't like the first scene (although a majority of those who commented seemed to like that scene) and I began to wonder what I was doing there. But after that first scene, when the true Trooper characters were revealed, I couldn't stop laughing.As for the ""gross-out"" scenes that everyone seems to be talking about, I have to ask: what gross-out scenes? I didn't find any scene to be gross or off-putting. Perhaps I missed that scene because I was too busy wiping the tears from my eyes from laughing too hard..I'm still laughing today, as is my boyfriend, who I went and saw the movie with.

That's pretty much all you need to know. Some of the humor is waaaaay out there, but not really offensive (and, yes, still very funny).  There's one particular joke about bikers (not really about bikers, but I don't want to ruin the scene) that is especially funny, and it's a really clean joke, too!The film is a bit long; the scene in which the guys go on a drinking binge and rip up a rival officer's lawn isn't really necessary.  Too, it  seems as if some of the scenes were improvised and sometimes they don't completely come together: scenes drag or lose their comic punch on a few occassion when Serious Actor (notice the capital S and A) Brian Cox enters.I really enjoyed the actors, though, and thier fresh approach to fairly standard material.  Kevin Heffernan is a riot as a patrolman on probation, and Paul Soter stands out in his role as an officer in romantic pursuit of another cop (Marisa Coughlan, who is also good) on a rival squad.I read another review here that intimated some sexism, and I have to say that I disagree.  Don't want to give away too much of the plot, though...I was worried this would be a stoopid, Farrelly Brother-like comedy, and it wasn't.  I kinda liked it!",Super Troopers
122,Shatts,Has its moments but just not enough of them,6,17 March 2002,"Super Troopers is a movie spattered with great comedic moments, mildly humorous jokes and some down right sleep enducing moments (maybe a little harsh, perhaps I should reclassify them as bad jokes that don't work at all). As has all ready been stated the best jokes are in the previews, so you find yourself searching for fresh material that doesn't live up to what you expect from a comedy movie. At its best it is a movie to rent from the video store when there's nothing else out or if you happen to be entertaining people who find a naked fat man being covered in castor sugar funny.

But if Broken Lizard is your offbeat brand of humor, you'll love this picture.Watching it you can tell the cast (who wrote the film as well) is enjoying it. Whether that is due to the excitement of their first feature or the sheer hilarity of the script or simply because of who they are naturally, it comes through. It is a joy to watch. You will wish you and your friends were this clever and funny.Parts of the story may be kind of weak, but for the most part it is quite a piece of work. Tight for a comedy script. The one-liners are great and the deliveries perfect. If it is your kind of movie, you will probably quote this film as much, if not more, than any of your other favorites.",Super Troopers

Kevin Heffernan, as Rodney Farva, is one of the funniest men I've ever seen (""Who wants cream?  Nobody?  Okay, no cream...""), and he alone makes the movie worth watching.

132,Inches_72,A movie to get drunk to,8,30 December 2003,"Sheesh, if I have to read one more review of this movie that says 'it isn't realistic', I am going to go postal.Right off the bat, I don't know why anyone would go into a movie called 'Super Troopers' and involving a comedy group called Broken Lizard and expect it to be a frank and realistic portrayal of the Vermont police service. Whilst the state police and highway patrol are both central agencies in the movie, they are portrayed more as college frats than as authority figures.When I first saw this movie I was a little apprehensive, too often a comedy with a good preview is sadly little more than that- a good preview with eighty five minutes of crap packed around the good bits. Super Troopers starts a little slow, but it picks up, and soon you're laughing at every second or third scene. The thing that makes Super Troopers work as a comedy is the different levels and styles of comedy you see in it. While my sixteen year old brother is most amused by Fava's violent outbursts and crude language, I found more amusement in the witty quips of Ramathorne and the wonderful acting by Bryan Cox as a drunken highway patrol chief. His performance as a drunk is the finest I've ever seen in a movie. Reminded me of countless drunken nights at college.Now, this film won't suit everyone, obviously. There are a lot of sexual allusions and a lot of foul language that may offend some people. But, for the most part, it's one of those movies that we need more of. It's innocent (in that it doesn't deal with any real issues), funny, and it has (I shudder at using the cliched expression) 'heart'. You can tell that all of Broken Lizard, as well as the other cast members, had an immense amount of fun filming the film. While the director and writer also plays a role, he doesn't pull a Tarantino and make himself out to be anything more special than the other cast members. That said, he is probably the strongest member of Broken Lizard when it comes to acting and line delivery.The entire cast, down to the redneck cops and Ramathorne's live-in girlfriend are played well, but it is the 'Super Troopers' that really dominate the show.See If You Liked: American Pie, Not Another Teen Movie, and Scary Movie. Strengths: Lots of different comedic styles, some classic one-liners ('Who wants a moustache ride' and 'You crapped on my heart' are both great). Weaknesses: Flimsy plot. But who really cares.My Rating: 8 out of 10",Super Troopers
133,bobzilla1996,"This is not a comedy movie, more a cop documentary.",2,2 January 2016,"Let me explain this rating a bit better now. If this movie didn't categorise itself as a comedy it would be a good movie because it would show what half the cops in the United States act like and it would of been interesting. However they made a fatal error and labelled itself as a 'comedy movie' yet the attempts it made to be humorous were dumb, lame and not smart at all, it was very poorly written. The scene where they are in the car and about to ask for their license details etc was just a feeble attempt at creating a smirk. It was just pure stupid and weak. If you have a very low sense of humour and one that isn't very sophisticated or requires any brain you might like it because its simple and still not effective.",Super Troopers

The members of Broken Lizard have an infectious rapport, great comic timing and true comic inventiveness.  The opening scene starts out as the oldest hippy/drug joke of all time (eating the bag of pot) which morphs into a really bizarre series gags.  The rest of the movie follows this same pattern where you know the joke that is coming, but it doesn't arrive the way you thought it would.  Although there are juvenile sex and gross-out jokes, they are tame and avoid the usual modern comedy stand-by--feces.

That was hilarious, but can the movie live up to its trailer?  I went into the theater with a sense of anticipation and dread.  Anticipation that the movie would turn out to be as clever as the trailer, dread that it would turn out like most modern comedies.  As soon as Willy Wonka was quoted, though, I fell in love with this movie.  I fear that the 1 or 2 key ""gross-out"" scenes will blind some viewers from the true cleverness of the comic madness perpetrated by Broken Lizard.  It meanders back and forth between razor-sharp dialogue and inspired physical comedy.  Many would call it sophomoric, and rightly so, but it achieves the kind of rare sophomoric brilliance delivered by the likes of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the Farrely Brothers, and the creators of Airplane.

So many things from this movie will become pop-culture quotes if it gets released nationwide, and I hope it does.

You watch it and think 'is this for real?' but don't get much farther than that -- you're laughing too hard.But I may be predisposed for laughter since I'm one of the under-30 crowd. However, Super Troopers is a work of pure insanity and pure genius. From start to finish, you don't get much time to recover from laughing. All things considered, it had a plot that won out over most of the teen-bop movies I've had to sit through.  And those didn't make me laugh a quarter as much. So you decide on what you want to watch -- another teen movie or this work of masterpiece?It's in some town in Vermont near the border, who cares? It's got the green New England small town feel.  Complete with a local diner that the town and highway cops frequent. Notice they park on polar sides. Then the next thing you see is maple syrup. Pure, viscous maple syrup being chugged in competition. It makes you cringe, laugh and feel empathy for Rabbit when he has to finish the rest of the bottle.The town cops are condescending, and clearly more organized in the sane sense of the word. The two factions hate each other, but even as the ax comes down to close the state police station they keep at it [by 'it' I mean shananigans].  There's a murder on the highway, but a rampaging pig inside a Winnebago coerces the state police to give it to the locals. It turns out that case, solved in entirety is the key edge either side needs to survive the firing.There's enough quirks, and pure comic craziness to keep you guessing what they'll do next. They're all newcomers [to me] except Brian Cox, and Daniel von Bargen. If you can get your hands on it, sacrifice a few hours and watch this.  ..Twice.

I actually turned to my boyfriend, who wasn't laughing either, and asked, ""When does it get funny?"" He basically said after that he remembered it being funny but can't remember why. Apparently there is a plot. I don't know what it is because this movie spent more time with the troopers F@#%ing around than telling a story. And all of the jokes are predicable. For example, Two Troopers are having lunch at a burger place. They get are served by two teen-aged boys who are jerks. They sit down and one of them noticed that a sticker has been placed over the cup. Guess what happens- A.He discovers a hole in the cup and his drinks spills. B. Nothing. If you guessed A. You win! No, seriously they hand the punch line out on a silver platter hopping you aren't smart enough to notice. The acting is so bad. And they don't understand comedic timing. According to them, comedy is yelling, screaming and punching each other in the dick and laughing about it. The writer and Director is also acting in this movie,got his friends write a script. Then some how got some money to produce it. The only good actor in this movie is the only female character. Her career was DESTROYED by this movie.

I couldn't believe there was 30 min left, because, Nothing and I mean NOTHING from the plot was present. EVER. So how are they going to wrap it up.

If you want laughs and think that pranks, practical jokes and goofiness are funny things, check out this fun, fresh approach to filmmaking, Broken Lizard style.",Super Troopers
165,sado196,Stop thinking and start laughing,9,21 May 2002,"I for one agree with the negative comments so far in one aspect.  This movie is dumb!  But the fact that this movie doesn't assume it is any better than that is what makes the entire thing work.  Plot?  Who cares?!  Line up the next joke.  Uh oh!  Another joke about excrement, drugs or sex?!  Well, damn!  Thats exactly what I expected when I plunked down my hard earned money I make from being serious all day.Maybe the problem for some people is that they don't belong to the right audience to appreciate and enjoy this film.  Here's some pointers:  If you still find yourself quoting movies like Friday, Animal House, Army of Darkness, Billy Madison, Tommy Boy or Ace Ventura you are in the target audience.  If you like to pull a few pranks every now and then (or at least are able to laugh at one) you are going to appreciate this film.  If you aren't uptight at the thought of watching a little nudity or hearing a few drug references, you will make it through just fine.  If you have trouble sitting through any of the afore mentioned movies because there's a stick in your rectum (damn nearly killed-em) then give this one with a wide berth.To anyone who calls this immature: yes, it definately is.  But the fact that it pulls off immature better than most films that have come up since Animal House is what makes it stand out.  And the slight indie film aftertaste coupled with the break from the overly done poopy joke of most mainstream Hollywood films is what will leave you wanting to see it again as soon as the end credits are over.",Super Troopers
166,vozzybear,Don't forget your low expectations,7,25 February 2003,"The key to enjoying Supertroopers is to set your preconceived notions of what comedy is and isn't, and watch the movie for yourself, wide-eyed and innocent.I enjoyed this movie because it made me fall on the floor laughing.  Most notably in the first act, it both makes me glad state troopers don't really act this way and makes me wish they would.Brian Cox, for whom I have tremendous respect for (watch him in Minus Man), is the glue of this movie. While the others are serving their adolescent insanity, Cox keeps things in order and occasionally slips to his charges' level.Yes, the movie sags a bit in the middle, and yes, this is due to a reliance on plot over comedy, but to hell with it, sit back and enjoy the stupid plot for what it's worth.This movie is at times considered forgettable, but I feel compelled to rate it a 7. It might be a bit high, but when you consider the inexperience of the creators of this movie, it stands up decently. Of course, I would feel that anything over a 7 for this movie would be inappropriate.7/10",Super Troopers
167,tms2-1,Lame slap stick,1,5 May 2012,"Apparently the second half of this movie is where it and the troopers redeem themselves. The problem is the first half is so bad I couldn't get there. It's populated by bad sitcom characters who are caricatures of incompetent cops. They bumble around blowing testosterone on the viewer with lame practical jokes and macho dufus clichés. When the characters weren't insulting my intelligence, the director was, with 'humor' derived from silly coincidences of situation. (I'm thinking of the errant baseball hitting the girl with eyes closed in the face at just the right moment to make her think the dufus is also abusive. What a crack-up, eh.)I recently moved to Vermont, the setting for this movie. I love it here. I was totally prepared for a silly little movie that I would get a kick out of if for no other reason than that it was about Vermont.

Don't take it too seriously and, like me, you'll not be disappointed.The atmosphere was good - at points I thought I'd stumbled on an inside-joke, or that this was a feature length movie of an existing series, but this is probably due to the fun relationship between the characters.
I'd put this flick somewhere between ""Bachelor Party"" and ""Me, Myself & Irene"" as a comedy: not quite as all-out farce as the former, not quite as involved as the latter. But more my style than Dude, Where's My Car (even if it's just as silly ;)",Super Troopers

This troop is very talented at pulling off the one liners and all the little gags that take place throughout the movie.  Many of them still make me chuckle to myself every time I think about them.  The acting in this movie is very mediocre, but in this kind of movie an oscar performance is not required to make it funny.  The movie does a good job in tieing together all the skits of their traffic stops with the main story of trying to save the station, and uncovering the smuggling ring etc. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be extremly funny.

What a story this company/comedy troop has.BEGGING people to come and see there movies on street corners,universities, anywhere they can and all for free and after all that to develop a great fan base after a few years THEY CRAP ON IT And decide to close down there website that helped them and was created for the fans, but the worst thing about it....THEY DIDN'T TELL ANY OF THEM. They just decided that they are better than us they want new fans not the fans that helped them get where they are....you know the same fans they begged years ago. Still the smart crew they are they released the best movie with Super Troopers and got everyones attention and thank God for that because after that they have sucked with everything else.

This leads to zany antics, drunk and disturbing behavior, and one unlucky soul covered in icing sugar.

It is a funny little glimpse into the inner workings of a group of tight-knit coworkers. They do the kind of stuff that you would do if you worked in a highway patrol office in a small town. They play pranks on each other, they give each other crap, and they try to make their job a little more enjoyable. In fact, I wouldn't doubt it if some of these things were excerpts from these guys' lives. It has the kind of re-watch potential that made Meet The Parents and other select comedies so beloved. It has the little things. Each character could had very well been made from a blueprint of any group of friends. It's got the tough guy, the new guy, the leader, and of course, the target.

I'm no snob, in fact I generally like lowbrow humor when it's FUNNY... which is the bottom line for me with comedy (what else really matters? Did you laugh?).

It is definitely an R-rated film, with plenty of well-placed expletives, numerous drug references, and sexual situations.

The cheesy gags and excellent editing bring this thing home, but the fantastic script and killer performances from the Broken Lizard team set it all up for a great film.

Our friend's tastes don't always line up with ours 100% but it was on cable the other day and I said what the heck, let's TiVo it. Two weeks later we play it and it CRACKED US UP!!! I told my husband we only had to give it 15 minutes and if he didn't like it we could bail but he could only say ""I can't look away""... it was just hysterical! The director and main character are HILARIOUS. The humor is broad, but so are some of the best movies, and this one absolutely fell into that category for me. It's so hilarious and I can tell it's going to be super quotable. I'm buying the DVD tomorrow to watch it with no commercials and with all the swear words! LOLOL... I love it!",Super Troopers

Instead of making the story an unfathomable premise, it makes a believable plot that keeps you interested due to the hilarity that ensues. Like Foster says, ""(they) bring the funny.""

I've always said these are the markings of a brilliant cinematic achievement.  Turns out I was right.Jay Chandrasekhar (credited not only as writer/director, but also playing one of the main characters) and his ragtag team of pseudo-heroes churn out a film that isn't hoping to be regarded by the Academy as the Best Movie of the year, nor is it trying to force upon us a political or religious statement.But what it IS trying to do is make us laugh, and with such scenes as a police unit fighting a ferocious pig guarding a Winnebago with a dead woman inside and a cop attacking the punk at the burger hut who spit in his burger, it succeeds.  Without comparing it to classic humourous powerhouses like Animal House, Caddyshack and the like, Super Troopers definitely stands on its own and delivers the goods.  Some may not appreciate the humour, as it does border on the offensive, however the characters come across as loveable despite their villainous status.Take, for example, Thorny (Jay Chandrasekhar).  In the opening scene, viewers will quickly love the three stoners who get pulled over and in order to rid themselves of the evidence, the kid in the backseat must eat a whole bag of marijuana and another of hallucinogenic mushrooms.  When Thorny pulls these kids over, the viewers' first instinct is to brand him the bad guy. But not moments later, he engages himself in an argument with the youngsters in which he takes THEIR SIDE and still manages to come out on top.  This not only proves his authority in any situation, but also displays a classic example of why this film has attained a somewhat cult status in such a short amount of box office time.The plot of the story, while defined, is very loose and comes across as clumsy at times.  But with such a diverse cast who each have their own subplots, it's to be expected.  There are always numerous scenarios happening at any given moment, many of them offering opportunities for uproarious laughter.  This merely shows one example of how the sometimes-sloppy plot is compensated for.  One more thing you have to give the movie credit for is the almost complete absence of any major Hollywood talent, not including rising talent Marisa Coughlan.  Even given the lack of familiar actors, the movie doesn't come across as low-budget, and the fresh faces on the screen are more than talented enough to carry the film from start to finish.All in all, while the movie isn't the best ever made and some of the jokes are rehashed from earlier theatrical releases, it firmly holds its own and is well worth the price of admission.I gave this movie 9 out of 10.",Super Troopers

Their desire to save their jobs often comes second to their urge to keep themselves constantly entertained.During the opening moments of this movie, the time I spent not rolling around on the floor laughing was spent thinking, ""These guys had to have been pulled over one too many times.  They KNOW what it's like having a cop mess with you.""  Of course no cop has ever messed with anyone the way these guys do, but to a young hooligan like I once was, Cops are seen with a paranoid fear somewhere in between fear of your father, and fear of death. Broken Lizard uses this fear to stage several hilarious scenes dealing with John Q Public and the way in which their fear keeps them from calling these cops out on their pranks.Super Troopers is by no means intellectual cinema, but I got my money's worth, which is (I believe) a rare thing when it comes to movies.

253,wrogers1321,Great review for a great movie,9,9 December 2008,"Written by ""Broken Lizard"", a group of writers/actors who have given us other comedies such as Beerfest (2006), Super Troopers is a hilarious comedy about some Vermont state troopers who are about to be shut down because of their lack of performance and the overshadowing from the know-it-all local cops. From the look of it, Super Troopers is just another silly slob humor movie, but unlike other movies in that genre, the movie's comedy is backed up by a pretty decent plot with a surprising twist toward the end of it. It has certainly earned a place in my mind as one of the funniest movies to come out in the past ten years.Broken Lizard, the writers and director of this movie, were also the five central characters of it. Jay Chandrasekhar, Steve Lemme, Erik Stolhanske, Kevin Heffernan, and Paul Soter starred as the five ""super troopers"", a quirky group of highway cops who enjoy playing pranks on people that they have pulled over in the name of fun. When this leads to none of them making quota and the idea of shutting their station down, the captain (Brian Cox) decides that they must fight to keep the station open so that they will not have to look for other jobs. Standing in their way, however, is the local police force, a bunch of guys who are just generally not nice to the state troopers, and seem to try and take all the busts, even ones out of their jurisdiction. The local cops do this so that they can get the troopers eliminated, and has total jurisdiction in the area.The film was shot decently, using mainly head shots, and was basic to say the most. The main things that I noticed when watching this movie were the camera angles in scenes where both the local cops and the state troopers were in the same room. The local cops were shot from lower angles but still were head-shots, so that they could be portrayed as bigger and more intimidating, whereas the troopers were shot either from a straight on shot or a higher camera. I think that the significance of that is to show that even though the local cops are usually better cops, the directors didn't want to make their main characters seem small. Other than that, there weren't any complex shots or angles that might be seen in other movies, mainly because this movie is not meant to be like that. It isn't artsy or complex, it is just a straightforward comedy with a crime-mystery type plot. It is real-life; when I saw this movie, I saw shades of my buddies in most of the main characters, making it easy to relate to and thus more enjoyable, because it seems like they were just everyday guys. I think that if being a policeman were actually like what these characters portrayed it as, more people would try to become policeman.Overall, I would give this movie 4 out of 5 stars. In my opinion, it is still in the category of ""slob humor"", and as a critic, I'm not one to give that genre any more than 4 stars. Having said that, in the little pond that is slob humor, Super Troopers is definitely one of the biggest fish, and a force to be reckoned with. I recommend this movie if you liked other movies like Beerfest, not only because it has the same actors and writers, but because the humor involved is so similar, and so brilliant in both. It also would appeal to fans of Dodgeball (2004), Office Space (1999), and Superbad (2007). So in conclusion, if you're looking for something silly, Super Troopers is the movie for you.",Super Troopers

256,lisabha,"Funny, funny stuff",10,20 January 2003,I love this movie!!! The more you watch it the funnier it gets! My friends and I toss lines back and forth from the movie. My personal favorite: Evil shenanigans. We must have rewound that scene at least six times! GREAT STUFF! FUNNY FUNNY!,Super Troopers
257,kinsellamj,A rave review for a great comedy,10,26 January 2003,"Super Troopers?  Never heard of it. Then I saw it.  Then I hit play again and watched it twice in a row. Sitting in an Airbase in Turkey, I knew I had found what would be our number one ""cruise flick.""  The movie that all the officers of Fighting VAQ-134, could watch together, then spend the next few weeks quoting.   One guy even got a callsign, ""Farva.""  Perfect.  There is a lot of great material to chew on all through the movie.  The rivalry, pranks, and rookie bashing are things we cherish.  And we can all relate to having that one guy around who drives you crazy.  Many of my peers have already purchased the movie. And we have incorporated many of the quotes into our cinematically based lingo.My recommendation is to grab a bunch of friends, maybe some cold beverages, and have a good time.  You just may want to become a Highway Patrolman.",Super Troopers
258,dolphieblu,This is the Best Movie EVER!!!,10,3 August 2003,"I love this movie...it is funny and action packed..it is the kind of movie you can watch over and over and still laugh...lol...i love this movie ""You boys like MEXICO!"" lol the characters are funny with a great since of humor...well that all i have to say...I AM A MOVIE FREAK...bye",Super Troopers
259,planet_janet,Hilarious! Funniest movie I've seen in years.,10,23 March 2003,"Of course, you have to be okay with drug and corruption humor, and that is right up my alley. Maybe lack of this quality is the source of some people's dislike for the movie? Frankly, I am surprised by the percentage of people who don't think it is hilarious! I think it is a classic irreverent comedy.",Super Troopers
260,runonanything,truly brilliant,10,27 March 2003,"I'm going to keep this review simple. Go see this movie. Buy the DVD. if you like GOOD comedy, you will like super troopers. It has a great combination of smart comedy and low-brow humor and exceptional acting. This is already a modern cult classic, in the vein of office space. The bottom line is - if you like to laugh (a lot), see this movie. I recommend buying it because you pick up on more and more jokes every time you watch it.",Super Troopers
261,smwarpig63,Great Film,10,22 April 2003,"This is one of the greatest comedy's of all time.  When I saw previews I thought it looked stupid.  Two of my brothers loved it so I rented it, and I was hooked.  I bought the DVD and watched it 5 days in a row. I have probably watched it 20 times already.  These guys have got to make more movies.",Super Troopers
262,oktur,"""That's alotta dimp!""",9,14 August 2003,"I remember first hearing about this movie by listening to the radio and hearing the band .38 Special on a show saying they did the music for it. Soon thereafter I saw a preview for it and it seemed really funny.I was right.The humor in this movie is not for everybody, but for the ones who do get it, it is gold. So many memorable lines and scenes make this movie one of the funniest I have ever seen. And I've seen a lot. This movie can be watched anytime, as many times as you want and it doesn't become old.God bless Broken Lizard and their comic genius. I can't wait for their next outing in ""Club Dread"" where hi-jinks are sure to ensue.",Super Troopers
263,spam_o_matic_2004,Funny every time I watch it.,7,7 March 2004,"I first saw this movie the first week it came out in theaters. I thought it was hilarious. It was the first movie in a long time that actually made me laugh out loud, instead of most other ""comedies"" that you have to force out a laughter or two to enjoy the movie. This film was original, well scripted, and the talent is definately there. I own the movie, and I have seen well over 20 times. I have laughed every time I have watched it. It is almost as if the movie just gets funnier every time I see it. I'm not saying this movie is the best comedy ever, and it isn't by far, but I have to say that if you're looking for a movie thats guaranteed to make you laugh, look for this on the store shelves. It won't be a let down.",Super Troopers
264,lslswan,This Cop Loved it,9,14 January 2012,"I have been a cop in L.A. for 35 years and I am a film buff. Those are my film critic qualifications.I can't believe that I just saw this. Absolutely hysterical. Where did these guys from Broken Lizard get their background and insight? Somehow, they really captured the humor that we as cops can appreciate. bring on the hate.Obviously over the top on some of the ""Shennanigans"" but definitely in the ballpark. They captured the essence of some of the ways we find to have harmless fun without letting the public in. For the haters, sorry, we have to find some way to let out the steam and go home to our families.Maybe these boys have done whatever they are going to do as far as movies, but I hope not. they have great talent and I hope they rise on my screen again and make me howl like I did at this one. Good luck and GOD bless Lizards!",Super Troopers
265,theInterceptor,"Very funny, ""easy"" comedy that's definitely worth it",8,26 June 2006,"I stumbled over this movie on TV some time ago, it just started when I was zapping around. As nothing else was on, I decided to stay, and it was the right decision. I'd need to think hard to find another movie that has given me so many laughs without being absurd or boring at any stage. You just shouldn't take it seriously, which the makers never intended I suppose. Just watch it, and you'll laugh all the time.When I saw the rating of it on IMDb, I wondered why it only has a 6.4, cause all the pages of comments were full of stars. Only the latter pages were drowning in lazy, lame and useless comments. Seriously, what's wrong with you people? There can't be so many ""worst movies"" as you describe, sometimes I think you just come here to vote some movies down intentionally. This is an easy one, but still, you should use your brain when talking about it. I've seen those lazy one-sentence-comments all over the IMDb, and you guys should be removed from here, cause you corrupt the whole points system. If you don't want to engage in a movie that's fine, but then don't come on the internet and vote it down.""Super Troopers"" is a hilariously funny movie for those who like comedy, and it easily makes your popcorn-movie-evening one to remember.",Super Troopers
266,krose-4,Loved it!,10,4 March 2004,"For some reason, I can't get enough of this movie. I've seen it about 10 times already and I love it.  Every time I see it on cable, I stop and watch it.  I love the cast and the plot and the funny jokes and the way they act. It's a comedy.  Of course Troopers don't really act like this, that is what makes this movie so funny.  I have so many favorite parts...especially when they have the kids pulled over (and then ""busting"" them in the end with the Keg.) that is too funny.  I laugh out loud when I watch this movie!!  I love the German couple that they sort of all adopted.  The guys in the film are great.  They are extremely good looking (the Super Troopers of course, not Spurrberry Police).",Super Troopers
267,luciddavid,Finally we can poke a little fun at the boys in blue!,8,15 July 2004,"A refreshingly hilarious look at the usually over-serious highway patrol. I know at least 2 guys who grew a mustache for laughs after watching that movie. A shining performance by the Governor of Vermont. After directing this now cult-classic, Jay Chandrasekhar should have seized the opportunity to take his burgeoning directorial talent and sly humor to the next level. We're still waiting Jay! and NO ""Club Dread"" doesn't count! I think there is still a ton of funny material in law enforcement. I propose that instead of recycling the Canadians into Super Troopers II, we inject the Mexican Mafia, hell bent on bringing us the lowest grade pot. Well Jay, I will give you guys another couple years before I produce my very own Super Troopers rip off with quicker jokes and more corrupt cops... so you can't say I stole your idea.",Super Troopers
268,snowmountainjazzman,three thumbs up!,9,5 November 2004,"Awesome movie! You can really tell that broken lizard have been around together for a while - their kind of fool-around mateship (or as they would say 'Shenanigans') really comes across well on the screen.Their laid back ""fraternity"" (boys mucking around, playing pranks, taking life very unseriously) humor is gold!You can tell that they had fun making this film - and i sure had fun watching it.They are a bit hard on themselves in the directors commentary about the standard of the film - there's a few things they seem to think a bigger budget would have improved - but i disagree - i don't think one single thing could improve upon this great comedy.I look forward to seeing more from broken lizard!",Super Troopers
269,chrishedlund,"Let me tell you another funny story, New Jack.",10,23 April 2019,"I love everything about this movie. I love the jokes, I love the action, I love the music, I love Ursula. Everything. I listened to the director's commentary and Jay kept saying how he wished he could re-shoot this, and change that. F that. I love it just the way it is. I don't remember this movie leaving a big impression on me the first time I saw it. But then I watched it again and laughed more. And I watched it another time and laughed even more. Now it has a place is my heart as one of my all time favorites. And thanks to Ursula, every time I watch it I get a ""raging mega-huge boner!""",Super Troopers
270,vigeant,a new classic for those who love irreverent comedies,9,15 May 2005,"no, this is not another bland predictable Will Farrell or Ben Stiller picture. Super Troopers does what Police Academy never could and films like Wayne's World and Tommy Boy are most revered for. this is the story of a rag-tag group of highway patrol men trying desperately to keep their station from closing while still enjoying the lax and sometimes ridiculous habits that cure their everyday monotony. great skits combined with crazy stock characters that everyone has somehow met keeps the story alive and the audience pumped until the closing credits. join together with a large group of pals and chill in front of the tube to this one - it delivers more laugh out louds than Napoleon Dynamite and will be quoted in the *in the know* circles for a long time to come.",Super Troopers
271,Musicisall420,Hated it then fell in love with it,7,16 May 2005,"Man the first time I saw this movie I thought it was awful. From the trailer my friends and I thought it would be based around the college guys, but it's based on the cops, which at first was disappointing. But later when we watched it on PPV it was hilarious. It's one of those movies that will give you thousands of quotes to crack up you and your friends like the always fun ""He's already pulled over he can't pull over any farther."" It's definitely a movie to watch in good company and preferably unsober. There's too many little funny things in it to mention, you have to watch it a few times to catch them all, and if your like me you'll want to. Don't expect to see an Oscar winner, or for that matter any award winner, it's just a stupid fun movie, and if thats your style this one is definitely for you.",Super Troopers
272,webmaster-1477,"Fantistic! Witty, smart yet immature humor",10,28 May 2005,"I have seen this movie probably more than Star Wars geeks have seen all the Star Wars movies. EXCELLENT comedic value, it has not yet gotten boring. This is one of those movies that some scenes are so well thought out with the details that you have to watch it a couple times to notice them all. The acting is Pretty good. Good enough to give off that ""real life caught on film"" feeling. Lots of movies I've seen (at least from my perspective) when they're trying to depict real life, it just seems like the script and acting are so ""pushed"" to seem like real life that it gets to the point of being annoying. The Broken Lizard comedy troupe is definitely very good at what they do and the script was very well written. Overall, my all-time favorite movie, hands down!",Super Troopers
273,aussie_snake_wrangler,What an experience!,10,30 May 2005,"This movie, albeit set in USA - is a close comparison to some of the policing in NSW Australia!! And what wasn't now is! As a Despatcher (I prefer not to compare myself to Farva but to Ursula (well I am a girl),what games we didn't play over air are now part of daily ""protocol""....Such as Miaow game and of course, ""The Repeater"".And Mac - Bring that moustache over here and give me a moustache ride - bugger Ramathorne - I want you!!! If only the NSW Police Coppers were as sexy, or as funny!It has given me a quote that I have used over the NSWP airwaves many a time, sometimes the full quote, others with partial quote - ""Unit 91, unit91, quit counting your pubes, we have a pursuit out here""I have watched the movie that many times, my hubby, also a copper, hates being near me, cause I can go line for line with you!Love your work guys!!When is Supertroopers 2????",Super Troopers
274,insanity_is_real,Great stuff,10,21 June 2005,"One of the funniest movies of all time it is really up there at least for my thinking. It ain't mainstream nor high budget in fact i'd say it's cult only a handful of people I know have seen it and everybody else is missing out. But it is a new wave twist on old school comedy and should be given 3 claps by all, gotta love it. How did this score an R in the U.S.A? It hasn't got anything graphic sure I wouldn't recommend it for under 10's or over 50's but besides that go right ahead. It's only M15+ in Australia which means any 5 year old could have walked into the cinema without an adult and seen it. Go Australian censorship laws.",Super Troopers
275,jandebeukeleer,police-forces: survival of the funniest,9,23 June 2005,"I was the only one at the movie theater. Tears in my eyes from laughing... GREAT!!This movie is a real treat, especially if you want to have a good laugh, if you want to free your mind. It's a bit like Hot shots, only it is no parody. The story is about two police forces that have to battle against each other because only one force can be kept. The one with the best points (most tickets, arrests,...) wins. Both forces try to make a big drug arrest in order to survive as a police force. It's a bit like ""police academy"", but this one is a lot funnier.I think that everybody has got to see this one, certainly everybody who likes to have a good laugh. I'd like to quote some jokes, or tell some of the great laughs of the movie but don't want to spoil the fun for anybody else. Just check this one out, it's great! Warning: dangerous for people with hart-conditions. contains drinking scenes, drug scenes, extreme violence, sex scenes, even some with animals.

276,blairjones78,One of the best comedies ever.,10,16 July 2005,"Not many movies keep on getting better and better as you watch them for the 5th, 6th or 7th time, especially comedies. The first time I saw this movie in the Cinema it didn't blow me away, and most people I know who have seen this movie only once do not rate it very highly. After seeing it a few times I rate this movie as high as Fletch and other classic comedies, probably higher.There is so many worthwhile jokes that I think it must have taken quite a while to write - if you don't have a similar sense of humour you would probably think they had written it all in one night which clearly wasn't the case. There is not a lot to complain about with respect to the acting either - their style suits the movie perfectly.Remember that it is a comedy first and foremost - if you are looking for an clever story you have the wrong genre. Criticism of the movie being a series of sketches or jokes is really irrelevant - one look at the cover or preview tells you exactly what kind of movie it is. Regardless, there is nothing wrong with the plot and if you appreciate/comprehend the jokes the movie flows just fine.If you are going to watch it, watch it 2 or 3 times.",Super Troopers
