0,Leofwine_draca,Tired prequel,4,19 April 2019,"OUIJA: ORIGIN OF EVIL is a prequel to the first OUIJA, set in the 1960s where a fraudulant medium gets hold of a ouija board that spells demonic possession for her and her family. It's tired, predictable stuff for sure, an insipid picture from Blumhouse Productions that goes through the same old material we've seen countless times. The cast is uninteresting, with former child star Henry Thomas wasted as the investigating priest, and the CGI stretched-mouth scares are laughable.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
1,SnoopyStyle,shockingly pretty good,7,21 November 2017,"It's 1967 Los Angeles. Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) runs a crooked spiritual reading business out of her home. She uses her daughters Lina (Annalise Basso) and younger Doris (Lulu Wilson) in operating her scams. They incorporate an Ouija board into their production. While trying to contact the girls' dead father, Doris seems to make real contact. Father Tom (Henry Thomas) is the headmaster of the girls' school. Mikey (Parker Mack) has a crush on Lina.Surprise! This is actually good. It is well-made. The characters are well-drawn and well-acted. I wouldn't say that this is breaking down any new walls but there is good in doing good work. I do have a couple of small nitpicks. For some reason, Alice and Father Tom go out for what looks like a fancy dinner. It almost looks like a date if it weren't for the characters. Second, I would keep the possibility that Doris is scamming everyone until further into the movie. It would be nice to have Father Tom uncover the whole situation as a reveal. The good are the actors, the mood, the simple premise, and good construction. It's a shocker that this is all pretty good.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
2,Prismark10,Spelling a disaster,6,2 September 2017,"Ouija: Origin of Evil is a prequel set in in 1967 and is filmed very much like a period piece from that era. The film begins with an old Universal pictures logo.Widow Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) stages scam seances with her teenage daughter Paulina (Annalise Basso) from her house. They justify it by helping their clients to move on.When they purchase a Ouija board as a gimmick for the act, the youngest daughter Doris (Lulu Wilson) seems to have become possessed by a mysterious force and behaves like a genuine medium. Doris thinks she can contact her father and starts acting creepily even showing strange abilities such as mind control.Local priest Father Tom (Henry Thomas) investigates Doris's abilities as a medium and thinks there is a link to a sinister Nazi doctor.The film delivers thrills and some scares without going too over the top. The acting is good from the younger cast members. You get the sense of genuine dread but then lapses into silliness and predictability at the end.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
3,nogodnomasters,Hello Friend,7,6 September 2017,"The film takes place in 1967 Los Angeles (IMDB claims 1965) where Alice (Elizabeth Reaser) performs scam seances for money, something she has been doing since her husband Roger died. (Michael Weaver) She allows her two Catholic school daughters to help her. Then enter a Ouija board, possession, Tubular Bells style music, a priest, and a little girl with an odd voice... very formula up until the ending which they just scrambled around until no one was happy with it.In spite of the formula writing, the actors did a good job to raise the level of a less than stellar script, especially young Lulu Wilson who has a flair for horror.

4,kosmasp,Welcome to the dark side,8,19 November 2021,"No there are no cookies, though if you really expected them, the joke is on you - big time. Although to be fair the joke is on many people - no pun intended. Evil can present itself in disguise - giving you what you think you want and/or need.Mike Flanagan is at it again and while this does not reach the heights of the two Netflix shows I've seen of his or the Oculus movie (go check that out if you haven't), this also has so many creepy and really scary moments in it - you should be rejoicing if you are a horror fan - or general movie lover.He again seems to have certain people that he likes to work with. But he does mix them up or adds a few here and there. The ET kid (a grown man and then some of course), Henry Thomas playing quite the interesting role here - one that he was able to stretch his acting muscles with.But all the performances are really good - some odd character choices aside (yes we have to have the occasional horror movie cliche thrown in a few times) of course. That being said the special effects and the things that happen outside the field of vision of our main characters (but visible for us as viewers) are as scary as the things that are thrown in your face - again no pun intended.Really well made movie, edited and written with great skill no matter if you like it overall or not.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
5,jboothmillard,Ouija: Origin of Evil,5,6 September 2020,"Ouija was a fairly disappointing scary movie,so I naturally didn't have my hopes high for a follow-up, and this one was a prequel, but it was rated better by critics, so I gave it a chance, directed by Mike Flanagan (Oculus, Hush, Doctor Sleep). Basically, set in Los Angeles in 1967, Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) is a young widower who works from home as a spiritual medium, assisted by her daughters, 15-year-old Paulina ""Lina"" (Annalise Basso) and 9-year-old Doris (Lulu Wilson). While others would see Alice as a fraud and scam artist, she tells her daughters that she is providing a service that makes people feel better. The family are still grieving following the recent death of Roger (Michael Weaver), Alice's husband and the girls' father. After visiting a convenience store, Lina spots a Ouija board, and suggests to her mother using it in her readings. While trying out the board, Alice unknowingly contacts a spirit named Marcus (Doug Jones) that takes possession of Doris. Alice receives a notice that the bank will foreclose their home. Doris communicates with the board, believing she will contact her dead father. The spirit leads her to secret stash of cash in the basement. Following this, the family the Ouija board, believing it is indeed Roger. The board answers a question only Roger would know the answer to, and Alice is thrilled and starts believing she is communicating with her dead husband. Lina is becoming disturbed with the change in Doris, and finds papers she has written in Polish, a language she does not know. She takes these to Father Tom Hogan (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial's Henry Thomas), her School Principal, to translate. Worried, Father Tom has a Ouija session himself, claiming he wants to contact his dead wife Gloria. The session appears successful, but Father Tom later explains to Alice and Lina that, having read the pages, that they are in fact in contact with a Polish immigrant named Marcus, who was taken captive during World War II by a sadistic doctor who conducted experiments on him and other captives inside the house's basement. These spirits knew answers that only Roger would know because they have been watching the family since they moved in. Meanwhile, Doris kills Lina's new boyfriend Mikey (Parker Mack) when he comes to visit. When they find the body, Father Tom, Alice, and Lina burn the Ouija board in the furnace. Father Tom finds the secret room where the experiments were conducted and is possessed himself. He attacks Alice and Lina but is eventually killed by Doris. Alice is captured, while the unconscious Lina is carried to her bed by the spirit of Roger. Recalling some doll's mouths with their mouths stitched, Lina realises that she must sew Doris's mouth shut to quiet the spirits' voices and end the evil. She fights the evil spirits and manages to sew mouth shut but kills Doris in the process. Doris's ghost wakes up and she is happy to be reunited with Roger. Lina explains to Alice that she had to sew her mouth to stop the voices. The spirits then possess Lina and stab Alice with a knife, but the spirits eventually leave her body. Alice tells Lina that it was not her fault, she is to blame for getting the board. Alice sees the spirits of Roger and Doris happily together and then dies herself, leaving Lina devastated. Lina is later committed to a mental hospital for the suspected murder of her mother and sister. She tells her doctor that she knows she will never be alone again. As Lina is left alone in her room, she tears up the carpet and creates a makeshift Ouija board on the wooden floor with her blood. She summons the spirit of Doris, but unintentionally summons the spirit of Marcus. The now elderly Lina (Lin Shaye) is seen, 47 years later, still institutionalised, and is visited by someone claiming to be her niece, leading to the events of the original film. Also starring Halle Charlton as Ellie, Alexis G. Zall as Betty, Hush's Kate Siegel as Jenny Browning, and Forrest Gump's Sam Anderson as Mr. Browning. Reaser is reasonable as the fraudulent fortune-teller who finds something to fear, the two young actresses playing her daughters do well, and Thomas is memorable as the priest. It isn't the scariest film I've seen, there are only one or two jump scares, but it is eerie and creepy enough, and the story is reasonably interesting, it's certainly better than its predecessor, an alright supernatural horror. Worth watching!",Ouija - Origin of Evil
6,ma-cortes,"For the most part, this was a pretty decent entry with mystery , suspense and creepy events",6,23 August 2021,"Decent supernatural chiller about the mysterious Ouija ,it's called an Ouija Board, and it's been used for thousands for years to communicate with the souls of the after-world. It is set in 1967 Los Angeles, a widowed mummy named Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) works out of her suburban home as a spiritual medium , accompanied by her two daughters (Annalise Basso, Lulu Wilson) but a new stunt to bolster their seance scam business by inviting an evil presence into their home, not realizing how dangerous it is . The family is still reeling over the recent death of Roger, Alice's husband and the childrens' father. They unwittingly summon an evil entity with plans of its own who makes the house part of its sinister game. The daughters plagued by nightmares, and begin confronting their most terrifying fears when they awaken the dark powers of an ancient spirit board . Along the way , School Principal Father Tom (Henry Thomas) attempts to solve the weird events and help them , but then things go wrong . When you talk to the other side, you never know who will be listening. No telling what you'll see. It was never just a game. Some call it a spirit board. It has existed for centuries. It is used to communicate with the other side. House always wins. The game just got bigger.This is a surprisingly competent horror movie, and it is certainly better than most other films of the same genre concerning the diabolic game , the mysterious Ouija . Enjoyable horror movie with thrills , chills and strange events , while the roles scream and panic her way through most of their scenes, . One of the film's strongest points is the fact that there's quite a lot of fun to be had with the supernatural aspects of the storyline. This starts off at the very beginning at a reunion occurs mysterious happenings , as the camera lurks suspensenful behind it's actors and beside them and above them and everywhere else. A straight-up horror movie, with its jump-scares and characters who can't see the obvious dangers that beset them . Although it packs some flaws , it still manages to be fairly entertaining. A fun, nostalgic 2000's Ouija classic , resulting to be a smashing good time. The plot is predictable and there are no big twists from what I have seen. Still the atmosphere is built up slowly and there are not many over the top scenes or special effects to distract from the plot . I am not so satisfied with the ending though. It seems too abrupt and was disappointing a little bit. The motion picture was well directed by Mike Flanagan . Mike frequent uses flashbacks to characters' traumatic events, usually involving the supernaturally-assisted death of at least one parent . Terror expert Flanagan turned to the horror genre for the first time with ""Oculus"", an applauded short film that is just the beginning of an ambitious horror anthology, which eventually became the inspiration for his 2013 feature film of the same name. In 2010, after raising funds on Kickstarter, he wrote and directed the applauded indie horror film ""Absentia,"" which he credits with establishing his career. ""Absentia,"" shot for 70k in Flanagan's apartment, led to ""Oculus"" (2014) and ""Before I Wake"" (2015). Flanagan's critically acclaimed ""Hush"" (2016) was released exclusively on Netflix, which led to the online streaming service producing Flanagan's adaptation of Stephen King's ""Gerald's Game"" (2017). Ouija : Origin of evil rating : 6/10 . Overall just decent supernatural effort.This one belongs to ¨Ouija¨ sub-genre , other films in similar style are the following ones : ¨Ouija House¨ (2018) with Mischa Barton , Tara Reid , Dee Wallace , Chris Mulkey. ¨Ouija 3: The Charlie Charlie Challenge¨ 2016 with Amanda Knapi , Vineyard , Tom Zembrod , Todd Jenkins . ¨Ouija 2014¨ with Olivia Cooke , Ana Coto , Bianca Santos , Douglas Smith , ¨Witchboard¨ 1986 with Todd Allen, Tawny Kitaen , Stephen Nichols , Kathleen Wilhoite.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
7,paul_haakonsen,Someone actually is there...,6,8 November 2016,"Having sat through a heap of somewhat questionable Ouija movies before, it was with some reluctance that I sat down to watch ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"". But hey, it is a horror movie after all, and that alone is actually enough to peak my interest.I will say that ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" turned out to be much better than I had anticipated or hoped for. And that is thanks to director Mike Flanagan who managed to set up a great atmosphere and skillfully execute turning points and spooks throughout the course of the movie.The storyline was good, albeit somewhat simplistic as horror movies often tend to be. So don't expect that the movie will challenge you intellectually. But don't get me wrong, it is still a very enjoyable movie. And while the movie was not overly predictable, it just really wasn't a front-runner for the horror genre, and it didn't really bring anything new and innovating to the genre.It is the cast and their performance that really also need to be complimented for their work in ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"", especially Elizabeth Reaser whom was so well-cast for her role in this movie, and she really carried the movie quite nicely.There was a good amount of pseudo-creepy moments throughout the movie, but not really any moments where you are spooked out of your seat. And that was a shame, because I was expecting (and thus missing) those moments.It is important for a horror movie to have good and believable special effects, and ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" has that. I enjoyed the way that we were kept in the dark about the spirits and what they looked like. But when they were revealed I sort of had a mixed feeling. Sure they were nicely made, but they just weren't all that scary to me.""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" is definitely a movie that you should take the time to sit down and watch, especially if you have seen the other ""Ouija"" movies in their many shapes and presentations.This is an entertaining movie in all honesty. Although it lacks some good old fashioned scares, it is still fun to watch and might actually still turn out to be creepy to some viewers.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
8,michaelRokeefe,Scary way to make ends meet!,8,20 May 2017,"A young Los Angeles widow struggles to make ends meet and uses her two daughters in a scam seance business. New customers are attracted when a Ouija board is added to the ""act"". The youngest daughter Doris (Lulu Wilson) is intrigued and drawn to the board believing she is in contact with the spirit of her dead father. A malevolent entity is in deed summoned; all hell can only break loose.Several real good jump scares with building suspense and a simmering sense of doom. Character development is better than a lot of horror flicks and some good acting with Miss Wilson leading the way. Kudos to director Mike Flanagan. Some chilling atmospheric music too.Also in the cast: Elizabeth Reaser, Annalise Basso, Parker Mack, Halle Charlton, Doug Jones and Henry Thomas.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
9,hitchcockthelegend,Wheeeeeja!,6,19 September 2017,"A sequel that's a prequel that's actually better than what preceded it! Ouija: Origin of Evil is an above average chiller that's a fine scary ride for those not expecting boundary pushing.Standard rules apply here, widowed mum and two daughters who dabble in the con of seance profiteering get more than they bargained for when they introduce a Ouija board to proceedings.Director Mike Flanagan knows how to construct a good honest scare piece (see Oculus and Hush), and so it proves here. The atmosphere is constantly set at impending dread, the tension slow built until pic goes into overdrive. Unfortunately so many horror films of the decade are reliant on the demon formula to fill out their respective tales, so much so it has become jaded and utterly unsurprising.This hurts this picture and it runs away with itself, rendering the big final quarter - complete with emotional baggage - as something of a let down; though the final shot has goosebump value for sure. Hadrcore horror buffs will find irritants and emptiness, but for those who dip in and out of the genre should find a quick chill to fill a fright gap. 6/10",Ouija - Origin of Evil
10,LeonLouisRicci,A Winner Across the Board...Scary and Fun Low-Budget Craftsmanship,8,2 March 2017,"Well Acted and Scary too, with a Dash of Retro-Fun. With Patience and Attention to Detail, Director/Writer/Editor Mike Flanagan continues to Hone His Horror Movies and seems to be a Caring Creator of this Low-Budget Genre.It's Clear that the Money Spent was Allocated where it was Needed and Unlike the Majority of Horror Movies it Feels Less Like Product and more Like a Production with Everyone in on the same Vibe.While the Movie Contains a Few Tropes, ""Wide-Open-Mouths"", and a few ""Obligatory Jump Scares"", it is the Pacing, Editing, and Retro-Presentation that makes this one Different among the Same.Creepy, Suspenseful, and with Characters that are Fleshed Out to make Your Flesh Crawl and You may find Yourself actually Caring about what Happens to this Family of a Widow and Two Daughters Living Alone (or are they?) in 1967.Note...This is a Prequel to an inferior Film, Ouija (2014), made by a different Team of Creators, that was a flop with Fans and Critics.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
11,Calicodreamin,"Great cast, lacking emotions",6,11 October 2019,"The casting for this movie is rather well done, the characters vibe and the acting is good. Though overall the movie isn't very scary and kind of bland. Most of the action comes at the very end, and it's a little too late. I have a few problems with the questionable decisions in this movie... who would let there kid play with a Quija board? Why is the mom so obtuse? And why does everyone generally have an almost careless attitude about the whole thing?

12,oscaralbert,Following in the footsteps of SPOTLIGHT . . .,6,24 October 2016,". . . OUIJA: ORIGINS OF EVIL makes a fairly direct case that the Roman Cult has given rise to much if not most of the Evil in this World. Quantum Physics and String Theory inform us that Humans can make things Real by simply imagining them. If you build your Dream Castles for Demons, They Will Come. (Have you ever noticed that there are no flicks about Methodists, Mennonites, Lutherans, or Presbyterians who have the sudden need--or urge--for an Exorcist?) Though OUIJA 2 is set in 1967, mom Alice Zander is suspicious enough of the Roman Cult leaders that she's spent her life around that she shows up for her dinner date with Father Tom virtually topless, in a desperate attempt to keep his demonic libido away from her two young daughters. Yet torsos are stabbed, bones are cracked, lips are sewn, young folks hung, and minds broken despite Alice's precautions. When OUIJA ends, Alice doesn't live here any more.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
13,neil-476,"Give your ghosts a brush, they can clean your cobwebs while they're up there!",7,21 May 2018,"It is 1967. Recently widowed Alice runs a spiritualist scam business with the aid of daughters Doris, 9, and Lina, mid-teens. Buying a Ouija board to bring in as a prop for the scam/business may not have been the most sensible move, however, as it appears to exert a malign influence on Doris.This film struck me as efficient. It does exactly what you want a horror film to do: it sets out its stall, it builds nicely, it feeds you some scares, and it delivers a climax which is exciting and adequately horrifying and then, as expected, finishes of with a chilling little postscript. It does this with a good sense of period design, with excellent performances (particularly from the two girls who play Doris and Lina) and with a feeling of genuine commitment from performers and crew. At no point does it scare you out of your pants without giving you fair warning that a scary bit is on the way. I might have wished for some plotlines to have finished differently, but I can't complain at them. I can complain at the mystery thingies, however, which were never explained in any way whatsoever - what they were, what they wanted, what they were doing, and I can also complain at how the deceased father was given a role which ultimately didn't really go anywhere.I was interested to note that whereas Japanese ghost children are black and white, wet,, have wide starting eyes, and creak like doors with rusty hinges, American possessed children have white eyes, open their mouths very wide, and scrabble along walls and ceilings. I find it helps to know the nationalities of haunted children.And so that's what happened to Elliott from E.T.!

14,morrison-dylan-fan,Oculas Ouija.,10,1 November 2016,"Left completely speechless by his film Hush,I looked for interviews with auteur co-writer/(along with Jeff Howard) editor/director Mike Flanagan,and I was caught off-guard by the news that Flanagan had taken on the ""Ouija"" franchise.Limited in my knowledge to the first Ouija flick being the terrible reviews it got (and that cute Olivia Cooke starred) I took a look at the page of Flanagan's sequel,and I was surprised to find it getting all the praise that the first Ouija missed.Finding Flanagan's Oculas and Hush to be nail-biting chillers,I went to see the Ouija box get opened on the big screen.The plot-LA 60'sSince the death of her husband Roger, Alice Zander has made money by holding fake séances which are performed with the help of her daughters Paulina ""Lina"" and Doris. Introduced to a new game at a party,Lina advises her mum to buy a ""Ouija"" board,which they can incorporate into their act. Buying the game,Alice starts figuring out how to manipulate it,during which,Alice unknowingly gets in contact with a real spirit called Marcus. Receiving a notice of foreclosure,Alice starts stressing over how to raise enough cash,as Doris gets her hands on the board. Finding bundles of cash buried in a wall,Doris says that Roger told her where the cash was hidden. Believing Doris can talk to Roger,Alice gives her control of the board,as Marcus starts to play his own game.View on the film:Working on a bigger board than he has had before thanks to Universal's backing, director Mike Flanagan & cinematographer Michael Fimognari avoid needless excess,to instead expand on the themes which they had started in Oculas (the mirror of which gets a cameo!) Swaying long hair in tracking shots which cut a foreboding mist, Flanagan and Fimognari play the game with ultra-stylised whip- pans round the Zander house,that are sharply balanced by Flanagan jumping from out of frame shocks,with creepy,lingering shots showering the closed-off Zander's house (a major theme in Flanagan's work) with burning anxiety.Opening with the 60's Universal logo, Flanagan cuts as many links to the first Ouija as possible by replacing the slick modern Horror look for the grain of the 60's,basking the Zander's in rich ruby reds,and a depth of field gliding in the family gatherings,with Flanagan keeping a casual edge to the added specs of dirt and dust,which give the title a gritty shine.Following the sound that was given to the silent world of Hush, Flanagan bends chirpy 60's Pop songs into sly warnings,as the sweet singing voices break into the howls of restless spirits. Retaining an expert precision for turning the sound down and allowing silence to be heard, Flanagan masterfully brings the great score from The Newton Brothers (who also did Hush/Oculas) in with nails of brittle floorboards and lightly stamped steps bringing the spirits to life.Keeping the most loose links to the first Ouija as possible (good move!) the screenplay by Flanagan and Howard build on the parental loss of Oculas and the memories of the first big novel in Hush with haunted memories of the past closing the gate to the Zander house,due to none of them being willing to question the thing which appears to be healing the wounds of their past. Turning the game with a fantastic twist which gives a new,very clever side to the ""voices"" of the spirits,the writers stamp the nerve- shredding chills with a gripping family drama which feeds into the horrors they game with.Joined by a terrific Kate Siegel (aka:Mrs Flanagan) as Jenny Browning, (related to Tod?) the beautiful Elizabeth Reaser gives an exquisite performance as Alice,thanks to Reaser making each scream Alice gives to the spirits be ones that are rooted from the memory of her late husband. Reuniting with Siegel after Oculas, Annalise Basso gives an impressive performance as Lina which peels away Lina's brat teenager image by Basso attacking Lina with real guts which show themselves in the final game. Looking absolutely horrifying when expressing the ""views"" of the Ouija board, young Lulu Wilson gives an incredible performance as Doris,whose angelic smile Wilson keeps painted just long enough to hint at the horrors behind the innocent eyes,as Doris discovers the origins of Ouija.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
15,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Highly enjoyable and engaging sequel,9,7 October 2017,"Trying to operate their illegal scam service, a widow and her teenage daughters running fake seances for rich clients find themselves in real trouble when an innocent game with an ouija board turns into a nightmare when they unleash a terrible evil and must stop it before it takes her over.This was quite a fun and thrilling supernatural effort. What really gives this one a lot to like is the rather strong and striking action played out throughout the film. The opening seance scene where the off-screen noises and shadows around the room lead to a belief in the supernatural that eventually turns out to be a part of their scam service gives this a strong start, while there's more to like about the way this one targets the daughters as the haunting scenes grow far more dangerous throughout the film. Many of these occur through the seance scenes that are placed in here, which allows this to take full advantage of its premise with the kids playing with the board on several occasions in brief, rather fun spurts to help sell their supernatural plight. Adding to the scares is the rather heartwarming factor brought into play when they realize the true nature of their ghostly visitors coming along to help them as the scene where they all see the game-play by itself and see what's been going on the entire time. By the time it changes into the more deadly and dangerous setups later on, they generate more of an impression as the frantic scenes of her getting manipulated by the ghosts in her room, the disfigurement dream she has with her sister and the series of behavioral outbursts that slowly seem to suggest something is happening to them. Once it really throws the idea of the possession into full-force, this becomes much more fun with the events inside the basement at the end which are a lot of fun and manage to really work out some fun ideas, from the revelation of the house's history and how the daughter connects to it all to the chilling supernatural action that occurs in the basement which gives this a really frantic finale. While these here work nicely for the film, it does have a few rather prominent flaws. The main issue here is the fact that there's just not a whole lot of interest in what happens in the first half. The fact that this one goes through the idea of their scam business and then moves on to their other plight really doesn't leave this one with a whole lot of interest as it simply drags on far longer than it really should. Some of the problems are based on the fact that very little of what happens here is really all that scary, as this is content to have her worry about her imaginary friends and play with the board which doesn't generate any kind of real thrills. This does lead to a longer start-up that expected and gives this a longer running time than what should really be required here. As well, the film's rating doesn't really let it go the type of extremes this could've generated as many of the scenes are the typical type found here and don't really generate much else here beyond these jump- scare setups. Beyond these issues, it doesn't have a lot else wrong.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

Never wanted to see this one due the 2014 version I noticed the reviews were better so I did go watch it afterwards.And it's a hell better then the 2014 version. The way it was shot and the slow movement of the flick did add towards the creepy atmosphere. The ticking of the clock throughout the whole picture also add the creeps.It all starts with an Ouija fraud and of course slowly it turns into a possession.

17,deloudelouvain,Better then the first one,7,10 February 2017,Not often a sequel is better than the first movie but this one actually is better. The first one was okay to watch once but Ouija: Origine Of Evil is just creepier. Good acting from that kid Doris by Lulu Wilson. There were some good scary moments that are necessary in a story like this one. I'm not going to debate about my personal experience with a Ouija board because it doesn't matter to the story. The only thing I have to say about that is that I'ma devoted atheist but that I will never ever play with a Ouija board again. But with that experience in mind you watch a movie like this one with other eyes then you would watch another horror movie. The horror in Ouija/ Origine Of Evil isn't really gory or bloody but it got my wife pretty scared a couple of times. And that's always nice to see. It was better than I expected.,Ouija - Origin of Evil
18,Rainey-Dawn,Just Watch The Exorcist (1973),3,15 October 2017,"The opening was fantastic! The old Universal (from the 60s), the overall look of the film looked as if was from the 1960s, the opening scene built up great suspense and then a huge let down. As soon as the people left the seer and the girls popped out to show us ""this really is a scam"" I was put off. Sure the scamming family started messing with a Ouija/Witch Board then things started happening but some of the major things that happened was similar to The Exorcist. The Ouija, then the demonic possession then here comes the priest that the demon takes over... yea just watch The Exorcist (1973) for a much better movie.I became quickly aggravated with this movie after the great opening scene.

19,KineticSeoul,It's actually very very rare when a horror sequel is actually better but...,6,28 November 2016,"I don't see why this film got the recognition that it got. Maybe it's because a horror movie sequel that is better is actually very very rare. Sure, this is better than the first one. And I thought it's focus on trying to bring back the late 1960's vibe when it comes to the cinematography was a nice touch. But when it comes the flow of this film at it's core, it just feels like another generic horror movie. I liked how it didn't focus too much on jump scares and didn't try to put in needless blood and gore. Maybe I am getting numb since I have seen way too many horror movies. But I just can't see what makes this movie stand out from other horror movies out there. A family gets haunted and they try to figure out the origin of that evil.

This chapter tells the story of a widowed mother, and her two daughters, who scam people out of money by running a fake seance business (in 1967 Los Angeles). When the trio begins involving a Quija board in their 'show', one of the daughters becomes possessed and things begin to go horribly wrong. The movie was directed by Mike Flanagan, and it was written by Flanagan and Jeff Howard; the duo also performed the same duties on 2013's 'OCULUS' (another supernatural horror flick). The film stars Annalise Basso (who also costarred in 'OCULUS'), Elizabeth Reaser (of 'TWILIGHT' fame), Lulu Wilson and Henry Thomas (of 'E.T.' fame). It's received surprisingly positive reviews from critics, and fans alike (mostly), and it's also performed decently at the Box Office. While it is a better reviewed movie, than the original, it hasn't done nearly as well financially speaking. It is a much better film though.The story is set in a 1967 suburban home, in Los Angeles; where a widow, Alice Zander (Reaser), cons grieving customers out of their money, by running a staged seance. She has help from her two daughters; Paulina (Basso), a teenager, and Doris (Wilson), who's 9- years-old. At a party with her friends, Paulina uses a Ouija board for the first time. She then convinces her mother to begin using it in their act. Real supernatural forces then begin haunting the house, and their 'show' becomes more than just a trick.The film is definitely a lot better than the original movie, if I remember correctly (but I don't remember that film that well, other than I didn't like it). It's also a lot better than 'OCULUS'; I do remember that flick, and I wasn't too impressed by it. This film is creepy, well acted and somewhat nostalgic; it's very reminiscent of other horror films from decades ago. It's definitely a lot better than I expected it to be.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/AZDkLpTvRzc",Ouija - Origin of Evil
21,thesar-2,An American Horror Story Under Two Hours,3,13 November 2016,"Yeah, it's kinda like that series. Well, except the exceptional writing, great acting, ingenious subplots and intrigue. But, hey. You get it all under two hours verses a full season.I was told Ouija: Origin of Evil is better than the original. I only bothered with this movie because of that recommendation and the fact I was the told the same thing about the other Ghost Story Part 2 in 2016: The Conjuring Part 2. While I agree with The Conjuring Part 2 being tremendously better than its original, I graciously disagree here.While the first third isn't that bad, as the movie progresses, it gets incredibly sillier to the point I was literally laughing out loud at some of the ""scary"" scenes. Mainly including the younger daughter's I Am Legend's bad special mouth effects. Seriously, I was completely cracking up where the director probably wasn't expecting (or desiring) that reaction.The movie is ""supposed"" to be a prequel to the 2014 undeserved smash- hit, Ouija, but I found no connection outside the game of the witchboard. It's set in the 60s where a scam-artist family falls prey to the board. While I appreciate the filmmakers going in a different direction than the failed original, it's just turned hokey towards the mid-to-final acts that takes you completely out of the picture and absolutely makes you yawn. Skip this mess.***Final thoughts: While also not perfect, this makes me wanna rewatch 1986's Witchboard for the x'th time. That campy, mid-80s flicksooo enjoyable. Thisnot so much.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

Never. (even if it's strictly for laughs)Yes. ""Ouija"" did have some good production values. And, yes, there were some fairly eerie moments, throughout.But, overall - Ouija's suspense-factor was sustained for far too long which reduced its story to a purely predictable level that (ho-hum!) ended on one of the most cliched notes imaginable.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

Still, this is a visually interesting and character-driven horror feature that is well-directed and doesn't rely on jump-scares to entertain its audience. It is styled to look like a film from the 1960s, complete with the old universal logo and intermittent cue marks, so it stands out from the crowd with a colourful texture not often seen in today's colour-corrected world, though some of the visual effects end up looking a little bit ropy at times perhaps more so because they stand out from the otherwise analogue aesthetic. There's still the niggling sense that the concept isn't entirely sound, though, considering it is based upon a Hasbro-owned board-game that shows up and somehow coincidentally causes the spirits, which have supposedly been in the house for a long time before the board, to start to show themselves. 6/10",Ouija - Origin of Evil

Meanwhile, the eldest (Annalise Basso) seeks help from a priest (Henry Thomas). Despite being a sequel, this frightful follow-up surpasses the forgettable original in all aspects. Filling in the blanks from the first, Origin of Evil also explores some interesting new themes concerning the afterlife while maintaining ample scares.

27,851222,Two Thumbs Up,9,12 January 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" (2016) may not be the best horror film from 2016, but its closed, really close. This second movie in a franchise (hopefully) surprises the original (which i liked overall, but not as much as this one by far) in every possible way. This is a first rate horror movie. I loved the ""70's style horror movie flick"" written all over this movie - this is clearly visible not only from the sets and the time in which action takes place, but also the movie making itself. Acting was good, especially by the two young leads. Writing was solid, directing was first rate. Overall, the first hour of ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" was pure 10/10 - it worked perfectly as a horror movie type drama, where all the chills aren't rushed and the movie was carefully constructed. Maybe the second half of this movie when the things that ""can't be explained"" a bit rashly started to be explained by the script and it lost a bit of that tension and terror of unknown. Nevertheless, this is a superb horror movie that first of all builds the story (and does not rush by doing it), introduces the characters that we start to care about (two young ladies of course) and goes for a wild climax which is good, but not as great as the first part of the movie. Two Thumbs Up for ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" nevertheless.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
28,Reno-Rangan,So this is where it all began!,6,24 July 2017,"It is a decent horror film, but surely better than the first. The previous part was an usual teen themed horror where everything started as a playful. But this one was a prequel and it focused on the origins. A single mother with two daughters is making money helping the people who want to contact their beloved dead ones. The things changes when her little daughter started to communicate the spirits of her own. The chaos unleashes, the house becomes haunted and the family begins to fall apart.Keeping it simple is what worked out well for the film, despite thematically borrowed from others, scenes were kind of familiar and characters intentionally developed. Particularly the priest role was the most overused in any horror film. Followed by the twist. That turning point was good, but not a new. Nice performances and well shot film. Ouija is a fine concept for a horror theme and with this film's somewhat success, I hope the next one would only get better. So it is worth a watch, if you're not anticipating a something special.6/10",Ouija - Origin of Evil
29,paulclaassen,Better than the original.,6,17 June 2018,"I actually thought this film was better than the original. Just as the first film, this one carries a lot of emotion and longing for a loved one. It is not melodramatic or overbearing, though, and is nicely intertwined with the horror elements. Suspense is always that much more enjoyable than gore in a horror film and this one has the scares and the suspense and it is rather disturbing as well, as the little girl gets more and more possessed. The effects are really great - quite stunning, actually.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
30,cruise01,Ouija being a huge improvement as a sequel but lacks scares.,8,14 February 2017,"Ouija: Origin of Evil being a better sequel surprisingly, even from the lowest standard that the predecessor set back in 2014. Yes, this sequel is way better, which the first movie followed with a non-existent story, terrible acting, and clichés with teens making stupid decisions. The sequel improves with about everything. All thanks to new writers and director in this film like Mike Flanagan. Who takes the story back in 1967, which does create a classic horror movie feel that has a look with tone that The Exorcist, and other classic horror movies had. From the film's editing look with color tone, cinematography, and so on. The plot follows a widow Alice (Elizabeth Reaser), who lost her husband in an accident. So raising her two daughters alone is hard enough, all while trying to pay for the mortgage. She makes money by scamming people to believing she is a psychic reader and can talk to the dead in the spiritual world. Her oldest daughter Paulina (Annalise Basso) and the youngest Doris (Lulu Wilson) are involved in it by rigging the dining room table to shake and lighting up the candles and cause a shadow effect through the curtains. Alice discovers an Ouija board game that they can use as a prop for their scamming business. Tempting to use the board to talk to her husband. With no response besides another spirit figure that decides to haunt the family in the house. The dark haunting figure possesses Doris as she mysteriously causes injuries to her bullies at school. And concerning her mother, she tries to get Father Tom (Henry Thomas) to help bring her daughter back. As they learn about the history of an old owner to the house that used his basement for a disturbing experiment. The pros about Ouija: Origins of Evil was the theme about a struggling family, dealing with a loss, and being non-believers to the spiritual world. Of course, that changes when they bring in the board game that releases a disturbed figure to possessing the youngest daughter. The plot worked with giving more leverage to actually caring for these characters unlike the first movie. Mike Flanagan's direction and script build this family dynamic as they experience this possession and are trying to save their youngest. Also, there are better performances with Elizabeth Reaser, Annalise Basso, Lulu Wilson, and Henry Thomas. The film does have some creepy factors, seeing a dark demonic figure at the end of the hallway, leaving you feeling a little on the edge. Or seeing a hanged body dangling on the ceiling with a possessed girl that can come out of anywhere. The sinister figure does have a backdrop of details that are quite disturbing, making it a scarier threat.The con about the film for being a supernatural horror movie was the lack of scares. It had a creepy eerie direction that would have worked for the best if the movie were released decades ago. I did not find the film to be scary, which did not deliver jolts or jump scares. Maybe it's just myself not finding supernatural horror movies as scary anymore. Overall, Ouija: Origins of Evil is a better film than the last, and better than expected from how the trailer looked.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
31,TheMovieDiorama,"Miles better than its predecessor, but it's not the origin of evil.",6,21 October 2016,"The sequel and prequel to the critically panned Ouija, Ouija: Origin of Evil is about a family contacting the dead through the titular board game, only to have the youngest possessed by something demonic. Now the first film wasn't great, it was watchable but nothing memorable that probably didn't warrant a sequel...but yet here we are. Interestingly though the sequel is much better, it's just a shame it is still missing something. Firstly the acting was great, the youngest of the family was genuinely creepy, the older sister was a typical teenager but had some depth and the mother had an emotional past...this all sounds like a typical horror movie but the characters were handled with extra care. Thankfully the script was able to elevate the characters slightly, it was sharp and concise with some excellent dialogue between the family members. The direction was great with slowly panning camera angles, a few one take shots and also throwing in some quick cuts to create the creepy atmosphere. The runtime was adequate, at 99 minutes it was not too long and was not too short so the story was perfectly developed. So what was missing? The story itself had no substance and that means not being invested in the characters. It was all very predictable and tedious and the problem with being a prequel is that we know how the film ends. There was no room for twists in the plot, therefore remaining formulaic and unfortunately that means it is boring. A horror film is not a horror film without scares, so how scary is it you ask? It's hit and miss. Some of the scares are executed well and retain the tension however the majority of them are cheap jump scares. Just loud noises to scare the viewers and unfortunately this is becoming a common trait in most Hollywood horror movies. A lot of these jump scares are also predictable and just don't deliver the chills it needed to...didn't help I was in a cinema full of teenagers who had to laugh every time they got scared.

As its trying to emulate movies like Amityville Horror (old classic horror) it finds its place where the story works well for the era, compared to the first movie set in a more contemporary but cynical age.The cast also works much better in this film.A really good job to create something memorable coming from a fairly bland base.Well done :)",Ouija - Origin of Evil

34,jtindahouse,Infinitely superior to the original,8,3 January 2017,"I just went back and read my review for the original 'Ouija'. It was a fairly negative review overall and there was an interesting line in there about these movies being doomed before they even start making them because Ouija boards aren't scary. Step forward Mike Flanagan to prove me wrong. Flanagan is becoming a bit of a heavyweight in the horror industry with each of his films so far being very strong. Here, he does the near impossible and makes the a sequel (technically a prequel) infinitely stronger than the original was.There was a lot of great stuff here. Something I loved was that the jump scares were more about the imagery than just a loud noise. Typically these days jump scares take almost no skill at all to pull off because the damn noise that accompanies them is so loud that it wouldn't matter what happened on the screen. In 'Ouija: Origin of Evil' the scares are more about the brilliant visuals that are created throughout the film. They're the type that will stick with you afterwards and require a lot more skill to pull off.The writing is also a lot better this time around. The first one had some atrocious dialogue and incredibly stupid characters. This time there are genuinely fascinating plot points that give the film even more levels than just a horror film. The original also had an immensely weak opening scene. On this occasion the opening scene is one of the strongest in the whole film and even has its own mini-twist.The character of 'Doris' was the highlight of the whole experience. I was incredibly impressed with young Lulu Wilson's performance. Playing a regular character in a horror movie is easy, but playing a villainous character is not. She was brilliant and played a large part in making this film what it was. Altogether I really enjoyed 'Ouija: Origin of Evil'. In a world where good horror films are becoming rarer and rarer we have to stop and truly appreciate the great ones that do come along. This was certainly one of them. Keep churning out films please Mr Flanagan.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
35,Stevieboy666,Promising first half but then falls apart..,5,19 April 2019,"Prequel to the disappointing Ouija. Nicely set in 1967, so we are treated to cars and fashions from that period, which also means no 21st Century annoying brats! I thought the first half was slowly but surely building to something genuinely intriguing. But that sadly started to fall apart at the first sight of of a bad spirit that looked like an alien dressed in a gimp outfit! From then on it becomes ever increasingly silly, with big plot holes (the discovery of a secret laboratory in the basement, used after the end of WW2 by a former Nazi, which comes complete with still working electrical lights! Yeah, yeah, whatever). I disagree with some reviewers, the acting I felt was fine. The film does deliver a few good scares early on, trouble is they lose their power after a while. And that's the problem - the makers threw too much at the audience and I just became immune to it.
Better than the original, though that is not saying much. However, still only an average horror movie, and further proof that the name Blumhouse is not a guarantee for success.

It is actually a prequel, which takes place about 50 years earlier than the first movie, in 1965 Los Angeles, where Elizabeth, a widower with two young daughters, is working a seance scam. She uses her daughters-9 year old Lulu & 14 year old Annalise-in the business to help make customers believe they are talking to departed dead relatives. Elizabeth hears about a new board game-by Hasbro-that might add some spice to her con game, so she brings one home. That is when the fun begins. Real spirits are released by the game and want corporeal bodies and decide to start with little Lulu-Hey, I could be mistaken but wasn't that the name of an old cartoon character? Anyway, Henry, the resident priest, tries to help out with the situation but is severely under qualified. FYI: the Annalise character is the connecting character to the first movie. I don't know if you saw the first Ouija or not-it wasn't that good-but this one is definitely better. And, you do not have to have seen the first movie to enjoy this one. There is a scene after the end credits so make sure you stay for it-it has a character from the first movie in it.

That is no criticism - the acting here is fine, and it is always a relief to find that the child performers are not at all like the petulant brats often found in these types of film. Perhaps children were better behaved in the 1960s, when this is set. Lulu Wilson is particularly good in her role of young Doris, youngest of the Zander family, a role for which she has rightly received much praise.This is an entirely respectable production. There are a few creepy moments, but little that will thrill you beyond the few moments they are on screen. The period atmosphere is conveyed well, and although this leads directly into the following film, it is fairly enjoyable in its own right.As with any family-friendly horror - and there is nothing here to unreasonably shock the viewer - it doesn't go beyond superficial, which is fine. A couple of gory moments towards the end will make the younger viewers wince a little, but beyond that, it is undemanding stuff. My score is 6 out of 10.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

Still, it doesn't pay for the bills. Yet she doesn't seem to have problems paying the catholic school for the girls. This is in 1967.Ouija is released and the mom buys it to add it to the scam paraphernalia. The older daughter Lina has already played it with her friends among whom is a boy she likes. They ladies try it out, they want to talk to the husband/father who is dead. He does answer. The little girl, Doris starts playing it by herself and she makes contact with someone named Markus. She and Lina have nightmares/visions but Doris isn't troubled except for some neck-pain. One day she's told about some money in the basemen. And indeed she finds it. Now the mom can avoid foreclosure. Doris acts weird at school and draws the attention of the head priest who one day goes out to dinner with the mom, but they just toast to another life when something between them could happen.One day Lina sees Doris furiously writing. She takes the pages to the priest. It written in Polish. He knows a nun who can translate. With the translation he visits the mom to talk about what is going on with the girl. By then Doris has already dispatched Lina's love interest.Turns out that Markus who has sort of possessed Doris was a homeless guy who had emigrated from Poland where he was tortured by a Nazi nicknamed Dr. Death. In the US he ran into him again (what are the odds!) and was captured by him. In the Dr's lair--the mom's family house--Markus witnessed and experienced all the horrors again.And now the mom, Lina, and the priest find the lair in the basement, a bunch of skeletons with their mouths (?) sewn shut, something that has happened to the girls as well at some point and even to a doll. Now they have to fight these forces somehow.Ouija 2, is like most of these fashionable seance/possession horror movies. It's a sober, mature, slower horror movie that's not particularly scary nor thrilling. It has one good scare; the background of the ghosts is mildly interesting; the moment between the mom and the priest is touching. Other than that, it's the usual nearly all-girl movie dealing with a situation pretty much all by themselves. I guess this movie dared going beyond the Hollywood agenda by hiring a male to play the priest. I also liked that they went for classic horror with the creatures in the background, out of focus, it reminded me in that regard of the much better We Are Still Here. Most of the stuff we've seen before: white corneas, mouths growing shut, lit pupils, crawling along walls and the ceiling. Lulu (?) Wilson shines in the role of the creepy little girl.

41,aidanratesmovies,Surprisingly Good,9,24 November 2020,"Although there are certainly some unoriginal elements at play, Ouija: Origin of Evil is an endlessly charming, creepy, and deeply atmospheric take that is quite well written and even better directed. Coming from someone who is such an avid hater of the first Ouija film, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. Granted, some elements of this film seem a bit too familiar to go for what the film was trying for. Director Mike Flannigan does direct the film well, but even he can't help the fact that the script can be similar to that of The Conjuring film's as well as the Insidious franchise. However, he manages to keep his cool throughout this entertaining flick, and through the film's wonderful and talented cast on screen, and the endlessly chilling atmosphere Flannigan is known for. It isn't the scariest film of the year, but it certainly can be rather intense, and I enjoyed that the film was more than your typical horror movie jump scares, which I always appreciate a film for doing. It's cinematography is excellent, I enjoyed the 1960s setting, and they truly utilized ever but of that. Actresses Lulu Wilson, Annalise Bazzo, and Elizabeth Reaser are all great in their roles, as well as actor Henry Thomas, although Lulu Wilson certainly proves to be the film's standout. Parker Mack who plays the love interest for one of the characters feels a little wooden, and his character w bit bland, but luckily the film makes up for the fact as it goes on. I enjoyed the use of not just characterizing the characters in the film but also the objects surrounding it, and there is no doubt that the way Flannigan protests his horror, will certainly be seen as iconic in the future.
My Rating : 9.25/10",Ouija - Origin of Evil
42,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Prequel that Improves on the Original,7,5 April 2019,"This prequel to Ouija I was really interested in checking out due to it being written and directed by Mike Flanagan. I actually only checked out the original to ensure if there was any carry over, I would know it. To get into this, the synopsis is in 1967 Los Angeles, a widowed mother and her daughter add a new stunt to bolster their séance scam business by inviting an evil presence into their home, not realizing how dangerous it is.Something I can really say about this film is that it really authentic about when it was set. From how they dress, their speech and even how the Ouija boxes look. That is something I wanted to touch on and was really impressed by. It kicks off with Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) as she is having a séance with Mr. Browning (Sam Anderson) and his daughter Jenny (Kate Siegel). They ask questions to his passed away wife and are freaked out when a presence is there, behind a curtain. It ends up getting too intense and the two leave. Alice decides not to charge them from what happened.It turns out though that they are running a scam. The candles that blow out during are done by the youngest daughter, Doris (Lulu Wilson). The presence we saw was the other daughter Lina (Annalise Basso). We learn from some interesting scenes that the father has passed away. The family is trying to get on without him, but it is a struggle. Doris is carrying on like he is just not home while Lina is acting out. We see her sneak out that night to go to a party. It is here that we meet a boy who has a crush on her, Mikey (Parker Mack) and we get introduced to an Ouija board and the rules of them. The party is broken up and Alice has to pick her daughter up.Lina makes a comment about buying an Ouija board for their scam and Alice does that. She comes up with a way to make it move without using her hands. She actually also tries to play it, but can't get it to work. Doris tries later that night and thinks she is talking to her father.Doris slowly changes and her family realizes that she actually has contacted spirits. Alice decides to actually use this to help those that seek her out, but the problem is the spirits they are contacting might not be the ones they think. Doris has a dark entity that is latching on to her. They do seek the aid of the principal at the Catholic school the girls attend, Father Tom (Henry Thomas), to help save the daughter and the family.I've already touched on the realism of time period, as being good. The other thing that I really have to give to Flanagan was he incorporated things from the original as well. The original film I didn't find to be that good and had problems. When Doris first contacts the spirit, it spells 'Hi Friend'. This is a recurring motif in the other film. This is the only time that we see it, but I thought it got a bit repetitive in that film. The rule to not play alone is used again, but this one builds on the mythology of not playing in a graveyard, which I thought was a good touch.Going from there, being that this was a prequel you kind of know how things are going to happen. I have to admit though, despite that, this film has a much more interesting storyline. Any sequel or prequel really needs to take the good things from the previous film and to build more on the story. I actually think that this one does that. They also use looking through the planchette, you can see the entities. This gives the history of the entities, why they are there and what they are doing. I was concerned for a bit that it wasn't going to sync up, but I definitely like how it plays out. It actually even explains why the events in that film happen, which is a plus.With that, I'd say that the film's editing is good as well. The film has a normal runtime and it moves through at a good pace. I was never bored and it kept me engaged. I heard good things about this one, but the original had me slightly intrigued how it could play out. For this, I definitely wanted to know more as things were revealed, which it definitely did. It was well done.The acting of the film was something that was really good as well. I have noticed is that Flanagan likes to use the same actors for his films. Basso who was previously in Oculus is our main character. I thought she did a really good job in this and I was quite impressed. I do want to see her do more in the genre for sure. Reaser was good as the mother. She has an interesting position of needing money, but also needing to do what is right. I thought it gave the film an added dimension. Wilson intrigued me as she is a cute kid. Some of the lines she said made her quite creepy and the duality of her character was solid. Thomas was good as the priest. I like that he has enough doubt early on, but the more the evidence presents. Doug Jones makes an appearance in this film as a ghoul. I'm always a fan of his work whether he has lines or not, he can do a lot with just movements and physical acting. Also want to shout out the small appearance by Siegel as well. The rest of the cast round the film for what they needed.Effects for the film were something else that I thought were well done. This film doesn't really rely on jump-scares too much, which I'm glad they went away from. The look of Jones was pretty creepy. I thought the glowing eyes were a good touch. Something else that was good was the eyes of those that are possessed. Making them completely white I thought was a creepy effect. I do believe there was some CGI in this film, but it didn't bother me. The effects were pretty solid I would say.Now with that said, this film is the rare case where the prequel is much better than the original. I thought this one had just a much more interesting story, even though I know how it was going to end. It introduced us to more mythology while ensuring that everything lined up as it was supposed to. It was edited together in a way that kept things moving and made me interested in seeing what happened next. Coupling with that was good acting and effects. The soundtrack of the film really didn't stand out to me, but it also didn't hurt it. I definitely think this is an above average film and I'm still impressed by all of the films I've seen from Flanagan. I would recommend this one for sure if you like ghost, haunted house or possession films.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
43,robertemerald,"Great horror film, not quite as creepy as Ouija (2014)",8,8 January 2020,"I have the disadvantage here of having already seen Ouija (2014) first. Origin of Evil did not scare me as much as the original, partly because I knew what was coming, and partly because some of the scares were duplicated. Other than that this iteration takes much longer to actually become a thing of rising horror. Mind you, that build up is beautifully done. In the special features part of the dvd the filmmakers make clear they took the period aspect of the movie (the 1960s) very seriously, figuring, rightly, that doing so would allow the horror to develop more successfully and believably. In this they were successful. The actors went to their parts with a real commitment and it shows. The little girl is probably as profound a part as that played by the little girl in Poltergeist (1982), although in this the part is much more demanding. There are good special effects and a few stunts, done well and suitably spooky or shocking. Origin of Evil is a fantastic horror movie and a welcome addition to the original. If you haven't seen either then consider seeing this one first. There are significant differences which are important, allowing Origin of Evil to stand upon its own merits, which is why I'm happy to give this movie a high score.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

45,justin-fencsak,A movie that improves on the last Ouija movie...,6,22 July 2017,"More like a prequel than a sequel, Ouija Origin of Evil takes place in the late 1960s and tells the story of a family that is fascinated by the board game of the same name. The scare factor in this one is pure pg-13 horror and suspense from the Blumhouse factory, known for low budget hits like Get Out and others, and it works. This film was shot digitally yet they made it look like a 60s film with film grain and wide instead of flat cue marks every 20 minutes along with warped audio.

46,Matt_Layden,This prequel has no business being as good as it is.,7,3 January 2017,"This prequel has no business being as good as it is. The first Ouija film came out in 2014 and quickly faded away into obscurity. So imagine my surprise when they decide to make a 'prequel' of all things. I hunch is that The Conjuring films have been pretty successful and they are set in the 70's, when things were a little creepier, no cell phones and genuine scary aesthetic. Imagine my surprise again when up and coming horror filmmakers Mike Flanagan was the man behind the camera. The underrated mirror horror flick Oculus and deaf home invasion flick Hush were two of his recent outings. Things were looking not too bad for this flick and to top it off, it received some pretty decent reviews. Alice and her two daughters run a scam business in which they ""speak to the dead"". The mother justifies this business by telling her youngest daughter, Doris, that it helps people move on and get closure. When her eldest, Lina, plays the new Ouija boardgames at a friends house, she tells her mother to incorporate it into her act. She does and things take a sinister turn when they scam becomes reality. It's hard to make a game board scary. The first film tried, failed and this one tries and succeeds for the most part. Any non-horror fan might balk at the idea that this film is good, but I consider this movie to be one of the most underrated flicks of the year. Flanagan knows how to build solid tension and he doesn't rely on cheap scares or an obscene amount of gore. This film has none of that. Careful framework and lighting is all he needs to create an unsettling atmosphere. Whenever someone decides to look through the ouija glass piece, you feel yourself tense up expecting something to happen. Kids in horror films are the go to for anything scary. Most movies tend to cast children horribly and they end of ruining the film. Doris, played by Lulu Wilson delivers an innocent and somewhat chilling performance as the youngest daughter. Her goodbye message to a young boy about what it feels like to be strangled to death is an excellent scene to send chills down your spine. No scary images, sounds or blood needed. Just a child delivering one monologue about suffocating you. Obviously the film is far from perfect, but it doesn't cater to the happy ending crowd either. It takes some chances and for the most part, lands them. I was surprised by how much I liked this film, which may be why the rating is higher than what others would tend to give a film like this. Had the first film never existed, this would be a bigger hit.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
47,vengeance20,As great as the first Ouija!,9,21 October 2016,"Saw this just tonight & have to say it was great!Those who panned the first Ouija, would call this a so called improvement. I thought it was a great sequel/prequel. If not an equally great sequel/prequel to the original.The film is about a single mum & her daughters as scam artists for the paranormal seances who con people out there money, the mother comes across a Ouija board (Dun dun dun!!!) & she tries to use this as a hoax until the daughter (used a a gateway) starts to communicate with a war veteran who killed people by ripping their tongues out & silencing them via cutting their vocal cords, he was evil & his wrong doings where left in the grave yard in their house & they awaken a dormant spirit via this Ouija board. So that's the premise.The scares were good as always & the story, 1960's setting was great. It was a good film & trailer delivered greatly. The film was overall great & was equally as good as the first, the dark humour was great & the sinister setting was epic. The scene with the school boy getting sling shotted himself was epic & great with the dark twisted humour. The scene with the daughter & her sisters BF was great, talking about in detail, how & what it is like to be strangled to death, man that was sinister as f*#k!I overall found this to be a great sequel/prequel to the 2014 original which was epic as f*#k & as great as this film was! 9/10",Ouija - Origin of Evil

I found this one to be quite the creepy little horror flick, and it gets increasingly scary as it progresses.As I've often noted, I have to overlook some of the really dumb decisions made by characters in horror movies, and this one is no exception. Also, the plot elements here are similar to many I've seen in this genre. However, I felt it was quite well presented with good acting from all the cast, well directed by Mike Flanagan, and solidly written by Flanagan and Jeff Howard.Overall, this film rather creeped me out and I'm still thinking about that scary ending.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
49,begob,Well shut my mouth,6,14 November 2016,"After the death of the father a family struggles to stay together by staging hoax medium sessions, but when an ouija board is introduced to the act they find themselves drawn to the other side ...Slightly better prequel to the original flat effort, this time produced by the team behind Oculus. The premise is coherent and the menace builds convincingly as a host of ghostly troubles is channelled through the youngest daughter. But about halfway through the dialogue begins to struggle, and I got the sense there was some rewriting on the hoof that led us to a third act where all conviction evaporated. Just as I was looking forward with dread, there was an unconvincing death scene with a sheet (same thing done much better in the first film), and things fell apart. It may be because the story jumped about in its emphasis on a main character, only making its choice at the very end. Maybe the family situation could have been drawn more interestingly if they were coping with a suicide of the father connected to the house.Performances were good. The little girl slightly overacted, but the big sister was impressive even if a little lost in poor dialogue toward the end. Frightwise, there was some interesting stuff going on in the background but nothing much removed from cliché, and mostly delivered by CGI.Music & photography nothing special, editing kept the pace even. Overall: Engaging, claustrophobic family drama that loses its bearings.And you have to wait for a very late end credit to catch an appearance by one of the biggest horror stars of the moment ...",Ouija - Origin of Evil

51,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Ouija: Origin of Evil""- Everything the lame-brained and poorly made original was not. Atmospheric, well-paced and lovingly crafted with taste and thoughtfulness.",8,3 November 2016,"Perhaps the most shocking and surprising treat of the 2016 Halloween season is director Mike Flanagan's prequel tale ""Ouija: Origin of Evil""- a skillfully crafted, tasteful and highly atmospheric follow- up to the disastrously bad 2014 thriller ""Ouija."" It's frankly stunning just how good a film Flanagan was able to build from such a poor foundation, weaving a tale that honestly not only runs laps around it's far inferior predecessor... but honestly made me completely forget about what came before. In my mind, ""Ouija"" will be a forgotten victim of studio greed, while this prequel will stand tall as the ""true"" film based on the iconic and controversial board-game of terror.In the 1960's, widow Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) works as a fortune teller out of her home, staging false séances with the help of her teenage daughter Paulina (Annalise Basso) and younger child Doris. (Lulu Wilson) After purchasing a Ouija board as a new gimmick for her work, Alice does not notice that Doris has become overtaken by a deranged and mysterious force associated with the board, instead believing that her young daughter's newfound abilities and knowledge of things she could not possibly know are signs that unlike her, Doris is a real medium. However, as Doris' abilities become gradually all the more powerful and sinister, Alice and Paulina must band together to try and break her free from the devious spirits of the past that have taken ahold of her physical form...Flanagan directs from a script co-written by Jeff Howard, and much like his wonderful previous efforts ""Oculus"" and ""Hush"", here he continues to shine as one of the finest new voices in horror. There's a certain sense of taste and thoughtfulness he injects into his work, as he takes his time to try and establish strong character and interpersonal relationships, in addition to identifiable human drama which helps to accentuate the fear that builds. He also just knows how to deliver a darned good scare- a skill he uses expertly throughout the entire runtime here to build a great sense of foreboding dread.The performances are all stellar as well, helping to add to the film's high quality and impact. Elizabeth Reaser is fantastic as the mother Alice, and you really get a feel for a person lost after the death of their beloved spouse who is trying to hold it together for the sake of her children. Wilson is a great new Doris and does remarkably well for an actress of such a young age. Supporting roles by the likes of Henry Thomas are all uniformly strong and help to round out the cast in likable performances. And Annalise Basso steals the show as Paulina (also known as ""Lina""), who becomes our main focus and is a strong presence on-screen. At only 17 years old, Basso is definitely one to keep an eye on in the future. She possesses talent far beyond her years, and is the beating heart of the film as a sister and daughter struggling to help her sibling and mother from the forces at play- both supernatural and emotional.The film does falter at times a bit, which is where it loses points. Despite the first film being decidedly very poor by comparison, this film does a bit of distracting ret-con work that may bother those who are familiar with the original. Some major details of the backstory and rules are changed, which made it feel a bit inorganic as a continuation. It's also a bit too heavy on the scares up- front, which lessened their impact. I would have preferred more slow a buildup. And it does lack some drama since this is a prequel and you'll be able to guess some of what happens based on this fact.Still, that cannot stop this from being a darned good and very well- assembled supernatural horror. It's not one of the best horror films ever made by any means, but it's a solid and highly entertaining thriller boasting some heart, some good scares and a great cast. This is the movie you've been waiting for if you've wanted to see a movie based around the idea of the dreaded Ouija board. My advice? Skip out on the first film and just watch this as a stand-alone. It's far more rewarding an experience than the awful original could ever hope to be.I give ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" a strong 8 out of 10. If you're open minded, be sure to give it a shot, especially if the last one let you down. Take it from me... this is a very pleasant surprise.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

54,gedikreverdi,A very good prequel to a very under appreciated film,7,24 September 2021,"I always thought the Ouija is very underappreciated and that Mike Flanagan decided to make a prequel for it says it all. He wouldn't make this film if he didn't see the potential that the first film has. Anyhow I'm glad this one turned out to be really good with better directing and cinematography but it only used what we had already knew from the previous film except for the Nazi Germany backstory. There was no surprises but I'm not complaining because the main story is already good.The young actors who plays Doris was really good and I really like the other actors too. The catholic school, the father, the fortune teller mother who's scamming people and the basement and the hidden room, everything was very charming and spooky and I don't know why but the fact that it was set in the '60s made it even spookier for me.Doris hanged the boyfriend just like the suicide in the first film. She found the money in the walls of the basement so her mother believed in her right from the beginning. She channeled the evil Nazi doctor who kept torturing people in his basement. She was the vessel and the the way how she looked during her possession and all were really creepy.Her sister who was committed to a mental hospital had to stitch her mouth shut. It was her late father who gave the clue by stitching the doll's lips. Her sister was still visiting her at the institution.I really enjoyed the vibes of the '60s and I'd like to see more modern horror films set in the same era.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

Instead they are just like that so spontaneous, sudden, appearing without a reason at all. And typicallity of all of it makes it look unreal.

57,rockman182,Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016),7,5 January 2017,"When I first heard about this sequel/prequel my initial thoughts were: ""Who the hell asked for this?"" The first Ouija was cookie cutter horror film. It use the device of a ouija board (and the mystique and eeriness of it) as a crutch for the thin, awfully written that followed. It was a completely forgettable experience, so one would wonder why the film series was brought up again. Its a good thing that first impressions are just what they are because this prequel is not bad at all.The film was in better hands when it was announced that Mike Flanagan would be directing but I was still mixed. Oculus was actually pretty great. A creative idea that was actually pretty emotional and investing. Flanagan's followup was the Netflix film Hush. I know a lot of people loved Hush but maybe these people don't watch movies often or are lenient to what they see on Netflix. Hush was terrible. I don't want to go into it here but maybe some other time I can explain how improbably dumb it really is. Anyways, this film is a prequel of sorts to the first and is based on a family who help people move on from their passed loved ones by staging seances. A ouija board causes dark spirits in the house to possess a young girl leading to trouble and at times, some wicked fun.The film is set in the 60s and you can immediately tell by the film style. The style is of a film you'd see from that era; they even used the old Universal Pictures logo at the start of the film. Its not just the post production editing of the film but the costume, music, and just all around aura is done very well. No one knows her well yet but Lulu Wilson made this film. She does a great job and there are a few moments (where the script was fantastic) and she was able to come off as unsettling, just from saying her lines. She is without a doubt the strongest point of the film.The film isn't without flaws. The third act isn't exactly fantastic as some questionable things happen and you scratch your head wondering if there could have been a better resolution. There definitely could have been. Also, the CG does look ropy at times but I think that can be forgettable as the film offers decent entertainment value. Here's a film that sacrifices scares for build up, good performances, and focus on the story of why spirits have possessed Doris and the circumstances surrounding whats going on. I can respect that.I'm usually extremely critical of horror films because these days so many films go for jump scares and have no substance. There are exceptions that are becoming smart, nostalgic, or reinventing the horror genre. I don't think there is anything innovative about Ouija: Origin of Evil but its a massive improvement over its predecessor and is a film has a good amount going for it to make for a good time.7/10",Ouija - Origin of Evil
58,RforFilm,"Looks like the fortunes for Ouija: Origin of Evil point to ""Yes""",8,27 October 2016,"Looks like were playing some board games again! Kind of like movies based on video games, board game movies are a tough call as there not that many of them, and yet so many of the are bad. We have Clue, which I still find a very funny ""whodunit in a house"" story, but we also have the strange mess Battleship was, and then we have Ouija. Rather then asking where did the original go wrong, it's better to ask what it got right. I guess you can't blame them for task of adapting a prop for slumber parties into a driven story.When it was announced that another Ouija movie was being produced, most people were angry that such a poor horror movie could warrant more of them. Just remember that as long as something makes a profit, that only tells the studios that people want more. In a surprise movie, the production company in charge, Blumhouse Productions, issued an apology for the original Ouija, promising that the new movie would be up to their standards. Though I wished we could have gotten this sooner, that shows a sign that they do value creativity over cash income, so it gave me more hope that Ouija: Origin of Evil could change my mind.In the late 1960s, fortuneteller Alice Zander (played by Elizabeth Reaser) makes her séances more legitimate by adding mechanisms that would allow lights to flicker, candles to be blown out at random, and for random figure to materialize. The use of smoke and mirrors tend to involve her daughters teenager Paulina (played by Annalise Basso) and nine year old Doris (played by Lulu Wilson). Though they seems to attract customers, their finances have been in trouble since the death of the family father. After seeing a copy of the newly released Ouija board game, Paulina convinces her mother to add one as a work tool. While playing with it, Doris unknowingly contacts a spirit who she says is her father trying to help the family. At first, Alice sees her daughters contact with ghosts as a delight to her fortunetelling sessions and seems to be actually helping people. The more that Alice stays in contact with the spirit, the more odd things start to happen. When her school principal Father Tom (played by Henry Thomas) begins to gather clues that Doris' spirit may be demonic, the ghosts are ready to stand with their possessed girl. Talk about a complete turnaround of a series. Ouija: Origin of Evil only adds to this years strong lineup of good horror movies (The Conjuring 2, Lights Out, Don't Breathe, The Shallows), with a possession story that may seem unoriginal, but throws plenty of curveballs with its premise. Unlike the original, this actually manages to make the board they're using frightening. Taking it out of the hands of dumb teens and into unexplained forces makes the situation more unpredictable. You hardly know what's going to set off the bad stuff.Also unlike the first Ouija, you actually care about these characters and want to see what the boards effects is going to have on this poor family. I'll be quick to note that rather then going for the endless supply of jump scares, this creates a spooky atmosphere that releases a bigger feeling of dread on the audience. This is how you scare people. I don't know what happened behind the scenes that made such a drastic chance from the original, but lets hope that the team behind Ouija: Origin of Evil can continue to produce more of the horror movies we should be getting.I'll give this eight original Ouija games out of ten. Now that we have this one, I'm not even sure if it makes sense for people to watch the original. Though this is a prequel, it's safer just to assume it's it own thing rather then an extension. Let's hope people are willing to give this a chance so that this story's fortunes are pointing to ""yes"".",Ouija - Origin of Evil
59,dave-mcclain,This movie does a better job of connecting its story to the previous film that it does of connecting events within its own story.,2,22 October 2016,"Ouija boards developed from practices that are nearly 1,000 years old and have been controversial almost from the very beginning. The modern version of the boards, which supposedly allow users to communicate with the spirits of the deceased, developed out of the centuries-old Chinese usage of an automatic writing method. The hole in the moveable planchette device was eventually widened and the writing implement was replaced by a small piece of glass through which users could see letters and words on a flat board, thus receiving messages from the spirit world. This ""Ouija board"" (the name probably coming from combining the French and German words for ""yes"") was patented in the U.S. in 1890. It has survived in the same basic form up to the present, but has been criticized - by scientists who claim that the users are the ones actually moving the planchette (whether deliberately or unconsciously) - and by Christian groups who believe that the boards could lead to demonic possession. This fear, coupled with the game's origins, became the force behind a dozen or so horror movies since the 1980s. 2016's ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" (PG-13, 1:39) is a prequel to the ""Ouija"" horror film released in 2014.This film portrays the origin story of the evil in that house featured in the first film, much as it was related in ""Ouija"". ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"", takes place in the mid-1960s and focuses on the three female characters at the center of the 2014 film's mythology. Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) is a widowed mother of a teenager named Paulina (Annalise Brasso), or Lina, as her family calls her, and a little girl named Doris (Lulu Wilson). Alice tries to support her small family by conducting séances for grieving people desperate to speak to their deceased loved ones. Alice has a few tricks up her sleeve to help her unsuspecting clients believe that the information she gives them is for real and that their dead relatives are really blowing out candles in response to specific questions. Alice's girls are in hiding, making the tricks work. Lina accepts that it's just a scam, but Doris doesn't really understand everything they're doing, so Alice explains that they're helping people by comforting them and giving them needed closure.After attending a party during which her friends played with a Ouija board, Lina convinces her mother to add one to the act. As Alice is working out how to manipulate the board's planchette for her ""readings"", she accidentally summons a spirit which begins possessing young Doris. As the spirit seems to come and go, Doris starts acting more and more strangely – doing her homework in ways that are beyond her capability, frighteningly dealing with a schoolyard bully, channeling voices, learning the hidden secrets of their old house and, just maybe, talking to the spirit of her dead dad. Of course, Alice is worried about her daughter, but comes to believe that Doris is a legitimate medium, like Alice's mother was – and Alice wants to talk to her deceased husband too. Unfortunately for everyone involved, this is a dangerous game that Alice is playing. Caught in the middle of all this is Lina's boyfriend, Mikey (Peter Mack), and the principal at Doris' Catholic School, Father Tom (Henry Thomas), who helps Alice figure out what's happening and why, what's real and what's not, and what to do about it, risking his own life to do so.""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" does a good job of connecting its story to the original movie but that's part of the problem. You won't necessarily be lost if you haven't seen 2014's ""Ouija"", but you won't fully appreciate what's going on either (especially in the very short post-credits scene, which you should just skip if you haven't seen the first film). Apart from the connections between the films, the connections between events in this film are not well established by Mike Flanagan's and Jeff Howard's script, and Howard's direction fails to build any real sense of dread – or much concern for the characters. Also not helping matters is the acting, which is pretty shaky, except for during the film's climax. Unfortunately, that resolution feels even more random and disjointed than the developments leading up to it. Many people seem to feel that this film is an improvement on the original, but that's not saying very much. Actually, knowing that these films are produced by Hasbro Studios, which is owned by Hasbro Inc., the company which currently produces the official Ouija boards, tells you all that you really need to know. If you have a Ouija board, ask it whether you should go to see this movie. If the planchette moves and hovers over the word ""NO"" well there might be something to those boards after all.

60,swilliky,Moderate horror fare,6,23 October 2016,"Ouija: Origin of Evil is a prequel to a spooky, yet lackluster original title Ouija that scared me but received abysmal reviews. I don't recall all of what happened in the original but I remembered some of the story and the twist in that one that leads to the story laid out in this movie. The setting is 1967 in the same house where murders would come back to haunt teenagers in the present day. During this time period a family that runs scams about contacting the dead lives there, a mother Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser), and her two daughters Lina (Annalise Basso) and Doris (Lulu Wilson).To spice up the act, Alice brings home a ouija board, Doris plays with it by herself and starts to communicate with an otherworldly being. The special effects are subtle and not too overused but as Doris becomes more possessed her eyes turn white and her mouth stretches overly large to create a disturbing visual. The movie establishes a decent emotional core as the three women mourn the loss of the father and husband. The need to reach out to the dead is understandable as they tread into dark magic.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Ouija - Origin of Evil
61,bryank-04844,This sequel strikes gold.,7,23 January 2017,"It's Halloween season and the big horror movie studio Blumhouse has released another film in their canon franchise with their famous business plan. That movie is 'Ouija: Origin of Evil', which is a prequel to 'Ouija' from 2014. I know. I get suspicious too when a studio wants to start telling prequel stories to the masses. Most of the time, they don't work, but Blumhouse and filmmaker Mike Flanagan (Oculus) really raised the bar with this prequel that is terrifying, fun, and connects the original film nicely, despite some silly problems here and there.Overall, the film works, has some great scares, some funny moments, and even has the characters doing and saying some smart things, which is usually not the case in these horror films. Needless to say, I kept the lights on at night after watching this prequel. Set almost fifty years prior to the events of 'Ouija', meaning this movie takes place in the heart of the 1960s with all of the excellent furniture, clothing, and hairdos – not to mention the great music. The Zander family is the main focus here with a young Doris Zander (Lulu Wilson) and teenage Paulina Zander (Annalise Basso) with their widowed mother Alice (Elizabeth Reaser), living in that beautiful home, reading people's palms and fortune telling. The family dynamic seems good and loving, despite the loss of their husband/father.A ouija board is purchased to help with the fortune telling business when all hell breaks loose. If you've seen the first film, you will know what is going to happen here, which the script and filmmaking perfectly captures all the horror you heard about in the first movie. If you haven't seen the original movie, then you're in for a thrill ride that will make the hairs stand on end throughout the film with all of its creepiness.Either way, I believe this horror film will do its job in scaring you, at least for a little while. There are some odds and ends that don't make sense here, and it seems like filmmaker Mike Flanagan wanted to incorporate 'The Exorcist' somehow in this film, because there are some shots and moments that were completely taken from 'The Exorcist', including the famous shot of the preacher (Henry Thomas, my man) walking up to the house and looking up upon it.The performances are decent and the scares are genuine. The time period really adds to the feel of the movie in a good way, in that it feels more organic, and there weren't any issues with social media or mobile phones. Even though there were some usual genre tropes used here, it all felt fresh for the most part and was quite enjoyable to watch. Doug Jones is billed in the film, and I'm sure you're able to pick out which character he plays, which as usual is excellent and scary-as-hell. For the Halloween season, this is the film to see.RECOMMENDED!",Ouija - Origin of Evil

64,mahmus,I must admit it. I am not a fan of MIke Flanagan.,5,20 March 2020,"I've always found Mike Flanagan's movies to be quite overrated, and this movie is for me the best example for why I think that.It's just a bland and unmemorable movie. Never really scary and only ocassionally creepy. It has some good ideas but is held back by having to expand on the lore of its awful predecessor. I like the look and the style of it, but I just wished it offered more than a well made but generic story.It starts strong but quickly descents into pure over the top horror loudness. It reminded me a lot of The Conjuring (another well-liked horror film that I'm not a big fan of for similar reasons).Most of Flanagan's movies I've seen are ok at best.
I just think his work is not for me.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
65,Andres-Camara,"Scary movie, really?",4,5 March 2017,"I was very interested in watching this movie. He had heard good reviews. It is true that it is better than before. But at no point do I feel that I'm seeing a good movie.Everything is Manichaean. I do not believe anything. I knew it starts with a theater and then it's for real. But is it really for real? All the actors are very bad makeup and hairstyles, it seems to be rather a comic movie. Although the girl is great, until the director decides to spoil it. What do I mean? I explain it in spoiler.At no time do I feel tension, there is no tension. There are not even scares. It takes something more than a bug to scare. Not that the end spoils the film, the movie does not say anything to me for a long time.The picture could be fine, indoors it's nice, but little else.The management is superficial. He does not know how to take the movie. It does not know how to create tension. He does not know how to draw plans.I like the genre of fear, but it is that this movie is not scary.Spoiler:The reflection of the film is the sequence of the girl telling the sister's friend about the hangman. The girl is great, the camera is kept in the girl, the girl attracts you, but the director or the editor arrives, I do not know what will have been and change the plane to the boy. He just finished with the tension. Already, even if you return to the girl, you are finished with everything. He does not go up any more. As you may not realize that.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

67,johannes2000-1,Absolutely great!,9,30 November 2020,"This movie is really awesome: it's extremely creepy, due to the great special effects and especially due to young Lulu Wilson who played the possessed daughter Doris to perfection, which is so amazing, her being just 11 years old at the time! Annalise Basso as the older daughter and Elizabeth Reaser as the mother by the way do a great job too. The story is surprisingly solid, there is all through the movie a wonderful sinister atmosphere, and the well-dosed jump-scares are intelligently done. The last scene gives us the obligatory but a bit cliché final twist to indicate that the horror isn't over yet, but hey, I can forgive them, everything else is so great! I'm not that keen on many other movies of the Ouija-franchise, but this one is really a big and pleasant surprise.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
68,nitzanhavoc,"Unoriginal, lacks creativity, but one of the scarriest films I've ever watched.",8,10 January 2019,"I am mainly confused. While the exposition and framing story are quite original, the plot is anything but and is as cookie-cutter as they come. If you've ever watched a film about an Ouija board haunting then you already know exactly what's going to happen. You could even guess some of the characters without watching a trailer. No actual plot twist, nothing slightly innovative or smart about the turn of events, nothing but the same old features to which we've grown tiresomely accustomed. Then why, oh why, was this film so great and entertaining? I truly ask myself that.Perhaps it was the absolutely terrifying manner in which the hauntings were portrayed and presented, both in means of visual effects and cinematography. Yes, there are some jump scares, but they are far from being the main fear factor, as the film is by far more terrifying than physiologically startling. Besides, there are chosen few films that succeed in utilizing jump-scares in a way that doesn't feel like a cheap cheat, and this one if absolutely one of the title at the top of that list.Perhaps it was the profound acting, especially by young 11 year old Lulu Wilson as little Doris. Younger actors showing such talent always impress me, but watch out for this one, she has a very dark and horrifying future ahead of her. Besides, there's something about antagonist children that makes Horror films all the more terrifying, and while this feature is usually utilized in films portraying young sociopaths - a haunted little girl has been the stuff of nightmares ever since the classic The Exorcist. Annalise Basso was also excellent as Lina, this time given a far greater (and long overdue) role than in The Oculus. In general, acting is definitely one of the finer aspects of this film.All in all? I had a great time, was kept compelled and at the edge of my seat and honestly finished watching a little frightened to go to sleep (keep in mind I'm a 33 year old man). I honestly believe more creativity and originality in terms of screen writing and story, and a good plot twist, would have made this film a solid 10. I know I shouldn't have enjoyed it that much, I know it's not as good as I made it sound here, but it's been a long time since a Horror film had succeeded in scaring me to such extents. I'd say watch it and judge for yourselves, never believe the critics, you might love the film even more than I did and you might hate it. Personally, I'd give it a try.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
69,James_De_Bello,6.5/10,6,29 October 2016,"In 1965 Los Angeles, a widowed mother and her two daughters add a new stunt to bolster their seance scam business and unwittingly invite authentic evil into their home. When the youngest daughter is overtaken by a merciless spirit, the family confronts unthinkable fears to save her and send her possessor back to the other side.Following up the truly great ""Hush"", Mike Flanagan is back at the helm of a new horror picture and this time it is a prequel to the 2014 film ""Ouija"" which I didn't see. My main interest in this was to see Flanagan delve into the genre again and hope to experience some of the same terror he has been able to give us in the past. Strangely enough this film is very light on the scares and shifts the focus on a more dramatic angle which works beautifully if only it weren't that the build up does not pay off.What is clear from this film is that Flanagan is no average horror director and actually no average director at all. The screen is filled with brilliant filmmaking and he manages to pull off some beautifully touching character moments that aren't exactly what you are used to seeing in a horror film. From the touches he adds to make the film have a retro 60s feel to the way he directs every single one of these actors, he just demonstrates a confidence in the visual medium that is effortless to grasp and enjoy.What is really particular of this horror film is the fact that I wouldn't actually call it a horror film, it is more of a ""supernatural-family drama"". Firstly because the scares aren't neither what the film is interested in, nor are they scary, more on that later. Furthermore, what is primarily in focus here and what is the actively most engaging part is the characters who are being portrayed. Their story is absorbing, it is filled with obstacles and since it is very hard not to empathize with these people, it makes for a very riveting small scale drama: the characters involved are five at best, but every single one of their journeys is clearly presented to the audience, all of them have legitimate reasons to do what they are doing and the more it went on the more I surprised myself with how much I was actually engaged by their stories and these actors' performances.The supernatural element is treated very smartly and gets incorporated into the story seamlessly and convincingly. Plus, the fact that these people feel so real and authentic really gives the film a touch of greatness that I was surprised by: I laughed multiple times and the character depth that the teenagers were graced with was something that really pleasantly surprised me.The film has just one big problem: it is not scary. For some reason Flanagan does not come back to the tension filled sequences he gave us in something like ""Hush"": the vast majority of this films scares are basic jump scares with a pleasant touch of creepiness added, yet only jump scares they remain. For a moment in the finale it seems like we could be touching great suspense dynamics, yet they are cut pretty fast. Basically the first two thirds of this film are amazing character development and genuine drama with which the viewer is really pulled into the picture. The problem is that it feels like all of this is building up to something spectacular, yet we end up with a final act that might have a couple of surprises up its sleeve (even if they might be a little too out illogical), but isn't able to deliver a satisfying finale to these characters' story and enters territory that's way out of what the story world asked for.Still, I would say this stands up as a worthy film, indicative of the director's great talents in technical filmmaking and competent storytelling.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
70,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,5,6 September 2021,"Good Morrow, countrymen.The use of reel cue marks was a nice touch of retro ambiance, as was casting E. T's Henry Thomas (Elliott) as Father Tom. Nice of Flanagan to dust him off and show the world what he looks like now. The rest of this tepid PG-13 Horror is about what you'd expect.Flanagan has taken every trope/cliché and repackaged them competently to deliver a solid Ouija-centric horror that will delight teenagers...and that's about it.If you're a seasoned genre fan, you'll find enough here to pass the time, but it's doubtful you're going to be dazzled. Flanagan's films are tomato soup and grilled cheese. A great lunch, but ultimately forgettable.Ouija Board horror is inferior. It's lazy and mindless. Flanagan knows this and smartly added possession and haunted house elements to distract you that you're actually watching Ouija Board horror and should be ashamed of yourself. That was a clever move. Setting the film in 1967 was also clever...removing modern tech is refreshing. Visually, this film is excellent.The little girl with the over-used Edvard Munch's The Scream and white eyes is possession 101, as is the rest of the it...it's all standard fare, but prepared by a good enough short order cook.With all that, this is probably worth your time if you're a horror fan. Like the Annabelle films, don't expect any new ground to be crossed. You've been here before and if a familiar lunch is what you're in the mood for...dig in.Fare thee well, it's hoecakes and Madeira time.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
71,Ramascreen,Creepy,8,20 October 2016,"OUIJA: ORIGIN OF EVIL is super creepy. And it has good amount of well-placed jump-scares to rattle even the toughest audiences. As a horror fan, I definitely enjoy this installment way better than its predecessor.This is actually a prequel to the 2014 film, so they're taking this story back to the beginning; how it all started, with the same house but 50 years earlier. Elizabeth Reaser is a single mom raising her two daughters played by Annalise Basso and Lulu Wilson. They run a seance scam business to make a living but when they unwittingly invite an evil spirit into their home which then possesses the youngest daughter, this becomes the struggle to save her and drive the demon away.There's so much to like about OUIJA: ORIGIN OF EVIL. Well, for one, it's set in the '60s, so that in and of itself provides a very interesting style in terms of the actors' outfit and hair, it's like watching 'Mad Men' all over again, I'll never get over how much effort people put into the clothes they wear just to go to the supermarket back in that era. There's also heart in this story, the kids lost their dad, the wife lost her husband, the priest lost his wife, and and so that hole in their souls forms a foundation for why each of them has a longing or desire to speak with their dead loved ones. The reason why they can be taken advantage of by the spirit, totally makes sense, because they are at the most vulnerable point in their lives and looking for answers, unable to let go.And because this is a prequel, at the end you'll see how the story and the characters connect to the previous installment, I won't spoil it here for you, but you'll be able to make that connection without a problem. I think what essentially makes OUIJA: ORIGIN OF EVIL scary is Lulu Wilson's character, Doris Zander. Horror genre has a history of little creepy kids doing bloody gory things on screen, but there's something in Lulu's performance in that she's able to get your guard down, so when the frightening moments do come in, they become all the more effective. And unexpectedly, I might add. You'll jitter, your pulse will keep pounding, you'll close your eyes with your hands but with a few fingers open, and all the while you feel for the struggle of this family, you're invested in them. OUIJA: ORIGIN OF EVIL is one of this year's best horror films in my book.-- Rama's Screen --",Ouija - Origin of Evil
72,fil-nik09,Not bad,6,25 December 2016,"I am quite hesitant when it comes to horror films as most of them are not scary at all and majority of them is quite boring. So, I had no expectations going into this one and I was right. It is not bad, but it is not great either. It is somewhere in the middle but I am giving at rating 6 as it is not quite boring and some scenes were actually good.I do not understand why the film had to be placed in the 60's... I did watch Ouija or original film and I did not really like it. This one is better. Saying that, I forgot what was happening in the 1st one, so maybe that has to do with 'timing' of the film.The end of the film is puzzling! That old woman in the mental institution...isn't she the 'star' of some other horror films? So it is confusing why is she here? Or that was done on purpose? Horror films which have no links - connect. Though, of course, why wouldn't a woman from one horror film star in other horror film?I think the red hair girl is also in some other horror film.All in all, not bad.

74,gustheaffen,Could have been great but sold out last 25 minutes,7,22 July 2017,"I found this movie to be very enjoyable. For those reviews that say the acting was horrible, what horror movies are they watching? Overall this was well cast, the acting was fine and the little girl was successfully creepy. This is not a gore fest or a movie with a lot of cheap scares. It was more of a slow burning psychological scare and it worked watching it late at night alone. The movie is set in the 60s and had a great story line that naturally unraveled. It has an Exorcist feel to it that is missing from most modern day horror movies. It was successful in being creep while being entertaining and the little girl's behavior was freaky particularly when she spoke to her sister's boyfriend or used her voice to enhance her performances. However, like almost all of these types of movies the story writer felt they had to explain everything by tying it into a tired story line of evil that occurred in the house. It would have been more unique and fun to just have a bad spirit that shows up. The little bit of killing just seems forced and the last 20 minutes or so are just a mess of your typical expected story-line with this type of story. Why does the spirit control itself until the last 20 minutes? Who knows, just felt like time to wrap it all up in a neat bow which ruined the story. However it is very entertaining the first 2/3 and really demonstrates you don't need gore and cussing and teenage sexual situations to present a scare and creepy psychological situation. Wish they'd do a third installment and take it in a new creative direction.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
75,eshwarmail,Fumbles both on human and other aspect with a passable story and occasional thrill,6,28 January 2017,"There was a time when Hollywood was obsessed with period crime dramas which seemed to have spilled on to the horror genre. It could be either the higher supply of Hollywood props leading to discounts or the ease of storytelling without having to deal with modern communication and other technology. Also in the recent times this genre has collectively matured into a less gory and more character driven plots and sometimes featuring popular actors. Ouija, the popular childhood game to invite spirits to answer silly questions forms the basis of this plot but it gets more irrelevant as the story unfolds.Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) is a recently widowed mother of two - teenage Lina (Annalise Basso) and 9-year old Doris (Lulu Wilson). She runs small scams as a fortune-teller or as someone who talks to spirits out of her house with her daughters as accomplices. She purchases a Ouija board when suggested by Lina for adding it to her props. When they get a notice of foreclosure for her house, Doris finds a package full of money hidden in their basement by previous tenants. This discovery along with solving their present crisis, also brings forward Doris's abilities to really communicate with the spirits that booms her business. Is Doris able to positively use her new ability or is she getting consumed by it?The movie establishes a moderately happy family where they collectively try to contribute towards running their house. All the standard tropes you would see like a single mother striving to stay above water, a rebellious teenager and her crush, an adolescent handling her bullies at school etc. While this is all well established, the mom's character is shown to be flip-flopping though the tone of the movie still continues to show her in a positive note. Instances like when the mom doesn't try to investigate much further into the money purse discovery, doesn't pay heed to the changes in Doris after her new ability and just pushes on to exploit it etc. With the eventual revelation about the spirit, having the Ouija board in the center of it doesn't make any sense. The acting is moderately good which has very minimal characters overall much like most other movies of this genre. Most of the scenes either happen indoors or at a school's entrance which means that the entire movie was shot in a shoe-string budget despite its period setting - considering this is observed only in retrospect shows the quality and it is worth to commend the production design of this movie. The atmosphere setup is one of the most important element in a horror movie which it gets right to most extent. But the overall quality of the story or the thrills plays the spoiler where the origin story is very under-cooked and full of holes leaving a lot of content that doesn't make sense. A serious evil doing mischievous things is what I can't comprehend in most horror movies and this movie isn't any different.Fumbles both on human and other aspect with a passable story and occasional thrill.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

The film's ending is baffling, and a drop-in Holocaust twist to a house's supernatural secrets is out of place. ""Ouija: Origin of Evil,"" is deliciously creepy, thanks largely to a good performance by the youngest of its stars.Mr. Flanagan springs some effective scares, though eventually the proceedings turn a little silly.

79,FelipeCarrillo,OUIJA Franchise Is Manumitted by Mike Flanagan,8,26 October 2016,"Ouija Board has gained certain religious veto with the passing of the years, given that the game designed by Hasbro company by the end of the 19th century with a child guidance, became in a spiritual communicator between the world of the living and the dead. These superstitions around the ""game"" were calamitously squandered for Universal in 2014 with a film that directly pointed to NO. The equivalent to a creative disaster of horror genre was showed two years ago, however, with a minimum-budget of $5 million dollar, earned around $103,590,271 million, anything unusual with Blumhouse Productions as production company. Because of tremendous economic success which reached such film, a continuation was unavoidable , the surprising thing was that the start with a clean slate produced a frightening prequel, one of the best in the genre so far this year.""Origin of Evil"" takes place in 1967 Los Angeles and tells the backstory of Lina Zander, the character played by Lin Shaye in the first movie. The Zander family is going through an economic, sentimental and labor standstill following the father's death, Roger (Michael Weaver), who died in a car accident. Trying to evade economic suffocation, the family does fake seances in order to help people to contact deceased beloved ones. With a complex and disturbing indication mechanism, they simulate a true communication, achieving give an unfounded peace message to melancholic clients. Despite realistic effect, Alice (Elizabeth Reaser), now family's pillar, decides to add a new element to the spiritism circus, this is where the OUIJA board comes into play. Doris (Lulu Wilson), the youngest daughter, connects to what she thinks is the spirit of her dad, nonetheless, once it has shown clement and reliable, things become sinister because of the fatal oversight of the three main rules: 1. Never play alone, 2. Do not play in a graveyard and 3. Always say goodbye, remember: OUIJA knows all the answers.All starts well from the opening of throwback Universal Pictures logo, which radiates nostalgia and memories in equal parts. Watching again the company logo for the 70's evokes pure sentimentality for those movies that really established the filmic foundations. Together with the emblem, oval and white marks in the upper-right corner of the screen, giving the appearance that the film is still projected in the old format, providing empathy with the context of the story.Director and co-writer Mike Flanagan together with Jeff Howard conceived a greater story in all respects to the first film. As it is a prequel, it is not prescriptive that you know the forgettable initial story, since the task of this film is to lay the groundwork for Laine Morris' story . In addition to serving as main common with the terrible predecessor, it does not show unilateral nor empty characters, but delivers measured and sumptuous dialogs (monologue by Doris) and well-positioned plot twists. Flanagan and Howard are primarily concerned to initiate a solid connection between main roles with the audience, then hold on us to our seats with calamities suffering them throughout the full-length film. It provides formulaic and common few scares that debilitate what has been achieved, nevertheless, it is remunerated with practical and original jump-scares supported with exaggerated special effects, which overdo the movie of fictions, however, many of them work with the unexpected ending - unpredictable if you were not thinking in Lina's life from the first film.In general, performances are permissible and even electrifying because of the consistent link generated in the first half with the affable characters. Doris, the younger star, performs the role debut of her career in great style, shines with her own light and joins the clan of promising girls in horror (Isabelle Fuhrman, Madison Wolfe, Heather Sossaman). Besides, Basso delivers what we must perceive of her character, a girl who is in physical and sexual awakening, Reaser, an enterprising mother and Thomas, a priest who must prevent a tragedy.One of the most curious and iterative aspects are its references to classics as modern as ancient. Among these are William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Conjuring"" by James Wan, ""Oculus"" and ""Hush"", these last two were directed by Flanagan. It extracts helpful techniques and visual pieces, in which predominate faithful and precise touch at the end of the 60's, cars according to the epoch, clothes not so sinister but appropriate and an alarming soundtrack.Flanagan does not renovate horror genre with ""Origin of Evil"", but gives a new direction to the franchise, a glittering direction pointing directly to YES. We must keep a close eye on the career of this director, who promises much in atmospheres, stories and settings. Perfect for Halloween, perfect for the loyal horror fans, ""OUIJA"" only is for a demanding public.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

81,gregking4,reasonably effective horror movie that will appeal to those who liked The Conjuring and Insidious,6,20 October 2016,"The original Ouija, released in 2014, cost some $5 million to produce and ended up grossing some $100 million at the box office, so it's no wonder that production company BlumHouse went back to the well for a second helping. But as the title suggests, Ouija: Origin Of Evil is more of a prequel than a sequel, but in terms of scares and delivering the goods it is far superior to the original. The film is set in Los Angeles in 1967, half a century before the events of the original. Financially strapped widow Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser, from The Twilight Saga, etc) and her two daughters run a seance scam in which they offer comfort and solace to the bereaved and lonely. Alice buys an Ouija board, the newest trendy toy for teens looking for a bit of excitement, hoping to use it to boost her business. But when she and her daughters use it they unwittingly invite a malevolent demon into their home. Before long, her youngest daughter Doris (newcomer Lulu Wilson) is possessed by a demon. In desperation, Alice turns to Father Tom (Henry Thomas, best known for his role in the classic ET), the principal at the parochial school attended by her older daughter Pauline (Annalise Basso, from Oculus, Bedtime Stories, etc) for help. Director Mike Flanagan has spent ten years in television honing his craft, and has since built up quite a repertoire of horror films, including the creepy Oculus. He seems to prefer an old school approach to his horror and doesn't overwhelm the material with flashy CGI effects and green screen work. Ouija: Origin Of Evil does have a few effective moments of shocks, and Flanagan does manage to build up the tension. But Ouija: Origin Of Evil is fairly clichéd, and Flanagan and co-writer Jeff Howard (Oculus, etc) tick off all the right boxes here - haunted house, a family terrified by supernatural forces, a young child possessed by a malevolent spirit, spider walking up the walls, a friendly exorcist - but he also tends to telegraph some of his punches. The film is derivative and clichéd, and borrows from numerous other horror films. Fans of the genre will recognise many of the references - for example when the kindly priest steps out of his car and walks towards the house, audiences will spot subtle allusions to The Exorcist, one of the modern classics of the genre. Flanagan also suffuses the material with an old fashioned aesthetic that perfectly captures the era. Even the opening credit title card is reminiscent of the 60s. Cinematographer Michael Fimognari gives the film the look and feel of something shot in the 60s with its colour palette. Patricia Farrell's production design also reeks of authenticity and perfectly captures the era. Reaser brings plenty of spunk and attitude to her role, and makes for a strong and likable heroine. Basso makes the most of her role as the feisty and rebellious Pauline. Newcomer Wilson is a standout as the possessed Doris, and creates a truly frightening character and one of the more creepy child characters the genre has produced. Thomas has a warm presence and brings intelligence and depth to what could have been a fairly colourless and clichéd role. Ouija: Origin Of Evil is a reasonably effective horror movie that will appeal to those who liked The Conjuring and Insidious and their ilk. It doesn't matter if you haven't seen the original either, as Ouija: Origin Of Evil stands out on its own. However, a brief post final credits sequence features horror veteran Lin Shaye (from the original Ouija, Insidious, etc) and provides a contextual and thematic link to the original.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

Zall, Halle Charlton, Ele Keats, Nicholas Keenan, Lin Shaye, Eve Gordon, and Lincoln Melcher Directed By: Mike Flanagan Review WHEN YOU TALK TO THE OTHER SIDE, YOU NEVER KNOW WHO WILL BE LISTENING. Hello Kiddies your pal the crypt-critic here and by goodness gracious I just saw another good horror movie this month but this ain't my kind of horror movie. In 1965 Los Angeles, a widowed mother and her two daughters add a new stunt to bolster their séance scam business and unwittingly invite authentic evil into their home. When the youngest daughter is overtaken by the merciless spirit, this small family confronts unthinkable fears to save her and send her possessor back to the other side. The child actors in this movie were amazing for starters, I may not be a fan of this type of because of my religion but when it's scary I give credit where credit is due. And it can be quite terrifying. But it does also have quite a few jump scares but these days what horror movie doesn't. This is a prequel to the first film and apparently there was an after credit scene that I was unaware of I figured there would be but that's only because I honestly feel like it's a cinematic universe connected to those Annabelle and Conjuring movie( but it isn't). Ouija: Origin of Evil is a scary experience far better than the film that precedes it and has method acting. But to me not much memorability.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

84,Jared_Andrews,Deft Direction and Stellar Acting Carries the Movie,7,28 October 2019,"If you first ""Ouija"" film, you might have been inclined to skip this addition (a prequel) to the series. No one would blame you. ""Ouija"" is a laughably awful film. ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" however, is a surprisingly competent and thoroughly enjoyable horror movie.Perhaps it should not come as a surprise that ""O of E"" turned out so well. With the steady guidance of director Mike Flanagan (Hush, Oculus, Haunting of Hill House), one of the most consistent creators of scary stories in the business, we should expect high quality work. Once again, he delivers.The story revolves around a recently widowed mother and her two daughters. At risk of losing their old, creepy and possibly haunted (definitely haunted) house, the mother resorts to work as a fake medium to make money, calling on her daughters to contribute to the ruse. Things get more exciting when the mother brings home a Ouija board, not knowing that sinister spirits would soon possess her younger daughter.Then, as we witness the little girl's behavior grow increasingly strange, our goosebumps grow increasingly prevalent (because creepy little girls are a reliably freaky scary movie trope). The older sister soon suspects something, the little girl crawls on walls, and a priest shows up to help. That stuff is predictable and somewhat unoriginal. But this movie still works because of its splendid acting - the little girl, Doris (Lulu Wilson), is particularly impressive - and deft direction.Mike Flanagan clearly knows how to run the show. He makes sure that ""O of E"" becomes a far cry from other horror movies of this ilk, which possess so little inventiveness in their direction.With this film, we are treated to elegant camera movement, unnerving closeups, and evocative framing and angle choices that all appear purposeful and thought through. Instead of calling attention to an evil presence on screen with a hard cut, we simply see a shadowy figure crouching on the edge of the frame.Flanagan also chooses to include limited jump scares and, mercifully, no fake jump scares. Fake jump scares are what I call those moments of building tension when the sound goes silent, then suddenly there's a blast of jarring noise that makes us jump out of our seats as the camera reveals a harmless friend character. It's a cheap manipulation, a dirty trick. We deserve better, and Flanagan gives us better.Rather than turning to a loud and bombastic score to sell scares, Flanagan relies on the editing and our natural inclinations as viewers to feel scared. He trusts that when something scary that unexpectedly appears in front of us on screen, it will deliver chills.""O of E"" delivers a slow-building eerie viewing experience. There are no excessive bursts of violence. Nothing is over-the-top. It's a small-scale movie, but one that is nonetheless effective. I recommend it to any fans of possession movies, especially if you prefer ones devoid of gore.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
85,pinkarray,Very unrealistic film,5,10 September 2017,"This film deals with the demonic possession of children from a Ouija Board.This movie had many unrealistic things happening in it, such as the planchette moving around on the ouija board without anyone touching it, Doris's mouth hanging wide open, Doris dying in an unexplained way all of a sudden at the end. When you think that there was going to be a happy or bittersweet ending, all of a sudden, it turns out to be a sad ending.Some of the characters were annoying, such as the bratty teenage girl and the bullies who intimidate Doris at school. There are some similarities between this and Annabelle: Creation, both are prequels, both star Lulu Wilson, both are a bit better in other peoples' opinions than the mediocre sequels were. But I also found an interesting comparison I found at is that Lulu Wilson's character in both movies hate boys. Doris's character gets bullied by boys in Ouija 2 and Linda's character in Annabelle refuses to talk about boys.The rest of the characters were fine, but they couldn't even save this movie. The movie just killed them off and I'd rather for Lina to not be in this movie because she was so bratty, if she was a lot nicer and sweeter, I would've not minded her being in this movie.The acting, otherwise, is the best thing about the movie. Everyone did a great job portraying the emotions of their characters and not coming off as wooden in their acting skills.Verdict: This movie is contrived, clichéd, and forced. It's not much different from your average horror film. It's got the same cliché, sweet innocent youngest girl getting possessed. Don't expect anything groundbreaking from this film.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
86,jdring2007,eerie but not scary; just a well-acted drama/suspense thick with horror tropes,7,29 September 2021,"I knew going into this that the ""possessed child"" cliché was going to be used, something I can hardly stand as it's been overused to the point of boredom, BUT the plot of the movie seemed unique enough: family using fake seances not so much for money but to comfort people - and then something goes wrong. Count me in! The movie proved to be a little more than that and what I enjoyed almost more than the horror-esque second half was the buildup and character development of the first half. Having not seen the other Ouija movie but research insisted this one was a standalone sort of prequel, I was not disappointed, although a confusing post credits scene DID apparently tie it into the first Ouija. The movie itself offered solid acting throughout, especially by the mother and older sister/daughter. There were some creepy elements but the jump scares etc were so predictable I was almost taken out of it. The ending, however, pushed my 6 to a 7, and I can't really say why without giving it away but I will suggest that it probably has a very polarizing effect depending on what you expect from an ending of a horror movie.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
87,spencergrande6,"Better Than It Has Any Right To Be, But Still...",6,12 December 2016,"Mike Flanagan just gets so close yet again, yet falls disappointingly short. Oculus is still his best work, and the promise that both Hush and this prequel to a PG-13 board game prequel show, is that if given the right opportunity he might really be capable of a cold-blooded classic.This is a film that shouldn't exist, should never have gotten theatrical distribution and definitely shouldn't have attracted the likes of Flanagan (okay, he probably did this to increase his clout in the industry, but still). He musters some great work here, following familiar supernatural clichés but bringing his own touch to the proceedings.The setting is beautiful, the characters likable and not completely square. The atmosphere is given time to build, he luxuriates in teasing and messing with audience expectations (as a way of spiting this, and goosing the audience lulled into a slow burn placation, he includes an explosive scene wherein the actual demon is seen shoving his fist down the little girl's throat. It's both too much and a necessary jolt at the time, a conundrum if ever there was one and a small encapsulation of everything right and wrong within this film). It's too bad some of the nice work done in the first 2/3rds of the film is undone by a clichéd, boring, exorcism-lite finale. None of it is very scary, and it all has the feel of fitting into the ""Ouija"" franchise package, whatever in God's name that could mean. Considering the stakes here, what Flanagan does is still impressive.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
88,SpoilerAlertReviews,An okay conventional horror.,7,23 October 2016,"Mike Flanagan give us the prequel to Stiles White's first and only feature debut, Ouija from 2014. This one goes into the history and origins of the first film, going into detail of the horrifying characters, returning to the same house 60 years ago. We go back to find a single parent family who makes a small living from pretending to speak to the dead for clients by way of performing fake seances. The mother acting as medium whilst her two daughters pull strings to create the illusions. Flanagan reunited with Oculus child star Annalise Basso, who's now not quite the child, playing the older teenager sister and could also be seen in last month's Captain Fantastic. She's brilliant, but the star and horror of the film is Lulu Wilson, who plays the impressionable younger girl with a keen interest of speaking to the spirits in attempt to speak with her deceased father. E.T.'s Henry Thomas is totally unrecognisable being all grown up and playing priest, it's hard to believe that he was once the alien befriending Elliot all those years ago. Adding an Ouija board to the performance obviously leads to terrifying events opening a door for something else which takes hold of the little girl who then proceeds to spread the word. This much we know from the trailer, and is pretty much the whole basis of the story tying in with the previous. It has elements from other horrors like the exorcist and the Omen, actually using the classic vintage opening, with title credits and universal's old logo to boot. There's some good imagery that creates enough spooks to keep audiences glued to the screen but it is just another conventional horror that lacks any real lasting effect. The performances are good, especially from both the girls who appear to be accustomed to the horror genre. Lulu Wilson is quite the scare, getting her big break in Deliver Us From Evil and is starring in next year's Annabelle 2. Horror films seem to be more frightening when using children. It's suspenseful and scary in parts, but unfortunately predictable and even comical, but I think that was just my defence mechanism. Worth a watch but don't expect too much.

89,quinimdb,Ouija: Origin of Evil,4,23 October 2016,"""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" suffers from a common disease in horror films: cliché. It doesn't start this way; it actually subverts the genre at first by being not about real paranormal investigators, but frauds with good intentions. The father of this family that conducts these fake seances is dead Ling before the beginning of the movie, and it seems this occupation is the family's way of allowing others to have closure, but it doesn't really work. This means when the youngest girl of the family, Doris, begins to contact their dead father, the mother, Lina, sees this as an opportunity to give real closure to people. This is all in the first half of the movie, and, to be honest, none of it is very scary, but it is pretty original. The characters aren't very deep, but they're real characters with understandable motivations and, while there are a plethora of predictable jumpscares, there is at least effort given to trying to make them scary, sometimes utilizing long takes to sustain tension, and not ending the build up with a jumpscare every time. This doesn't mean it's good, the little girl is basically puts on the usual ""cute little kid"" performance when it comes to child performances, and then when she becomes possessed it changes to the ""creepy little girl"" stereotype. It becomes much worse in the second half, however.There are too many moments in the second half that are incredibly cliché, and the entire finale is way over the top. I found myself laughing at the absurdity of the little girl who is supposed to be creepy. The strange changes in voice, the casual eyes rolling back with the gaping mouth as she watched TV, etc... it all just felt really cheesy when they were trying to scare you.In the very, very end of the film, Lina, the older daughter and only surviving member of the family, is in a mental institution. She is insane, and there is a moment that would've been a perfect ending that would've showed that their good intentions only resulted in a clinging to dead ones, rather than acceptance, but then it goes on for one more scene just to deliver a predictable jumpscare. This is a pretty good microcosm for the whole film: at first it seems like it could have potential, but then it's thrown away for a lazy jumpscare fest.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

91,caseynicholson,The Perfect Horror Film for a Non-Horror Fan,9,25 October 2016,"I'm a casual horror fan at best. I've seen a number of horror films spanning several time periods, from Hitchcock to 80's slasher films to a few from the 21st Century. Still, I'm not a huge horror buff, and I don't take in scary movies time and again the way that some people do.That being said, I found ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" to be the perfect horror movie for someone like myself who likes a good scary movie now and then, but isn't a huge horror buff. The movie is very well made, features good acting and has an intriguing plot. And, again taking into consideration my personal comfort zone with these type of movies, I found it to be the right blend of scary but not over the top intense. The movie is not very gory at all (it's rated PG-13--a rating I find appropriate for this film), and while it certainly does have its creepy side, it's not the kind of thing that's going to keep you up all night. Well, I suppose that's a subjective thing--but for me I found it to be a fun kind of scary, rather than an overly unsettling film.In light of all that, I'm giving this movie 9/10 stars--a rating that I give to relatively few movies. I feel that this movie is deserving of that because it nails its aim, which is to be a well made horror flick that is ""family friendly"" so to speak, i.e. suitable for a teenage audience. If I had teenage kids, I'd definitely feel comfortable letting them see this movie--and I wouldn't mind sitting through it with them, as it was fun for me as an adult.

I usually give horror movies sh*t for bad actors, but this one knocked it out of the park. Elizabeth Reaser was brilliant as a single mother just trying to survive. She doesn't know exactly what the best things for her kids are, and she feels just emotionally weighed down. You sympathize with her throughout the whole movie, and a lot of that humanity present was due to Reaser's performance. Annalise Basso and Lulu Wilson were also excellent in their roles as the children. The character of Doris is the one given much more to do compared to the other characters, as she is the one who becomes possessed (evident in the trailers), and I thought Wilson was fantastic. She was definitely channeling The Exorcist at certain parts. Sometimes it work as well as other times, but overall, for such a young kid, I thought she was remarkable. Basso was also great, because she walked a thin line. Her character had the most potential out of anyone to become the annoying one, yet Basso gave a multi-layered performance that really helped even out the dynamics between the three main characters...",Ouija - Origin of Evil

101,tiskec,Creative Filming Indeed,6,7 November 2016,"""Ouija: Origins of Evil"" was not a bad movie at all. I like how the director/film crew filmed the movie as if it were a 1950's-1960's type film. If you look close throughout the movie, you'll get a black blotch on the right corner of the screen occur every now and then. In those times of filming, that indicated something about the film spool. I can't remember exactly what, but the point is that it was really neat and creative. It went right along with the films vintage setting. Even the cars were appropriate for the time. The starting title also has a vintage feel to it. I think this was a very creative way to film the movie. This little girl in this movie was indeed creepy as they come. She did an excellent job of acting. In fact, she may be the best child actor I've seen yet. Maybe. All I know is she did a great job, even during her possession phase of the movie. I can just imagine how much cosmetics and CGI were used with that weird mouth of hers, as the character. She played it off real nicely. That's talented for such a young actress, so props to the crew for selecting her. All I know is she needs to come to my house and find thousands of dollars in my wall for me. Then she'd be REALLY AWESOME. We all know that's not going to happen...so. After watching the movie, it was actually better than I expected. Truthfully, I've never seen the first one because it had such bad reviews. I usually learn to judge for myself, but I also know when to trust my gut. I'm glad I did, because I was told personally by others that the first one was garbage. So, I got a lot out of watching this. There were a few jump scares in there where I thought I was going to poo a little. They got me. Then again I'm easy to jump scare.

103,trnjamesbond,Good For About An Hour,3,7 January 2017,"I watched the original film feeling like I wanted to tear my eyes out. Then this prequel comes along. I click the play button and before my eyes I see something that looks like television show quality, a throw back to the old cult classics that I use to watch as a kid in the eighties. It was an interesting direction, but really didn't know what to make of it. I say to myself ""okay it's set in the past and we are about to embark on a journey"". All went well for about an hour, there were very little jump scares noises, if any, and only one stretchy CGI demon face(for the first hour or so). But the stretchy cheap CGI demon face was done in a way that is acceptable. There were very eerie moments when the camera would pan to the left or right catching a shadow figure in the background. But the good thing is there was no cliché jump scare sounds, it was left up to us as the viewer to deem the scene scary or not.I was actually commending the director for this old school style of horror story, no silly jump scares. But in and around the one hour mark or just a little after, all silliness broke loose. This movie now turned into jump scare central, all the gags were saved to spoil the end. It's like they didn't know where to go with this ending, or they ran out of money, and decided to make the last half hour or so an editing mess, full of unwanted scenes, and dialogue that people have seen over and over again.You can really tell when a production runs out of money these days, it had such a good back story, but instead of branching out on that story, they made it into a teenage horror drama-fest. They did this by throwing in scenes of other films we all know. This film started out good, it had a feel of a really good short story, and unfortunately that's all it was, because the last half hour was all pies and anchovies. Note to studios: Stretchy CGI demon faces are silly and just dumb, and not even teenage girls find them scary, they are a product of the YouTube generation, and it's been done to death, so please I beg you stop using CGI in horror, it doesn't belong in this genre!(or any other genre)",Ouija - Origin of Evil
104,sjarja,very good,8,21 November 2016,"This movie was very well done. Although the story is of course nothing new - it was remade in a very high production value way. Visuals and immersion worked well for me - and there was a lot of nice detail...mind you, there were only like 2 major locations, - the house and the school.Acting was good - except the mothers acting in the last act. I did like it before - but in that act... it felt unnatural and actually broke my immersion noticeably. I do not know why that was so - maybe i imagined it... but i really disliked it.While the movie had only sparse effects in the first half - it became quite abundant in the last half. But they were placed well enough for a good effect. There weren't many really any cheap jump scares - the movie rather used peripheral effects most of the time with a few well placed center focused full screen effects.In terms of the story - i very much appreciate a story where the protagonists actually communicate and act quite naturally. That means they do not stubbornly deny anything until, neither do they progress through the story in blissful ignorance. The characters talked to each other, drew good conclusions and also acted on those conclusions.All in all - this movie is highly recommended ... alone or with friends when it is dark.postscript.: The movie would have worked just as well without the namesake Ouija board, which plays a rather insignificant role.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

106,christophershobris,Ouija: Origin of Evil Review,7,29 October 2016,"After the trailers, the previous film, and just the name Ouija made me anticipate that this will be a bad film like the predecessor. But whoever's idea it was to switch directors needs to get a high-five. Mike Flanagan the director of Hush, and Oculus two films I enjoyed comes in this film and totally turns this horror franchise around. When I saw they were making a sequel to Ouija I was just thinking ""cash-grab"" which is initially what horror sequels are. But after seeing this film I didn't think that at all. Flanagan actually put effort and heart into it. The story, characters, and execution of the scares was improved tenfold and the predictability that a lot of films have was pretty much nonexistent. However, I did give it a 7 out of 10 for a reason. Even though this is much better then the first, it has flaws. It takes a while for the film to get going, the first quarter and a half was spent wondering and worrying, and talking. Then the climax hits then stuff gets good. But I took some sitting through to get there. Also the film despite being very good, is actually forgettable, there is nothing that stands out, or is something I haven't seen before. Besides this film takes a very familiar trait of a ghost story about possession. We've seen that many, many times before, and this doesn't offer anything special or memorable. However, one thing I will remember is the little girl, she was superb. If you remember Linda Blair from The Exorcist and how good that performance was, this is just as much so. I don't remember her name but I'm sure I eventually will. She was excellent. So, with all that said I do enjoy this film as a whole and a sigh that it was a welcoming improvement over the first film.

107,politehere,The Scariest Movie I have Ever Seen,10,10 June 2019,"I eat horror movies for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I've seen it all. In my experience, there are two types of horror movies: those that you can watch many times and enjoy the story as well as the scares, such as Drag Me to Hell, 1408, Resident Evil, Final Destination, etc. And then there are those that are full of scares of all kinds (particularly jump scares), but you may not want to watch many times, because story-wise they are just not as interesting or varied as the horror movies of the first category. For me, Ouija: Origin of Evil falls into the latter category. It is by far the scariest movie I have ever seen. I jumped at least 20 times during this movie, which is a record in and of itself, and 4 times I felt as if someone poured a full bucket of ice-cold water all over me and chills were sent down my spine. That is yet another record. The jump scares here are surprisingly effective. The acting, cinematography, music score, and atmosphere are top-notch, but it's not one of those movies that I would want to watch more than twice unless I watch it, say, 5 or 10 years from now, when I have forgotten about the movie and enjoy the jump scares again, because the jump scares will stop being effective the more you watch the movie, and the story is not really something that I would want to watch more than once. It's about a Ouija board after all.Anyway, the jump scares alone win this movie a 10/10. Strongly recommended.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

109,Oberrated,An absolute shock,9,26 October 2016,"First and foremost, ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" may very well be the biggest surprise hit, in my opinion, of the year. I went from writing off this origin story because of how bad the first one was. Then giving it some respect because the thriller/horror mastermind, Mike Flanagan, was tagged to it. Who, might I add, directed the hit- or-miss ""Oculus"" and made the fantastic Netflix exclusive ""Hush"" (Click here for my review of it). Now, I am here making this review, in love with this movie and now this series. Mike Flanagan masterfully created an origin story to a series that was so investing and so eerily creepy that it, at times, made my skin crawl. Story alone, this film keeps the audience so curious throughout the film until the very end when it hits you full force with consistent terror. This is not simply a jump scare movie, although it has its moments, I have just grown immune to them. I found the slow burn creepy actions and mannerisms far more terrorizing than an attempt at catching me by surprise. In a sense, the film toys with the audience as they expect to be scared but right when you think it may happen, it pulls off the trigger. A fantastic element of which I applaud Mr. Flanagan.Beyond the film itself, I must bring focus to what Mike Flanagan did with this series. In 2014, ""Ouija"" came out and to most and especially myself, it fell flat. Far too many holes in the plot and an abundance of eye rolls and sighs at the frequent stereotypical horror scares. Two years later, Flanagan delivers not only an origin story that alone stands as a very strong horror film, but also delivers a film that makes the 2014 installment a crucial piece of the story. To the individuals who saw the first then watched this, many may sit in awe of how the 2014 film blended perfectly into this one. It caused me to have an irresistible desire to re-watch the original and be awe-struck at how genius this film truly is.Now for the wrap-up, ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" not only stands strong on its own as a masterful blend of slow-burn horror and fresh jump scares, but also stands strong with a story that sparks curiosity throughout the duration of the film and keeps you invested. I highly recommend this film and even encourage watching the 2014 ""Ouija"" afterward... just ignore the bad acting and stereotypical horror genre antics.--Oberrated--",Ouija - Origin of Evil
110,RileyOnFilm,This prequel is much better than the original,8,28 October 2016,"Like most horror movie fans, I was not impressed with the first Ouija film. It was flat and lacking in almost every aspect. For that reason, I didn't plan to spend my hard-earned money on a prequel (this film takes place before the original). The surprise part of my story is that my daughters dragged me to see it and I really liked it. It was a whole different concept than the first film and it worked on many levels to be what I feel is one of the strongest horror films of 2016.As with many horror films, it does take a while to really get going. In fact, despite some good scares and creepy atmosphere in the middle, the best scares are in the last 1/3. A story must be told so I get why they have to tell it calmly in the beginning. There are two daughters: an 18 and 9-year-old. They live with their mother and their father has died. The mother runs a psychic medium business out of a parlor in her house. She gets customers in touch with their dead ones and she knows what she does is a scam. She has no guilt because, as she tells her daughters, she is helping these grieving people. Her daughters know it's all BS. I must mention this was directed by Mike Flannigan (Oculus, Hush) who I have tremendous respect for. He really made a good horror film here and I look forward to seeing more of his work in the future. Spoilers ahead.There is a rather intricate plot here which reminds me of recent horror films like The Conjuring 2 and Lights Out. In a way, it was too busy for me but I appreciated the story, it sort of came together and worked in the end. Again, it was very complicated. Does anyone miss movies like Halloween where horror is simple?After one daughter gets seemingly possessed by a demon spirit and helps her mother do readings, the older one meets a boy and reports strange letters her sister wrote in Polish to the headmaster priest at their school. And, that priest is ""sort of"" dating their mother but not really because he made a vow he won't break. See what I mean by complicated? It gets more complicated. Suffice it to say Nazi German history weaves in and  well, the ending is sad beyond what you normally would see in a horror movie. Bring your Kleenex.All in all, despite the convoluted, overlong plot, I really liked the scares and creepy atmosphere in this film. I would recommend it as a 8/10 for horror fans.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
111,Hazu29,Not bad at all,6,11 June 2020,"The production of this movie is really really good. The story and jump scares are okay, a little predictable, but in the end, it's a good horror movie, I enjoyed it. If you like The Conjuring and Insidious, you'll like this one.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
112,briandwillis-83825,"Not Very Memorable, But Well Made",6,25 October 2020,"For a studio mandated prequel/sequel to a lousy original film, Ouija: Origin of Evil is better than it has any right to be. Bringing in Mike Flannagan to tackle this was a wise choice, but you can tell he feels boxed in by the material and perhaps some studio tampering. Things are too clean and too safe most of the time even if the great performances and smart direction do elevate the material as much as they can. There's an overuse of modern horror cliches like the CGI mouth distorting. It isn't a movie you'll want to rewatch over and over again, but for a film that could have easily ended up as garbage, it's amazing how decent it turned out.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

In another director's hands this could have been a cheap Exorcist ripoff, but instead it was an intelligent, sometimes moving, high quality horror film.I loved the family drama/dynamics - the characters really seemed fleshed out to me. The film dealt with death and loss in a very smart and warm way. There were times I was even misty eyed.There is some dark humor in the film which had me laughing out loud.And the scares? I literally jumped out of my seat four times! And there were a lot of scenes that sent shivers down me.While the story isn't all that original, the execution is. The acting is top-notch for everyone, and Lulu Wilson (who plays the 9 year old) should get an academy award. Seriously, she earned it!!! I had a BLAST!!! Really enjoyed myself.. 8 out of 10..",Ouija - Origin of Evil

But I admit maybe the movie deserves 3.5 because the first 30 minutes of it were not that bad. However, after that most of the scenes were either ridiculous or very boring and predictable. And this special effects looked so cheap made. I don't know how someone can think this is a good horror movie or a good movie at all.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
115,BillSims28,"Five-Word Review: Unexpectedly Great: Chilling, Well-made; Over-baked",8,28 October 2016,"The sequel no one cares about to the 2014 film no one cared about is surprisingly good. Elizabeth Reaser stars as a mother who pretends to contact the spirit world and ends up opening a dangerous door to this world with her daughters Lulu Wilson and Annalise Basso. The director is Mike Flanagan, who previously gave us another surprising critical hit with Oculus, and his skill is evident in this film. Right from the start it is clear that Ouija: OoE is no ordinary clichéd piece. Being set in the 1960s, it is made to look so, with an old-fashioned Universal logo and title card - this is small but is just a cute touch that shows the director at least has some passion for this project. There are a few more of these touches: Tyler Durden style top-right-corner white blotches to show reel changes, plus a fantastic soundtrack and note-perfect dialogue/acting (visible in the comedic displays of attitudes towards teen fraternisation) which does a really good job of setting the period and making it feel like 60s America. The acting is solid throughout, in fact, with Reaser bringing charm and depth to her role, and the young actors are great too. Furthermore, thankfully, they all manage to imbue their characters with a certain amount of wisdom and common sense that is often noticeably lacking in horror films. It's also refreshing to have a proper score, which really sets the viewer on edge and succeeds in having far more of an effect than the usual horror background music. The script is not silly either, and there's some genuine dialogue aside from a few instances of over- baked exposition later in the film. The horror works in Ouija. Instead of relying on jump scares, there's some real dread, and I found myself with goosebumps and a constantly tingling spine, whilst my hands hardly let go of the armrests. However, it is the buildup which is the best - in the final third things start to falter a little, perhaps as it becomes too focused on tying into the first film (which I have not seen) and seemingly with as many endings as Return of the King. Nevertheless, this is one of the best horror films I've seen in a while, and is definitely worth seeing if you fancy a solid Halloween flick. 74/100",Ouija - Origin of Evil
116,kimheniadis,Loved everything about this movie!,10,17 February 2017,"This movie instantly puts you into a different era, which you can tell as soon as the studio insignia comes up, and it continues throughout the movie with the screen blips that makes it seem like you are watching actual film. I was very surprised that they were able to convey such a creepy and horrific feeling in this movie, especially with a PG-13 rating.It doesn't rely on cheap jump scares, but gives you the tension and creepy-crawlies through the telling of the story and the fantastic acting, especially the two sisters. When Doris (Lulu Wilson), talks to her sister's boyfriend about what it feels like to be choked, I got goosebumps. And when Doris who was just staring at the TV is suddenly staring at the other people in the room, you can feel the evil radiating from her.I don't jump a lot while watching horror movies, but towards the end some of the effects that they did (without CGI) had me jumping. The scene that takes place on the stairs and with the boyfriend was just perfect.I highly recommend this one, and feel like I need to make a new graphic so I can give it more than five stars!",Ouija - Origin of Evil
117,thomasshahbaz,Excruciatingly dull and formulaic,1,4 December 2016,"Despite my better instincts, I watched this, as I was impressed by the director's ability to weave gold out of other tired genres. Sadly, this is nothing more than a by-the-numbers spook-fest with nothing original, mediocre acting, no scares and plenty of painfully drawn-out scenes leading nowhere. My immediate problem was with the music, which is so generic sounding it could be stolen from any number of horror films, and often sounds as if it's been directly lifted from Harry Potter. Lots of white contact lenses, multiple voices and floppy, arms-by- sides possessed little girl shots, and, of course, the Lord's Prayer just when you thought the film couldn't get any worse. I can't think of a single element of this disaster of a film that hasn't been hackneyed to death previously. I'm now wondering why I've even bothered to waste my time typing this... Don't watch it!",Ouija - Origin of Evil
118,anandrajeev979,Ouija Board finally gets the perfect horror and creepy treatment thanks largely to this unexpected prequel,8,7 November 2016,"So the film defines three rules for playing with ouija board. Do not play alone.Do not play in graveyard and Always say goodbye.I f any rule if broken Ouija will unleash its wrath and it does that happen in this movie.I personally loved it as a horror fan since in many movies Ouija had always had a side role but this prequel to the awful 2014 Ouija is a perfect horror film.It has its clichés and does not break any new ground but its scary and satisfying as a horror movie and that with being different and able to stand out from the crowd.After watching likes of The Witch , Conjuring 2 , Don't Breathe and Lights Out I didn't expect much as 2014 Ouija was really horrible but after watching Hush I had some expectations and the result was beyond that. The story is perfect as it explores fear in late 1960s which is scary and the way the story turns from being helping others to needing help is actually worth seeing.The pace is fast and the Director has nice grip on the intense chilling scenes.One particular scene that was also in trailer where Doris says about what it feels to be strangled is spine chilling and remind of the scene in Conjuring 2 where Ed talk with the demon. Despite fairly predictable jump scares the film has the potential to built an eerie atmosphere which strikes the right chord. All the reveals in this movie are more than creepy especially some creative ways to scare us are also present which were new and refreshing and they are always nice to see. A particular thing about the movie is that it does not play good , it makes you root for everything then it just vanishes in thin air as the hunt starts very fast and goes on and on.It always nice to see children used as a weapon in horror movies as their innocence contrast with the horrible things they do. Its the first time I have seen such creepiness in children since Orphan and The Orphanage. So Final word Watch this unexpectedly great and scary horror movie which finally utilizes the full potential of the so called OUIJA BOARD. Also don't watch the trailer as it spoils most of the story and good scenes. If something you didn't expect to be good turns out to be more than good then its a must watch.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
119,cjs6547,The best Ouija,7,12 December 2016,"Who knew Ouija was going to release a sequel (or in this case, prequel), that could provide more than cheap thrills and shallow characters? Ouija: Origin of Evil certainly delivers.The highlight of this movie would be the wonderful child acting by Lulu Wilson as Doris Zander. Whether intentional or coincidental, the girl portrays childhood innocence very well, which ultimately becomes a mask for the possession.The story is set in the 1960's around a widow and her family who are trying to make money as mediums (counterfeit ones, of course). It is not centered around present day teens making stupid decisions in their hormonal angst, and that is already a good start.There was potential to make it more. The elder sister is very skeptical in the beginning, and remains so throughout the movie. This seems to be her only role in the film, and it would have been nice to see her resolve some of her own conflicts.The effects are not brilliant, especially some that appear on Doris's face, but overall they do the trick. Some may not like the ending, but I for one don't feel the need to achieve moral resolution in any supernatural horror production, so I liked it, even though I wish it hadn't been so abrupt/final.Good movie. 7/10.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

123,leosmith-11166,A surprisingly scary halloween flick,7,31 October 2016,"When watching ""Ouija: Origin of Evil it is easy to say that it lacks any ""real scares"". The jump scares are Predictable, and you leave the cinema feeling at a loss. But it wasn't until it turned dark last night, and I hopped into bed, that I realised how scary this film is. The haunting images of the slick, black demon, and the fear of the concept of possession riddled my sleepless night. So in the morning, I could definitely and conclusively say this was a scary horror film. But I still couldn't find how I really felt about it. And then it came to me. I actually enjoyed the vintage, classic film feel about the film. And that was what I loved about it. The whole feel of the film is, classic. And it isn't just the Universal Title Card or the vintage filming look, but in the narrative and characters itself. The film homages such ""demonic"" films of the 70's and 80's, such as ""The Exorcist, ""The Omen"" and ""The Poltergeist"")with a classic plot trope of using a creepy little girl (Exorcist, Poltergeist, The Shining) in a creepy little house doing creepy little things. And, as all great homage films do, they put their own spin on it. The backstory behind the house itself is sensationally creepy(and slightly cliché) and adds a creepy atmosphere to the film. The film also successfully captures the 60's culture, and the craze revolving around the ""Ouija Board Game"".And, as you can see by my rating, there were a few flaws in this film. First off all, I felt like they were really hamming up the creepiness of the little girl, and made the film feel a little conventional. The acting, at times, was a bit bland, and felt quite weak and conviction less. The acting does, however, pick up in the second half. The scares could also be considered ""Cheap"", but nonetheless, do their job with startling the audience. Overall, Ouija is a fantastic Halloween movie, and is a classic embedding of what horror is all about.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

127,knifemagnet,"Not ""terrifying"" and lacks any real plot.",2,29 October 2016,"To be up front, I have to admit - I am not, and never was a horror fan. For me an alien abduction movie is far more creepy than any 'horror' film could ever wish to be. Yet, some of the classics are decently entertaining as well as the Emily Rose film from 2005.""Ouija"" starts out alright; it sets up the stage for events to begin nicely. They convincingly portray 1967 - at least for those of us not alive at the time. However, once things start to happen the film simply bombs. I really cannot comprehend the hype behind this film with praises such as 'creepy' and 'terrifying' heard on YouTube, radio, and elsewhere. The plot of this film is never truly realized - you are clued in to who the entities are, yet even that doesn't add up (one would think an evil spirit would have been an evil person in life). They never provide any real backstory aside from a short conversation and we are never given any closure. It is basically along the lines of ""this thing is that"" and then some half-***ed attempts at making the audience jump. Sure, the trend these days is for Hollywood to milk everything of its last drop of blood - and this film is left totally unanswered likely so another film can be made. Still, if this is a chapter in an ill-thought money-grab scheme they could have ended the chapter with one loose end - instead the entire thing is frayed. A friend and I actually sat through the credits and were rewarded with an utterly worthless scene of a ""loose end"" in present time... Which also answered zero questions. So my rating, for lack of any real tangible plot, brings this down to 5/10. When I watch a film I want a story - what I don't want is some loose-knit script with a movie constructed around it. The acting likewise tanks once the ""scares"" begin.That brings me to 'the horror' part of this film. The horror here entails a young girl screaming multiple times, whispering into ears in an indiscernible language, standing on the ceiling or walking on walls, and moving quickly. Every single one of these acts is done repeatedly - and perhaps after the second scream it is all yawn-inducing. So, for me, this film's lack of anything scary brings my final score to 2/10. If I see a drama I want drama. If I see an action film I want action. And likewise, if I see a horror film I want to jump. This film fails.I shouldn't even have to mention I will not watch the next iteration of ""Ouija"" even if it is free.

Unfortunately, the girl is devoid of guidance and is forced to make her own mistakes via trial & error, and it's mostly error. A dark entity spawned of a ""Dr. Devil"", obviously based on Josef Mengele {Angel of Death} comes through the oracle portal to possess the girl and experience her senses, especially the ability to speak. The creature resembles a combination of Dr. Satan {House of 1,000 Corpses}, and Greedo, yet inclusive of a reptilian tail and ridge back. Once inside her, it manifests through facial distortions and additional possessive transference to manipulate their quarry, which includes a priest friend Fr. Tom Hogan, mother Alice, and her sister Lina's boyfriend Mikey.In one remarkable scene, the clerical acquaintance witnesses her abilities in action to confirm the need for an exorcism. She is clearly an empath, clairvoyant, telepath, as well as demonstrating telekinetic abilities to move the planchette, read and manipulate the thoughts of those participating. It doesn't end well for neither the priest or the older sister's boyfriend, both of whom meet their doom.It's up to Lina to free her mom and little sister from the grasp of the shadowy specter who at one point peers out from her mouth with a gruesome eyeball. Utilizing the board in such a conducive environment rich with nefarious history raises Hell for all involved. The demon within her enjoys toying with the boyfriend, offering a morbid, descriptive preamble to his suffocating demise, then appealing to his greedy curiosity, leading him to a secret room via the basement. The Victrola plays again as terrible secrets are revealed from within the walls. Thus the sacrifice offered, the creature gains even more materialization.The tragic tale concludes as it is ultimately Lina's sad responsibility to unfortunately free them of their very flesh. The poor girl ends up in an institution for the rest of her natural life, yet even at the very end, the supernatural makes a familial, familiar visitation.Rating: 5/5.

Big Mistake!The story starts out slow, but midway through it picks up and turns into an intense creep fest. Without giving too much away all i can say is that this installment is surprisingly good and even better than the original, its smart in using tactics and angles to creep you out! Strong story with good acting always elevates cinematic projects like this, but what truly did it for me is that it sort of defied some horror basics and played by the ""horror movie rules"" by adding a smart direction to it.

However, it all comes down to this: you simply CANNOT do a good thriller/horror movie with bad special effects. The enlarged mouth-face you see in the trailer gives away the poor quality of CGI and that's really pretty much you're going to get when it comes to scares. This makes the movie completely ridiculous and an overall mediocre horror experience.

Where this film fails for me is in the actual horror and its final act; you have a nice build-up with attention to characters and mood only for the film to completely fall apart two-thirds in, turning into a PG-13 Exorcist on steroids, which isn't scary at all. The suspense at the start was nicely built, but once it starts piling on ropy special effects and endless attempts at jump scares I really lost interest.

Sometimes because I had so much tension built up before they happened or just that they were really scary and good so it is stuck in my head forever.This movie however had so many jump scares it got to the point it was just ridiculous. I mean towards the end it just became funny almost as you could predict every jump scare. Many of the jump scares are basically the actor just jumping in front of the camera with the face really close with a stupid looking cgi effect.Some of the jump scares were also more funny than scary. And the acting of the little kid are one of the worst I have ever seen: She is emotionless. I bet even if you have a demon inside of you, you should portray some emotions like hate or anger or spite... but nope... this little actor did not manage that.I have to rate this awful simply because the movie is not scary. It only relies on jump scares to ""scare"" you. It's not real fear you know.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
139,klheintz,Performances were inconsistent and the story was filled with tropes,4,10 November 2016,"The main thing I have a problem with in Oiuja is the performances. At times they are pretty good and then at others, the whole thing feels messed up. The most consistent was the youngest daughter but even her very purposeful movements which are meant to be creepy just look weird and forced.The film does take a while to get going and I like how it develops the characters a lot more than other horror movies do. I didn't quite get the feeling of actually caring for the people but it was a good attempt. I think the characters needed to be a bit more likable, but that could just be me.So basically the first half of the movie is a solid horror film but it devolves into an average movie with strange actions by the family that don't fit with anything normal people would do... That's so typical for films like this so I can't bash on it too much.Overall it had nothing really special about it and the final act of the film kind of went all over the p;ace and felt kind of rushed because of the focus on the family for the first half of the film.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
140,sukanya-samy,Mike Flanagan moves the planchette to a YES for Halloween,7,25 October 2016,"Ouija (2014) was a lazy, nonsensical movie about a bunch of teenagers who get killed because one of them plays a Ouija board alone and awakens something dark and sinister in the house. The hero of the film is a friend who figures out that there was a family of three women - a mother and two daughters who did seances in the same house and one of them is the bad spirit who is killing her friends. She visits one of the sisters in an asylum only to be tricked by her to actually awaken the monster sister. The film itself was shabby, with no logic to the sequence of events and plot holes the size of pot holes on Indian roads. It was one of the worst of 2014. Flash forward to 2016, we have Ouija: Origin of Evil which attempts to tell the story of the three women and connect it to the 2014 disaster. Is this a bigger disaster? Read on to find out. Originally reviewed at 'Broth of Blogs'.Plot and ScriptThis prequel shows the story of middle-aged widow Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) who earns her living as a fake medium and has help in her charades by her two daughters, 15-year-old Lina (Annalise Basso) and 9-year-old Doris (Lulu Wilson). She insists that she is just comforting the living who come for the readings by faking contact with their dead loved ones.Fast forward to an under-aged alcohol party which Lina attends just to fool around with her friends on a Ouija board and the suggestion that Alice should use one to up her theatrics. Alice does buy one and invents a whole magnetic mechanical process and tests it to see if she can move the planchette and make it seem like it is moving on its own. Little does she realize that she has awakened a spirit who channels himself through Doris who is obviously the one who will be possessed in the story.Things start moving and the father makes contact when Doris tries her hand at the board - Alice takes that as a sign of Doris being a true medium and even puts her to work. But all hell breaks loose when the school priest (who has a soft corner for Alice) comes to the house to explain the letter that Lina saw Doris write - the letter is in polish and is the back story about the history of the house. Without getting into spoilers, the story moves forward to show the possession, the havoc caused and how Lina ends up in the asylum - connecting it to Ouija.The back story was a bit muddled and there were some flaws in the story but the story was largely logical.Characterization and Acting (C&A)The characterization and acting was really good I though. Special credit to Wilson who plays the part of the vulnerable-girl-eventually-turning- into-a-monster quite well. A lot of effort again to showcase the 60's and done well right from costumes to the house. Sounds and Effects (S&E)Since sound is such an integral part of horror movies, it has to be good. And I am happy to say, it was good in this. There were minimal jump scares - if there was a lurking shadow, there wasn't a loud noise to scare the audience, it was just a lurking shadow and a reaction by the character who saw it. The third and final act had a good sequence which helped the suspense. The editing is good and flows well - it does slow down once in a while but that is to establish the characters which is done really well. The first act is only about that. Cinematography and Visuals (C&V)This movie looks really good. The 60's are shown like how it should be but obviously with a modern twist. I noticed the 'cigarette burns' all too well which just shows a lot of care was taken while making the movie to make it seem like it is a period film when people had to change reels once those circles showed up. I didn't think too much of the demon itself - it sorta broke away from the setting of the movie because it was CGI and obviously some of the other effects when Doris gets possessed are kinda funny if you see - I didn't find it creepy.Direction and Overall (D &O)Mike Flanagan has the craft people - he proved it again (Oculus and Hush fame). He made sure the characters are well defined so when the movie moves forward, we care about them. He made sure the sequence of events was logical though the story is about demonic possession and that it is a well made, suspenseful horror movie without the use of stupid jump scares. Kudos Mr. Director!Bottomline: The first one was so stupid that most people didn't expect this one to do anything other than bore you. But this is a good one in the Halloween season, well made with solid characters and some good scares. Does have some flaws but the character of Doris, played by Wilson is by far the best thing about the movie - a kind of Damien-esque role where you think she is cute one minute and a devil the next.So here are my scores:Plot and Script (P&S)- 1Characterization and Acting (C&A) – 1.5Sounds and Effects (S&E) – 1.5Cinematography and Visuals (C&V) – 1.5Direction and Overall (D &O) – 1.5Overall Score – 7 out of 10--Originally reviewed at 'Broth of Blogs'.--",Ouija - Origin of Evil

The actors (especially the Child actors) were great and the effects were creepy and cool.

The quality of the acting does not, unfortunately, continue up the ranks of the cast but director Mike Flanagan and the technical team's ability to create some genuinely, physically unnerving moments is never for once in question.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
143,tvsweeney-39052,Great Performed by Juvenile Actor in this Horror Film,9,30 March 2017,"Although this film is a prequel so having not seen this original, it's better to start with this one. Set in 1967 Los Angeles, the story moves so leisurely one can imagine the movie audience fidgeting impatiently for the ""action"" to start. It's slow, true, but the tension does build, and the things little Doris spies through the planchette's glass are only given in tantalizing glimpses. The usual ""shock"" scene of something thrust into the viewer's face as she peers through the glass is absent, perhaps making its actual appearance even scarier.The story: A widow supporting herself and her two children by giving seances, is shocked to learn her youngest daughter has contacted her dead father through a Ouija board. When the child finds money, saying her father told her where to find it so they can pay off a foreclosure, the mother gets the idea of having the girl help her with her seances and give actual readings to clients. She keeps the child out of school to do readings and it's surprising no one investigates this since the priest who runs the school is very aware. Things go from there to worse when something not her father's spirit invades the child.There are so many moment in which the expected horrific images are given chances to appear and those are ignored, using Doris to convey them, which makes the action even more frightening.All in all, the absence of ghostly presences, with most of the spectral action conveyed through the child makes it even more frightening., though I had hoped for the father's spirit to perhaps intervene a bit. Indeed, he does little more than appear a couple of times, perhaps not being strong enough to fight the true evil lurking in the house.Anyone who's seen the original movie knows how this is going to end, but it's still frightening when it does.Good, low-key performances by all, with a truly eerie one by the child actress portraying, who carries the story.This DVD was viewed as a rental and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
144,BoredNow33,Sequel Writers Beware!,4,5 August 2018,"Did Mike Flanagan & Jeff Howard even watch the first movie? I originally gave this movie a rating of 7. I thought Lulu Wilson was spectacular and creepy. It was an original story and did have some nice creepy moments. Then I made the mistake of watching the first movie. So many inaccuracies from one movie to the next. Origin took place in 1967 as spelled out on the screen. The original movie said the pictures where from the 40s or 50s. The story in the paper in the original stated Doris was 10. In Origin, she specifically told the priest she was 9. In the original, the girls were much closer in age in the pictures. In Origin, they were at least 6 years apart. In the original, ""Paulina"" claims her mother was the one forcing Doris to let the spirits in and who sewed Doris' mouth shut. In Origin, ""Lina"" sewed Doris' mouth shut and her mother had nothing to do with the spirits invading Doris. Pauline says in the original movie ""Maybe there is more than one spirit"", but we know from Origin there were many spirits, all of the people tortured by the doctor. Again, did the writers of Origin watch the original movie? One other gripe I have: I hate, hate, hate when the vengeful spirits are the victims of someone else. If they themselves were victims of this horrible doctor, why would they then go on to hurt this little girl and her family? Why wouldn't it have been the doctor or the other spirits Marcus had referred to in his writing? That line never makes sense to me. Oh, I was hurt in my life so now I am going to hurt others after I am dead? Bad choice.Bottom line, don't make a prequel / sequel if it has no bearing on the original. I changed my rating to a 4.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
145,Fiurilli,A mixed bag,5,31 October 2016,"The Ouija board has been a staple in the horror genre dating all the way back to 1944 when the very first horror movie featuring this spiritual boardgame was released. The premise is almost always very simple, a group of people get together and, sometimes as a joke, use the Ouija board to get in contact with the afterlife. The Ouija board however has a small set of rules one must abide by in order to play without any troubles. More often than not these rules are broken and as a result one of the players becomes possessed with an evil spirit. 'Ouija: Origin of Evil', directed by Mike Flanagan, follows a similar premise and has a story centered around a small family consisting of a widowed mother and her two daughters. By means of an Ouija board the family tries get into contact with their father who passed away a few years ago. What they don't know is that they unwittingly invite pure evil into their homes causing the youngest daughter to be overtaken by a merciless spirit. A problem with the story of 'Ouija: Origin of Evil' is its predictableness. If you've ever seen a horror movie and more specifically one featuring an Ouija board then you have pretty much already seen this movie. Every side characters is pretty much disposable and the major plot twists never appear as a surprise. The horror side of the movie is also very hit or miss. There are some very well done psychological horror moments that definitely create an eerie feeling and the sense of tension is often times extremely high. Sadly the many predictable jumpscares present in the second half of the movie do not manage to capitalize on this and quite often have an almost jarring effect that can pull one out of the movie. Mixed in are also some minor attempts at gore horror which felt extremely misplaced.The movie starts out a little slower than most horror style movies as it really takes its time to set up most of its characters. A lot of times this was done through conversations characters had with one another by dropping a lot of not so subtle hints at their past. This heavy use of expositional dialogue is extremely blatant, however unlike most horror style movies it isn't crammed into a mere five minutes. The movie really takes its time to at least try and get the audience invested into the characters before moving on to the spooky part of the story. It fails to execute this properly considering the family as a whole does not feel genuine whatsoever. The mother Alice and the oldest daughter Lina never actually seems to care about their family and these characters are ultimately extremely forgettable. By far the best acting amongst the main cast comes from the eleven year old actress Lulu Wilson in portraying the youngest daughter Doris. Her character definitely conveys a great sense of creepiness that really adds to the horror vibe in this film. All in all 'Ouija: Origin of Evil' is a mixed bag. The horror moments are extremely hit or miss, the acting overall isn't very good and the story is extremely predictable however with low expectations this one is definitely fun to watch.My rating: 5/10",Ouija - Origin of Evil
146,benjaminryder-45940,Better Than The First,6,16 July 2019,"It's rare to find a sequel that surpasses the first these days, but Ouija: Origin of Evil manages to just that. Not that it was a very tough feat considering the original was one of the most lame-brained movies I've seen in a while, but Origin of Evil improves upon its predecessor tenfold - just not enough to make it really worthwhile.It's obvious that Mike Flannigan is on his way to becoming one of our true masters of horror, but this film seems more like a paycheck movie for him and it shows. He does the best he can with the tepid material, but ends up using the old ""distorted faces/mouths with rolled back eyes"" effect a few too many times and it quickly becomes tedious.Like all of Flannigan's films, it's wonderfully well cast and beautifully put together. I just wish they'd spent a little bit more time with the script. You might be better off watching Flannigan's Hush, Absentia, Gerald's Game, Occulus, or The Haunting of Hill House.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

152,vsd324,So why did I like this one? All I can say is I was entertained. Maybe I'll have to ask a Ouija board..... Good-bye,7,28 October 2017,"I'm going to start by admitting I shouldn't like this movie as much as I did. It's cliché in so many ways. They use the loud orchestral pops to make you jump throughout the movie, but while cheap I found many to be chilling. The PG-13 rating took away from some of the scenes. I'm not look for gratuitous gore, but some of what occurred in the movie was simply too clean to believe what was happening. The premise of the movie is a mother of two makes a living as a psychic medium. She uses various mechanisms to put on a believable show so that she can ""provide peace"" for the families who come to see her. After deciding to add a Ouija board to her business for added effect. After her younger daughter begins playing with the Ouija board, the daughter seems to gain the gift of being able to do what her mother only pretended to do for her clients. And that's where business picks up. The movie was corny throughout, and the effects were low grade. You could practically see where the harnesses were attached when bodies were thrown about. The ending was rather clunky and sudden. I guess I generally like movies involving the Ouija board. Although it's not inherent as I wasn't crazy about the movie ""Ouija"" (2014), the movie for which this movie is a prequel. But I loved the movie ""Witchboard""(1986) and it's sequel ""Witchboard 2"" (1992). So why did I like this one? All I can say is I was entertained. Maybe I'll have to ask a Ouija board.....

155,urbanlegend23,Huge improvement on its predecessor.,7,5 October 2017,"""Ouija"" was poorly executed and badly received, and is generally regarded as one of 2014's worst films, so it's hard to imagine anyone eagerly lining up around the block for a follow-up film. As it turns out, the prequel ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" is a massive improvement on its predecessor.Talented director Mike Flanagan – confirming his status as the latest horror maestro by adding this to his 2016 output alongside ""Hush"" and ""Before I Wake"" – has been brought in to class up the proceedings and he succeeds admirably. Flanagan captures the look and feel of 1967 Los Angeles and adds a number of neat visual throwbacks and details (such as Universal's 1963–90 logo that opens the film). ""Origin of Evil"" also has more on its mind than might be expected, raising some interesting ideas around the issues of faith, belief and the existence of an after-life, mainly via protagonist Alice (Elizabeth Reaser), and most effectively when it examines with her belief that the supernatural force in her home is her husband attempting contact from beyond the grave.The film has a number of effective frights, with the scene where Doris (Lulu Wilson) first sees a ghostly apparition through the Ouija's planchette probably being the best jump-scare. Wilson also brilliantly delivers a monologue to her sister's boyfriend about being strangled to death, an utterly chilling moment and, thanks to Wilson, one of the stand-out scenes of the film. It's also nice to see Annalise Basso back in another Mike Flanagan film, after she showed such promise in the brilliant ""Oculus"".Unfortunately ""Origin of Evil"" goes a bit off the rails in the final act. Up to this point, much of the film thrives on how the haunting plays into the family dynamic and the feelings of the characters, but this is abandoned in favor of a seen-it-all-before haunted house explanation which feels over-the-top for this particular story. The depiction of Doris' possession also becomes a bit stereotypical as the film goes on. She spider-walks up the side of a wall, stretches her mouth to inhuman lengths, whispers malevolently in the ears of other charactersall things that feel old hat (and aren't always visually convincing), unlike the aforementioned monologue scene. Ultimately it feels like ""Origin of Evil"" succumbs to typical supernatural-horror excess, making it only two-thirds a great film, and overall simply a quite good one. But for a follow-up to such a dreadful first entry into the franchise, this film is far better than anyone had a right to expect.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

157,ozyhmandias792,The Origin of Evil,6,18 December 2016,"This movie is positively impressing. The setting reminds of ""Insidious"", occasionally, even if ""Ouija"" does not appear to be as original and entertaining. The first hour of the movie is honestly remarkable : we are given a complete background of the main characters and the atmosphere is adequately prepared for the expectable final action-sequence. In the first section of the movie the narrative elements combine in perfect proportion : thrill, realism, humor, drama, they all build an absolutely convincing plot. But then action comes and all falls down to pieces. As a matter of fact, after the first 60 minutes the movie seems anxious to run too quickly towards a very confusing conclusion. The dosage of CGI is reduced but shows a cheap quality; concerning the end, as I said, too many elements (cliches and attempts of originality) which do not assemble organically are brought on the screen all of a sudden, at the same time. This contributes to creating the sensation that it took less then 20 minutes to shatter a promising work of horror, cautiously built in over one long hour.

159,HenbaineAccount2,Ouija- Origin of a lazy copy,4,11 April 2017,"Sorry but I honestly do not understand the 10/10 reviews for this movie. In fact I think my 4 is begin a tad over generous. Let me explain why..I'll begin with the good bits.. 1. the score is pretty nice, ambient but eery and a bit sad. 2. Some of the effects are pretty creepy, especially where the possession starts to fully show. 3. There is some good suspense to be had a few nail bite moments especially as it all gets a bit crazy toward the end with a possession free for all going on. 4. The young lady playing Doris shines in this movie, very talented despite being given a painfully clichéd creepy child role, she is superb. 5. The ending was a surprise, but that's probably as I haven't bothered watching ""Ouija"" due to very bad reviews. 5. The actress playing Lina has her moments also as a promising actress. 6 Character dynamics and interactions have some genuinely believable moments. The not so good bits..1. This type of story is beyond exhausted. They try to twist it with the whole "" we can make our readings more - real with this board"" but it's not enough 2. dead parent, creepy kid, bitchy rebellious teen kid, dead parent and strong but unravel parent. 3. A creepy new fad appears and things go all eery. People get possessed, people get killed and then more people get killed- no real reason as to why these spirits are killing a whole family. 4. No real closure as to what the ""other"" things with Markus are 5. The families general reaction to hanging teenager in their stairway & their dead kid/sibling is way too nonplused. I mean you kill your sister happily then come round not giving a hoot.. but freak out only when you kill your mother. 6. Given that the dynamics and interactions have such believable moments , the chronic underacting near the end just makes me frustrated. 7. The mother is seriously irritating throughout.And exploiting your child, top parenting, how does no one step in knowing her kid is skipping school to ""work"" with her? 8. Dialogue begins to drift into cliché territory near the end as do all the effects, it's just like watching a rip of the Exorcist mixed with other known themes... 9. The end just appears so suddenly. I hate it when movies begin to show promise then just race to an ending. It just escalates un naturally fast for my liking, I mean really the kid does what like 2 readings, writes loads of junk in polish then mass murders and possesses people in a couple of days if that? 10. Daddy sews up doll mouths to stop ""the voices"" was he alive/dead when he did this? and why so suddenly, I mean if these things have been in the house so long, the mother and her kids do ""readings"" all the time why suddenly does it take this kid turning out to be some insane conduit medium out of nowhere? Surely she'd have shown signs sooner? surely they would have had weird things happen sooner? Too many plot holes in this movie which is a shame as it does have promise but the lazy approach tarnishes it's ideal.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

165,Alex-Siddhi,A retro horror based on the infamous Ouija Board,5,24 October 2016,"A retro prequel to the 2014 horror film based on the infamous Ouija board. This film explores the place that has a fine line between our reality and 'the other side'.It focuses on a family of 1 single woman with 2 daughters and she is a fake medium pretending to communicate with the dead and justifying her cause by giving people 'closure' until of course they discover the Ouija board and learn of its powers and their own compatibility with it.I didn't feel as though these characters were very deep or unique, you have the single strong caring mother, the rebellious older daughter and the young innocent carefree daughter who because of her age is not the slightest bit phased by an entity from another realm. And then the two supporting roles who are a priest and the daughter's polite and shallow boyfriend.The relationships between all of these characters was limited, and the boundaries were rarely touched upon, whereas in groundbreaking memorable horrors these boundaries are always pushed and twisted which is what ties the story up in fascinating knots. The only reason I felt like the characters had interactions with each other was to mildly further the plot but not develop characters or to keep us curious and/or intrigued.The themes of this horror are the fears of not being safe in your own home, fear of the your loved ones in danger, possession and evil spirits with evil intentions. Obviously you have the board in this movie which connects us with other beings but it is when something inevitably goes wrong and channels through the youngest daughter that we experience the true nature of what lurks on the other side. One thing I can say is we witness an exceptional performance from Lulu Wilson as Doris the young girl as she goes through the changes, she is very intimidating. However the CGI of her possession and the demon appearing occasionally were more comical than menacing. And the over amplified and boosted demonic voice does not compare to the classics like The Exorcist.This film has a good genuine concept but lacks originality and never quite peaked at any time throughout, it has potential but rather than explore the world of the supernatural it sticks to the jump scares, tense cutting and ordinary horror soundtrack.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

I was pleasantly surprised to find that this movie was one of Flanagan's better pieces along with Oculus and Hush.The film itself was a pretty masterful period piece, with excellent costumes and sets and lines that helped you place the time period without a big date sprawling across the screen at the opening. Seriously, the costumes were so good. Although some of the lines hit you over the head with the whole ""we are in the '60s"" deal, it wasn't cheesy or over-the-top.The child acting was pretty good, particularly from Annalise Basso who I was excited to see again after her performance in Oculus. LuLu Wilson was also exceedingly creepy in plenty of parts. I was very pleased with the amount of creep factor, especially from a PG-13 movie which usually rely on cheap scares (example: this movie's predecessor).Where this movie fell flat for me was the actual demon/ghoul/monster story. I wish they would have kept the ghoul as a fleeting figure instead of full-on showing them fairly early on in the movie. It's so much scarier to let your imagination go wild instead of seeing a digitized monster. Maybe it will be scary for the teens who go to see this film, but it took the scare factor down a notch for me. The origin story for the demon seemed a little forced and rushed towards the end, and I think choosing a less complicated origin might have made the movie run a little smoother. However, the ending was pretty good and it was an overall thrilling theater experience.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

She could be another/the next Dakota Fanning.The priest looked a lot like my pastor, like in his facial expression. He was also very stimulating, interesting, kind, and smart. He had a good hold of his acting. He helped ""hold down the fort"" in the movie.I also liked the older sister and mother, the other remaining main characters. They were sweet and caring.It was interesting when we saw a demon instead of the father.

Was the film itself nicely done? Yes. I liked the cast, the acting wasn't bad;they actually looked like ""real people."" But the cliché where the little girl happens to know more than everyone else about the evil spirit, she becomes possessed and it becomes like every other attempt at an exorcism film.

Or a city ! Even a country! So the audience feel the chill! Because now everyone feels it only happened to one family one house, one city... but when it's an epidemic it gives it a more sense of helplessness! Make the horror movies something bigger than a family's problem! Moreover, when it's the kids that are affected, it's not really scary it's more of a kids movie not for adults! There was no story development, no character build! Even the demon himself is not described well!!

174,smcdonald-23418,I had nightmares about Doris,9,29 January 2017,"I love supernatural horror, particularly ones with creepy wee children in them. Alas, pretty much every single film that's been out in recent years has been predictable, samey and actually not remotely scary. Ouija: Origin of Evil breaks the mold here, as it has good twists to its tale, is filmed a bit differently with good effects, and actually succeeded in frightening me.The child actress who plays Doris, is great! She is genuinely chilling! As a character, Doris avoids falling into the 'irritating child' bracket that befalls so many kiddie characters, and as such, is really scary. There are a couple of jumpy scares, but mainly, it's the continual feeling of dread surrounding the Horror That Is Doris that drives the film. When the twists start to come at the end, they are really quite horrible and offer a great explanation as to why this house/family are under attack. The ending is absolutely great, and avoids terrible Hollywood clichés.In short, this film is great fun. both my partner and I couldn't sleep afterwards! I had a terrible nightmare about Doris, actually. To me, if a scary film gives me a nightmare, I know it's a winner! :-)",Ouija - Origin of Evil

It starts with an idea that's not often exploited, by letting us into the daily life of a con artist 'medium' in the late 60's, and slowly builds up from the moment the Ouija board is introduced. Then it starts to gently derail, completely missing great opportunities to build an original ambiance and falling back to generic, obvious jump scares. The last part of the movie is a total botch, with a short-cut plot exposition which introduces all the clichés you could expect, up to the very end.

This movie is not a terrible piece of garbage, but it is boring, not very creepy, not very frightening and barely has much tension. It is PG-13 and don't expect much gore. Being PG-13 is no excuse for not building tension, not playing with the viewers minds and simply not being creative. Expect to wait about 45 minutes before anything creepy even really happens and then even when it does, barely flinching. A few jump scares happen but they're expected every time and have little effect. Then expect the story to fall apart quickly and the ending to be stupid. All of this would be fine if the ending were terrifying but it's mediocre, cliché and worst of all, boring. I was deeply disappointed. Wait till you can watch it on Netflix, don't waste 20$ like me and my gf did.

But the killer for me was the reactions to some terrible situations that were so poorly directed I said to my wife multiple times, did that just happen? Because they don't seem to be that worried about it. Many people (myself included) have tried a Ouija board, so can probably relate to the movie more than other horrors, maybe that is why people think it is better than it actually is.

182,imnosferatu,Ouija: Origin of Evil by I.M. Nosferatu #Nosferreview,8,2 December 2019,"I know evil. I know it when I see it. I know it when I hear it. I know it when I touch it, taste it, and smell it...you get the picture. And let me tell you, it was no damn coincidence that my parents dropped the moniker I. M. Nosferatu on me - they tell me that it was because I had such an otherworldly scream right out of the womb. But I digress...Suffice it to say, I've always accepted that I'm evil incarnate; and with that comes a certain responsibility - a responsibility to filter out the real deals from the hoaxes when it comes to the wicked, the malevolent, the vile, and most anything related to the spirit world. So when I hear that so-called scientists - you know, the namby-pambys in the white coats with all their degrees hammered on the walls - spew their ""facts"" that a Ouija board is fake, phony, or otherwise just a party game for pre-pubescent teeny boppers wearing p.j.s and telling ghost stories in mommy's basement, I get angry. Fever pitch angry. And I see red. Do they really believe that the planchette (for those of you who haven't had the pleasure, a planchette is the triangular-shaped pointer on the Ouija board) only moves because of ""the unconscious movements of those controlling it"" - some obnoxious phenomenon they call the ""ideomotor effect""? Sounds more like the idiotic effect if you ask me, and that's just plain b.s. According to the rest of us nefarious folk - and we run in packs of thousands, mind you - the Ouija is a portal to the spirit world. It's not all freak and fear though - because it can be used for both evil and good (not that I'm a fan of the latter). Just google away and you'll find thousands of horrific stories - everything from raising the dead to demonic possession. If you don't believe me, I have my own Ouija and talk to the dead all the time - come on over for a visit and we'll have quite the night - Krugerian level fun to be had.But for those of you who just want your jollies vicariously, Ouija: Origin of Evil is a fairly sick flick. And certainly it's ill-er than its predecessor, Ouija. Does it merit that Kugerian level of a visit to my house or even an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes? I have to say, it's not Ripper smooth for hardcore horror, paranormal, or occult fans, but I can see where the muggle population would be more accepting (and forgiving) of its flaws. Certainly Hasbro is happy that the public likes one of its movies for a change and I'm certain Ouija board sales will spike no matter what the inherent risks of its use may be.Ouija: Origin of Evil is a period piece, taking place in Los Angeles circa 1965 depending on which source you use. Single mother Alice Zander, played by veteran horror actress Elizabeth Reaser (the hot mama Esme Cullen from the Twilight franchise), scrapes by making a living and raising her two daughters by scamming muggles who want to talk to their dear departed ones. Her daughters Doris Zander (Lulu Wilson from Annabelle 2 and Deliver Us from Evil) and Lina Zander (from Oculus) are willing participants in the scam and actively take part in the séance shenanigans that serves as window dressing for the gullible muggles.Alice decides to turn up the heat with some Ouija board action. Little Doris takes to the board like a maggot on a dead carcass. The next thing you know, it's the scene out of Ghost where Whoopi Goldberg finds out she has the shine. It seems Alice's mother was a ""real"" clairvoyant and just maybe the gene skipped to Little Doris. (I kid you not; that's right out of the script). Demonic possession (you can always tell victims of demonic possession by the pure white contact lenses they wear) occurs and all hell breaks loose - literally. It was nice to see how Henry Thomas (Elliot from E.T.) has grown into manhood and plays the sympathetic and rather naïve Father Tom Hogan.At its best, Ouija: Origin of Evil is a slow build to a somewhat predictable and milk-toasty climax. At its worst, for diehard, uncompromising horror aficionados like myself, it's totally derivative and like E.T. following the Reese's Pieces, one can see the trail and trappings of past horror classics. Doris Zander, for example, is but a toned-down Linda Blair-clone, sans the head spin and pea soup. While Henry Thomas made a credible performance as the requisite faith-plagued Irish Catholic Priest, he certainly was no Jason Miller or Max Von Sydow. There are elements of Poltergeist including a house buried over the dead. And speaking of Ouija boards and their cinematic use, The Exorcist was one of the first films to introduce the Ouija as a possible portal to the spirit world. From there, the cult classic Witchboard starring White Snake's main squeeze at the time, Tawny Kitaen, forever established the Ouija board as an instrument of evil. That film was totally sick, Ripper smooth, and gets my I.M. Nosferatu Medal of Honor. Special bites in that film must go to Kathleen Wilhoite as the wacky psychic, Zarabeth.But enough about Witchboard. This movie was written by Mike Flanagan and Jeff Howard. Despite its limitations, Flanagan's excellent direction raised it above the usual genre fare. Having previously directed Hush, Oculus, and Absentia to name a few, he's developing a real John Carpenter-esque style which I, for one, am certainly looking forward to seeing how it develops in future projects.On the Krugerian scale of horror, Ouija: Origin of Evil is a thin layer of ectoplasm compared to the thick viscosity of these other horror films. But while Ouija is no Witchboard, it's better than watching reruns of Ghost Hunters.",Ouija - Origin of Evil

This one takes the lead with no competition in sight. Still, as with so many horror and thrillers recently, the ending lacked conviction. Not only that, but when the story starts unfolding you might find yourself rolling your eyes to the same clichéd jump scares, dialog and story telling.That said, this definitely deserves a viewing.

We are all used to see Japanese girls whose pale faces semi-covered with long-dark-hairs, this time a nice looking 9 year old blonde cutie turns out to be a white- eyed demonic creature whispering into people's ears.There was no really bloody scene but reaching to the end you find yourselves wishing that house burn and the movie end understanding that there is no way for that family to be normal again.

194,oscarvaladez12,Let me Tell Your Fate,7,3 August 2017,"Mike Flanagan has been a director to watch since his film ""Oculus"" with his Netflix movie ""Hush"" he really gave a sense to the way he directs suspense/horror movies. With Ouija: Origin of Evil he beautifully displays yet again why he is one of the best horror movie directors working today.With today's modern horror I can see why audiences find O.O.E. hardly scary at all. No jump scares, not graphic, not gory. Which is what I think to be the downfall of movie goers these days, and I cant blame them. Over and over we anticipate scary movies to be so over the top, that when a movie like Ouija comes we push aside because it didn't meet those standards of silliness. Mike Flanagan way of creating fear is by simply placing it on the screen. it is completely silent, the way it would be at your house when you think you see something in the shadows, or you hear a bump in the night. There is no loud music, no dumb jump scare to a cat popping out of the cabinet. The fear is just THERE.another credit to the director is the way he chose to direct it. The movie takes place in the 60's and boy does he really make you feel like you are in that time era. Not only with the clothes or the cars, but the way the movie is. How the title of the movie just appears on the screen with the old school font title at the bottom, to the ""cigarette"" burns you see at the top right corner of the screen as if it signals to change the reel of the film. You even see a jump in the screen as if it were really changed! All the little details to this movie is down to flawless.The acting across the board is great, with a standout performance by Lulu Wilson playing Doris. Be on the lookout for her in future films. the way she is able to deliver lines in the most bone chilling way, literally makes you quiver. ""want to know what it feels like to be strangled to death?"" Absolutely frightening!I definitely recommend this film, as it not only surpasses its the first one that was trash, but shows a new way of horror. Go in with a open mind and enjoy the film.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
195,corinne-boman,Partly scary and unnerving but in the end lacks of depth,4,23 October 2016,"Surprisingly this sequel is actually better then the first Ouija, and I was excited about Mike Flanagan directing it too after making excellent horror movies like Oculus and Hush. The movie has a nice beginning, with a story and characters that feels pretty well, together with a good pace. It doesn't feel too slow or too rushed. Flanagan has some interesting and original takes on how to scare and thrill his audience, but I can't help but to feel like the background story and depth of the movie fell flat in the end.Unlike Oculus, where the background story and nature of the horror elements felt very throughout and tied together, the plot and reason behind Ouija 2 instead felt like an random excuse just so they could make a creepy movie about an Ouija Board. In 5 minutes you get a very compressed story about a evil Nazi doctor who experimented on humans during WW2, and that he continued his horrific and occult torture after fleeing to the US, in the very house they (the main characters) live in. The spirits of the tortured and murdered people then haunts the house and eventually takes their chance to possess the little sister, but the motive is unclear. It's also not obvious if the possession is done by the evil doctor or by the spirits, since you get no information of what happens to him. In some cases it's more interesting not knowing the motive behind the ghost or demon, or that it doesn't have any reason but to torture and hurt humans (like in Oculus). But this movie really needed a story with depth and complexity.In addition, the scares didn't really do it for me. I do realise that it's highly individual what is considered scary, but things like creepy kids and dragged out mouths have been done a bit too many times. The movie had scenes that did surprise and make me a bit unnerved, I will give it that.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
196,cynth_alvarado,Do not watch The Ouija before this,6,26 October 2016,If you have never seen the movie The Ouija then your in the clear. But if you have seen the movie then while your watching this one you will know the ending before it even gets near. The story itself is entertaining and the acting is superb. The little girl in the movie makes the whole story believable and downright freaky. The special effects were not cheesy which is a major plus unlike the Conjuring 2. The casting agency did a great job putting together a wonderful cast that delivered the story well. The only issue about prequels like this is knowing the ending and not being excited for it.

197,aprilfrancesleitner,Annoying and not particularly scary.,5,22 October 2016,"I was actually really annoyed by this movie, but I'm the sort of person that rolls my eyes at a jump scare (this gives you an indication of what sort of movie this might be). It was a CGI driven, Amityville Horror-esque story which wasn't particularly inventive and definitely not new. I think in order to work a horror movie has to have a surmountable obstacle (for if our heroes can't defeat the obstacle and there's no hope of a victory, then what's the point?) This movie had no victors and no satisfying resolution. I saw this movie in a cinema full of teenage girls that screamed at every jump scare, which got very irritating after the first hour or so. Really? Are jump scares that terrifying? It made me sad that these are the sorts of thrillers being dished out to this generation. None of the thrills in this movie are psychological. Additionally, I'm not sure how many times I've seen the motif of the mouth being sewn up. That's not scary anymore. And I'm sick to death of heavily made-up monsters being shown on the screen. When will filmmakers realise that what we can't see is more terrifying than what we can?Bleurgh. You might get something out of it, but hire it at home.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
198,filmornothing,decent but not memorable,6,8 November 2016,"Upon seeing Flanagan's 'Ouija', it pales in comparison to his previous two entries 'Hush' and 'Oculus'. Although they are all exercised in atmospheric elements,'Ouija' seemed rather tamed. Some decent scary moments, but seasoned horror aficionados would be blunt to its anticipation. The cinematography is made to reflect the period in which the story is set in, with blotches appearing on screen occasionally to look like degradation seen on film but sometimes feels contrived. Visually some of the shots are reminisce of a James Wan movie. Not without its merits, the first half of the movie sets up its characters for the audiences to sympathize with and care about in their times of distress. It is well acted, especially the young girl who has to carry the element that drives the plot forward. The film is aware of make-believe, with doubts slowly descending into something more sinister.

But it suprised me. The whole mood, and the atmosphere of the film was really great, and there were some very well placed jumpscares, and some nice twists in the story as well. Around the end of the movie, the story got a little hard to follow (for me at least), and some of the previously mentioned good jumpscares were reused several times, so for the 2nd, or 3th time, they were not as great as for first.
After all, I think, it was a pretty enjoyable movie, with good visuals, sounds, and story.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
202,jcwestgate71,"Sadly, not scary",5,13 August 2018,I enjoyed the movie but I really wanted it to be scary. It seemed to have potential but sadly? It's as scary as a Road Runner cartoon. Glad to see Eliot from E.T. is still getting work. In a nutshell... Lame,Ouija - Origin of Evil
203,vvandenbergen,Ratings given are too low,8,4 January 2021,"Even though it resembles the last Ouija movie from 2014, the storyline is not predictable and actually surprisingly interesting. The movie keeps you interested until the last minute and the ending is not predictable. Definitely worth an 8.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
204,aztony33,Not scary one bit,3,26 June 2018,I'm sorry but I felt the acting in this movie was just terrible. The acting and the script made the overall movie more laughable than scary.,Ouija - Origin of Evil
205,doublerb,Watch something else.,3,1 April 2017,"This movie is phenomenal if you consider, cliché and horror stereotypes some sort of revelation. Unlike Lights Out (that had a few elements of originality)'Ouija: Origin of Evil' follows a Mother who is running a scam fortune telling business and her two daughters who lost their dad recently. The reason I bothered to mention their dad died recently is because they mention his departure a lot, in every scene in fact. Just in case the audience forgot. The beauty of this film is that you don't have to retain any information from the previous scene because they just blurt out exposition during any moment of plot development anyway. The acting is OKAY but it's pathetic character arcs and the character's non existent personalities give the actors little to work with.I'd recommend Conjuring 2 before i'd even remotely consider recommending this crock of crap. I genuinely found myself laughing of bordem during this film especially since the mother's source of the Ouija board was at a Cafe/Diner and people's reactions to some of the events in the film were over the top on some of the minor character's behalves. all and all just about every element of this film was a let down, from the screenplay to the direction and the fact that the film is even remotely being praised because of it's homage to it's cigarette burn on the film and opening title card featuring roman numerals is not enough to redeem this disappointment in film form.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
206,ewmon-hickey,Average demonic possession film,5,26 December 2017,"Pretty much what it says on the tin. I haven't seen the original so have no frame of reference, but this film was bland in a lot of aspects. Characters had little interesting going on, there were plot details that didn't seem to go anywhere and some inconsistencies in the films internal logic.What the film did well was that the overall story had interesting direction and some surprises, and the low number of jump scares was refreshing. The film tries to use bits of monster horror, dread and a little body horror for its frights, only sometimes effective.Overall a distinctly middle of the pack film that lives up to what it promises, but doesn't impress.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
207,methegemini,Evil spirits haunted a family.,3,30 October 2016,"Film has a history as it is directed many times before. This time, it was directed to make it a good one as compared to its previous versions. Its cinematography was fine. Dialogues were strong. Recently seen this film. The film has few scenes of interest. As father comes and told the history of spirits to family, he told facts behind it and gave a solution like to call the Vatican Priests for exorcism. At that point i was excited because the scenes of exorcism brings some horror to the films. Story and screen play were going smooth before father become hunted by the bad spirits and he attacks on the helpless family. That was the weakest turn in the film. Moreover, the story ends without any moral outcome. It is unfinished. It was a Halloween special film. Its rating is fine as compared to its production. As compared to classical horrors like: Devils, Exorcist, Evil Dead and Nightmare etc., this film is bellow average. It would be a memorable product if a proper focus would be on horror contents. Over all film is average.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
208,vit_con,Surprisingly Entertaining.,8,1 November 2016,"I went to see the movie without watching the trailer or reading anything about it first. I watched the first one though, didn't like it. So I didn't expect much from this one. However, to my surprise, the movie was very enjoyable. I specifically liked it because my family had experienced things similar to the story told in this movie, just not as dramatic. My mom played the Ouija game after my dad passed away trying to contact him out of grief, and we (my mom, my siblings, and myself) believed we were able to contact him for a long time until things got weirder. Good thing is my mom stopped playing the game shortly after we found out someone else was pretending to be my dad.So as I watched the movie with my sister, we felt like we were living that part of our past again. It has been almost 20 years since then, but thanks to the movie for bringing back old memories :)Because of our personal experiences, we found the movie believable. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to see a creepy and not so cliché horror movie.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
209,wimpel,Appalling... in the worst way.,1,21 December 2016,"First of all, let me state that I do not consider myself a hardcore horror connaisseur, but I do like to think that I can spot a pile of sh*te when I see one. And boy is this movie a massive sh*tepile!Also, I don't ever do reviews. But I feel like have to step in here.I saw HUSH, it was okay... I saw OCULUS, it was bad... But this one... man oh man... The real horror about this movie is that it manages to score 6.2 on here and even get some good reviews.It is obvious that Mike Flanagan has seen all the James Wan horror flicks. It is also obvious that Mr. Flanagan does not understand what makes these movies good.To make things easy, let's start with the good: - The oldest daughter (Annalise Basso) was pretty convincing (up until the end) - Her boyfriend (Parker Mack) looked like a young Patrick Wilson and wasn't horrible nor important. - ... Nope, that's about it. Other characters: - The mom was bland and boring. Also, more than once the camera stayed on her for too long for her to stay in character - The priest was okay but unnecessary - The youngest daughter wasn't good, but hey, she's young. Even worse was her CGI mouth, though. Flanagan must've thought this looked amazing because we only saw like seven random jump scares with the girl's CGI mouth open wide... - Ghost daddy... why?? what?!The writing is horrible as there are far too many dialogues in which the characters lay out their entire backstory in the most uninteresting way e.g. we don't need to know that the girls' grandmother was a fortune teller.The pacing was incredibly slow. There's one scene in which the girls are alone in the house, which could have been a tense sequence. Instead we see some teenage couple shenanigans and a really tiresome dinner date of two widowed adults. The only purpose being that we know the priest lost his wife and we can move on to the seance scene...Almost every moment of this movie felt like I'd seen it somewhere before only slightly/a lot better: - The 60s feel from ""The Conjuring"" - The medium hoax setup - The black monsters from ""Insidious"" - The gaping CGI mouth from 100 movies - The pupil-less eyeballs - The slingshot scene - The lips sewn together - The jump scare cliffhanger before the credits - The girl saying ""it seems really dumb to split up"" - The fact that they do split up even after the girl said the previous... Almost all of it is a badly rip off from another (or 10 different) movie(s).ALMOST! The one thing that was a first for me was the ""plot"". If I understand correctly, the family is being terrorized and eventually killed off by an angry mob of Polish Jew ghosts? The priest explains that the ghost possessing the little girl was (a) rescued from a concentration camp by allied soldiers (b) brought back to America only to (c) be kidnapped buy some crazy Nazi doctor who experiments on Jews in a basement in an American suburb... These experiments primarily being your typical torture stuff(?) like sewing mouths shut, cutting vocal cords, cutting in general...Oh and then the priest drops something along the lines of ""but there was something else in the darkness, something that had never been human to begin with""... So demons? Do you mean demons, priests? Can you tell us more about those inhuman fiends please?! No? Oh... you want to keep the focus on the Polish Jew ghosts? Oh, OK... So don't torture Jews or they will possess innocent kids and slaughter families? That's not a weird moral at all...So... don't spend money on this. Please don't. I haven't seen the other Ouija movies... but if this is the best one as stated by a reviewer before me, I will stay as far away from them as possible.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
210,bleebarn-77675,A Return to Timeless Horror,8,20 October 2016,"Ouija: Origin of Evil is a swingin' sixties prequel to the 2014 horror movie and sleeper hit Ouija. Its predecessor has a mere 6% on rotten tomatoes, but had tremendous financial success. The budget was an estimated $5 million, and by December, 2014, the film had grossed almost $51 million. Obviously, the next step is to plan a sequel.I was fortunate enough to attend a pre-screening. Basing my expectations off the 2014 Ouija, I was ready to be bored and disappointed. Boy was I in for a surprise.The film opens with a mother and her two daughters performing a scam séance for a grieving man and his skeptical daughter. The first part of the film delivers a steady stream of laughs and starts on a light-hearted note. This mood only continues when the oldest daughter Lina (Annalise Basso) sneaks out, looking suitably 60's, and plays with a ouija board along with her friends. Then things, as they often do in horror movies, turn for the worst. In an effort to spice up their séance scam, Lina's mother Alice (Elizabeth Reaser) buys a ouija board. Doing so then causes the youngest girl, Doris (Lulu Wilson) to become possessed, no surprises here.What happens next, however, is one of the scariest horror movies made in a while– but when the director and writer is Mike Flanagan, you expect nothing less. Flanagan, director and writer for films such as Hush, Oculus, and Absentia, knows what he's doing. The whole theatre was on the edge of their seats. People shifting to hide their face or cover their ears was a constant sound, and the scares delivered genuine screams. Once the horror starts, the 99 minute film never lets you take a breather.The main person to thank for this is Lulu Wilson, the youngest daughter. This girl is only 11 and she carried the film from start to finish. Her malevolent intensity and purposeful movements made even the toughest members of the audience uncomfortable. To be blunt, she's creepy AF and steals every scene. One in particular involving a basement, hole in the wall, and a menacing Doris standing behind a poor soul comes to mind. To say any more would spoil the movie, but this film has its share of jump scares, unexpected frights, and a delightful retro tone through out. Various moments feel like homages to horror classics of the 60's and 70's. The film will also appeal to fans of recent horror films Oculus and The Conjuring.Another aspect often neglected in horror films is the human aspect. The small rag- tag family is reeling from the lost of a husband and father. The grief feels genuine, as does the hope and tentative joy they feel when the ouija board and Doris seem to be contacting her deceased father. The film is both horrifying and tragic. The ending evokes equal parts screams and empathy for this ailing family.Overall, if you're looking for a fresh horror movie to deliver a punch–you're in luck. Outstanding performances by all the actors, a fantastically creepy little girl, and a retro vibe create a film that will stand the test of horror time.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
211,AdrianRemus,It didn't quite do it for me,2,8 October 2020,"I probably had too many expectations, but the film wasn't quite the right thing for me and I left the movie theater quite disappointed. You could even hear people laughing and yawning in the cinema at some really odd scenes that were supposed to be scary but instead had a humorous effect in the audience. I don't think it brought anything new to the table. It wasn't that scary, it wasn't even psychologically solid or dramatic, and it was full of horror clichés and over-recycled elements. I'm super anti-elitism and I try to find the good parts in so many ""objectively"" bad movies, but in the case of this one I'm just shocked a lot of people gave it a high rating, especially if comparing to so many horror films that came out around that year that were notably better and scarier.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
212,gallarzoabby,Ouija:origin of evil review,8,31 October 2016,""" When you talk to the other side you never know who will be listening."" This seems to be the overall theme with movies about a Ouija board. Similar to the Paranormal Activity series, Ouija: Origin of Evil reveals the events and answers the questions some had when watching the 2014 Ouija movie. The acting was genuine and real, Lulu Wilson who played the possessed little girl, did a rather wicked job as being creepy and as well as staying in character, creating that bone-chilling factor for the movie. With it being rated pg-13 it had a few jump scares, none that were particularly scary to keep you up at night, but to shudder and jump in your seat. With movies that are prequels are either a hit or miss but Ouija definitely delivered making this a must see this Halloween. Giving this movie an 8/10 rating, I leave you with these important rules– if you ever play with a Ouija board: never play alone, never play in a graveyard, and the most important rule always say goodbye.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
213,fernandovelasquez,Better than the first Ouija installment.,8,1 November 2016,"This movie truly captures the curiosity of the Ouija board in the 1970s. The movie highlighted the types of clothing, language and struggles of this period. The Ouija has a story line that is more believable than other scary movies. This is most likely because there have been plenty of horror surrounding the Ouija board since it was created. The Ouija board is a real thing and many real demonic experiences have happened to people. Therefore, there are plenty of scenes that will make you jump and with an ending that surprises its' audience. Finally, a horror movie that isn't predictable or corny and actually terrifying.The stories that you have always heard about are brought to life.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
214,ademk-67099,Awful.,1,15 November 2016,"Went to this movie with a friend in order to scare him a little bit.We came out of the movie laughing both our ***es off because this was pure comedy.I do not understand how anyone would find this scary in any way whatsoever.The only ""Scary"" part might be where one of the actors scream. Loud. VERY LOUD.Other than that noise being a pain in the ear, nothing is scary AT ALL.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.Not even if you're taking a date with you, expecting her to hug you for safety.No.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
215,lucas_m-08117,A cliché start with a strong ending,7,23 October 2018,"The start of the movie is similar to so many other movies of the same overly saturated genre: a family with a single parent, a rebellious teenager and a sweet hearted little girl get in touch with the spirit world. The first half an hour can almost be skipped as it is riddled with clichés: not enough money to pay the bills, daughter sneaking out to see her friends, teenage romance etc. However, after making it past the first half of a pretty uneventful movie, the second part makes up for it. Of course cheap jump scares are being used on a regular basis but the atmosphere of the movie changes entirely and opts for a much darker tone, a direction that succeeds in most parts. Although the plot twist (did Nazi that coming) falls short in the end, the last 20 minutes are a hellish ride of emotions even if a lot of different scenarios are crammed into it. To conclude, this movie starts off very slow, even too slow for a movie of this genre, but then delivers a strong final punch even if the ending feels a little unsatisfying.",Ouija - Origin of Evil
216,munnellyvincent,The Ghost?,6,4 November 2018,I don't understand the ghost. It dosen't look demonic or scary but the movie is creepy. It is a good movie however the demon made me laugh out loud.,Ouija - Origin of Evil
