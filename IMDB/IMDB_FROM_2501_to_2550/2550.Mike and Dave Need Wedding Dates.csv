0,MartinHafer,Occasionally funny...often stupid and crude.,3,30 December 2017,"""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" is occasionally quite funny. However, the humor is also often very, very crude and quite stupid. Whether or not you should see it is really dependent on how much you can tolerate the depths to which this comedy sinks.
Mike and Dave (Adam Devine and Zac Efron) are two obnoxious jerk brothers. They have a pattern of getting drunk and stupid at big family events and ruining everything. So, their parents have laid down the law...the pair will NOT ruin their sister's upcoming wedding. And, to make sure, the parents insist the pair find responsible dates to bring along and keep them under control. Unfortunately, they go about finding dates in the worst possible way...by advertising on Craig's List! Not surprisingly, they soon end up with two even more obnoxious partners (Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick)--who are just using them to get a free trip to Hawaii. And, once there, the girls let it all hang out....and create even more havoc than Mike and Dave usually unleash.Often, the jokes involve folks getting naked or drunk or stoned...or all three. Sophisticated, it is NOT...and it's probably not a film to show your kids, preacher or mother. Low-brow and stupid, actually, now that I think about it.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
1,TheLittleSongbird,Wedding dates? More like a better film and better humour,3,18 October 2017,"Love comedy, there are some great ones out there from every decade and with all kinds of humour (whether it's sophisticated, witty, camp, satirical, dark or vulgar). Silly comedy can be done well, providing it doesn't go overboard. Low-brow comedy is not always done badly, though usually it's my least favourite type of comedy.'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' just didn't do it for me. Can totally understand the mixed critical and audience reaction, especially the many misgivings people have of the film. Seeing as it was based on a true story and have liked some of Aubrey Plaza, Anna Kendrick and Zac Efron's other stuff (even if not a huge fan of either), 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding' had potential to be a halfway decent film. It actually started out on a semi-promising note, with a few sporadically semi-amusing moments, a good set up and it was when the humour and performances didn't go overboard. Then it started to fall apart from the ATV scene and took a turn for the weird halfway through.There are a few good things. The two best performances come from Plaza (though some are going to disagree with this) and Efron. Plaza is in a samey sort of role, but the deadpan nature of it suits her well (though she is best known to me for her work in Seasons 11 and 12 of 'Criminal Minds' as one of the show's best unsubs), the muted indifference and broad farce that critics have picked up on fits with the material and she plays it perfectly.Efron's role is bland, but he does play him straight with a likable charm that was a refreshing counter-balance with the over-acting from most of the rest of the cast. Some of the scenery looks good.However, a lot doesn't work. Kendrick just doesn't fit the material, being better known and more suited to girl-next-door roles, her role requires a broader approach and she is too bland in it and over-compensates in the latter parts of the film. Most of the rest of the cast are underused, and consist of a strange mix of disinterested and overdone. Worst of all are Adam Devine and Sugar Lynn Beard. Devine tries far too hard and comes over as insufferably irritating, especially in the facial expressions and the shouting. Beard constantly sounds like she is on helium and her ""acting"" in the massage scene especially is embarrassing. The chemistry between the actors just isn't there, due to the overacting and mish-mash of acting styles.Can sort of forgive the predictability of the story (the speaker system scene could be seen coming from miles away), can't forgive how disjointed and random it's structured and how everything ends so too-conveniently and resolved in such a hasty manner. The characters may have been intended to be shallow and juvenile, the film however takes this to extremes and makes them mostly without any likable or interesting qualities, only annoying. The only halfway likable character is Dave and he is also bland in development.Soundtrack is forgettable at best and the direction is barely existent. 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' even fails in making Hawaii, one of the world's most beautiful places, look good with some of it looking very straight-to-video quality. A big dishonourable mention in this regard is in the ATV scene, which contains some of the cheapest and worst looking photography and editing for any film seen in any film recently.Biggest problem with 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' is that a vast majority of the time it just isn't funny. A few semi-amusing moments to start with but as said from the ATV scene onward it falls apart where things become increasingly witless and vulgar to the point of being stretched to breaking point. The massage (a particularly distasteful scene that went on too long and should have been cut), sauna, ecstasy and argument in the hotel room scenes induce a mega cringe-factor especially. Too many scenes are also dragged out where severely affects the timing which comes over as limp and the jokes become unfunny consequently.Dialogue has far too much of a vulgar edge to the point a lot of it falls into uncomfortable distaste. Things seemed to take a turn for the downright weird halfway through, with some attempts at seriousness when there are various revelations made that are executed in a forced and seen from a mile off way.In summary, a few decent things are not enough to save a poorly done film on most levels. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
2,bkoganbing,Meet The Stangles,4,4 February 2019,"Yet another movie where the title tells pretty much all. Meet the brothers Stangle, a pair of liquor salesmen. At least in casting Zac Efron and Adam Devine

afterward. These two goofballs both around 30 are being given an ultimatum
with an invitation to their younger sisters wedding. Bring nice respectable
dates and don't embarrass the family by hitting on all the women there.But two partying women Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza hear a free trip to
Hawaii is in the offing and they maneuver an invitation. And these two like
to party as much as the Stangle brothers.All in all an occasionally funny films that leads to the gross. I think everyone
here has been in something better.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
3,SnoopyStyle,low stakes comedy,6,18 December 2016,"Brothers Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave Stangle (Zac Efron) have caused havoc in family get-togethers. His parents (Stephen Root, Stephanie Faracy) confront them about the upcoming wedding of their sister Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard) to fiancé Eric. Jeanie convinces the guys to calm down and get date. They go on Craigslist and later on TV looking for nice girls. Best friends Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) want the free trip to Hawaii but they aren't necessarily nice. Alice is still recovering from being dumped at the wedding altar. Tatiana make up outrageous lies to get the guys.I love everybody in the cast and I root for all of them. They naturally have good chemistry. The premise is pretty low stakes for the foursome. While the cast is game, the writing is not always willing. There are no truly big laughs. There are some chuckle worthy moments. There are enough moments for this likable cast to grab a hold on and squeeze out a workable comedy.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
4,Prismark10,Crash out,2,14 September 2016,"Well if I was Anna Kendrick I would fire my agent.... preferably out of a cannon.I really think this film was greenlit solely on an idea and without a script which was made up as the film went along.Mike (Adam Devine) and his younger brother Dave (Zac Efron) are always causing chaos and embarrass their parents. So they are asked by their parents to bring dates for their sister's wedding in Hawaii which means they will behave themselves. I have no idea why the parents never thought that they might bring two chaotic idiots.This is exactly what happens. After an internet search they meet Tatiana (Audrey Plaza) and Alice (Anna Kendrick) who are two wild party girls who pretend to be respectable and responsible in order to be their wedding dates in Hawaii where they plan to cut loose.The film is just badly structured, it wants to be a bad taste, high jinks film like Neighbours or The Hangover but the script is poor, even boring with a few key set pieces such as the quad bike scene but the actors have to resort to silliness just to pad out the film. There are a few laughs to be had but the film is dreadful, interminable, inconsistent in pace and tone. At least the actors got a trip in Hawaii out of it.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
5,nogodnomasters,Who are those girls?,8,17 October 2017,"Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave (Zac Efron) are brothers who wholesale liquor to bars. They have a propensity to ruin family gatherings. When their sister Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard) is getting married to Eric (Sam Richardson) in Hawaii, they are required to come with dates so they don't go chasing the female guests. They place a Craig's List ad which goes viral. In a subplot Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) and Alice (Anna Kendrick) are cocktail waitresses who like to drink and party too much which has led to their current state of unemployment. They connive a way to look sweet and innocent in order to get a free trip to Hawaii, something Alice really needs. As expected, the girls are too much like their male counterparts.The plot is basically formula. The comedy is at times crude, but tends to rise slightly above the trashy teen sex comedies. Drinking and drug humor is included. A basic fun contemporary comedy hashtag I heart Anne Kendrick.Guide: F-word, sex talk, brief sex scenes, Sugar Lyn Beard nudity with a fake beard.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
6,kosmasp,Family Wedding Crashers,7,12 June 2017,"If you are into political correctness, don't even think about watching this. It has a lot of insults and bad/foul language throughout. And it's not only the male leads who use that language (in case that matters to you). After stating the obvious, let's also point out that this is really silly.Disasters are about to happen and you can see most of them coming from a mile ahead (which might make some wonder why even bother), but the charm of the four lead actors and all the supporting cast, makes this an interesting watch. And if it weren't for the swearing almost a sweat one too.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
7,tavm,Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates was enjoyable for what it was,7,27 July 2016,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend-who had seen this before and enjoyed it-and his nephew. It's quite raunchy and has plenty of current pop culture references which I found quite funny. There's also some slapstick scenes that were also good for some laughs. There were also some touching ones. Zac Efron and Adam Devine and Audrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick fit their roles and do their stuff to mostly good effect. We're told this is based on a true story...sort of. No doubt much of what is on screen is exaggerated for comic effect. This is mainly just the kind of movie just meant to entertain though some lines do make one think of what one's destiny is. Overall, I very much enjoyed Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
8,ComedyFan2010,Hilarious feel good movie,9,19 May 2018,"Looking through reviews I can see that I might be an exception, but I loved the movie. The story is about two brothers who need to find dates for their little sister's Hawaii wedding and make an ad. The two wild girls pretend to be good girls so they are chosen.And it is hilarious all the way through. I was really laughing out loud through most of it. It is not some super clever comedy but it makes one laugh and this is what I need from this kind of movie. We live in a bit of depressing times so it is nice to see this kind of comedy just to relax and laugh.The characters are all great. Fun people, made me remember the good times of living with my best friend and doing crazy things. And of course the fact that the actors are all talented comedians makes it even better.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
9,zardoz-13,Above-Average Hilarity with A Great Cast!!!,7,25 July 2016,"Surprisingly enough, the dames are raunchier than the dudes in the dim-witted, slapstick saga ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,"" with Zac Efron and Adam Devine standing in for the notorious, real-life Stangle brothers. Typically, when a movie advertises itself as ""based on true events,"" audiences are inclined to roll their eyes and prepare for the worst kind of exaggeration. Ostensibly based on their madcap memoir ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates: and a Thousand Cocktails,"" the movie ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" escalates their escapades to the extreme, but freshman director Jake Szymanski and ""Neighbors"" scenarists Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien have apparently captured the gusto of the real-life counterparts. The premise is simple. Father Stangle informs his two trouble-prone offspring that they must bring dates to their sister's wedding because otherwise they have managed to sabotage every previous family function were they showed up alone. According to People as well as Vanity Fair magazines, the guys took their dates to a nuptial in Saratoga rather than a Hawaiian wedding. Actually, they attended their cousin's wedding rather than their sister's marriage. Furthermore, despite trolling for total strangers as their dates with an outlandish Craigslist post that depicted them as half-human and half-horses, the Stangles took two girls that they knew. The Stangles have acknowledged that Hollywood has livened things up a little, but they claim that Zac Efron and Adam Devine have captured the essence of their monkey business. Ironically, Hollywood haywire here is stranger than the matter of the facts. Efron and Devine radiate enough chemistry and charisma that you like them as much as you laugh at them throughout their misadventures in this standard-issue nonsense. Meantime, as Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza steal the show right out from under them as their daffy dates. Despite its predictable plot, ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" not only provides enough genuinely side-splitting antics, but also at 98 minutes, it doesn't wear out its welcome.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
10,oscaralbert,Fox MegaCorp believes that Real Life . . .,7,12 July 2016,". . . should be like a grown-up version of Disney World, MIKE AND DAVE informs us. That's why it casts an aging version of that HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL guy in its Lake Woebegone rendering of America. Whether you're talking Fox ""News"" or a Fox flick, all the Minorities are Polychromatic but Housebroken, all the White People are Wild but Harmless, and all the Incomes are Waaaay Above Average. It's a given that REAL ""Real Life"" will never rear its ugly head on Fox ""News"" or in a Fox Big Screen offering. If three million American mass shooters (the actual number of PTSD, suicidal, and\or diagnosed paranoid schizophrenics in the U.S. Today who ALREADY own Bushmasters!) each ""take out"" 100 normal people, Fox Talking Heads will reassure the shooters (the ONLY Americans left alive) that ""Guns don't kill people."" Similarly, the Zacs and Annas of MIKE AND DAVE may set off more explosions at a wedding reception than the hijackers produced on 9-11, but none of the Fox Pretties will suffer a scratch, because actions have no consequences among the Rainbows and Unicorns of Fox World.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
11,neil-476,Mostly entertaining except Adam Devine,7,23 May 2018,"Mike and Dave are brothers whose shenanigans always go too far and ruin family events. With their sister's wedding coming up in Hawaii, they are instructed to find dates in the belief that this will curb their antics. And the plan might even have worked had Tatiana and Alice not seen the ad and decided that a Hawaii vacation sounded nice...This modern comedy (and when I say ""modern"" I mean ""non-stop profanity and a preoccupation with sexual matters"") features Zac Efron and Adam Devine as the two brothers, and Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick as the wedding dates, and some attractive Hawaiian locations. It is often also quite funny, and if you're happy with constant profanity and a tendency to revel in sexuality at the gutter end, you're probably going to like this a lot.I enjoyed it, and there were times when it made me laugh quite a bit. And I liked both Efron and Aubrey Plaza: Plaza has mastered an on-screen persona which is attractive without being stunning, and both raunchy and funny at the same time, and she uses that quality well in this. I have reservations with both Anna Kendrick and Adam Devine, though.Kendrick is very talented. She is also a pretty girl with a nice body, and this film demanded that she show some of it. She didn't. She played the Hollywood game of talking a lot about sex but coyly showing a flash of ankle (OK, there is some minor nudity in this movie, including Plaza's *ss, but not much). Miss Kendick wears Big Knickers and I felt cheated.Adam Devine's character, big brother Mike, is a dick. He's meant to be, but it makes him the most annoying character in the film. Unfortunately, Devine is allowed - nay, encouraged - to overplay him, which turned the character (and Devine) into individuals I never wanted to see again. Ever. And this was a shame because I mostly enjoyed the movie.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

Anna Kendrick and Zac Efron, as the comic straight couple, while miscast and bland, respectively, fair better, mostly because they're not asked to wring as much humor from the film's meager screenplay. Profanity can be used to tremendously comic effect -- just watch a Quentin Tarantino movie for evidence of that -- but profanity can also be the tool of a lazy writer, and guess which one the profanity in this film is evidence of.I want to watch and like modern comedies -- I want to laugh as much as the next guy -- but why do they have to be so aggressively awful?Grade: D",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
13,anaconda-40658,Mike and Dave Need Anna and Aubrey!,7,8 July 2016,"Mike and Dave Need Weeding Dates (2016): Dir: Jake Szymanski / Cast: Zac Efron, Adam DeVine, Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza, Stephanie Beard: Juvenile comedy about the need to grow up as brothers Mike and Dave Stangle learn when their parents have a meeting that ends with them finding dates for their sister's wedding. They stress ""nice girls"" but they end up hooking up with female versions of themselves. Mike and Dave have the reputation of raising havoc at family events. Alice and Tatiana are doped up versions who go along with the invitation in order to gain a free vacation. Predictably all havoc breaks loose again but it mainly lies with the females while the brothers are blamed. While the concept is fun the payoff never gives us Rihanna as it seemed to hint at. Zac Efron plays Dave who desires to aim his ideas through drawing. Adam DeVine as Mike witnesses some of the havoc and is distraught at behaviour that surpasses even his. They are upstaged by their female co-stars. Anna Kendrick as Alice is crushed over memories of being stood up at her wedding and responds by getting stoned often. Aubrey Plaza poses as a school teacher who will obviously stoop to any level to gain tickets to a Rihanna concert. Stephanie Beard has a blast as sister and bride Jeanie who is drugged by Alice and has an orgasmic time at a massage parlor that leaves her with the most joyously bizarre facial expressions. While the message may regard maturity, what viewers are really left with is the reality that females are just as outrageous as the males when it comes to wrecking a perfectly fine wedding.

14,FlashCallahan,Adam and Zac need new agents.....,4,19 September 2016,"Hard-partying brothers Mike and Dave have ruined every family get together they've been to,thanks to their drunken antics. Their parents give them an ultimatum, find the perfect dates for their sister's Hawaiian wedding, or don't go. Hoping for a wild getaway, the boys instead find themselves outsmarted and out-partied by an uncontrollable duo who saw the two on T.V, and have bagged themselves a freebie.....Efrons foray into bawdy comedy continues with his third 'hilarious' movie this year, and while it's not as inexcusable as Dirty Grandpa, or a blatant cash in like Bad Neighbours 2, it's nothing that you've never seen before.In fact, you'll be thinking of a dozen, better films whilst watching this. It's premise isn't very exciting, and the majority of the characters are the type of people you'd cross the street to avoid, and it's thanks to the charm of Efron and Kendricks that prevents this from being a complete disaster.And it's a shame that they don't have more time together on screen, rather than them having to bounce off such over the top scene schemers like the terrible Devine (the total opposite of his namesake), and Plaza,Moho isn't bad, but she should have more range than just the expression of hatred toward the human race.It's not in the least bit funny, it's humour is below the belt, using easy targets like sexuality and culture to up the number of jokes, and it just doesn't work. It didn't work thirty years ago, and it certainly doesn't work now, despite the wondrous locations and six-packs on view.It's lazy innuendo went out of date when the American Pie went stale, and it's verging on annoying here, because this could have been something quite sweet, if they had a writer who wasn't thinking about the birds and the bees every five minutes.So all in all, it's not very good, but the locations are beautiful, and it really made we want to watch Jurassic Park after.Whoop De Doo for comedy.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
15,zetes,"Has a few laughs, but is disappointing",6,10 July 2016,"This dumb comedy has a few laughs, but ultimately is unsatisfying. Adam Devine and Zac Efron play a couple of dufuses who are forced by their sister (Sugar Lyn Beard) and father (Stephen Root) to find dates for her Hawaiian wedding. The brothers post an ad on Craigslist which goes viral (this much of the film was based on a true story). They soon attract two sloppy potheads, Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick, who pretend to be normal, upstanding ladies to win the trip. When they get there, their baser natures soon fly free. The four of them get into a bunch of trouble. I saw this mainly for Kendrick and Plaza, who are both funny and extremely sexy in the film. Of the two guys, Devine gets a few good moments. Efron doesn't get much to do at all, which is disappointing considering his excellent turn earlier this year in Neighbors 2. The main problem here is a lack of ambition. The cast is game, but the screenwriter (and I'm sure the army of punch-uppers behind the scenes) don't give them enough funny jokes.

17,Hellmant,"Not a great comedy, but...",7,15 July 2016,"'MIKE AND DAVE NEED WEDDING DATES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A raunchy romcom, based on the true story of brothers Dave and Mike Stangle; who famously took out an ad on Craigslist, looking for wedding dates. The film stars Zac Efron and Adam Devine, as the Stangle brothers, and it costars Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza, Sugar Lyn Beard, Sam Richardson and Stephen Root (most of the four leads have previously worked together, on multiple other movies before). It was directed by Jake Szymanski (a veteran TV director, making his feature film debut), and it was written by Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien (who previously co-wrote both 'NEIGHBORS' films together, also starring Zac Efron). The movie's received mostly poor reviews from critics, but I thought it was mildly funny. Mike and Dave Stangle (Devine and Efron) are two brothers that run an alcohol selling business together; and they also party excessively. They're notorious, among their family members, for always ruining family get-togethers. So their sister (Beard), and father (Root), both insist they bring wedding dates to their sister's Hawaiian wedding (to help them avoid having another accident). In order to find dates, the Stangle brothers put up an ad online (which goes viral). Two other 'hard-partying' friends (Kendrick and Plaza) see them on television, and decide to trick the brothers into inviting them (by posing as nice girls). The movie has a great premise, I think, and it's definitely funny (at times). The cast is all great in it, and the direction is decent. The script could have used a few more rewrites though; the genuine laughs are just too few and far between, and a lot of the line delivery seems forced (at no fault of the actors, I think). A lot of comedy flicks fall victim to these flaws though; just none of the great ones. This isn't a great one.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
18,thesar-2,Mike and Dave Needed a Bigger Audience,8,23 September 2016,"As much as Aubrey and Adam are draws for me and Zac, eh, I think the wait is over for Anna. She finally won me over!I think other people like Anna Kendrick more than me. I loved 50/50 and Up in the Air a lot, but thought Kendrick was just okay in them, even though others raved about her. Then I saw Pitch Perfect and actually thought she was, well, PERFECT for that. But, only for that. Here, she was third or fourth tier and I think I am warming up to her.Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates started off with a hilarious bar bit for me and then sank into familiar, albeit unrealistic, territory for me. Sure, it still made me laugh, but I've seen this movie countless times. Sorry for the very-mild spoiler, but it's another lie-upon-lie comedy. Luckily, this movie possessed two changes that made this movie soar above most of the rest.One: the aforementioned lie was revealed early on verses in the climax, like normal. Thank you, screenwriters for that. And two: the chemistry was so good, I could enjoy everything else they had to say and do.Backing up: the concept is simple. Two doofus bros, actual real (on- screen) brothers, are made to bring good-girl dates to their sister's wedding since they womanize themselves into ruining everything prior. But, unbeknownst to them, they pick the mirror image of themselves pretending to be good-girls who just want a free trip to Hawaii for the wedding.That's the basic story and, of course, anyone who's seen a comedy like this since the 1980s knows where this is headed. Luckily, and again, the chemistry between the four leads is so genuine, you'd think they've been friends their entire life. And because of that, and their individual comedic talents, it's a roaring good time most of the time. This is not a criticism, but if you like Aubrey Plaza and Adam Devine from the past, they're exactly the same here. No changes whatsoever. Luckily, I do love their shtick, so I, personally, didn't have a problem with them. But, Zac Efron, he workshe's just not the highlight. It's really Anna Kendrick that shows depth. While not ""pitch perfect,"" she finally showed me, thanks to Devine, Plaza and Efron, that she really does have talent.There are moments that I cringed, mostly from the not-so-original setup or Devine going a little overboard, but those were so insignificant to the many, MANY times I laughed out loud. It's too bad this didn't get the attention it deserved. Sure, it can be grouped with all the lie- comedies, but it will shine as one of my favorites of the subgenre. ***Final thoughts: Efron just needs to retire early. He's not horrible – he does have an on screen persona, a rock-solid body and some charisma, but he is always barely worth a mention to whomever they pit him against. Neighbors 1 and 2 are 98% Seth and everything else and only 2% of his poster body. Here, he was barely even noticed by me. Oh, and don't automatically create a scene where he has to take his shirt offyou're making him as worthless as Taylor Lautner from the Twilight series.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

21,lesleyharris30,"Raunchy, Harmless Fun,",7,25 August 2016,"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a terrific comedic cast. The highlight of the entire movie ls certainly the cast itself, the chemistry between Zac Efron and Adam Devine makes it all worthwhile, they are very convincing as brothers.As well as that, their is a natural connection between the lead actresses, Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza, who are fiercely entertaining as two rebellious girls, certainly different from Kendrick's previous roles. The humour was, at times, tasteless. There is several innuendos, drug abuse and moments of sexual endeavours that simply came across as immature comedy that only young teenagers could really laugh at.Some of the films major plot points are also very absurd. For something that is suppose to be loosely based on a true story there is not a whole lot of realism, such as one of the girls throwing herself in front of a vehicle to get a guy's attention and a particularly discomforting masseuse scene, it was ridiculously exaggerated at times. Funny and with a charming cast, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates may have its flaws but if you are looking for an enjoyable adult comedy, i's worth the watch. Two brothers must search for dates for their sister's wedding in order to keep them under control, but the two girls they find have other ideas.

22,cosmo_tiger,Funny and surprisingly full of enough real emotion to make it more than just another carbon copy comedy. I recommend this.,8,27 September 2016,"""Over the years of our family gatherings, you two show up and you ruin it. I want you to bring a date to your sisters wedding."" Mike (Devine) and Dave (Efron) have a bad history of partying too hard and family functions and causing things to go terrible. They make a promise to their sister to find respectable girls to bring and be on their best behavior. They meet Alice (Kendrick) and Tatiana (Plaza) and think they found the perfect dates, but the girls aren't exactly who they seem. This is a very funny movie. More than that though, the movie has heart and that only adds to the overall feel of the movie. On the surface this is just another sex comedy that has many of the same ideas as other movies but the bits of seriousness and heart really help the movie become more than that. I laughed out loud many times in this and have to say that this was surprisingly one of the better comedies I have seen in the last year or so. Overall, funny and surprisingly full of enough real emotion to make it more than just another carbon copy comedy. I recommend this. I give this a B+.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
23,The-Sarkologist,Actually Quite Funny,8,12 December 2019,"The thing that annoyed me the most about this film was the title. I was in Paris at the time this film had hit the cinemas there, and the title was Hors Controle, which, honestly, probably describes this film so much better (for those who don't know French, it means 'Out of Control'). In a way, that title just suited the film so much better than the one that us English speakers got, and also, it made me want to see the film more so than when it was in the cinemas here in Australia.So, we have Mike and Dave, who love a good party, but the thing is that whenever they are around, the party turns pretty bad, and people end up getting injured. In fact, the opening credits, and then the videos that are shown afterwards, give a pretty clear indication of how these parties actually turn out.Yeah, it is one of those films that has a few drug references (and I have to admit, having people hide marijuana smoking implements as opposed to people just taking ecstasy provides much more laughs, particularly since Hollywood really does seem to go overboard when they portray people on ecstasy), as well as other things that you would expect from such a film.The premise is simple though - their sister is getting married, and the ultimatum is that they have to bring their own dates. Well, that doesn't turn out quite well considering they decide to post an ad on Craigslist, and as such get a heap of people that they realise probably wouldn't go down all that well at the wedding (and as an added catch, the wedding is in Hawaii). However, a couple of girls realise that they can get a free vacation, and set in motion a plan to get invited along. Not surprisingly, these girls, and Mike and Dave, just seem to be so much the same.Yeah, I found this film to be pretty funny, though another big problem is that there were a number of scenes cut, and a number of scenes that had references to those scenes (such as the apple, and the spit roast pig). Honestly, I found that to be rather disappointing that these scenes were actually cut, because it would have made the film so much better. Then again, maybe, just maybe, an uncut version will be available down the track.Still, though, this is definitely a fun film, especially if you like these types of films, and I have to be honest that I did actually find it rather amusing in places. It was all round good fun.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
24,Reno-Rangan,"Sorry Mike and Dave, it's an Alice and Tatiana's free vacay.",6,14 October 2016,"I should be honest that I had some good laughs, but not the overall film was impressive. For me it was a chick film, and Anna Kedrick and Aubrey Plaza are the lead actors. I really loved their parts and that's the reason I had no issue watching it, but like usual Zac Efron ruined it. I won't blame him completely, but he and Adam Devine's roles did not deliver as what the title expresses. I mean they get their wedding date, but the title should have been 'Alice and Tatiana Goes for a Free Vacay' or something like that.It was like a 'Brideamaid' kind of film, but there are too many adult jokes. The story was sort of based on the real, and that's just a joke to begin the narration. The advertisement was real, but the remaining story was fictional. From there, how the plot developed was totally makes no sense, but it does not matter because it is a comedy. Especially the initial parts, but later on, it gets better, only the comedy wise. In some way it was not bad, and not good either to recommend to others. So it is nothing more than a decent timepass film, but some people might find it most annoying.6/10",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
25,Floated2,Not as clever or funny as lead to believe,4,2 March 2017,"The film's premise and plot is partially based on a true story. It starts where Mike and Dave settle on two girls, Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) and Alicia (Anna Kendrick), who turn out not to be respectable at all, but just as self-absorbed and clueless as they are. They are also just as rude, ready for alcohol, the film does evince a welcome sense of gender parity for bad behavior.Similar to Wedding Crashers, Hollywood demands that the wedding is messed up, so no surprises there, nor in what happens afterwards. All four actors have great comic timing and their improvisation skills are tested, but within the content of the film, crude sexual gags and tastelessness hammering the same jokes over and over hold them back. This film isn't clever, witty or funny enough to warrant anything more than a one time viewing. For films such as this in which we know what it is about, it's utterly predictable and not as entertaining as it could have been. Simply put, the jokes aren't that great as to warrant consistent laughs, just light chuckles.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
26,TheMovieDiorama,"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is a ""comedy"" that just feels tired.",4,9 March 2018,"Everything here has been done before pretty much and to a better standard. Just a lazy attempt to get some money. Mike and Dave have been ordered to find dates before going to their sister's wedding. Firstly, how would getting two random dates keep these boys in check? This is what their father suggested! Secondly, there is no way that the family would pay for the flights and accommodation for these two random dates. Thirdly, two random dates to a family wedding? I mean really!? What if these dates never progressed? What would be the God damn point!! Meeting the whole family for nothing!!! Urghhhh it's such a silly premise. It would be fine if the script was poking fun out of itself but it's not, it's an entirely serious ""comedy"". Oh, whilst we're on the script, it was pretty terrible. Some jokes hit but it's a combination of drinking, dick and fingering jokes. I'll give the film credit, the whole scene set in the massage parlour and the ATV tour did make me laugh. So that's about 15 out of 100 minutes that were humorous. Not good enough. Zac Efron and Anna Kendrick are better than this (never thought I'd say that about Efron). They delivered well with what they were given so I have to give them credit. Aubrey Plaza plays the same ""I'm drunk, horny and a bitch"" role that she does for most comedies. Adam Devine...nothing divine about his performance (I'm so punny! (notice the pun in that as well)) it literally consisted of him screaming and yelling like a girl. Funny once perhaps, not thirty times. It sounds like I didn't enjoy it, it's actually watchable...if you turn your brain off. If you like crude, rude and dirty jokes then you'll enjoy this. I like to think my humour is better than that so this was not meant for me. That massage scene though...literally when those butt cheeks were rubbing together whilst swinging I proper cracked up!",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
27,jtindahouse,Fun but lacking in chemistry,5,13 July 2016,"When 'The Hangover' came out in 2008 and was a massive success, my hope was that this would signify an evolutionary step in the comedy film world. A step where story would drive the humour, rather than other way around. That was what made that film so great. Sadly though, it seems to have almost gone the other way and now almost every comedy we get has next to no story and simply relies on comedic actors to carry the entire show. The problem with that is that there are very few actors in Hollywood who can actually pull it off. Is Adam Devine one of them? Sadly, not quite yet.Zac Efron seems to be making a career out of being the straight guy playing along side a comedian who is expected to carry the show. Just film after film these days, it seems to be all he does. He's good looking and appeals to female audience members I'd imagine, but he also sucks a lot of life out of films. I can honestly say in 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' he failed to make me laugh once. Can a film (a comedy for that matter) survive with one of its two leading characters being that ineffective? I don't think so.There's some fun to be had here though. Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza deliver a few laughs and Devine gives his everything in every scene and it comes off now and then. There really isn't a lot for them to work with though. The fact that is based on a true story is a bit of a joke. It is based on one, but the true story itself is about as uninteresting as you could possibly imagine. Two guys put an ad out looking for some dates to a wedding - stop the presses! Apparently they did, and even thought it was enough to make a movie out of. I assure you however, it wasn't.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
28,DarkVulcan29,Just okay,7,20 July 2016,"I went into this movie thinking I was gonna see something worse then Dirty Grandpa, the premise didn't make me want to give it the benefit of the doubt, which is loosely based on a true story.Mike(Adam Devine) and his younger brother Dave(Zac Efron) are asked by there parents to bring wedding dates to there sisters wedding in Hawaii, in hopes to keep them under control, cause Mike and Dave seem cause mayhem at every party they are at. So both of them become internet sensations when they advertise that both are need of wedding dates, even go on Wendy Williams. After so many interviews with very little luck, they meet Tatiana(Audrey Plaza) and Alice(Anna Kendrick), and feel a little connection, and end being there wedding dates. But little do Mike and Dave know that Tatiana and Alice are not what they seem.Unlike Dirty Grandpa some of the jokes here really hit there mark. Efron here this time plays a great straight man playing off of Devine insane zaniness, the two do have great chemistry. Audrey Plaza basically playing a similar character from Dirty Grandpa, but here seems to be putting more effort. Anna Kendrick is good too, showing more to her character. The four leads do play off each other quite well. But some of the other gags go further than they should, to the point where it wasn't funny anymore. The other supporting cast do well with what they are giving.It's not the unfunny disaster that was Dirty Grandpa, but nowhere near the comedy masterpiece that was The Hangover(2009).",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
29,jadavix,"Not funny, and not as raunchy as you'd expect",5,23 January 2017,"Zac Efron is uncommonly pretty for a man. He is so good looking, in fact, that I don't believe he works as a lead. His face is a punchline for a joke ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" never supplies. The movie seems to be going for the dynamic that ""Mike and Dave"" are funny together because Dave is much better looking than Mike, and Mike is more of an obnoxious goofball while Dave is the romantic pretty boy. In fact, Adam Devine as Mike is actually very handsome by anyone's estimation, and the chemistry between the two guys just isn't funny. They give it their all in scenes where you want to applaud them for their chutzpah, even if you aren't laughing while doing it.Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick, though? They're funny. It's too bad the movie doesn't really know what to do with them. It doesn't know whether to make them the shameless party girls the plot requires, or cave into the expectations of the audience and have them be the perfect role models women in movies these days always are. For one thing, the movie hedges around sex. Plaza and Kendrick play trainwrecks who love drinking, drugging, getting wasted and watching porno together. But there is nary a mention of their sex lives; a major plot point is made of the Plaza character leading on Devine's Mike, but resolving never to have sex with him. What's the point of the lead on? And are we expected to believe that these too party girls draw the line at sex? Why would they – or is this just the filmmakers condescending to us, assuming we'll be put off by girls who are promiscuous?In fact, for a supposedly raunchy comedy, the movie seems fairly puritanical about sex in general. The presence of Maron, Nanjiani and Crawford all spelt a good time, but only Nanjiani gets a memorable scene. Perhaps, as he lost weight, Crawford also lost his gift for comedy?",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

Mike & Dave Stangle are two real life brothers that are the text book definition of party animals. When their sister is getting married, she wants them to shape up and play nice, at least during her wedding. Zac & Adam play the Stangle brothers and at every family get together, they take partying to the limits and beyond, usually with things ending in explosions or something being burned to the ground. After their parents and sister hold a family meeting-more like an intervention-to get them to act nice, Zac & Adam decide that their best chance to shape up is to go on Craigslist and place an ad, saying that they need 2 nice girls to take to their sister's wedding-all expenses paid in Hawaii. Of course they are deluged with offers-who doesn't want a free trip to Hawaii?-but the lucky winners are Anna & Aubrey. The only problem? Anna & Aubrey turn out to be party animals in sheep's clothing-They are just pretending to be good girls for the free trip, of course. The humor is really 'R' rated material, so if you are easily offended by such then you might be better off seeing something else. I enjoyed it and thought it was good, raunchy fun . During the end credits, there are some out takes & bloopers. It's rated ""R"" for language, drug use and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 38 minutes.

The lead stars do respectable jobs and most of the comedy is funny, the fact that it tries to be heartfelt on too many occasions almost derails my feelings towards it though.Zac Efron (Dave), Adam DeVine (Mike), Anna Kendrick (Alice) and Aubrey Plaza (Tatiana) all connect very well together, the chemistry in their respective cliques isn't always there but for the comical stuff they work.Efron and Plaza would be my picks from the onscreen talent, especially Plaza who commits to the role nicely; despite an iffy accent. Elsewhere you have Sam Richardson (Eric), Lavell Crawford (Keith) and Stephen Root (Burt) appearing, they have relatively minor roles though it's cool to see them involved.It's the attempted heartwarming story that lets this down, I guess it does leave with a positive message but none of it comes across in the film itself - I didn't connect with any of the characters on a proper level, Jake Szymanski & Co. should've just went for the 100% pure comedy.

36,aharmas,Unbelievable,2,17 July 2016,"What happens when we take some of the strongest young talent around, mix it with a script that has limited use of some of the most recognized words in the English language, manages to avoid an NC 17 by some miracle and asks the audience to leave their brains outside? You get this offensive, tasteless, and mentally impaired movie.Loosely inspired by various comedies we have seen before but without any redeeming quality or grace, we witness a family that hasn't somehow killed any of its members, treat each other with the utmost disrespect and seems only concerned with coming up with the next opportunity to use foul language supposedly to keep the audience believing something funny is happening. I'm not against hearing a colorful word, but it's like using spices in the right amount, and pretty soon we're burned and bored.Here's a movie that makes the younger generation look pretty useless and dumb, Hawaii becomes a rather plain scenario because all of its charms disappear as we are confronted with every possible display of vulgarity and ignorance. There's not a single clever, cute, or funny moment. Well, maybe the reconciliation of one of the couples is a fresh moment of fresh air but that can't overcome the prevalent stench.There are issues with the proper use of language, too. As far as I know there was a man in the massage scene, but people kept using the feminine term. If that slipped by, I wonder if it was just intentional or just another instance of the effort to come up with anything memorable. All through the movie I was waiting to for a surprise since Zach and Anna were there, or maybe some of the inspiration would follow one of the leads from his hit TV show. An absolute waste of time, money, and talent. Stay away.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
37,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,5,13 July 2016,"The title says it all. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (my latest review) marks the third time I've seen a comedy that takes place in Hawaii. The other two are 50 First Dates and 2008's Forgetting Sarah Marshall. ""Wedding"" which falls somewhere in the middle, is not as funny as it should be nor is it as raunchy as it could have been. A main character singing and grinding to ""This Is How We Do It"", been there. Another getting shockingly hit by a car, done that. Two female troupers getting high on Ecstasy and running around naked. You know what, that might be a new one.Anyway, despite scenes involving an unconventional method of having sex, a women's full frontal nudity that brings back the 70's, and a line in which someone says, ""you look like Don Johnson made a baby with 'Zack' Morris"", Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates only garnered some mild chuckles from me. This film sans script, has persisting moments that go on for too long, and has line readings that scream improvisation overload. The rest is just f-bombs, conventional gross-out gags, and obligatory outtakes during the end credits. Comic up-and-comers Adam DeVine and Aubrey Plaza along with chiseled Zac Efron, don't stand a chance with this material. Oh and by the way, save your money if you haven't seen ""Wedding"" yet. Its trailer which promotes summer movie salivation, is way more humorous.Directed by first-timer Jake Szymanski and distributed by 20th Century Fox, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates introduces us to a sexual term known as the ""push pop"" (don't ask). The flick follows bumbling brothers Dave Stangle (Efron) and Mike Stangle (DeVine). They come from an upper class family, have jobs as partners in the selling of liquor, and have the maturity level of a couple of teenagers. They also like to wreak havoc on family social events (their destructive behavior resulted in a bad trampoline accident and the near death of their grandfather, no joke). When it's announced that their younger sister is about to get married, well their dad insists that they bring dates to the wedding instead of constantly just hitting on random ladies. Mike and Dave agree and eventually go on The Wendy Williams Show to put the veritable word out. In walks Alice and Tatiana (played by Anne Kendrick and Audrey Plaza). They are a couple of stoner chicks who live in a rundown apartment, say stuff like ""hot as balls"", and eventually get fired from their jobs as waitresses. Mike and Dave choose them because they come off as good girls. Bully for that. They do this only so they can get a free trip to The Aloha State (the location of the nuptials), bide their time by watching male porn in their hotel room, and sneak off to smoke the almighty reefer.Now ""Wedding"" is pretty lightweight satire despite a lot going on. I mean, you don't know where it is actually headed. There's a mixture of romance between Dave and Alice, a love/hate relationship between Tatiana and Mike, the bride-to-be getting hit in the face by a ATV (ouch), and a side plot involving a bisexual cousin trying to get with one of the ill- mannered rendezvous. In the end, it's really hard to care about anyone involved because the banter between the characters feels made up, forced, and badly off-putting. The similar-themed Wedding Crashers was no masterpiece but it felt more absolute. It had funnier zingers, an actual conclusion, and an actual resolution (its box office take of $285 million is proof of that).All in all, after seeing Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, I'll probably see a lot worse comedies in my lifetime. And in jest, I'll probably see a lot more superior ones too. Rating: A fair 2 stars.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
38,Kingslaay,It has its moments,7,12 May 2017,"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates was humorous and quite entertaining. It has somewhat of a plot and was enjoyable. Some scenes could have been removed however. It was thankfully not too vulgar and relied on the performances of its four main cast members to bring it home. There was great chemistry between the four, some funny moments that most audiences should laugh at and slightly sentimental too. Audrey is a natural treasure but the weakest link was Anna Kendrick who was not as funny as she was annoying. You know this film is not in the running for any Oscars but it exists to entertain and achieved that. Glad I watched it.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
39,bkrauser-81-311064,Wedding Crashers for the Snowflake Generation,7,21 July 2016,"They're two brothers stuck in a permanent state of adolescence. They're two puerile reprobates pretending to be nice girls to hustle a free trip to Hawaii. The setting; a lavish Oahu resort where Mike (Devine) and Dave (Efron) will watch their little sister Jeanie (Beard) get married. The tables are set, the wine is chilled, the suckling pig has been basted; lock and load.Mike and Dave is yet another bawdy comedy in a summer already inundated with bawdy comedies. As such it has all the familiar contemporary trappings of the genre: basic camera coverage, bacchanalian sensibilities and an over-reliance on improvisation. Thankfully the main four; Efron, Plaza, Devine and Kendrick, find their niche within the plot. Their motivations are clear, their chemistry easygoing and their interactions with other supporting cast members is downright Shakespearean. This may come as a pleasant surprise to some. Comparing a mediocre comedy to Shakespeare? Well the plot is inducted by a quixotic request from the parents of the brothers in the hopes that finding wedding dates would pacify them. When they find their dates, each duo tries had to put up a front but ultimately succumb to their worst natures. Chaos ensues, truths are revealed, it ends in a wedding.Mike and Dave's greatest asset is its self-effacement. It knows it's juvenile, it knows it's unoriginal and it knows it's second life on blu-ray is going to be limited to Redbox and the paltry shelf space of the guy that peaked in high school. Yet it really doesn't care. It's here to make you laugh and it will resort to Adam Devine screaming at an octave only dogs can hear to do it. At least instead of the girls being relegated to the shrill ""I'll give him one more chance to grow up"" roles they're giving as much as they can take (if not more). I don't know about you but there are somethings even I wouldn't do for Rihanna tickets.If the film has a secondary asset it's in Mike and Dave's attempt to flip the script on gender roles and casual misogyny. By far the most noticeable permutation of this theme is Alice Wetterlund's libidinous cousin Terry who competes with the frat-house bravado of Devine's Mike for the heart of Tatiana (Plaza). While disappointingly underused, when Wetterlund is on screen hilarity naturally ensues. Sugar Lyn Beard likewise joins in the fun in two uproarious set-pieces that are brought to the tipping point by her chirpy disposition. She's much more than a caricature and her wedding is a little more than a plot device but rather an opportunity for all involved to grow as people.Of course just like the recent Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising (2016), Mike and Dave is unsuccessful in translating socially progressive themes. But unlike that retread, Mike and Dave does have its heart in the right place and its impact cannot be overstated. You can tell there's a lot of pieces cut from the final product (including a competitive streak between the brothers that doesn't go anywhere), yet I like to think most of those cuts were made to get Aubrey Plaza to not just shine but glimmer. She's been in two films with Zac Efron so far this year and both times she's proved her co-star a middling comedic force and the material she's given beneath her abilities.Running the gambit of predictable and safe comedy back-and-forths, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates stands as one of the biggest surprises of the summer season. It may not successfully flip the script and many have derided it as a middling Wedding Crashers (2005) for the snowflake generation. Yet as a comedy it just works.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
40,zhyarTheChosen,Either you love it or hate it,8,28 December 2019,Truly one of the best comedian movie out there but not all people get the joke,Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
41,Screen_Blitz,It's over-the-top and ridiculous but delivers some hilarious moments,6,13 July 2016,"As of today, there are a few particular aspects that define R-rates comedies: vulgar sex humor, abundant profanity, and a story with little ambition; all of this sums up this hysterical comedy directed by Jake Syzmanksi in this feature film debut. Zac Efron and Adam Devine take positions of the lead roles and bring middling efforts to bring on the laughter. At some degree, they succeed but their over-the-top goofy portrayals of the lead characters make this comedy both fun and obnoxious to sit through, though it is slightly better than Zac Efron's previous outing when he starred opposite Robert De Niro in 'Dirty Grandpa' earlier this year. Enter Efron and Devine as Mike and Dave Stangle, two hard- partying brothers who've become known for going to their family gatherings with nothing bigger on their agenda than to party their souls out, and their reckless, party-to-the-death behavior often leads to disaster. Whether they cause a fire or send a family member or friend to the hospital; they always seem to be the disastrous catalysts of their family gatherings. When their younger sister Jeanie (played by Sugar Lyn Beard) is getting married in Hawaii, their parents (played by Stephen Root and Stephanie Faracy) propose an elegant solution: the boys must each bring themselves a date to keep them under control. In a desperate efforts to find nice dates, they meet Alice (played by Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (played by Aubrey Plaza) who start off as nice young ladies, but on vacation turn out be even bigger party animals. Before they know it, Mike and Dave are forced to deal with the chaos that ensues. If you are amused about by characters indulge in a constant parade of sex jokes and hijinks, and occasionally slapstick humor without a pinch of substance, this just might be a movie for you. Otherwise, you are likely in for 98 minutes of tedium. Surprisingly, this film is just a little more than that. Though the main story is nothing of true aspiration, Zac Efron and Adam Devine bring a fair amount of heart and laughter to the screen; even when they have the tendency to annoy in some scenes screaming and yelling like children high on caffeine. Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick also make a wild bunch, and the chemistry between is fine, though not great; especially as it's hard to buy Kendrick as a raunchy bad girl who gets high on ecstasy. The humor these four bring to the screen often ranges from to somewhat funny, to amateurish, and to deeply absurd. While most of the humor isn't particularly smart, especially the childish antics perpetrated by the two main leads; these four actors at least use some of their comedic chemistry. As typical as many average comedies, there jokes don't always land, some of which fall too far in the category of a sitcom. When Efron and Devine are on screen together, the jokes are dumb; when Plaza and Kendrick come on screen, the jokes haves little substance. In the end, not many of the jokes are remotely quotable.Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is a bit of a mixed bag of dumb, funny humor and hit- and-miss comedic material. Overall, this is an okay film but is not destined pleased everyone, particularly those seeking for a comedy with a smart, witty story because this movie doesn't quite have one. But as long as the laughs there, some can easily come to appreciate this hysterical comedy.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

Adam DeVine and Zac Edron star as Mike and Dave, two slacker brothers who always screw up big family gatherings. When their sister, Jeanie is getting married, the family hold a type of 'intervention' for Mike and Dave and tell them to bring nice respectable women as their dates to the wedding.

43,thekarmicnomad,An attempt at an objective review,6,24 January 2017,"Mike & Dave are going to their sister's wedding. Due to the fact that they wreck every engagement they attend - their parents insist they have dates. Of course their dates turn out to be less than perfect.I watch these kind of movies hoping I will enjoy them. But I rarely do - maybe I am just too straight laced - but I will try and be impartial.This movie has every one of the staples that make for mad-cap gross out comedy. There is swearing, drug taking, nudity, improvised arguments, drunken antics, stunts, and family members caught in inappropriate situations.If this is your thing then I think you may like this. It is well made and compared to similar titles a lot of the set pieces are reigned in (not nearly enough for me though) before they become too stupid.The stars of the shows are definitely Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza - who have more interesting characters and give great performances.I didn't mind this movie - I just feel I have seen it all before. But well made and if this is your kind of thing I think you will enjoy it.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
44,Karl Self,"Lowbrow fun, like it says on the box",8,18 September 2016,"I had a great time with this movie, but reading all the negative reviews made me feel almost sorry for having enjoyed myself. After reviewing some scenes, granted, they feel kind of thrown together and forced. Like the opening scene. The protagonists, two brothers are trying to scam a landlord into buying a few boxes of liquor off of them. The landlord tells them that he knows it's a scam BECAUSE ONE OF THEM USED TO DATE HIS NIECE AND USED TO COME TO HIS HOUSE REGULARLY (what???), but that he'll still buy four cases off of them.So, admittedly, this movie doesn't always have the smoothest of scripts. The plot is more or less a thinly veiled excuse for the comedic interactions between the two likable but hapless brothers and two certified floozies pretending to be nice girls in order to snaffle a free trip to Hawaii. Although two of them predictably end up in a romantic relationship, especially the interactions between the male leads and the two bad girls pretending to be all sugar and spice are hilarious.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

It's definitely her personality. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is really watchable for its super raunchy sex appeal and the 4 funny leads. With Sugar Lyn Beard. You gotta love it.

SLB gets TFN (totally freaking naked) in M&DNWD. I love that. Anna Kendrick's so super hot. She doesn't turn me on that much in Mike & Dave. She should of been naked like Aubrey and Sugar. Seemed like a good opportunity! I love this movie because of Aubrey and Sugar. Like 75% Aubrey 25% Sugar 0% Anna. This movie's funny enough and it has a lot of funny parts. The Plaza Devine moments are way better than the Efron Kendrick moments. This is a sloppy hot ass comedy. Speaking of sloppy hot ass I want Aubrey as my wedding date. I want to do ecstasy with Sugar and Anna. I wanna marry Sugar. And give her a massage. This movie's like an 8 in my book because of Aubrey, and Sugar, and Anna. Aubrey mainly.

47,bankofmarquis,Unexpectedly fun,7,30 July 2016,"I can't believe I'm about to write this line.MIKE AND DAVE NEED WEDDING DATES is the funniest movie I have seen this summer (so far).There, I said it and I don't even feel like I need a shower.I know - I'm surprised, too.  MIKE & DAVE is a pretty funny movie of the over-top, gross out type - think THE HANGOVER or NEIGHBORS,  M&D tells the story of...well...Mike and Dave (Adam Devine and Zach Efron) who think they are just ""great partiers"" at the various weddings they go to - as seen through their eyes in the opening credits, only to discover ""the rest of the story"" from their parents (Stephanie Faracy and the great, underused Stephen Root) - they go out of control to disastrous results. The remedy?  Bring dates to their sister's destination wedding.They go about it by putting an ad on Craigslist that goes viral.  Enter into it Alice and Tatiana (Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza) two ladies that party even harder than Mike and Dave who B.S. their way to the wedding pretending to be shy, demure and ladylike.  As you can imagine, chaos ensues.The key to this type of movie is the performances of the leads and in these 4, they are in good hands.  Aubrey Plaza commands the first part of this movie as she is over the top and inappropriate from the start.  She had me laughing early and often.  Zach Efron joined in gamely and Adam Devine does what i think Adam Devine does, be the dimwit.  I gotta admit that this act wears thin on me, but is serviceable here.  Kendrick draws the short straw on this part of the movie as she seemed to be trying to hard in a part that was underwritten.And then an interesting thing happens...as usually occurs in these types of films, they leads find their ""hearts"" and the shenanigans tone down.  When this happens, the relationship between Kendrick and Efron shine (I'd really love to see a movie with just these two) their heart and sincerity come to center stage and I really start to root for them.  Fortunately, for me at least, this means that Devine needed to tone down his act, which I was grateful for.  The unfortunate side effect is that Plaza had to tone hers down as well, and she became somewhat of a background player in the 2nd half of the film after carrying the first half.Comedic movies often rise and fall on the performances of the supporting players, the can be fun (see THE HANGOVER) or they can be non-descript (see the recent GHOSTBUSTERS), fun works, non-descript doesn't.  This movie has fun supporting players starting with the afore-mentioned Root as Mike & Dave's father.   Add to that Alice Wetterlund's bi-sexual Cousin Terry, Mary Holland's uptight Maid of Honor Becky and Lavell Crawford's Best-Man Keith, they all have their moments to shine.  But, for the me, the real unexpected surprise was Sugar Lyn Beard as the Bride, Jeanie.  She was inappropriately hilarious in a role that could have been one note, but wasn't.  Only Sam Richardson's groom, Eric, was not fun, but he wasn't supposed to be - and he wasn'tIs this movie an Academy Award winner?  Well...no.  Is it a fun way to spend a couple of hours on a warm summer evening - heck, yes!  And isn't that what summer comedies should be?  I think so.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
48,dave-mcclain,"""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates""... and this Dave needs a funny movie to review, so...",7,8 July 2016,"They say ""familiarity breeds contempt"", but I say, ""familiarity breeds contentment"", well, cinematic contentment anyway and familiarity ain't bad for cinematic chemistry either. Take the cast of the raunchy comedy ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" (R, 1:38) for example. Adam DeVine and Zac Efron, playing the title characters, respectively, have previously worked together in the ""Neighbors"" movies. The two female leads, Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza, have also done two other films together (2014's ""Life After Beth"" and ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" in 2010) and are good friends in real life. Kendrick and DeVine appeared together in the ""Pitch Perfect"" movies, while Efron and Plaza shared the screen in 2016's ""Dirty Grandpa"". What's more, this film's co-writers, Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien, also shared writing credits on those ""Neighbors"" movies. And, to take the ""familiarity"" theme one step further, Movie Fans may already be familiar with this movie's basic premise – if they remember hearing about the real-life 2013 events (or read the book) on which the Stangle Brothers' story is based.Mike and Dave Stangle are trouble makers, but they consider themselves party makers. After all, injuring wedding guests with an ill-advised trampoline stunt, shooting fireworks into a camper and causing an uncle to have a heart attack at his anniversary party are just a few isolated incidents in an ongoing string of party awesomeness, right? Well, these two brothers' parents (Stephen Root and Stephanie Faracy) aren't going to take chances on one of these legendary mishaps ruining the upcoming Hawaiian wedding of Mike and Dave's little sister, Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard), to the kind but boring (kind of boring) Eric (Sam Richardson). Jeanie suggests (and mom and dad insist) that Mike and Dave bring dates to the wedding – to keep the pair in line. The guys don't like having their style cramped, but they agree, for Jeanie's sake.Not really knowing how to find ""nice girls"", Mike and Dave place on ad on craigslist. The ad goes viral and the guys are soon meeting a number of the, ahem, ""candidates"" in a sequence reminiscent of Eddie Murphy's character searching for ""his queen"" in 1988's ""Coming to America"". An appearance on ""The Wendy Williams Show"" brings this quest to the attention of down-and-out besties Tatiana (Plaza) and Alice (Kendrick). (Think of the ""Dumb and Dumber"" characters, with nicer legs, a few more IQ points and lots more booze.) The girls refashion themselves into nice girls, engineer an encounter with Mike and Dave, and before you can say ""Aloha"", the foursome are on a plane to Jeanie's destination wedding.Tatiana and Alice manage to make a great first impression on everyone in Mike and Dave's family, but it's not long before the girls' true (wild) colors begin to show. Mike and Dave realize that the girls need more straightening out than they do and, soon, the whole family – and the whole wedding needs some serious straightening out. Some of the situations that arise include on ongoing gag about a relationship between one of the girls and the guys' lesbian cousin Terry (Alice Wetterlund), a masseuse (Kumail Nanjiani) who takes things too far, a dangerous ATV stunt, an unfortunate ""live mic"" moment, an awkward discussion of parental sexuality and an ill-timed first-time experimentation with ""Ecstasy"".""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" is the best wedding comedy in more than a decade, but does take things a bit too far. The four leads are familiar enough with each other to have good chemistry and they're clearly having fun, which goes a long way to ensuring that Movie Fans have a good time. There's some overacting, but it is entertaining to see Kendrick, who is known mainly for intelligent, charming, confident characters, play the exact opposite of those characteristics. Efron and DeVine might have been better off switching roles, but they did well, with the help of Plaza effectively playing her now familiar carefree/shame-free character, along with scene-stealing turns from Wetterlund and Nanjiani.This movie calls forward the spirit of the series of memorable wedding comedies from the first five years of this century (i.e., ""Meet the Parents"", ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and ""Wedding Crashers""), but goes further than any of them. Some of the situations and gags from those movies reappear – as if on drugs (which, in some cases, they are). The film's advertising doesn't hide its raunchiness, but it might make even the most open-minded viewers uncomfortable at times, such as with a ""Scarface"" reference and one other scene, both with incestuous undertones. However, if you can take it, much of the movie is very funny and first-time feature director Jake Szymanski keeps the plot moving and the wild moments coming. ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" is an entertaining, boundary-pushing entry into the wedding comedy sub-genre. ""B+""",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
49,bryank-04844,'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' needs more than a date.,4,23 January 2017,"I think the vulgar wedding comedy has formed its own sub genre these days. With films like 'Wedding Crashers', 'Bridesmaids', 'American Wedding', and 'The Hangover', you have all the ingredients to make a modern audience laugh with toilet humor, vulgar language, sex, drugs, excessive amounts of alcohol, and a happy ending (pun very intended). The next on the list of this current sub-genre of wedding comedies is 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates', which is actually based off a real life story of brothers Mike and Dave Stangle, who took to the internet to find dates for their sister's wedding, offering a free trip. They went viral, got a ton of responses, went on national television, and had a book come out.Is there funny vulgar language here? Yes. Are there tons of drinking, drugs, and sex jokes here? Yes. That being said, there isn't anything new or original here, and we've all seen this before, several times. Yes, there are some funny moments here and there, but the film really loses steam quickly, due to the lack of any kind of real story. Instead, it just moves from next joke to the next joke to the next joke, all which involve drinking, sex, drugs, or saying the word ""fuck"" a few times in a matter of seconds.Here, Mike and Dave are played by Adam Devine ('Workaholics') and Zac Efron, who take to Craig's List to look for wedding dates for their high pitched voiced sister's wedding in Hawaii. Mike and Dave are known to be the hard party dude's who bring the fun and also destruction to every party they attend, whether it be a family party, a funeral, or friend's rave. Their father (Stephen Root) tells them they need to not be the drunk assholes like they usually are at functions and be on their best behavior, and also need to bring actual respectable dates, instead of trying to hook up with every girl they come into contact with.Enter Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick who play Tatiana and Alice respectively who are actually more ridiculous and ruthless than Mike and Dave themselves. However, the two girls play nice in order to get to Hawaii, which is when the big laughs are supposed to happen. Sure there are some funny moments with a hardcore massage with a happy ending, a lesbian scene in a steam room, and a naked drug induced scene with horses, but none of them really stick the landing in a big way. Sure, you'll laugh here and there, but it's mostly from the insane and hyper-vulgar dialogue from the actors and nothing more. Even that runs its course early on.Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick are fun enough and have great comedic timing even if their characters are unlikable for the most part. Adam Devine is turned up to 11 here as the funny man where Zac Efron plays the straight laced guy. Their chemistry is energetic and it looks like they had a lot of fun in Hawaii, which is mostly why I think everyone decided to say ""Yes"" to this project – a free trip to Hawaii. Come to think of it, there was a better comedy made in Hawaii, which was 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'. Still, for a mindless summer vulgar comedy that has a tiny bit of charm, 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' should satisfy you for a minute or two when it comes out on Netflix.WAIT FOR NETFLIX!",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

53,James_De_Bello,5/10,5,10 August 2016,"They think they have just made them all better parties, but to their parents and to admittedly, reality, brothers Mike (Zac Efron) and Dave (Adam Devine) have only ruined all of the family events they've participated in for their wild party style. So when its Jaine's (Sugar Lyn Beard) turn to get married the family is taking no risks: Mike and Dave are to bring wedding dates to the wedding in order to be kept at bay. That's when Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) put on the façade of being nice and ordinary girls to score a free weekend in Hawaii after discovering an advert from the two brothers. Yet when the chaotic spirits of both pairs start to explode, an apparently normal weekend turns into a ludicrous series of events.""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" has good and charismatic leads, with natural comedic timing and an appropriately funny cast built around them with a script that has some effortlessly funny gags working. Yet, a fair amount of laughs are not enough to surmount the film's lack of heart, which often transpires into both annoying and unmotivated sequences and humor which is close to being mean spirited.What severely lacks from the film is a fresh and interesting comedic voice. As much as you feel the director's passion, I couldn't help but feel very cold about the style and visual choices the film makes. It is directed with almost no life, it doesn't feel alive and breathing, the shot choice is for the majority so basic it made my head ache at some point. There aren't any passages in the film where you feel inspired filmmaking and character or story being given a chance to flow. The editing is very mechanical and brings the film into feeling more like a series of gags, which might be occasionally good, but lack any kind of drive given the very predictable and clichéd script.Still, there's no denying the talent almost everybody has for comedy and even when handed what for most is very average material they manage to elevate it and thanks to what is sure to be a lot of improvisation they make the scenes that work, work really well and transcend what are otherwise deeply problematic character development elements. Efron's career has lately been all about these R-rated comedies and I have to admit I am one who really enjoys his effort in these: he is a great screen presence and always brings a palpable irony to the scenes. Adam Devine at this point is an enigma for me, I have no idea where he'll go in the future, that is because he has some really borderline annoying stuff here, but I don't know if it's thanks to him or the gag in itself I was never brought to a breaking point. I enjoyed probably all of his beats and he had many different ones to bring alive, succeeding in all of that variety.What is frustrating about the movie is how standard it feels and how much everything around it is striving to be better, but what we end up is this basic studio comedy that goes through every single beat we except and leaves the audience with little passion at all. The premise is right, the talent behind cast well, the script is trying to go to fresh places occasionally, but there is an incredible aura of average all around that simply flattens the film to the point of annoyance. Not to mention the ridiculous quantity of screeching women all over the place that had me almost covering my ears.""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" is a film that delivers some good and at times great laughs thus succeeding a laugh prompter, yet a comedy film it lacks any depth of character or story to make it live any further than its closing credits unfortunately.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

55,kaptenvideo-89875,Mike and Dave Need Some Better Jokes,3,1 October 2017,"A raunchy comedy about hard-partying brothers Mike (Adam Devine, Zac Efron) who start a public campaign to find perfect dates (Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza) for their sister's Hawaiian wedding, so the family would be pleased for once. Supposedly based on a true story. American mainstream comedies have a lot of improvised dialogue and scenes these days which can be great. Also, as in this case, it can bring mediocre results when there's not much content backing all that impro-ing, or the players are not able to get creative enough. In this case, there's enough story for an unpretentious 98 minute entertainment but the dialogue remains generic and performances feel uninspired. Both leading men, Efron and Devine, have done this sort of thing so much that they're always kind of cool. But the leading ladies, Aubrey and Kendrick, don't impress at all. They don't develop much of a flow of their own and settle for copying the guys. Dirty jokes are not that good either, and the blissful massage section which is supposed to be one of the major setpieces, is just painfully unfunny. Mike and Dave"" comes from the writers of Neighbors"" and Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising"" but offers none of the fun and energy of said comedies, not that these were true classics or anything. It certainly doesn't help that at least three of the four leads have done this sort of thing way too much in recent past.

He is a fine actor but guess was in a movie which could have been a million time better with more possible role in it. Adam Devine, why he was getting all the shots?

The film follows Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave (Zac Efron) place an online ad to find the perfect dates Alice(Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) for their sister's Hawaiian wedding. Hoping for a wild getaway, the boys instead find themselves outsmarted and out-partied. Supposedly this is based on a true story, but I assume there were a lot of liberates taken as a lot of the film is way too over the top to be believable. With that said, the movie is still pretty enjoyable for the most part. Some of the jokes don't land, and at times it seems the movie is crude just for the sake of being crude. I especially found Aubrey Plaza's character a bit too much at times. I really like Aubrey Plaza as an actor. I just didn't care for her character overall. The same goes for Adam Devine. He is a funny guy but tries too hard sometimes. Zac Efron plays his part well, but there isn't much depth there. Anna Kendrick, on the other hand, is the best part of the movie. Her character Alice actually has some depth to her as she goes from a recently dumped bride who is broken to a strong and confidant woman. She also has the best one-liners IMHO. In addition to this, Anna Kendrick looks simply stunning in this movie. It's not her traditional role as she has red hair and dresses kind of trashy at the start of the film. But she makes it work for the most part. There are still a couple of scenes where she isn't funny, and I could've lived without the drug usage and the events they cause. But overall, Anna is the best part of this movie, and I would dare say she alone makes it worth watching. It isn't her best performance or character, but it is far from her worst. As I said, this movie won't be for everyone, but it's a fun watch if you need an escape from reality for 90 minutes or if you just need a laugh.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

Other than singing at the end, Anna Kendrick is slightly miscast, but Aubrey Plaza is always fun and - though I'm hardly the target demographic for him - I can't help liking Zac Efron. The guy is funny. It's not just because of his abs that his career goes from strength to strength while DeVine's, comparatively, is stuttering a bit. And why does he give himself a capital V?

59,j_forbesy,Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,7,22 July 2016,"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is your typical raunchy summer comedy. The movie follows two wedding crasher like brothers that are given to order to bring respectable dates to there sister's wedding. In the typical comedy way, two not so respectable girls answer the call and pose as the respectable girls they need to be all in order to get a free holiday.Like most comedies, I often try to come into them with a low expectation. This was, if it was a decent laugh, then I'm not going to be disappointed. If it ends up being an all time classic comedy, even better. If you are planning to see this movie, I suggest to go in with these low expectations. I say this not because it is an awful movie in anyway, but because I it serves as a great TV watch. In the end, the focus of comedies is to make you laugh and at no point during this film did I feel that this movie was failing at this job.I thought the chemistry between the main four characters were fantastic. While there wasn't many situation where the four shared to focus at the same time, I thought the combinations of DeVine and Efron as brother, Kendrick and Plaza as best friends, and Efron and Kendrick and Plaza and DeVine as their paired romantic interests all worked really well. I thought from a cast perspective they all bounced off each other really nicely and created a real natural flow.The only downside I really had with the cast was DeVine. While I thought he worked really well in his pair ups, I just felt that as far as quality, his behind with the others such as Efron and Kendrick playing stand out roles. For me, DeVine shares a problem I also have with Melissa McCarthy in that I think in a supporting comedic role they are fantastic but when it comes to stepping up into that main role where they have to touch on more than one emotion they struggle a bit. This can really be seen in a scene where both Efron and DeVine's characters are upset and Efron pulls a real cry and DeVine just scrunches up his face. While it was pretty funny, it is scenes like that that shows he lacks that extra dimension. I felt like they could have easily had a few really emotional scenes throughout this film but with someone like DeVine, they can't tone it back and play a serious scene.Overall, this was a nice easy laugh. I don't think you have to be into the complete adult humour to enjoy but you have to be matured enough to see the funny side of some of the jokes.7/10",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

True Story!,8,9 August 2016,"Comedies set in Hawaii instantly remind me of 50 First Dates and Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and this isn't far off the mark. It's in the same vein as the comedies with the same title structure, Harold & Kumar Get The Munchies and I know Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, stupid but entertaining, and this happens to be one of the funniest films I've seen this year. It's the silly leading the crazy with brothers Mike, Adam Devine (Pitch Perfect, Workaholics), and Dave, Zac Efron are forced into getting 'nice' dates to keep them in check for their little sister, Jeanie's (Sugar Lyn Beard) wedding. Their online ad for dates go viral and in stream hundreds of annoying and funny applicants. But they end up getting duped by equally immature BFFs and real life best friends, Tatiana played by deadpan comedienne Aubrey Plaza (Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, Parks & Recreation, Funny People) and Alice played by Pitch Perfect singer star Anna Kendrick (Up In The Air, Into The Woods.) I could be wrong but I believe this might be Jake Szymanski's first main feature debut after many TV shorts and episodes, who is quite familiar with comedy being credited to directing shorts titled Denise Richards' Funbags, Zac Efron's Pool Party and Three Matthew McConaugheys and a Baby. It's hardly surprising that he has a good understanding at what makes people laugh especially with shock and awe. There's plenty of outrageously, awkward scenarios which ensures laugh-out-loud moments such as the quad bikes, Kumail Nanjiani (Central Intelligence, Life As We Know It) as Keanu the masseur and some embarrassing sexual encounters. What probably most shocking, if not too over-exaggerated, is that this is actually based on a true story, with the real life Mike and Dave getting cameos with over-competitive cousin Terry and according to a recent Vanity Fair interview, the brother are pretty much spot on!It's hilarious in parts and actually, going against the critics hate parade, it's not a bad story, the script is better than a lot of comedies out there, it doesn't lose slack and the soundtrack is good. You can tells the cast had fun with the out-takes and there's even a needless Branscombe Richmond (Renegades) cameo.

63,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 60,6,1 February 2017,"Strangely enough Zac Efron was in 3 comedy films in 2016, when the man lacks any sort of comedic conviction whatsoever. It's a good thing he has Adam DeVine to compensate for him in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates.The film follows Mike and Dave (DeVine and Efron), brothers who are always screwing up family parties with their wild sensibilities and attempts to snag women. So for their sister's wedding in Hawaii, their parents give them an ultimatum--either they bring nice girls as dates or they don't show up at all.Right away you think to yourself, ""Well they probably have a couple of female friends that are parent approved."" Whether or not this would work for the characters' dilemma, this simple solution is never addressed. Mike and Dave jump straight to placing an ad on Craigslist, advertising a free trip to Hawaii, because that's the easiest way to get strange women to go on vacation with you. The unrealistic thought process of the characters not only insults the audience's intelligence, but lets us know that the film is just a means to an end, uninterested in actual logic.Situations within a ridiculous premise still have to be cohesive to that ridiculous premise. Writers can't just do anything they want just because they've established a impractical scenario.After placing the ad, the guys get thousands of responses but inexplicably can't find girls who are acceptable enough for their parents' standards. Eventually, a pair of trashy girls (Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick) decide they want a free vacation and put on a nice-girl front so the guys will want to take them.There are plot holes galore in this setup, but it's also the time in the movie with the best comedy. The rest of the way includes some funny isolated moments, but for the most part it tapers off. Then when it tries to stretch the already-thinning plot, things get weird and unnecessary.With that said, I laughed more than I probably should have. DeVine has a true knack for comedy, which only serves to outshine his costars, constantly creating a juxtaposition of how poor the rest of them are.Besides the initial archetypes set for the characters, their personalities are constantly wavering. We're made to like and dislike certain characters on a whim based on what's convenient to the story at any given moment. I do applaud, however, that the film doesn't really waste time trying to create conflict and develop a relationship between the two girls. Whether this was inadvertent or intentional, it works in favor of the overall product.At one point in the story the film Wedding Crashers is mentioned, which only reminds us of what we could be watching instead.Twizard Rating: 60",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

66,The_moan_of_all_moans,The Comedic Apocalypse is coming.,1,29 September 2016,"After witnessing such a horrific film, I can't help but feel that we are barrelling towards a comedic apocalypse. Dramatic as that may sound, it is exactly where we're headed.To a world where jokes are outlawed and laughing is punishable by death. Where rebels hide away watching true comedies such as ""Airplane"",""Naked Gun"","" Stir Crazy""; the list could go on. Hunted down by the dim, those who have had their funny bones broken, whose tears of laughter have been sucked back into their humourless eyes. Too much?In an ironic twist, you may state that it is my inability to find comedy in this film, therefore my logic of impending doom on the Worlds laughter would be to blame on me and those who agree with me. Here's the thing. If you continue to make films like this and label it as comedy, eventually no-one will want comedies anymore, because what's the point in paying money to see a film, that's main purpose is to make you laugh, make you depressed? I mean, the four lead dweebs in this film are quite possibly the future of comedy films, take a second to let that sink in......the future! The likes of Richard Pryor, Gene Wilder, John Candy, Leslie Nielson, Robin Williams (I apologise for stopping here, the list is long) are no longer with us. It really is sad to see what comedy has now become, that people are out there that actually laugh at films like these.Fortunately I didn't fork out any money to watch this garbage, I witnessed it at home and (naively) put this on in an attempt to brighten my uneventful day. Oh how it failed. There was not one silver lining, not even the credits (like most people may say in a negative way) because then a long list of people's names who contributed to such a disastrous attempt at humour proceeded to make their way up my screen and that depressed me more. Why did I watch the entire film? I did turn it off 20 minutes in, but went back in because you have to give comedy a chance, it's easy to make someone laugh if you know how. None of these nitwits knew how.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

69,robertmaybeth,Tries mightily but lacks direction or energy,5,4 December 2020,"This is a movie i wanted to like, since it has a number of stars (Zac Efron, Anna Kendrick) whose films I've enjoyed in the past. But it's a movie that's just too hard to watch. The goal of the characters is obvious enough, since it's in the title, and the light-hearted premise would seem ripe for funny situations. Alas, not much of the sort ever seems to make it to the screen. The movie spins its wheels, not knowing where to go or what to do with the premise, and the most obvious thing to exploit - the minor tension implicit with the question ""how will they find their wedding dates?"" and more importantly, how it will all go wrong - is never explored in an entertaining way. There's a surprising lack of any sort of tension about any of the questions inherent in this light comedy...unfortunately, since it is seemingly the sole plot device in the whole movie.This movie misdirects at every opportunity, and wastes the talent its given. It doesn't manage to create any interest in any of the characters, even the two leads. I couldn't find enough interesting about it to keep watching, and that's too bad - the director and screenwriter should have been sent back to film school after this, really second rate effort.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
70,ragpap93,Mike and Dave Need Better Dates,4,24 July 2017,"A good premise but they placed the ad on Craig's list of all places. Guys like them deserve girls like them that much is true but the point here was to keep them in check for that you really need bouncers or military officers, nannies or babysitters even. Comedies nowadays push the envelope on that cringe factor and this is definitely one of them. At Hawaii things quickly take a turn for the worse. If you could tolerate the awkwardness then the humour is LOL. The parts where Dave and Alice were alone and talking were good. They had chemistry and seriously more of that was required but the movie makers decided we need more crude humour like the brother walking in on his sister while she is naked which was done twice. The first time it was overkill. A sensual orgasmic massage with Kumail. Kumail you are better than this man? That scene was not at all funny and brother Dave walks in followed immediately by Dave walking in on his date fingering his cousin for Rihana tickets. I know Tatiana it is Rihana but nothing is excusable for that. Alice and Jeanie take ecstasy with Dave walking in on his naked sister right after the horrible fight with Mike. It was funny but a line was crossed so the laughter leads to a feeling of depression. It gave me a headache because instead of sleeping I watched it late into the night. Damn I wish I stopped after watching the funny Carmichael show I would have slept contentedly.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
71,Oberrated,Another over-the-top comedy to mindlessly enjoy,6,7 July 2016,"Some may know that I am a big fan of Zac Efron and his comedy line of movies and 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' falls right along that line. This film had plenty of hilarious moments throughout and had me genuinely entertained with the amount of over-the-top humor it presented. On top of the moments, Anna Kendrick, Zac Efron, Adam Devine, and Aubrey Plaza did a great job every moment they were on screen, bringing the laughs every chance they could. I have been waiting to see Anna Kendrick let loose on screen for a while and with this film and also 'Get A Job', it was awesome to finally see that. Adam Devine is naturally ridiculous with every on-screen shot and never fails to get a laugh out of a crowd and even his co-stars (See gag reel at the end of the film). Although hilarious, an avid movie lover will notice the pointless and utterly ridiculous plot and sometimes way over-the-top antics. Regardless, this is just another raunchy comedy fit for mindless entertainment. I am a fan and if you like movies like 'Neighbors' or 'Dirty Grandpa', it will be one you will be a fan of too.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
72,makleen2,Well-made comedy with relateable characters,8,4 October 2017,"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (2016) is one of the funniest comedies I've seen in a long time. I try to watch anything with Aubrey Plaza in it, but didn't catch this one in the theater. Not only is it hilariously improvised, it's also based on a true story. The unbelievable misadventure of Mike and Dave Stangle, who were instructed to bring dates to their sister's wedding in Saratoga, New York, inspired the film. They posted an ad on Craigslist in February 2013, which went viral. Real life Mike and Dave, from Albany, even have a cameo in the film.In the movie version of events, Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave (Zac Efron) face an ultimatum from family members over a history of hard partying and ruining family gatherings. Their parents, Burt (Stephen Root) and Rosie (Stephanie Faracy) Stangle, insist they bring dates to their sister Jeanie's (Sugar Lyn Beard) wedding in Hawaii. She is marrying Eric (Sam Richardson), who is grounded and emotionally reserved. After their Craigslist ad goes viral, they run through a series of hilarious dates before meeting Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza), another pair of hard-partiers who pretend to be nice girls to get a free trip to Hawaii.Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates was written by Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien and directed by Jake Szymanski. Szymanski has directed dozens of video shorts and a few television episodes and TV movies, which might explain why the film felt like a series of skits seamlessly woven together. Make no mistake, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates not only has a plot, it also has character development, two things often missing from other recently-released comedies.The film is simply about four shallow, emotionally juvenile people maturing and finding happiness. Dave learns he needs a separate identity from his brother and decides to pursue his talent at drawing, Alice finally gets over being left at the altar and pursues a relationship with Dave, and Mike and Tatiana go into business together. They patch things up with their sister after derailing her ceremony, and use their talents to make sure Jeanie gets the Hawaii wedding she deserves. Even Eric gets to show he's not as straight-laced as he appears. It's not a complex story, but what else can you expect from a raunchy romantic comedy? Its only glaring plot hole involved the rivalry between Mike and his sexually ambiguous cousin, Terry (Alice Wetterlund). Terry and Mike are continually trying to one-up each other and compete for Tatiana's affection. Terry plays a key role in pushing Mike over the edge when he sees Terry and Tatiana in a steam room in flagrante delicto. As all other conflicts are being resolved, however, Terry seems to disappear from the movie. Terry does apologize for her behavior, but in a deleted scene. It's not a strong scene and I see why it was cut, but it leaves that whole subplot dangling in the air while everything else is tied up in a neat bow.In terms of characters, Adam Devine, Zac Efron, Anna Kendrick, and Aubrey Plaza were perfect for their roles. In the wrong hands, the four protagonists threatened to be annoying, unlikable, and generally disgusting human beings. Somehow they come off as sincere, well-intentioned, and charming, despite their lies, self-indulgence, and destructive behavior. It took skilled actors and actresses to maintain that delicate balance. Despite all the chaos they cause, the audience roots for them to clean up their acts and save the day.Most importantly, the characters are relateable. They are flawed and self-conscious, just like everyone in the audience. In one scene, Tatiana and Mike finally have a heartfelt conversation. Tatiana turns to Mike and says, ""I thought I was, like, destined for such great things, but I may never achieve anything."" Who hasn't felt like that at least once in their life? Aubrey Plaza conveys real emotional depth in her expressions. She shows her character's vulnerability while at the same time hinting she might have some affection for Mike after all.Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is relentlessly funny, but behind the crazy, over-the-top humor there's an actual movie with characters we like and relate to despite their flaws. That combination is what made this film so successful. Most critics hated it, but I agree with San Francisco Chronicle's Mick LaSalle when he wrote, ""The beauty of the film is that, though it is utterly coarse in its content, it's not coarse or sloppy in its craftsmanship.""",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
73,trevor-82944,Wow. What a Joke.,1,8 July 2016,"It's based on a true story sort of. Essentially, it began with these two single fellas whose parents complain to them that they're always starting trouble at every party. So in order to stay in line, they are told to find dates for their upcoming sister's wedding in Hawaii. As a joke, they throw an ad up on Craigslist, their description for the essential date looking something like this:  An excuse to get dressed up  Open bar & food all night  Eccentric/downright dangerous bro-2-bro dance moves (may need to sign a waiver)  Adventure  Mystery  Suspense  True LoveRoyalties once our night's story is developed into a romantic comedy**if this happens (we estimate the chances at 85%) we refuse the right to let Ashton Kutcher play either of our characters, however, we will consider him for a supporting role.Next thing they know, they get over 6,000 responses from girls who find them attractive, leading to appearances in talk shows and a series of mock-dates. Fox Studios even made the last part of their ad come true. The unfortunate result is a wild and mean-spirited ""comedy"" that exists for all the wrong reasons.The two leading males, Mike and Dave, are played by the overly handsome Adam Devine (Mike) and Zac Efron (Dave). Their dates are played by the even more overly attractive Aubrey Plaza (Mike's date) and Anna Kendrick (Dave's date). None of these four young stars are as funny as you'd think they are, and they each resort only to screaming like drunk bozos to spice up the sleazy screenplay. They're all unbearably annoying to watch, Anna Kendrick in particular. The supporting cast was equally as horrible, say for instance Sugar Lyn Beard, who plays the soon-to-be-married sister of Mike and Dave. She's not exactly a ""bad actress,"" she just has this annoying high-pitched voice that doesn't even sound that natural.But that's not even the worst of it. No, the worst is yet to come.There is no story, but rather a series of jokes that drag on and on and on without a clear punchline. Within the hour and thirty-eight minutes you'll need to suffer through, a girl falls off a roof and gets seriously hurt, a building catches fire at a 4th of July party, a grandfather dies at his birthday celebration, a girl gets hit in the face by an all-terrain vehicle and is heavily bruised the day before her wedding rehearsal, and all of these bits are intended to be the most hilarious thing ever. But did I laugh? Well no, but the audience in my screening were hysterical throughout the entire movie, which makes me incredibly worried.Emotional moments of redemption are attempted by the third act, but none of them are earned nor appropriate. The crazy events and dirty jokes all try to meet up in some sort of message about how life is not about getting the big things. Yeah, right. Just the number of ""should I really be laughing at this"" type of jokes glamorizes the romantic lifestyle rather than attacks it. So therefore, the redemption that this movie tries to get to is complete bull. In the end, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates becomes exactly how it started as: a joke. It thinks that funny is about being rebellious and mischievous, but there's no way that has any affect in the long run.Overall Grade: F",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

See, there's the problem right there: these guys are going to meet someone on short notice whom both will be so invested in that they'll behave? This is particularly bad when their search goes viral, as the randomness just gets higher.Plaza - playing essentially the same character she did on 'Parks and Rec' and Kendrick (really?) are two losers who decide to angle in just to get the free trip to Hawaii. Scheming on, they're in. So off they go.You would think two such women would be all over giving it up to the two hunky guys who gave them a free ""vacay"". That neither are, and that neither is really as hot as needed for the role, stunts any attempt at plot or story. That the sister and her (for no apparent reason, black) fiancé are both as dull as dishwater doesn't help. The guys' aggressive, bisexual cousin in the mix shows the desperation level the writers got to. Sauna scene - ugh.The guys aren't wild enough (Ephron being about as sensitive as possible) and the girls aren't hot enough, and no one is funny enough.Not too long ago, they would have amped up the raunch enough to make this marketable and funny. But the PC-balance now seemingly required for films keeps the sophomoric humor - about the only kind that will work here - at bay. Result: a couple funny moments in an otherwise forgettable film other than DeVine who is actually pretty good.Next time, get some hotties, have them have troubles keeping up their 'good girl' appearance, show some T&A, and see what happens.

I know this film was based on true events, and I guarantee the true events would have been far more entertaining than the ones depicted in this film. For he most part, the movie has a strong opening where we see how these two brothers party, but we also witness the aftermath of their wild antics. Things move well enough till we get to the point where they actually end up on Hawaii. At this point, things take a tumble off a cliff.2.

Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick are probably the worst additions to the cast, cause they are terribly unfunny. You would assume both Devine and Plaza would bring a certain level of comedy and timing, but they unfortunately don't and the jokes are misplaced.3. I'm not saying the movie is completely unfunny, but the most you get are a few chuckles here and there. Efron and Kendrick are better actors to star in a film like this, frankly this is below their standards. This should have been a direct to TV or DVD movie which featured some unknown/up-and-coming actors instead of bigger names filling the void.

81,yourfavoritecritic,Dumb and Fun,4,3 November 2020,"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates stars Zac Efron, Adam Devine, Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza and is about two hard partying brothers placing an online ad to find dates to their sisters wedding. So Mike and Dave was a comedy that I was sort of anticipating and well... I got what I wanted for the most part, a fun summer movie. Now this is a very simple film, so this'll be a shorter review as I don't have too much to say about this movie. So this is a very predictable story, you can see everything coming from a mile away and the ending is no surprise but what this movie does have going for it is great chemistry among the actors/actresses as well as this film oozes this cartoony nature that may be a turnoff to some people but worked quite well for me. So first off the acting is good, I enjoy all the actors in this film, I just wish they could have been in a film a little more original and funny but I thought they all worked quite well and I totally bought into Adam Devine and Zac Efron being brothers. Also like I was saying before this film is sort of different for the fact that it is not based in reality, this movie really plays out like a cartoon, nothing like the Jump Street movies but still nothing too realistic. A major downside to the film is that this movie feels very generic, like it is trying to play to young kids my age and it doesn't always work out. The film tries to cater a lot of jokes to millennial's, some of them so worn-out and tired, that they aren't even the slightest bit funny. Luckily this movie does feature some jokes that are laugh out loud hilarious and will keep me coming back. That's something I can't really explain about this movie, it isn't anything special, like it'll definitely be a comedy most people will forget but I loved its lighthearted nature and it just made me smile. It's a feel good dumb film that'll I'll definitely be re-watchng from time-to-time, in no way is it a good movie and my rating shouldn't be solely based on my enjoyment.

Granted Zac Efron has been in quite a few comedies as of late, but he needs to get out of them. This was a completely different role for Anna Kendrick (my #1), but she nailed it.

Then again I never understood why people found Adam Devine funny in the first place. He's the worst part of Pitch Perfect and he's the worst part of Mike and Dave.You can easily see that this is written by the same guys who wrote Neighbors. At least in Neighbors Zac had more opportunities to be funny. Also Anna Kendrick plays a character she's never really tried before and she actually excels at it. She doesn't have much depth but that's the writers fault not hers. Then again maybe I'm over analyzing a cheap comedy with cheap humor.Kumail Nanjiani is briefly in the movie and has probably the most weirdest and out of place scenes in any movie I can remember lately. I find his sense of humor more in tune with mine but because the scene was so far-fetched it didn't make me laugh. Aubrey Plaza is herself, like she is in everything. Only this time she's a tad too over the top. Generally I enjoy her sense of humor, but this time it was a miss for me. She's the female version of Vince Vaughn. Not in personality, in that she can't act as someone other than herself. I especially liked her in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.Zac Effron can act, he just wasn't given enough scenes to showcase this. Even if there was a scene with him, he is mostly harmless and unoffensive. There's a common theme with Zac Effron movies, it keeps with this movie just saying.Alice Wetterlund is actually the funniest person in the film. She plays the cousin to Mike and Dave who constantly tries to one up Adam Devine's character. She's calm, smart, and riles up Mike on purpose. I don't remember her character from The Interview that well, but you might recognize her from that.Verdict: The storytelling is predictable and some of the jokes are a Ferris wheel. If you're born in the early eighties or earlier you'll probably be offended by the movie and turn it off. So don't waste you're money. If you liked Neighbors then this is right up your alley. Zero laughs.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

Meat while the brothers look for redemption through them, so all could be kind and sweet as planned with no slips.BUT in the movie everything is basic and not characterased as it should be for these four characters, full with different colors and tinges.

I know it is formulaic, and the wedding theme has been done to death, but I couldn't help but like this movie. In spite of all its flaws, I enjoyed it and actually laughed many times throughout. I think its charm is due to the characters and their relationships to each other. These are people, albeit cartoonish people, who have a real love and affection for each other: the brothers have a strong connection and they deeply love their little sister, who is a wonderfully fresh personality, and her fiancé is a breath of fresh air in a genre full of clichés - a cautious, nerdy, introspective, good-hearted man who loves his wife- to-be more than anything in the world. The parents love their children despite their exasperation. There is lots of action and the actors play their parts with energy and affection for the characters - nobody is phoning it in. I would say the only weakness was with the wedding dates themselves, played by Aubrey Plaza, and Anna Kendrick. I'm lukewarm about both actresses and did not really like the characters they played - too mean and too stupid to be believed.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

The movie is not a bad watch. It is funny, but the humor sometimes fall into absolutely juvenile. It's entertaining enough, and acted fine, but this is another over the top comedy movie.
Still, it was enjoyable and not a bad way to kill some time",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
91,Songwriter_90210,"So Much Promise, So Little Delivery",3,26 September 2016,"One would think that with a cast line-up like this, how could you go wrong? That question has been answered, and the answer is: Easily, apparently.Aubrey Plaza is a fantastic up and coming actress. She holds so much promise. There's a gutsy, intelligent comedic actor just waiting to burst out. She just needs the proper vehicle. This, unfortunately, isn't it. I don't ever expect much (anymore) from Zach Efron, but interestingly, he was one of the brighter spots in this turkey of a film, and only when he was actually acting instead of trying to make us laugh. I only really laughed at one line in the movie, and it was his. The laughs are very few and very far between (unless you're starved for entertainment and/or have no real sense of humor), and when you do laugh, it's more of a chuckle than anything else. I think it's the writing, among other things that derails it. It's pretty bad. The film is uneven, and there aren't any ""punchlines"", only poorly delivered dialogue. Which is the fault of the director, mainly. You do see the actors trying very hard to make this movie more than what it is doomed to be, and I kind of felt sorry for them. Anna Kendrick is a very capable actress, and it's hard to see her in this schlock. A fantastic performance by this young actress is in the film Up In The Air, which is superb. If you're a fan of hers, watch her in that instead. Even if you've already seen it, it's worth a second viewing. Or third.Bottom line, after waiting to see this movie, I was a little upset that it wasted my time. I would have rather watched reruns of Parks & Recreation to get my Aubrey fix, than sit through this thing. Finally, what can I say about Adam Devine. He's a clown, who has been intermittently funny on Modern Family and in the first Pitch Perfect movie, but he's the type of person you laugh at, not with. He was just loud and obnoxious (and not in a good way). Although his humor is not my taste, I'm sure fans of his may at least tolerate him in 'Mike & Dave'. I could barely. Bottom line, miss this time-waster. You're better off.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

If films like this are anything to go by (another of his frat boy/party boy comedy onslaughts), getting old is going to hit him pretty hard, unless he concentrates on broadening his range rather than his impressive physique. (For those of you salivating for the money shot, you'll have to wait patiently as it's near the end of the movie).The main gripe I have with Mike and Daveis that it isn't funny or crude enough.

93,nickijjohnson,People take comedies too seriously,7,25 August 2016,I'll start with the obvious flaws of the movie. There was definitely some over-acting in this film however done in a very SNL type way which happens in a lot of comedies. The movie itself is raunchy and at times kind of corny. As with most Hollywood films the storyline was just okay. I would've liked more backstory on all the characters. For instance it's never said why Anna Kendrick's character gets left at the alter or how long they were together or how recent it happened. That all aside I thought it was pretty hilarious. It had some undeniably funny moments and even though these four characters seem shallow they all had human moments that showed a little depth to them. Besides how deep do you expect characters to be in a raunchy rom/com anyway. I think its funny when people see these type of films and complain about the language. People complained Dirty Grandpa was too over the top. It's literally called DIRTY grandpa. Anyway if you love funny over the top comedies with awesomely crude characters this will be hilarious to you.,Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
94,mother_of_popcorn,A Fun And Easy Watch,6,10 July 2016,"Zac Efron has starred in no shortage of comedies lately. With Dirty Grandpa and the Bad Neighbours franchise under his belt, he is really starting to flex his comedic muscles (so to speak). Therefore, it comes as no surprise that he stars in this hilarious 'loosely based on true events' romp, Mike And Dave Need Wedding Dates.Zac plays Dave Stangle, a dim-witted lad who is in the alcohol business with his equally dim older brother Mike (played by Adam Devine, who you will remember from Pitch Perfect and Modern Family). Both are notorious for their destructive behaviour at family get-togethers so when they are confronted by their fed-up father to bring sensible dates to their sister's upcoming destination wedding, they are on a mission to find the perfect girls.They end up with Alice and Tatiana (played by Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza respectively) who are far from wholesome but manage to convince the boys that they are. It's not until various unconventional situations occur that the ladies' true colours are revealed to the Stangle brothers who are now facing the dilemma of potentially ruining yet another family event.This film is what you would expect – a lot of crude humour and ridiculousness so don't expect anything more. My biggest fear was that (like most movies of this nature) the best bits are all in the trailer, leaving the film empty of anything fresh however I can safely say there are plenty other laughs to be had throughout.

The comedy set pieces rely on sexual humor, mostly nudity and many fall flat except the sequence where Adam Devine stumbles upon a few family members in throes of ecstasy. Anna Kendrick gave one of the most disappointing performances i have seen from her, she is usually very dependable but some line readings here were poor, she also looks out of place and embarrassed to be involved.

The concept of trying to find wedding dates for their sisters wedding is a plot for a good movie. That being said there were so many things they could have done better. I remember thinking half way through the movie ""where is this going?"" Overall I would give the plot a 5.Characters: I would say Zac Effron and Adam DeVine are what made this movie even remotely watchable. I like Anna Kendrick but not in this movie and I am not a fan of Aubrey Plaza at all, She is just not my style. Overall a 6 on Characters.Conclusion: I would say the worst part of the movie was the conclusion. The writers were teetering on a stupid funny movie and a funny movie with a romantic twist. Needless to say they went with stupid funny, with no real conclusion to the dates that they brought. Conclusion was a 3.Overall After a few days of watching movies that were action packed, this was a nice alternative.

Hilarity ensues when their dates turned out to be not who they appear to be.From the poster and the premise alone, you should know that this movie is going to be your typical comedy movie you watch while you were doing something else, say getting high, background noise, or even better: 10 minutes before you get down with your date. Most of the comedy works with zero context. I can see why this movie wasn't funny for some audiences, but one thing the movie knows and does it well: it knows who their target audiences are and they've done a pretty good job pandering to them.The movie has mediocre points at editing and scoring. The cast chemistry is definitely undeniable, but their potentials are so much wasted. All the lead actors have amazing comedic timing and can deliver lines suited to their talents, but the script and the scenes just doesn't show it. It's a shame since I watched this movie because I liked all the lead actors in it.However, the good points of the movie stopped right there. If you're looking for a quality comedy, you might want to look somewhere else.

Two immature brothers who are told by their family to bring responsible dates to their sisters wedding.Another film that seems to be just over the mark from what I believe to be a style of comedy devoted to the stereotype of teenage humour. Or at least that's what I thought from watching the joyless trailers for this film. But as always I walked into the screening room with an open mind. So did I actually end up laughing at Mike And Dave Need Wedding Dates? Well yes I did laugh a couple of times.... Not very many but a couple. But the problem is the distance of time between each laugh was way too long. I laughed right at the very start and thought this could actually be good. The trailers might have just mis-sold the film. Unfortunately I didn't laugh for another 20-30 minutes. And this seemed to be how the pace of the film went. And the main reason I laughed at the specific gags I laughed at was because they made a difference to the constant barrage of crude ""humour"" being thrown towards the audience. The biggest problem seems to be that this comedy isn't funny. The lead actors do a good job in making some scenes funnier and Zac Efron delivers one of his best performances of the year ,but then that's easily done for him after the trainwreck on steroids known as Dirty Grandpa and the unfunny Bad Neighbours 2. If the script was better then the film would be better. That's really the only thing wrong with the film. There is one main stand out actress who can't act for all the money in the world and this is the person who is playing the sister of Mike and Dave.Once again 2016 delivers another unfunny comedy but this one isn't as bad as others before it.

However, this was a comedy built on the performances of a select few actors, so it was a bit glaring when some of those performances were noticeably more enjoyable than others. Zac Efron's dull ""acting"" felt forced when paired with Adam Devine's innate hilarity, and Anna Kendrick's kindhearted ridiculousness helped drown out Aubrey Plaza's cacophonous attempt to add swagger to her monotone drawl.

Jokes are being forced into the dialog. Continuous usage of similar jokes in the same scenes are failure as well. Acting is pretty terrible, I mean comedies have never been known for a top notch acting, but still this is just rubbish. It seems like modern comedy actors are chosen only by their looks.

The cast are the reason I went to see the film. They severely disappointing for the majority of the film. There is one saving grace between Zac Efron and Anna Kendrick where they are are talking while sitting on a tree. It is sweet, nearly heartfelt and was thoroughly enjoying. That being said, this scene could not save the film from having one of the worst screenplays of all time. The cast were severely misused in this picture. Aubrey Plaza should use her quirky Parks and Rec talents here and this could be successful. She doesn't work as a conniving leading lady. Anna Kendrick should stick to her girl-next-door type of comedy. This crude comedy doesn't suit her. Zac Efron should do more work like Neighbours, where he acts very well against type as a disobeying college student. Here trying to play the voice of reason, it was an uncalculated risk that could have worked with an anyway decent script. Adam Devine is out of his depth. It pains me to say it because his work on Modern Family is brilliant and he is great in Pitch Perfect. This cast did not suit the film. Their personalities may, but not their acting skills. In summation, this picture is not worth seeing. The story has some potential when in the hands of a competent director and intelligent screenwriters. This is not the case. Poor directing, a truly awful script and the wrong cast, your 90 minutes is better spent watching a Woody Allen film which will give you more laughs and no awkwardness.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
113,ParsingHaus,Here's the Pitch Perfect-meets-Dirty Grandpa mashup that precisely no one asked for. And it's dumb. And sometimes hilarious.,6,7 July 2016,"There's a definite Apatow-type genre comedy making the rounds these days, consisting of semi-improvised dirty talk by young ne'er do wells who suddenly get super wholesome around act three. This is one of those, and it's a decent example of the breed — which is to say, not particularly intelligent and almost entirely dependent on (a) its cast and (b) the ability of said cast to pull off funny one liners.Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates isn't a good movie, but it does get you from (a) to (b). (Like that?)The titular Stangle brothers (Dave, played by Zac Efron, and Mike, Adam Devine) are thinly-sketched liquor salesmen with a serious failure to launch; while they bounce around all Animal House style, their parents lament the brothers' (utterly contrived) history of ruining family gatherings (by generally being manic and partying too hard). The parents implore the duo to stop chasing women and to find real, actual dates for their dear little sister's wedding.Their Craigslist ad soon goes viral, landing them a TV spot and the attention of an even bigger pair of screw ups, freshly unemployed drunks Tatiana and Alice, played by Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick. The wily ladies hatch a scheme to clean themselves up, land the guys, and score a free trip to Hawai'i. Of course, they do.The wedding gets royally boned, but that's not particularly funny or interesting. People also get sporadically wholesome, and ditto on that. These characters are thin and none has much of an arc save for bouncing around like pinballs between wholly artificial deep reveals. If it weren't for Plaza's foul-mouthed quips over sly, knowing glances, Kendrick's actually-kind-of-decent-after-all damaged damsel, Devine's babyface rants, and Efron's pure comedic charisma, this film would founder. But every now and then, the guys — and it is generally the guys, I think — hit one out of the park. There's some legitimately funny stuff in here. (It also has low points, like the cringe-worthy, 2010-era Adam Sandler-style cutting of the ATV crash scene. Feels like you're watching a cheap B-movie comedy.) Upshot, it's uneven.The supporting cast is decent here. I doubt you'll rush to the marquee to see Stephen Root, but he's good as the frustrated dad; Sugar Lyn Beard (now there's a name) does more with the little sister bridal role than she probably needs to, hamming it up to good effect. I enjoyed the choice of Sam Richardson as her fiancé, and similarly that the filmmakers made precisely no mention of the fact that the pending marriage was interracial. (But before you ring the bell and declare social justice achieved, consider the underlying premise of women as simple arm candy to soothe and control hyperactive man-boys — and gaze also upon Alice Wetterlund's ""Cousin Terry,"" a comic-relief predatory lesbian with a Tesla who certainly comes off like a stereotype, but to my knowledge, isn't — at least not yet.) Bell not rung.I will say, for a movie about pretending to be someone you're not, this film graciously shortchanges the inevitable reveal. (You know, that moment when a protagonist has fibbed to get where they are, reaped the rewards, and then has to come clean, despite having developed real feelings in the interim their poor counterpart is always dumbstruck and super hurt, whereas in real life they'd likely have smelled a rat and seen it all coming.) Reveals happen here, of course, but they don't seem to matter very much to anyone. Blink and you'll miss one of them. I like that.So, overall? I loved the first 15 minutes of this movie. I loved various other minutes of it, but nowhere near all of them. It has a saggy and dumb middle and it misses its shot at greatness by a substantial margin. But sometimes you're in the market for a lousy, R-rated comedy with a few high notes, some good looking leads, improvised quips, and nice Hawaiian scenery. There are other, better entries in this slim little canon (Forgetting Sarah Marshall comes immediately to mind), but this one isn't all bad. Summer's here. See a movie.Haus Verdict: About as smart as you thought it would be (not very), and sometimes a whole lot funnier. Efron really makes it for me. Is that weird?

I'm not going to critique this movie as a movie because that would be giving it credit as being a movie. Rather I am going to critique what's wrong with movies like these. When an audience watches a movie, regardless of how stupid they may be in everyday life, once they enter that theatre, their IQ's increase exponentially. They can tell when actors are riffing and improving on the spot. Actors, filmmakers, studios...just because you think something is funny at the time because someone said something ridiculous and unexpected doesn't mean it works for the rest of us. Most of the time, the characters in movies like these are arrogant, narcissistic and think their so wacky and crazy and anything that comes out of their mouths are funny. The characters act as though they are aware that their being watched by an audience, similarly to reality television. Why are comedies from the 20th century so much better and funnier then comedies from the 21st century? I believe it's because the characters from those films react and act as those characters should and they live and act as they should in the world in which their living. Most of the time in those films, the characters hardly ever crack any jokes. In fact, they often play the scene and the story incredibly straight.

I am not that crazy about Zach Effron, and David Levine but love Aubry Plaza and was on the fence with Anna Kendricks. I was surprised at how much I like this movie. I found my self laughing....a lot. This is one of the funniest and enjoyable movies I have watched in a long time. The two couples are very funny and have amazing chemistry. The rest of the supporting cast are really funny as well (massage guy/Lesbian cousin etc). It's a pretty standard plot, a wedding where everything goes wrong. :) But the dialogue between the two couples is hilarious.I think people who review Comedies miss the point completely. This movie will make you laugh, a lot. It's funny and ridiculous. It's not Shawshank Redemption lol.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
119,jayfemsantana,Not my cup of tea,5,31 July 2016,"This movie took me off guard, even though I knew I had an idea that it had to do with a wedding theme. A 98 minute movie directed by Jake Szymanski had comedy in it, but it also had an emotional attachment when it came to the big ""I do's"". One of the reason why I was interested on watching this movie was because one of the actors Zac Efron - Also known as Dave Stangle. I wont do the movie spoiler here, but if your currently married and don't think you can still manage any topic thats related to weddings, I don't recommend watching this movie. Unlike myself, I didn't think the whole entire film was going to be related to weddings, but it did. So I did get emotional, since my whole marriage didn't go as planned. But overall it was a beautiful movie, the meaning behind it was to never give up, that in every bad situation there's always a chance to fix things and that no matter what love can conquer every tragedy (for those that fight for hope). I just thought that this movie was going to be a little funnier and not so obvious when it cane to predicting what was going to happen next. I guess that even though I am a hopeless romantic, I felt like the theme of this film was divided into several categories and not just focused on one. The whole Production was filmed very well, the angles and locations that were chosen for this film made it looked very propelled. The editors did a great job, not once did I feel like my eyes got bored and looked away to see what was on my phone or if someone texted me. So it did kept me interested due to the fast cutting of the clips. The Audio production also did a great job on choosing the music for this film.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

Looks like it was written by a 12 year old that had nothing better to do one weekend. Awkward moments in the movie that tried to be funny but just weren't. I saw this for free on an airplane so at least I didn't pay, and I'm sure some of the movie was edited for content so I can only imagine how much worse the full/unedited version might be. Even though I watched the movie for free, it still wasn't worth the price of admission.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

Part of me wants to agree with the guys and gals that have given this sub-5. It doesn't have the depth that some comedies have, not all the characters are likable, some of their arcs are frankly unbelievable, and I have no idea whether some of the scenes are even slightly possible. If yes, sign me up, you'll know which scenes if you watch the film!HoweverDid I laugh my ass off for the best part of an hour and a half? Yes. Was I stone cold sober? No. Would I watch it again? Absolutely.Effron doesn't display the awesome acting you might be expecting from some of his other films, but he's definitely funny (if a little crass and childish at times, but hey it's called ""Mike and Dave need Wedding Dates, what are you expecting?!?? My regular movie buddy even turned to me and said so much).There's romance, there's comedy and, kind of, adventure (not sure on the one film classifiers at IMDb). Focus on the comedy. Accept that this is childish. Pour yourself a glass of something yummy, and just enjoy it for its silliness. Simple fun to be enjoyed by anyone who can see past some of the stupid lines, nonsensical plot themes and obvious set ups. Still enjoyed it though!",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
122,shelbymustang,This was a three-finger Poi kind of movie,3,31 March 2018,"The reference to ""three-finger Poi"" has nothing to do with one of the scenes from the movie. I gave it (3) stars for Anna Kendrick's ability to dumb herself down sufficiently for this stinker and constantly covering up her midsection whenever it was slightly visible in the flesh.

As Good as it Gets.. very funny movie ...Something About Mary was Too funny. This movie didn't get under the lowest bar for a funny, entertaining and well acted comedy. I barely chuckled until the outtakes. Maybe they should have made the movie with all the outtakes instead. There were younger folks laughing. I must have a different view of what's funny, more old school. Some of the best comedies had all pro comedians, Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder in Silver Streak. John Candy in Uncle Buck. the 80's side splitting Porky's and Tommy Boy. In the way back machine, Some Like it Hot was a 10 star funny Bone breaking movie.

The acting was OK and the story line was Completely predictable to its premise. There was a definite opportunity to make this film far better than what we got but overall the film was 'ok'. Nothing more and nothing less. Watch it when it comes on the Netflix or the Redbox but don't spend more than matinée price at the cinema. This is no Hangover but a film worth watching with a couple drinks in you. Thats pretty much it with this. The most disappointing aspect of this film was the fact that I was able to predict its story line from its trailer and that speaks volumes.

Gave the movie an 8 because I laughed so hard, it needs to have an unforgettable story line to get close to a 10.The movie had a simple story and flowed pretty obvious sequence. Anna Kendrick and Adam Devine has their own brand of humor, and the movie showed it off well. Made us laugh hysterically, lots of slapstick humor, and the jokes flowed well. Zac is not very creative, but even Anna has a hard time getting a word in around Adam, so Zac stayed in the shadow most of the time, but played it well.The movie was meant to be stupid and funny, and not to be taken seriously.

134,bennaismith,Horrendous Tinder jokes for 1.5 hours,1,18 July 2016,"A few years ago late night comedic TV show hosts used to do this thing where they'd just use internet terms outside of the internet as the entire punchline to a joke. They'd say ""YOLOOOOO!!!"" and ""L-O-L"" and ""Hashtag_____"". The joke was that they were old and using young peoples lingo and internet things are funny so you don't even need to write any material just say those words apparently. That was some of the cringiest work going about. The modern version of that is just saying ""Tinder"" over and over and over again or using shock words like ""finger ing"" and saying that over and over and over until it looses its comedic shock. Thats what happened in this movie. Seriously there was at least 9 tinder jokes that were awkwardly slapped into scenes. Adam devine was the only saving grace in this flick. And even still it was a weak poor performance from him. You're better off stringing together an entire season of Workaholics and watching that instead of this, because this felt like a workaholics episode but 50% less funny. It was really cring-y to watch the 2 chic characters try and act drunk for a good portion of the movie. They just slur their words and hicup a lot and mention ""fist ing"" and ""tinder"" and ""finger ing"" over and over, its not funny unless you've never been exposed to dirty humour before. Why didn't they just have a few drinks before filming? do some method acting would've made it more convincing then watching a clearly sober person act drunk. It looks like They were sipping on a fresh wheat grass juice under an umbrella and the director yelled ""action"" and they just started swaying around and slurring dialogue to appear inebriated. Hollywood seems to be the opposite to where it was years ago. The actors were all completely smashed drunk and on screen trying to act sober like Oliver Reed. The last thing I saw Audrey plaza in was that Father John Misty video and she was ace in those 3 mins. Sucked hard in this film though. Im not sure if we have reached peak shock humour but i'd say we'd be close. There's only so many times you can just shout shocking words before the audience members become accustomed to those and it no longer has a comedic angle. At least in Workaholics they'd get creative with words, mixing stuff together and generating some new phareses like ""Ayoooo-maggots!"" The worlds changed and I don't think you can get away with this sort of thing anymore. You have to at some point start writing some proper material instead of relying on the laugh that comes from an audience member hearing a dirty word they've herd a million times in private but never on the big screen. I think directors are forced to get Effron to take off his top in each movie because it translates to an extra 10 million views world wide $$$$$$$$. Hey the kid looks good. Shocking actor. Yes Audrey plazza even said ""Hashtag"" out loud as an actual joke in this film. pure toilet movie. Rubbish Trash Garbage",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
135,jamesallen198,A few laughs here and there...,7,23 September 2016,"Mike and Dave are two young brothers who...well as the title depicts need wedding dates, specifically for there sisters wedding. Based on a true story, I somehow feel the real events would have been funnier, yet this film did achieve a few laughs throughout the film. I like Zac Efron, and he played his part just right and you get everything you expect from him like in any of his roles. Adam Devine was also an okay addition to the cast, however I find he was a bit 'too much', maybe it was an accurate depiction but I'm not sure how I found it. Don't get me wrong he did have some funny scenes. I liked the chemistry between these two and they did pull off the idea of being brothers.The story was interesting, with the rest of the cast pulling off there parts fine. It is defiantly something to consider watching on a night in but maybe not an essential cinema viewing. There's not a lot to really say about this movie, it is what it is..Two wild brothers seek dates and the reckless events unfold. I personally just wish it was a bit more in depth of the 'hunt for dates' as with the sheer amount of applicants there could have been some great humour.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

Zac Effron is his usual self a lot like every role he has played this year.Also it is pointed out several times how attractive he is (it must be tiring being Zac Effron).Adam Devine is always over the top and is just way too cool and edgy....that's not a compliment,also he squeals a lot,almost like a girl and reacts like a girl after his date fingers a dike.Aubrey Plaza also like zac is a spitting image of her bad grandpa role and utterly annoys me with her ultra hip edgy cool talking and eye rolling.To quite its 2016 woman do sh&t....

A lot of movies now seem to base humor off of dick jokes, vulgar language, sexual content, which lately has been over-saturated in the film industry. This movie's humor definitely stems from that content, but it made me laugh my ass off. It didn't feel like they were trying too hard, and even though you could tell there wasn't much of a script, you could see the actors were having fun, and that showed on screen. I thought it was one of the funnier R rated movies I've seen in a while. So much better than Dirty Grandpa, which has Zac Efron and Aubrey Plaza as well, but where Dirty Grandpa was just flat out dirty with very little funny moments, Mike and Dave had tons of funny moments. If you can get past the fact it's immature, you'll have a good time. Not the greatest story, but it's got some heart and even more laughs. Enjoy.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

Boy was I wrong. It was hysterical! From beginning to end, I laughed hysterically. I loved the writing, the jokes and the overall intelligence behind the plot. The basic premise is that these two brothers are screwups, and their father is making them calm down and get dates so they don't mess up their sister's wedding.

144,Drunkk,2016 Strikes Again,1,11 December 2016,"This whole review will contain *SPOILERS* so if you don't want to know what happens then do not read it. That being said if I spoil it for you I am doing you a favor.This movie is in a genre where the bar is not set very high. You have to do very little to make a passable young adult romantic comedy. The sad part is this would have been entirely okay, and even what you would have expected, without the overdose of 2016 in it. I swear movie producers these days have a checklist that includes feminism, interracial dating, and general LGBT activities to make it out of production. None of these things would be a bad thing were it not for the way they slap you in the face with them. Allow me to explain:The premise of the movie is Mike and Dave are charged by their parents to find dates for their sisters wedding in Hawaii so they don't ""go stag"" and ruin it with general debauchery and flirting with everything that moves. Our heroes take to Craigslist to locate a suitable pair of women, but get more than they bargained for. This would be a standard young adult romcom these days that you would drink and laugh to, but not expect too much out of. However to meet the above quota I mentioned the studio decided to include these things into the storyline:1. The girls state that its their American right as strong individual feminists to table dance to Rihanna songs(I would say this is a parody were it not for this kind of thing happening the whole movie) 2. When the girls get to Hawaii instead of wanting to stay with their perspective dates, they stay in their own room together and partake in a scene where they are watching porn and hint that they are eventually going to masturbate together while watching it 3. They go ATV riding with the boys and the bride and groom. During this they find this huge hill and decide to jump it at speeds only a professional would attempt. The girls do awesome tricks no problem, while one boy is too chicken to do it and the other crashes his ATV into the brides face 4. Their bisexual female cousin Terry, who wears a vest and pants to the wedding, tries to steal one of the boys girlfriends throughout the film(because family steals families dates) 5. The girl being pursued wont sleep with her date but will gladly finger the bisexual cousin in the steam room for Rihanna tickets. 6. When the boy discovers the steam room fingering the cousin fights him and easily wins...because girl power 2016 7. One of the female dates slips the masseuse money to give the bride a happy ending before her wedding during her massage(being faithful is so last year). She doesn't actually get penetrated but she has multiple orgasms 8. The bride takes ecstasy at her rehearsal dinner and ends up completely naked sporting the biggest bush you could possibly have(bush == independent woman in 2016) 9. When the girl who fingered the cousin and the boy finally do have sex its at the very end. The interesting part is the position. The dude has his legs up and is sitting while the girl has hers completely together standing up and is thrusting into him. This would not actually work and is made to look like shes the one plowing him. 10. The bride and groom are an interracial couple. They have a funny way of dealing with this because the groom is the ONLY black guy(minus hule from breaking bad who isn't related to him) in the entire movie until the last 20 minutes. Even then they mostly shoot his family in far out or blurred shots and zoom in during the brides white family.If you took out the 10 things I just listed then you would have your standard 5 to 6/10 frat boy romcom. I have no idea why every movie now is forcing this stuff into their plot lines but it is getting very old. They should rename the movie Mike and Dave show us why Trump won the election.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

Not only the plot overall, where literally nothing happened. At all. Basically, every scene, and almost every line of dialogue was stupid and/or weird (and not the funny kind of weird). IMDb has it classified as ""Adventure, Comedy, Romance"", but I saw no adventure at all, and barely any romance; and the comedy in it was like... well, a parody of a parody, or something like that. And believe me, I am the type of person, who actually loves the ""silly and cute"" type of comedies (for which I am often labeled as ""shallow""). But this was too silly even for my tastes. Most of the time it was just stupid, rather than silly. And even the moments that were supposed to be cute had enough cringe worthy elements in them, that the fun and that ""aww"" feeling in them was ruined. And I'm not a prude. I have laughed at this kind of humor before, and have had lots of fun watching movies that use it. But it has to be done well. Here, it wasn't. The writers didn't do a good job, period.

I've heard people say it wasn't funny, it had no real plot and that the acting sucked. I couldn't disagree more! I read that the movie was nothing more than a bunch of bad jokes which is why I was pleasantly surprised when I realized the movie was so much more than that! The characters were lovable and the actors shared great chemistry. The jokes were funny. It had great character development, especially considering that most of the film took place during one weekend. And the movie had a lot of heart which based on other reviews, I wasn't expecting! I think some people just took it too seriously.

I like dirty comedies, so this was definitely my kind of humor. Anna Kendrick is adorable as usual, but it was fun to see her act like a stoner most of the movie. Adam DeVine and Zac Edron star as Mike and Dave, two slacker brothers who always screw up big family gatherings. When their sister, Jeanie is getting married, the family hold a type of 'intervention' for Mike and Dave and tell them to bring nice respectable women as their dates to the wedding. They even go on The Wendy Williams Show to advertise themselves, which catches the attention of Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) and Alice (Anna Kendrick) Tatiana and Alice are two best friends who are slackers, too. They get drunk and lose their jobs. Alice is going through a depression because her fiancé left her at the alter. Alice and Tatiana meet up with Mike and Dave and all get along real well.

154,emilyzap,Surprisingly funny!,8,3 August 2016,"I wasn't terribly excited for the comedy of this film, simply because the trailers seemed to splice scenes at awkward moments - but I was laughing hysterically for nearly the whole film! The relationship between the four leads was both funny and heartwarming, and while the comedy took a crude turn at times, it never stretched reality so far that I was taken out of the moment. Sidenote - the girl who plays ""little Genie"" absolutely blew me away with her performance! Very unexpected! Overall the film was nicely cast, save for a few roles that required very specific looks. Great suspense and soundtrack, great location, and great costuming!",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
155,pastisnow,It's Totally Gross,1,12 July 2016,"I went to this movie with my daughter and 13 year old granddaughter. This movie was rated as a comedy. From the start the foul language never stopped. We were appalled. The sexual situations left nothing to the imagination. Showing a lesbian type of sexual situation was totally inappropriate and not necessary. The full frontal nudity of one of the girls was uncalled for. It was a waste of our time and money. Actually, we want a refund!!! Had we known in advance how gross and foul this picture was we never would have purchased tickets for this movie. The trailers didn't indicate the foul language that shortly followed. Unfortunately I watched the trailers AFTER seeing the movie.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
156,nlion,Hilarious!,8,13 July 2016,"Laugh-out-loud hilarious from start to finish with a fun story line to boot. Admittedly I went in with low expectations but are you really expecting to see Shakespeare here? I was just hoping for a few laughs and instead got a really fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Zac Efron and Adam Devine deliver in their own right but Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza definitely steal the show. Director Jake Szymanski does a great job of keeping it light and funny while still delivering a story that tugs at the heart strings, not a lot but enough to make you care what happens. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fun movie that'll make them laugh the whole way through.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
157,mruss-61826,Simply Terrible - A Waste of Time and Money !!,1,17 July 2016,"My wife and I were hoping for an uplifting comedy. The short previews looked OK. The film though is total crap. It was like they were trying to break a record to see how many times the ""F"" word could be used in a film. Zac Efron is capable of so much more and we have enjoyed some of his previous films, I don't know how he stooped so low to be a part of such a low class film. The jokes were flat the plot was ridiculous. The acting was poor and over done. What a waste of $28 and 2 hours. If I compare this film with The Wedding Crashers or Step Brothers which were both eons in front of this film in humor plot and acting quality, I don't understand how the films director could lead it to such a poor result. If you decide to go - well at least we tried to warn you. Save your Time & Money and go see something else. My wife and I have made a pact that if we ever feel the way this film made us feel within the first 20 minutes we will walk out of the film & either ask for a refund or tickets to something else worth watching.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
158,brianbrick-98992,"rude, crude, lmao comedy",9,24 July 2016,"One of the funniest films in years, this crude and politically incorrect comedy was funny from the get-go thru the final credits. Never taking the plot too seriously, the film avoids necessary predictability, taking great advantage of the loose set-up to pile on the laughs throughout. I wasn't familiar with most of the cast, but whoever they were they delivered the laughs. This was the rare movie that didn't seem too long (cf. Cafe Society and Star Trek Beyond, both of which I saw this same weekend). An old-fashioned stupid sex comedy - a perfect escapist film for a day when the temp was climbing toward three digits. And it made me want to head back to Hawaii for my next vacation.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
159,palimino-88280,Thank god Zac Efron was in it!,2,23 August 2016,"Not worth your money! Probably one of the most random films I've seen that doesn't make any sense.The only thing worth watching about the film is Zac Efrons face and body - it's an amazing body but not even that could save this film. Don't worry ladies, if you get hit in the face by a quad bike the day before your wedding, all the bruising and swelling will be gone for your big day! Another weird part of the movie is the very random massage the bride gets. One minute the girls are bad then good then bad, makes no sense! Also the bride takes drugs like oh OK that's fine to take these from you! Didn't find the film funny, it's search for laughs but doesn't deserve any. I actually got bored watching this film. Absolute rubbish!",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
160,mamaru-70404,"This is a whole new level of ""waste of time and money""",1,26 August 2016,"I love comedies. I watch a lot of them. Cute, silly, stupid, clever - any. Some - good, some - bad, some - are really not so good.But this was a whole new lever of terrible. The script sounds like being written by 12 years old, but they usually don't use ""f-word"" as often. Who talk like that, even in a comedy? As for comedy acting skills - the girl who played Tatiana and Zach Efron are the only watchable there. There is no excuse for this waste of time, money and good actors. I feel really sorry for the girls and Zach. I guess, every actor has a film on their resume they would rather forget about. This is definitely one of them. I hope this is not the new Hollywood standard for comedies.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
161,rpasc,This was just awful.,1,29 October 2016,"This movie was a despicable way to show how disgusting human beings can be. I'm ashamed to be a part of their species because these people acted like such human trash. The people in here made fun of their own race and tried to display ""the little white girl"" as a racist snot nose and they also made of a mockery of Jesus as showing a dirty girl who didn't shower in a week as imprinting her face as Jesus. I'm so disgusted by this movie. These people are complete degenerates there wasn't one minute where I saw a funny moment but felt like I was going to get sick at their barbaric anecdotes.My fiancé wrote the above review and I absolutely agree with every word that is written here. I could only endure about 15 minutes of this dreck before shutting it off. Not only was the so-called humor completely stale and far fetched to the point where it becomes unbelievable and un-relatable, not only does the movie resort to using the same tired stereotypes to make it seem like the people involved with the film ""totally get"" the way ordinary people act (although they clearly don't), but of course they have to resort to the gratuitous mocking of Christian imagery and beliefs. I actually cracked the DVD in half and discarded the remains as a form of personal protest, and it was well worth it. Lest anyone think that this is merely the ramblings of a humorless, hyper-religious ignoramus, you can rest assured that any person with a sense of decency would agree that this film, just like so many others today, unfortunately play to the lowest common denominator. What a shame.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates

166,schofieldclytn-43874,Entertaining movie. Enough said.,8,26 February 2019,"Listen, leaving a bad review and taking a movie like this serous is just silly. The here is a successful film in my eyes. It stuck to its guns, it's a slapstick romantic comedy. Good actors playing the roles of a group of idiots, and they played it well. People calling it ""stupid, unrealistic, has a poor plot line"" (which I disagree with, the plot line is solid, also pretty unique in its own way. Meaning I've never heard of a movie with a plot similar to this.) These people don't understand that that's the way the cast/crew intended it to be looked at. The movie was made to make you laugh, and it worked for meAlso Aubrey Plaza is fiiiiiiiiiiiiiine.",Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
