0,TheLittleSongbird,Kill or be killed,7,6 December 2017,"While it was not a great or perfect film (particularly in the dialogue, ending and some of the acting), the first 'Final Destination' was entertaining and effective (especially with its terrific opening plane sequence and the creative deaths) with a fascinating idea done well.The bigger and bolder 'Final Destination 2' had its flaws but was just as good and perhaps the best of the four sequels. 'Final Destination 3' is just as big and bold, as well as gorier, and is also as good. 'The Final Destination' was however a big disappointment, easily the series' worst and to me the only bad film in the series. After wearing off and becoming stale in 'The Final Destination', despite the more of the same structure, 'Final Destination 5' shows the novelty returning and being refreshed and refined. It's as good as the previous three and a huge improvement over 'The Final Destination'.'Final Destination 5' isn't perfect. The down-time and exposition between the deaths is turgid and clumsily written, saying very little interesting.Characters are as shallow as to be expected, the dialogue is just as flimsy and the effects look pretty cheap.However, the opening bridge scene is spectacular and perhaps the best opening of the series. The ending is also the series' cleverest, the only truly shocking one and the least illogical and contrived. The story has more time to develop and while it uses the time it does it in a way that makes everything as tight as possible. Really enjoyed the interesting new plot rule that allows the tension and thrills to register strongly.Standing out in particular are the deaths. They are very scary, very inventive in terms of being bold and elaborate and surprisingly witty. They are also quite gory, but not gratuitously so or in a way where it's overused and abused. The laser-eye surgery and acupuncture ones are especially well done.Visually, 'Final Destination 5' is atmospheric and stylish. The music is suitably eerie and the direction shows a grasp and understanding of the genre and the ability to breathe life and freshness to a formula that should have been fatigued by now. In the acting stakes, it fares favourably too.On the whole, good fun. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Final Destination 5
1,Leofwine_draca,Wonderful 3D in a inventive final sequel,8,8 September 2011,"The latest - and last - in the 'shock death' horror series. Although THE FINAL DESTINATION was marketed as the last in the series, it made cash at the box office so here we are with yet another instalment. To date it's the final one, although it wouldn't surprise me should another come out at some point. After all, the simple premise has plenty of mileage in it. This is another 3D film, so the cinema really is the best place to see it; failing that, a home 3D Blu ray set-up will suffice. Unlike PIRANHA 3D, the entire film was shot in 3D and the effect is very noticeable in crowd and dialogue scenes as well as the money shots. The 3D effects are pretty darn fantastic, they just keep getting better and better, and to be honest I just wouldn't bother with a 2D version of this movie.As for the film itself, it's a mixture of the good and bad. The definite highlight of the entire film is the initial disaster, this time taking place on a suspension bridge. The CGI effects are the best I've seen in a movie and the whole set-piece is directed with expertise and skill. In fact, it's so good that it beats the vehicular pile-up in FINAL DESTINATION 2 to become the best so far of the entire series. It's just a shame that the rest of the film can't equal this kind of brilliance.We're left with a mix of painful deaths and even more painful plotting. The deaths are all show-stoppers and highly sadistic, with the best being the elaborate set-up at the acrobatic training. However, as the film progresses it seems to lose focus, and ends up run-of-the-mill by the end, although there is a neat last reel twist that ties in with the whole cyclic nature of these films.The characters are the worst yet, and a more disappointing bunch of faceless characters I couldn't imagine; these are about the blandest you can get for a teenage slasher flick (and this is a slasher film, just with death itself as the villain). The dialogue stinks and the storyline – which throws in desultory cop Courtney B. Vance and a novel way to attempt to cheat death – is a bore. Apart from the 3D carnage, the only thing I enjoyed was the welcome return of Tony Todd, sorely missed in the last instalment and bagging a meatier role this time around. Way to go, Tony!",Final Destination 5
2,SnoopyStyle,good improvement from 4 with a very nice twist,6,28 March 2015,"Sam Lawton (Nicholas D'Agosto) is going to his brother's wedding but his girlfriend Molly Harper (Emma Bell) cancels and breaks up. He is wrestling with a job offer in Paris. His friend boss Peter Friedkin (Miles Fisher) is trying to hide a relationship with intern Candice Hooper (Ellen Wroe). Olivia Castle (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) is a bitch. Isaac Palmer (P.J. Byrne) is a talkative womanizer. Nathan (Arlen Escarpeta) is pushed by union rep Roy and Dennis (David Koechner) is the big boss. The group is going to a business team-building retreat. The bridge collapses and most of them die. It turns out to be a dream and Sam is able to save 8 of the group. However death has different designs. Agent Jim Block (Courtney B. Vance) investigates but he doesn't believe Sam's explanation. Coroner William Bludworth (Tony Todd) warns them and gives them a possible solution.The opening bridge death dream sequence is great and a vast improvement over the previous racetrack sequence in 4. The CG looks much better this time around. The set pieces look realistic except maybe for the final kills. After the save, the individual kills are nothing new to the franchise. The laser eye surgery is a nice kill. There is something about being close to the eye that is truly creepy. Also the final twist is nicely constructed. And who doesn't love a kill montage.",Final Destination 5
3,claudio_carvalho,Death doesn't Like to be Cheated,7,14 December 2011,"The Presage Paper employees take a bus to spend the day in a retreat. Sam (Nicholas D'Agosto) is an aspirant chef and his girlfriend Molly (Emma Bell) has just ended their relationship, since he intends to take an internship in culinary art in France. While crossing a suspension- bridge that is in maintenance, Sam has a vision where everybody in the bus including him dies after the bridge collapsing. Sam asks the driver to open the door and he leaves the bus with Molly. His friend Peter Friedkin (Miles Fisher) and his girlfriend Candice Hooper (Ellen Wroe) follow Sam and Molly asking them to return to the bus. Olivia Castle (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood), Isaac Palmer (P.J. Byrne), Nathan (Arlen Escarpeta) and their boss Dennis Lapman (David Koechner ) also leave the bus. When the bridge collapses, they all do not die. The Federal Agent Jim Block (Courtney B. Vance) suspects of Sam, but sooner he receives the technical report concluding that the bridge collapsed due to natural causes (wind). During the funeral of their friends, a creepy man tells to Sam that death does not like to be cheated. Sooner Candice, Isaac and Olivia die in a stranger way and Sam recalls that the survivors are dying in the sequence that they had originally died. The next victim would be Nathan, but he accidentally causes the death of the rebel worker Roy. The survivors learn that if they trade spots with another victim, they receive the years left in the live of the victim. When I see the franchise ""Final Destination, I know exactly what I am going to see: a group of teenagers escaping from death in a first moment and then death chases each one of them since the storyline is always the same. ""Final Destination 5"" has excellent CGI and very creative deaths and never disappoints; therefore the intention of the director is accomplished. The sequence with the collapse of the bridge is very impressive. The acting is also good and in the end I liked this film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Premonição 5"" (""Premonition 5"")",Final Destination 5
4,nogodnomasters,WATCH YOUR STEP,7,29 April 2019,"If you have seen one of these before, you know the plot. The movie introduces the characters, in this case they are a group of office workers. They travel. One has a premonition of death and saves the group only to find out there exists an unseen expiration date on all of us, and if you go past that date you must die in a bizarre abnormal manner. If you have sat through all the ""Friday the 13th"" movies and thought they were all different, you might try this series. As for me, knowing basically the whole plot before it unfolds...over the last 5 films is a bit boring. The re-addition of Tony Todd issuing a warning as if he is ""Death"" himself was one of the highlights. Many of the main characters are named after famous horror directors: Peter Friedkin is named after ""The Exorcist"" director William Friedkin; Candice Hooper is named after Tobe Hooper who directed ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" and ""Poltergeist"";and Olivia Castle is named after William Castle who directed ""The Tingler"" and the original ""House on Haunted Hill.""Death has rules, just like killing vampires and zombies. You would think if you cheat death, then you must die. However, that is not the case. If you kill someone who wasn't supposed to die, you get their years.It is my understanding the DVD will have an alternate ending. The gore was fairly decent. The movie has a lot of things thrown at the camera. Clearly it was designed for 3-D.F-bomb, no sex or nudity",Final Destination 5
5,kosmasp,Back to the roots,8,23 January 2012,"I guess everyone felt that the Final Destination series was declining (no pun intended). Many might have liked the second movie, but the third one was the breaking point for many (I still kinda like the inventive death scenes in that). Fourth part is by far the worst (rating wise), but was named ""The Final Destination"", which suggested it was the end. And while this might not have been entirely true, it was a good thing they came up with this ""final"" installment of the series.This one goes back to what made the first one so good. And it's not the only thing that can be linked with those movies. Tony Todd is ""back"" again and you have the same premise as with the other movies. But in the end it proves to be more than that. And I'm not only talking about a (3-D) reprise of all the Deaths of the other movies put during the end credits ...",Final Destination 5
6,jboothmillard,Final Destination 5,5,3 March 2012,"The Final Destination franchise has been up and down over the years, the first and third films are probably the most watchable, and the least memorable being the previous fourth film, although it made a lot of money, hence another sequel. I read that the fourth film was apparently supposed to be the final film, this fifth entry does feel much more like a conclusion, directed by Steven Quale (Into the Storm). Basically, office worker Sam Lawton (Nicholas D'Agosto) is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. The bus is about to cross the North Bay Bridge, when Sam has a premonition that the suspension bridge will collapse, killing everyone, apart from his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper (Emma Bell) who he saves. In a panic, he persuades several people to get off the bud, and others to leave the before it collapses in reality. Sam saves Molly, along with friends Nathan Sears (Arlen Escarpeta) and Peter Friedkin (Miles Fisher), Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper (Ellen Wroe), his boss Dennis Lapman (David Koechner), and his co-workers Olivia Castle (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) and Isaac Palmer (P. J. Byrne). FBI agent Jim Block (Courtney B. Vance) believes that Sam has nothing to do with causing the bridge to collapse, but he says he will be keeping an eye on him. At the memorial service, a mysterious coroner, William Bludworth (Candyman's Tony Todd), tells the survivors that ""Death doesn't like to be cheated"" and warns them to be careful. The group ignore his creepy warning, believing it is nonsense, and leave. Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice her athletics routine, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she is killed snapping her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac steals a dead colleague's voucher for a Chinese spa, he is severely injured during an acupuncture session, but ultimately dies when a falling Buddha statue crushes his head. Bludworth was present at each other deaths, and he appears again. When questioned what is going on, he tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death (the Grim Reaper), they should take a life to regain their own. Meanwhile, Olivia is having laser eye surgery to treat her short-sighted vision. While the doctor leaves the room, there is a malfunction of the machinery, the laser is activated and sears Olivia's eye and hand. She manages to free herself from the operating chair, but Sam and Molly are too late to save her, as she trips and falls out of the window onto a car below, killing her and popping her eyeball from its socket. Sam concludes that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant when the bridge collapsed, so Nathan is next. Nathan has returned to work at the factory, he gets into an argument with co-worker Roy Carson (Brent Stait), Nathan pushes in front him in front of a lifting hook, which impales him. Nathan tells the other about this, they realise he has claimed Roy's lifespan by killing him and therefore he has been skipped. When Dennis arrives questioning the incident, Sam realises too late that he is next on Death's list, a wrench is launched by a belt sander and Dennis is killed when it hits him in the face. That evening, after working at a restaurant, Sam asks his supervisor to reserve the restaurant for a date with Molly. Peter has become unstable since Candice's death; he interrupts them and threatens to kill Molly to take her lifespan. Peter draws a gun and starts shooting at both Sam and Molly. Agent Block overhears the gunshots from outside. When he enters to intervene, Peter shoots him dead. Peter believes he is safe from Death but decides to kill Molly and Sam as they are witnesses to murder. The two men fight in the kitchen and Peter knocks Sam unconscious. Just as Peter is about to stab Molly with a kitchen knife, Sam wakes and stabs him in the bag with a large skewer, seemingly claiming Block's life as his. Two weeks later, Sam and Molly board a plane to Paris, France. As they take their seats, they notice a group of passengers being removed from the plane with one of them, Alex Browning, warning everyone to get off. This reveals that the plane they are on is Flight 180 from the first film, and the date is May 13, 2000. Sam and Molly are confused but settle down in their seats. Upon take-off, Sam has similar feelings like before, and overhears a hostess telling another passenger that Alex had a vision of the plane's destruction. It is already too late to escape, Sam and Molly both perish in the explosion that follows. Nathan meanwhile is in bar not far from the airport for Roy's memorial. He learns that Roy was already dying from a brain aneurysm that was close to bursting, meaning he was due to die ""any day now"". Nathan realises he is still in danger, and the landing gear from the plane comes through the roof and crushes Nathan, setting off the events of the first four films. Also starring Chasty Ballesteros as Spa Receptionist and Jasmin Dring as Cho. All the performances are alright, it is a clever concept that the villain is Death itself stalking the victims, the new ""kill or be killed"" plot is interesting enough, and the editing and pace is okay, but it is not quite as eerie and creepy as before. The chat in between slows it down a little, but for the long and spectacular opener, the inventive, gory, and often over-the deaths, most memorable involving gymnastics, acupuncture and laser eye surgery, the revealed prequel twist ending, and a montage of all the best deaths from the previous four films before the end credits, it is a worthwhile horror thriller. Worth watching!",Final Destination 5

8,BA_Harrison,Will anyone survive FD5?,8,1 April 2014,"There are very few long-running horror franchises where I can happily say that I have enjoyed every single chapter, but that is definitely the case with the wonderfully dumb and delightfully gory Final Destination series; admittedly that's probably because each successive sequel has been almost virtually identical in format to the enjoyable original, setting the stage with a spectacular disaster and allowing death to do the rest, but I have enjoyed them nevertheless.Part 5 certainly doesn't stray far from the formula. Barring one new plot device—the kill or be killed rule—and couple of twists that, if you've been paying attention, you may very well guess, this is business as usual: a group of people narrowly avoid being killed but find that their reprieve is only temporary while Death gets its act together. As always, expertly orchestrated and spectacularly gory demises await them all, and this time they're even bloodier than before!If, like me, you have enjoyed the previous instalments in this popular series, then it's almost certain that this one will also satisfy your yearning for inventive deaths and over the top splatter. I only hope that they keep 'em coming 'cos I'm not done yet.",Final Destination 5
9,paul_haakonsen,Quite good actually...,7,8 December 2011,"I was surprised to see a part 5 of this movie franchise, but it was a welcomed one though. And it was with some anticipation that I sat down to watch it.Initially, the story here in part 5 is the same as in the previous four movies. Despite liking all movies, seen with a reviewer's eyes, the story has been abused a tad too many times now. I mean, seriously, it is just the same story over and over in all 5 movies. But what makes it worthwhile and worth watching is the inventive and cruel ways that people meet their demise at. At least that is it for me, it is what drives me to keep watching these movies. I want to see what ways people die, and I want to see the effects.If you are a fan of the series, you definitely want to check out part 5 as well, as it is every bit as entertaining as the previous four, and the ways people die in this movie was cool - as in the previous movies as well. And the effects were quite nice, and it had just enough gore to keep most gorehounds well-fed as well.Despite enjoying the movie and the deaths, five movies cooked on the same broth is just getting too thin. You know the story already before you sit down to watch the movie, it is not a matter of if they die, it is a matter of how they die.One thing that was awesome in part 5 was the way they made it come full circle with the first original movie. That was a very inventive stroke of genius on the writer's part. Thumbs up for that twist, it was well worth it.The cast in ""Final Destination 5"" was pretty good. Again, lots of nicely talented young actors and actresses, and people here did a great job with their roles and bringing their characters out on the screen.""Final Destination 5"" is well worth a watch, if for nothing else, then for the death scenes alone.",Final Destination 5
10,BandSAboutMovies,A little better,5,3 September 2020,"Steven Quale was the second unit director of Titanic and Avatar before getting to make his own movies. He jumped into the Final Destination franchise, which had by now pretty much done it all when it came to brutally wiping teenagers out of existence. He was joined by Eric Heisserer, who wrote the remakes of A Nightmare On Elm Street and The Thing, as well as Lights Out, Arrival and Bird Box.They did what had never been done. They made a prequel instead of another story.Sam Lawton is about to cross the North Bay Bridge when he sees the bridge collapsing and only his ex-girlfriend Milly Harper surviving. So he keeps everyone off the bridge, which soon collapses. In case you haven't seen any of these films before, Death will make them all wish they had just become ex-people then.Luckily, Tony Todd is back as Bludworth. He takes a more involved role this time, telling the survivors that if they wish to live, they should kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge.Only Molly and Sam survive and they go to Paris together. Of course, they board Flight 180 and...we're right back to the first movie.Another major part of these films is the references to horror personalities. The fifth film references William Friedkin, Tobe Hooper and William Castle.Well, that was five movies from one franchise in a few days. We did it! We made it! Oh no, the computer is glowing! Instead of seeing my death coming, I'm just going to take whatever comes next. I've learned so much from these movies. Good bye, readers!",Final Destination 5
11,Coventry,"Less gore, (slightly) more substance",6,20 January 2012,"Penning down yet another sequel to the ""Final Destination"" franchise has got to be one of the easiest and most relaxing jobs there is in Hollywood! The original, released in 2000, still had the more or less innovative concept, but the next three sequels are basically the most simplistic horror movies you can think of. All the writers have to do is come up with a perilous type of setting or situation – a place where are horrendous large-scaled accidents can potentially occur, like race tracks or an amusement park – and, next to that, they only still need a small dozen of extended but incredibly cruel and sickening death sequences. The ""creative minds"" behind Final Destination movies don't even have to worry about maintaining a sense of reality or logic, because the more grotesque the deaths are the better! Therefore parts 2, 3 and 4 are the most hugely derivative and unmemorable horror movies that exist, but hey, the nowadays cinema public adores the senseless violence and the fresh young faces in the cast, so why wouldn't the producers exploit the formula to the max? Due to the above mentioned reasons, I personally wasn't in too much of a hurry to check out the fifth entry in the series, but a buddy of mine is a big fan of the series and since I'm always in the mood for some mindless violence, we watched it as soon as it became available on rental. I do have to give some extra credit to the people behind ""Final Destination 5"", for at least trying to pump a little more depth and innovation into the mundane format. The set-up and structure is still largely the same. A whole floor of administrative co-workers and managers are heading towards an external team building activity by bus. When stuck in traffic on a bridge where road works are going on, Sam Lawton suddenly has a creepily realistic vision of the bridge collapsing. He and a small group of others still manage to get off the bus, but they still meet their gruesome deaths trying to escape the bridge before it tumbles down entirely. As he snaps out of the vision, Sam hysterically warns the others and the same clique reach safety in time. They all assume they somehow miraculously evaded death, but we all know what happens next Now what exactly makes this fifth installment slightly more worthwhile than the others? Three main aspects, in fact, of which two are quite essential (or they are to me at least). First and foremost, the main characters and their handlings are more diverse, more plausible and even more likable. One of the characters becomes dangerously obsessed with the hope of ""skipping his turn"", some of the characters are even prepared to make sacrifices rather than the usual egocentric ones and the plot even introduces a distrusting policeman who seeks an explanation for all the sudden mysterious deaths. Secondly, and I might have to add an extra (minor) spoiler warning here, ""Final Destination 5"" admirably links itself to the very first movie in the series; actually making this installment a prequel even though you're not aware of it throughout the entire running time. When this specific sequence appears near the end of the film, I was positively surprised. Finally, I also think the death sequences deserve a bit of praise as well. They are definitely less gory (albeit still sufficiently nauseating, no worries) but occurring more everyday circumstances you can identify with. There's for example an excruciatingly painful gym accident and a routine operation going awry. Especially if you underwent the same kind of treatment, like yours truly has, it's a very unsettling scene to watch. In spite of the vastly positive improvements of this film, it still needs to be said that this still remains a largely unnoticeable horror film that you won't remember long afterwards.",Final Destination 5
12,michaelRokeefe,Suspension bridge of death.,6,11 February 2012,"Could this actually be the finale of the FINAL DESTINATION franchise? Steven Quale directs a group of co-workers on their way to a corporate retreat. As the private bus makes its way onto a suspension bridge one of the colleagues gets a premonition about the bridge being unstable causing a horrific collapse. A small group do manage to survive; but the shaken survivors begin getting killed in the order they escaped death on the crashing bridge. In spite of survivor's guilt, there seems to be an unseen entity, possibly Death itself...not satisfied with the living. Starring are: Nicholas D'Agosto, Emma Bell, Courtney B. Vance, David Koechner, Ellen Wroe, P.J. Byrne, Miles Fisher and Arlen Escarpeta. It seems the scenes of violence have gotten more gruesome, possibly why I like this better than the previous four.",Final Destination 5

14,hitchcockthelegend,You spin me right round baby right round like a record baby.,7,2 August 2015,"Hee, no surprise to find great division among horror fanatics, whatever the film or franchise, hot debate - even furious anger - can be found. FD5 has unsurprisingly garnered mixed reactions, but even allowing for the fact that as an idea it's a series that can't get better, part 5 is a considerable step up from the very poor part 4. It also boasts a neat trick of the tail, where some ingenuity is used to bring the series full circle, with a glint in the eye and a bloody tongue in the cheek.Once again the opening and closing credit sequences are superb, doffing its cap to what is undoubtedly a very popular horror franchise. The disaster that underpins the formula is one of the best to be staged, a mighty bridge collapse that terrifies and thrills in equal measure. Then of course it's same old same old, which you would think anyone venturing into watch would expect anyway. Acting is as usual mixed, but the deaths are up to the ingenious standard set throughout all the other films, and then a narrative twist at the finale arrives to seal the deal for a rollicking good time. We even get a welcome return of Tony Todd - Bonus! If it proves to be the final Final Destination then it's a fitting closure, because there is thought here. Anyone taking on another will have to come up with a whole new idea to appease the horror hordes.Enough Now. 7.5/10",Final Destination 5
15,Theo Robertson,A Good Way To End The Series,6,29 March 2015,"Death can't be cheated so you know what's coming next . Someone has a premonition of a disaster , they alert their friends . escape from the scene and find the disaster comes true and thank their lucky stars they escaped death . Next thing they know death comes for them in a series of cruel and graphic freak accidents There's not a lot of milage in this premise and there's an element that if you've seen one film you've seen them all . With FINAL DESTINATION 5 you spend much of the time feeling that the producers have become fed up with the franchise because the deaths show a lack of imagination . It sounds cruel and more than a little cynical but that's much of the selling point of the series being surprised as to how characters get killed and feeling something akin to enjoyment that the film makers have pulled the rug out from under you . It also suffers from the same fault as the previous instalment with having the gimmick of 3-D in order to shock the audience but it detracts from the impact of the deaths rather than embellish the impact . Another unimaginative element is the demographic where most of the characters are of a similar age . With hindsight the best film in the franchise is the second if only because the characters are much more diverse !!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!! As I said I spent most of the film thinking there's not much imagination to the proceedings and there's a suggestion you can escape death by killing someone in your place , a type of kill or be killed dilemma . A slightly desperate plot turn too since your dilemma is dying quickly or spending the rest of your natural life in an American maximum security prison so it's not really much of a dilemma . Then the producers play a blinder be having an ending I never saw coming in a million years and it's so simple and is a great way to finally wrap up the series which looks like ending with this movie",Final Destination 5
16,Hey_Sweden,Surprisingly effective.,7,15 July 2018,"""Final Destination 5"" adheres pretty closely to the formula established in the previous four films. Character A, in this case aspiring chef Sam (Nicholas D'Agosto, 'Gotham'), has a horrifying vision of a major catastrophe, and he and assorted others (who died during the vision) are frightened when they escape and witness the catastrophe actually taking place. They spend the rest of the film dying off in spectacular fashion, because as omnipresent coroner Bludworth (Tony ""Candyman"" Todd) likes to put it, ""Death doesn't like to be cheated."" They also have to wonder if it's at all possible to avoid what seems to be inevitable.This series still continues to be perversely entertaining in its over the top depictions of ultra-elaborate death set pieces, and the resulting cartoonish gore. It still plays that way at times, but at least writer Eric Heisserer (the ""Thing"" prequel) and director Steven Quale, the latter making his fictional feature debut, give us enough story and enough character detail to make our intended victims worth watching. They also make sure to give us little moments of foreshadowing that will pay off very soon. The filmmaking is slick, and the wholesale destruction of human bodies consistently offers amusement. One undeniable highlight is a case of laser eye surgery gone horribly wrong.Where this offers some truly interesting wrinkles is when: A) Peter Friedkin (Tom Cruise lookalike Miles Fisher, ""J. Edgar"") thinks he has a handle on solving his problem, and B) the denouement where events take a very circular turn. It rather reminded this viewer of the way the writers of the ""Saw"" sequels would go out of their way to tie events & characters together. But this was fairly clever, and appreciated.The cast is personable. D'Agosto and Emma Bell ('The Walking Dead') as his sweetie are likeable, P.J. Byrne (""The Wolf of Wall Street"") is a hoot as an uber-sleazy moron, Arlen Escarpeta (the ""Friday the 13th"" reboot) is engaging, and there are also roles for veterans David Koechner (""Anchorman"") and Courtney B. Vance ('Law & Order: Criminal Intent'), the latter playing an appropriately befuddled Federal agent.A reel of highlights from all the previous films precedes the end credits, and one has to feel that this fifth entry does provide a sense of closure...unless, of course, some producer or suit decides to resurrect the series at some point.Seven out of 10.",Final Destination 5
17,zardoz-13,"Not As Good As Earlier ""Destinations""",7,15 August 2011,"The latest ""Final Destination"" sequel ""Final Destination 5"" burns, boils, fries, roasts, slices, dices, hooks, crushes, electrocutes, and disembowels several characters. Some even find themselves impaled on items either as tiny as acupuncture needles or as towering as a sailboat mast. Death is certainly never dull despite the dull characters that it claims. Since ""Final Destination 3,"" the victims have grown awfully forgettable, and those in the fourth sequel amount to little more than one-dimensional pawns. Freshman director Steven Quale and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" scenarist Eric Heisserer glamorize the spectacle of death with the same wicked cinematic abandon of their illustrious predecessors. Mind you, ""Final Destination 5"" does not top the third sequel ""The Final Destination"" that opened with a terrific raceway sequence. The only thing wrong with the superlative 3-D effects in ""Final Destination 5"" is the scarcity of sensational scenes that are enhanced by them. The 'cheap thrills' 3-D here sends everything from severed limbs to flying eyeballs on a collision course with the audience. If you like to flinch at horrible things hurled at you, you'll enjoy this cynical, far-fetched escapade. The biggest problem with ""Final Destination 5"" is that no disaster rivals the first accident on the suspension bridge. Death in the ""Final Destination"" movies occurs as a consequence of outlandish chain-reactions designed along the lines of a Rube Goldberg machine. Before each expendable character perishes, we are treated to a number of coincidences which culminate in a very gory, gruesome demise for that unfortunate individual. Just to assure us that none of these deaths is too tragic, Quale and Heisserer cap them off with a macabre prank. For example, a woman suffers incredible torment trapped under a surgical laser that eviscerates her eyeball. Of course, the squeamish should probably shun ""Final Destination 5"" for scenes like this that gave the 92-minute film an R-rating for strong violent/gruesome accidents, and some profanity.While he toils on the day shift at a paper plant, Sam Lawton (Nicholas D'Agosto of ""Fired-Up!"") spends his nights working at a local restaurant. Our protagonist dreams about becoming a chef. Imagine his reaction when he learns that a culinary internship in Paris is his for the taking. The catch is that if Sam leaves for Paris, he will have to split up with his coworker and girlfriend, Molly Harper (Emma Bell of ""Frozen""), who cannot join him. Sam tries to work out something amicable with Molly as they accompany their boss Peter (Tom Cruise look-alike Miles Fisher of ""Superhero Movie""), and their callous superior, Dennis (David Koechner of ""The Comebacks""), for a corporate retreat. Meantime, Peter's personal intern, college gymnast Candice Hooper (television actress Ellen Wroe), the provocative Olivia (soap opera actress Jacqueline MacInnes Wood), and software guru Isaac (P. J. Byrne of ""29 Palms"") are attending the retreat.As he rides a chartered bus to the retreat, Sam has a frightening premonition. In his imagination, Sam watches as the suspension bridge collapses under their bus, and everybody but Molly dies. Abruptly, Sam awakens from his reverie. He wastes no time evacuating the bus with Molly. The rest of his dubious co-workers follow at his heels and are grateful afterward. In the first ""Final Destination,"" the hero had a similar premonition that his high school class' flight would crash after take-off. During the rest of ""Final Destination,"" the teens died in freak accidents because they got off the jet. After Sam and company survive the bridge accident, they spend the rest of ""Final Destination 5"" trying to stay alive as one outlandish event after another occurs. At the same time, a suspicious Federal Agent named Block (Courtney B. Vance of ""Dangerous Minds""), has his doubts about Sam's premonition. It doesn't help matters for Block when the authorities rule that the bridge disaster was an accident. After their close encounters with death on the suspension bridge, each of Sam's co-workers find themselves confronting death again, and City Coroner William Bludworth (Tony Todd of ""Candyman"") isn't surprised by their fate.Ironically, the ""Final Destination"" franchise has produced more sequels with ""Final"" in the title than any other franchise. However, nothing except death is final in these derivative thrillers. The ""Final Destination"" movies have been going strong since 2000. These are essentially supernatural sagas because you never see the specter of death that acts as an insane architect in conjuring up scenes of accidental overkill. The first two epics rank as classics, while the rest qualify as little more than elaborate but clever depictions of accidental death. Of course, the ""Final Destination"" movies pale by comparison with the actual thing in the ""Faces of Death"" documentaries. Meanwhile, the first two shared some characters, primarily actress Ali Larter's heroine Clear Rivers and Tony Todd's William Bludworth. Beginning with ""Final Destination 3,"" the franchise shunned continuity. Bludworth didn't appear in either ""Final Destination 3"" or ""The Final Destination"" (2009). Basically, the stories about men and women cheating death never change. Several characters survive a near-death experience and then spend the rest of the film awaiting their dismal fate. Like surviving the Marine Corps, only the few elude the Grim Reaper. Quale, who served as James Cameron's second-unit director on ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar,"" doesn't let ""Final Destination 5"" wear out its welcome.",Final Destination 5
18,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Entertaining enough series entry,8,26 October 2015,"When a group of survivors of a devastating bridge collapse suddenly start turning up dead in a series of freak accidents, the others learn that they were meant to die on that day and try to prevent it from happening to them as well.As much as this one provides a lot to absolutely love, there's still a few problems here that do keep this down. When this one works, it's enjoyable mainly for its high-quality action along the way here, starting with the absolutely fantastic opening hallucination here as the small cracks in the road lead to the series of rather fun roadways dropping off into the water below taking people and cars along with setting up the series of support collapses that take out several others along the way as the fleeing survivors are taken out as they try to escape back to safety in a fun sequence that serves as a rather enjoyable opening. When it comes to the real accident and the events relating to the escape gives this one a really enjoyable beginning. Other fun moments here come from the spectacular attacks along the way as the deaths are a lot of fun if a bit hokey at times in the Rube Goldberg-ness of their set-ups, especially the gymnast accident and their co-workers' accident in the factory are just fun if goofy and ill- thought-out even though in all the kills the gore is spectacular and the suspense is decently handled. The set-up in the massage parlor and the doctor's office work the best here, which are really chilling and make for some fine times here giving this one enough positives to hold out over the few flaws here. The biggest one here is the revelation added to the storyline here, though the new twist on the hero's plight doesn't make much sense. For something as supposedly vicious and cruel as what's stalking the heroes to just roll over like it does here with this new twist doesn't really make any sense at all, for that changes around the entire purpose of the events that transpire. It's barely even integrated into the story and seems placed there merely to give this one something new without really doing anything original or creative here. That also ends up giving us the finale in the restaurant which has no business being here and nearly ruins the film on its own just for its inclusion. The only other flaw here is the pace, since it's also way to lax about going after them once they've survived, taking forever to start knocking them off and we get way too much time with their personal lives here, making it way too boring in the first half. All in all, it's a pretty decent entry if not overly spectacular.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Final Destination 5
19,FlashCallahan,Kill or be Killed.......,6,29 August 2011,"So it continues with part five. If you don't know the plot by now, then you shouldn't be on this page.Guy has a premonition of an accident, warns people to get off the bus, the survivors start dying in freak accidents, Candyman appears to be stalking them at first, then gives them advice, in a very camp way.Candles blow, the film makers show us things unscrewing or water falling on electric, and then splat, some cool money shot deaths.And there is always a twist at the end. But for some reason, the film makers have decided that if the victims kill someone, they get their 'years'. Why didn't Todd inform the people on flight 180 of this? It's a great move that they decided to do a prequel and not let the viewer know until five minutes before the end. There are hints, trips to Paris, old mobile phones, but if you don't read spoilers (like i did) then these ae very hard to spot.The opening disaster is one of the best in the series, and is on a par with part two. it's quite a traumatic opening sequence, letting you know it's going to be a lot darker than the previous efforts.After the gymnast scene, which is the standout death, things start to go downhill, and come the final act, apart from the major twist, it becomes very absurd and way off track from the other films.The cast are just there to look at, and they are second rate eye candy, apart from a couple of actors, the calibre of acting is bad.Todd puts some effort into his role, but then he is candyman, and knows he will live and just walks around with a swagger and a knowing nod.3D is surprisingly good, and used sparingly, but is very effective come more of the gorier scenes.All in all it's not a bad film, better than the fourth, but the franchise is running out of steam very fast.Given the matter of the final scenes, it seems it would be a good time for the reaper to hang up his scythe now, as another instalment would be suicide.Then again, if one of the victims committed suicide, what would happen to the rest of the survivors? How would death take to the changing of the pattern?If that gets made, i want my cut New Line......",Final Destination 5
20,phd_travel,Better than the previous one,7,17 February 2012,Something about this formula works. There have been so many. This time the disaster takes place on a bridge and it is quite spectacular. The acting is alright. Nicholas D'Agosto is quite good as the lead. Emma Bell looks a bit too worried throughout. The supporting cast could have been more attractive. The ways to die are quite creative but a little too gruesome at times like the lasik. But what do you expect for this genre. Didn't like the part in the restaurant where one of them came after the other 2. Felt contrived.Liked the way things linked up at the end. Overall better than the last one. I guess we will see another.,Final Destination 5
21,Wuchakk,"One of the best of the franchise, if not THE best",7,17 November 2018,"The first ""Final Destination"" movie in 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, an invisible spirit. A group of people, mostly youths, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying the kids who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually an unlikely chain of events. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash, in the second a highway pile-up, in the third a rollercoaster mishap, in the fourth a racetrack calamity. In this fifth and most recent film (2011) it's a spectacular bridge collapse and it's probably the best opening tragedy of the franchise.All of the movies in the series tell the same basic story with different characters and minor nuances; all of them are of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on your preference for cast members and the death sequences (and the locations). Other than these factors they're all basically the same.""Final Destination 5"" features Nicholas D'Agosto as the main protagonist with Emma Bell as his blonde girlfriend. Tom Cruise lookalike, Miles Fisher, is also on hand while Ellen Wroe plays the gymnast. Meanwhile Tony Todd returns as the creepy coroner who seems to know more about the situation than he should.While it's true that you know exactly how this film will play out if you've seen the first four installments, or any of them, there are some highlights beyond the females. For one, this movie has a superb score and soundtrack, at least on par with the previous installment. Aside from featuring the most thrilling opening tragedy, there are several creative death scenes involving a gymnast accident, an Asian spa, eye surgery, a factory mishap and a restaurant altercation. This entry also throws in a unique twist that I'm not going to give away (but if you've seen the trailer you already know what it is). There's an additional surprise at the end, which nicely wraps up the five-movie franchise.The film runs 92 minutes and, like the first three films, was shot in the Vancouver area (the fourth film was shot in the East).GRADE: B+",Final Destination 5
22,trashgang,back to the beginning,7,23 January 2012,"The Final Destination or part 4 should have been the last entry into the franchise but the success made money go around to create part 5. And this time it was okay. No 3D that led to shots made towards the 3D effect. It was also Steven Quale's first attempt to make his first full feature. But he clearly knew his stuff from being second unit director at Avatar and Titanic.Final Destination is, you can't deny it, just made for the killings, all the stories are the same and here is no exception. But what a great opening sequence at a bridge. It's naturally full of CGI but this time it didn't bother me at all because it worked and the death worked this time on two parts, the CGI killings were believable and Tony Todd was back in business. I found the story a bit weak but as I said, that's a bit normal for Final Destination but the end sequence is again of great CGI quality. And it takes us back to Final Destination part 1. Remember the vision of a plane crash and the fight on board of the air plane, well it all comes back here. On the other hand the end credits made a compilation of almost all the killings in the franchise and makes it a gory ending. Emma Bell did well here (Frozen, Hatchet 2) as did the other because there are other thespians from the horror scene. Just look at the dead of the gymnastic, that really had some suspense.Overall a typical Final Destination flick with some great death scene's and good use of CGI and even some funny parts with the death of Olivia Castle (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood (Piranha 3DD)) once she loses her eye and a car drives by.Gore 3/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 1/5",Final Destination 5
23,StevePulaski,"I like my horror without comedy, and my destinations final",9,20 August 2011,"Final Destination 5 is an extraordinary revival to the long-running series that started eleven years ago. Not only does it display an excellent, glossy, well-utilized 3D formula, but it also revives the series after a lackluster fourth installment. Ever drop your iPod or cell phone by accident, while your headphones are plugged into it, and the cord of the headphones barely saves it from hitting the ground. Think of the device as The Final Destination, and the cord as Final Destination 5.The 3D scheme, just like the previous film, is perfect. I don't think I've seen a better 3D film ever. I stated that the fourth installment of this series, while poor in comparison to the previous films, presented an excellent 3D nature. This does the same only better. But I can see a 2D viewing will make the whole look and feel awkward, and pointless. If you're going to see Final Destination 5, the theater is the place.The story doesn't change. A young male (D'Agosto) has a premonition on a bus with co-workers to a retreat that upon driving on a suspension bridge, it will soon collapse and kill everyone on the bus. He awakens, makes a commotion, gets many people off of the bus, then realizes his premonition has come true. But ""Death"" is now coming back, picking off every character piece by piece in the order they would've died if they stayed on the bridge.Special effect work, along with use of well-crafted death scenes, deserve nothing but applause here. This is why I love the franchise, and why I have loved it for so long. By the fifth film in horror franchises, they have already shown signs of ware and tear, but not Final Destination 5. It's still got spunk.Suspense is back too. Full force. In The Final Destination, we hardly got any contrived suspense and everything happened so quickly that we were left without a shock or surprise in our system. Most of the deaths were just quick, instantaneous little scenes that accomplished almost nothing. Here, you can't even trust every little sign or camera close up on an object. It may not even have anything to do with the death scene. Even the trailer does a good job of not showing all the death scenes. They show parts, but not the actual execution. Brilliant job to the editors.The ending? Back in business. No cheaply made short in an art program to pass as an ending like the fourth film. We get an ending that will satisfy any fan of the series. It shows itself to be something we didn't expect - a prequel. A long time fan of the series, like myself, was left in disbelief and shock. The good kind.Even the design has been tinkered with to give the slight feeling of a new formula taking effect. I will not explain it because it's not the most simplistic of schemes, but it does prevent repetition. Eric Heisserer, the screenwriter for all four previous films, has stepped up his game and has given not only a new entry in Death's plan, but more character development making up for the emptiness in, yes, the fourth film.Though the film is great, and honestly one of the better sequels in the franchise, there's one minor problems. The dialog between the characters is so wooden, stiff, and dull it needs acupuncture treatment from the elderly Chinese woman in the film. Miles Fisher, the doppleganger for Tom Cruise in the Top Gun days says his lines like the director is holding a cue-card right in front of him. It doesn't help matters, but it doesn't completely destroy them.This is the first time in the entire series that (1) a new director was brought in to play (Steven Quale, respectively) and (2) viral marketing was used. Steven Quale darkens the series and uses special effects to the film's advantage. The previous installment was directed by David R. Ellis who ultimately influenced comedy on the series rather than keeping the eerie format like he did in the second film. Miles Fisher also recorded a song and music video called ""New Romance"" to pay homage to the series while adding a Saved by the Bell style setting. You need to see it to believe it.From the disgustingly gruesome 3D, the excellent premonition sequence in the beginning which is arguably the best of them all, the darker approach, the character development, a clever piece added to the puzzle, the return of a very spooky character, a fantastic full circle ending, and the icing being a fantastic montage at the end, Final Destination 5 pulls the series back to its feet and tells it ""You're not done yet soldier. Just stop moseying around the comedy field."" Starring: Nicholas D'Agosto, Emma Bell, Miles Fisher, Arlen Escarpeta, David Koechner, and Tony Todd. Directed by: Steven Quale.",Final Destination 5
24,Smells_Like_Cheese,The Mouse Trap of Death,9,12 January 2012,"You know the last Final Destination film there was a word in front of it which named the title ""THE Final Destination"", I figured that was the last of the films. But I suppose they were just having fun seeing all the money the series was making and decided to give it another try. But how about giving us something different? And boy did they ever! I have to say that this is by far next to the first one my favorite of the Final Destination films. As silly and over the top as they are, you know you go into these films just looking forward to the death scenes. Death has a very clever way of killing people, he's like the Mouse Trap gamehe just likes to have fun I guess. Tony Todd is back to give the premonition warnings to the new group of teens which one looks like a cross breed between Tom Cruise and Brandon Roth and one who I knew that mole looked familiar from Election! Sorry, I just love it when I guess an actor right off the bat. But believe me when I say this is one of the best sequels by far with a great twist ending.Sam is on his way to a company retreat with his co-workers. While his bus is crossing North Bay Bridge, Sam suffers a premonition that the bridge will collapse, where everyone, including him, is killed. Panicked, he persuades his girlfriend Molly his friends Peter and Nathan, Peter's girlfriend Candice, his boss Dennis, Olivia and coworker Isaac to leave the bridge before it collapses. Following the memorial service, local coroner William Bludworth mysteriously warns the survivors that they have cheated Death. They ignore his warnings and move on with their lives. Of course in order they are killed off one by one learning how they have to put a sacrifice in their place in order to get out of death.I had a small feeling in my gut with the ending as I'm about to spoil it so please don't read on further. Sam mentions he has a flight to Paris and I was like ""wait, in the first film wasn't the group on a trip to Paris? That'd be great if this was a prequel"" and it turns out I was right! I wish I was watching this with my friends as I always somehow guess correctly when it comes to twist endings. I'm just sick, I've seen too many movies. However, I really loved this movie. Between the awesome death scenes, the gymnastic scene and the massage was just great. There's even a cringe worthy scene of eye laser surgery that I'm sure will get you covering your mouth and eyes, it was creepy. The effects are great as always and I'm such a crazy gore hound that I love the first vision as always. The bridge collapsing was just terrific and done so well. Every time you saw someone die you just would scream and have a good time with it. I really do like most of these Final Destination movies, they are a lot of fun and just a great idea in general. The only thing I would have changed in this film was to have Miles Fisher jump up on a couch and start laughing maniacally, because somewhere Tom Cruise must be wondering ""Do I have a son somewhere that I don't know about?"".9/10",Final Destination 5
25,KineticSeoul,Back to it's roots of being somewhat intriguing,6,10 March 2012,"The first two Final Destination movies was pretty good for it's time, but started to fall apart with it's 3rd and 4th sequels. The last two before this one weren't super terrible movies but was far from being good either. Like it was easy cash in without much effort being put into it just relying on the franchise. This one is somewhat of a rehash of the previous movie but it seemed to have gotten more effort put into it. The CGI in this movie is actually really well done and believable. If you seen the previous movies in this franchise the first few scenes are really predictable and doesn't hold much tension because you will know what is going to happen. But as it progresses it gets somewhat intriguing and has some tension going for it. Tony Todd as William Bludworth makes a appearance as the mysterious man that knows exactly what is going on. The acting in this one is awful and you just can't take it seriously sometimes, but the death scenes I guess makes up for it. Seeing how there is more tension in this one. This one is a worthy installment to this franchise, just wonder how it's going to keep up the pace for the next installment. Cause this one was a bit of a rehash.6/10",Final Destination 5
26,Hellmant,Hollywood won't stop producing them until people stop seeing them (at least in large quantities)!,6,19 August 2011,"'FINAL DESTINATION 5': Three Stars (Out of Five)Yet another 'FINAL DESTINATION' sequel, even though the previous film was supposed to be the last. When a horror film series is as successful as this one it's almost a guarantee that Hollywood won't stop producing them until people stop seeing them (at least in large quantities). The Jason and Freddy franchises have already proved that. The original 'FINAL DESTINATION' (like with most popular long running slasher franchises) was actually a really good and well made film. When it came out, eleven years ago, I wasn't as big a horror hound as I am now and actually had no intention of seeing it in the theater but my friend, Kara, talked me into it and I was actually pleasantly surprised. It's one of the better horror/slasher films to come out in the last few decades. Like with similar franchises the original sequel really upped the ante and gore and it was a pretty satisfying installment as well (with probably the best all around death scenes of the series). The third and fourth installments were just more of the same with no real twists. The last installment had the addition of cool death scenes in 3D, which was a bonus, but the film as a whole was the worst of the entire franchise and it was therefore nice to see it was coming to an end. With this fifth chapter we do get more of the same (in 3D, although I didn't see it that way) but it also has a couple nice surprising twists at the ending. The film as a whole isn't that impressive but it is at least somewhat of an improvement over the last two.The film tells the story of another psychically gifted youth, Sam Lawton (Nicholas D'Agosto), who has a premonition of he and his friends dying in a horrible accident (this one involves a bus on a collapsing bridge) and gets them out of danger shortly before the accident happens. In this film Lawton is on a company trip with his girlfriend, Molly (Emma Bell), and other co-workers who are also close friends. Of course death tracks them down one by one killing them all off anyway, because it ""doesn't like to be cheated"", as they're warned by a mysterious coroner (played by Tony Todd once again, appearing in all but the fourth film now). Sam's friends continue to die in bizarrely horrifying accidents as he desperately tries to find a way to save them (just like all the other films).Steven Quale directed the film. Quale has a great deal of experience doing various jobs on James Cameron films including co-directing the underwater documentary 'ALIENS OF THE DEEP', with Cameron. This is only his third directorial effort and he does a decent enough job. The screenplay was written by Eric Heisserer who also wrote the recent remakes to 'A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET' and 'THE THING'. The film is mildly witty in places and highlighted by the supporting turns of David Koechner and P.J. Byrne. The rest of the cast is pretty flat (excluding Todd of course) and like I said the events of the film are mostly routine (for the series) but the death scenes are once again spectacularly creative and like always the main reason to see the film. Seeing it in 2D did take away something from the intended experience though, as you can obviously tell where all the 3D elements were used (and they look like they were used well). In that way it kind of reminded me of watching an old 80's horror film on video in 2D that was released in theaters in 3D (like 'FRIDAY THE 13TH PART III'). As I also already said there are a couple of surprising twists towards the end, one takes away an element to the film that has always made the series so unique. That being that the main villain is death itself and not a creature or mad killer. There is a routine horror element added towards the end which makes it no different than all the other slasher films out there really but it does make it different from the rest of this series at least. The film as a whole is sure to please die-hard fans and is definitely a step above the last two installments. Worth seeing if that's good enough for you.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4tG6zhJxO8",Final Destination 5
27,thesar-2,The Final Destination Again,5,17 February 2013,"Much like Batman Forever should've reversed titles with the following Dark Knight sequel: Batman & Robin, Final Destination 5 should've switched with its previous installment called: The Final Destination.Forwe hope this is the last one.Now, that's not saying I didn't have a good time with this film. The first time I saw this, I had a blast. Perhaps, I was in a really good mood that day, or the 3-D was finally satisfying. With this (only) second viewing, I was more: meh.Perhaps it was the very poor CGI, especially on the opening bridge scene. Or the all-over-the-place and mostly ridiculous plot. Yeah, I know; we're talking a 'part 5' here.And speaking of a fifth horror sequel, very little new was brought to the table. A young male, Sam (Nicholas D'Agosto) has a horrible vision while riding a bus on a company sponsored outing that everyone was going to die while on top of an about-to-collapse bridge. So he attempts to take as many of his peers and sort-of-ex-girlfriend with him off the bus and to safety. Completely and unexpectedly, and yeah, I'm being facetious; they die one-by-one since they were supposed perish anyways on the bridge accident.Sure, there is a little humor here, namely by sex-crazed, kiss-ass Isaac (P.J. Byrne) and boss Dennis (David Koechner) and there's a few gross deaths, but up until the end, the surprises and creativity are gone. Like I said: up until the endingWhat made me give this a solid 5/10 stars wasn't just that Nicholas D'Agosto is so damn cute – oh, wait, I didn't even mention that yetI loved the ending. I don't remember if I 100% saw it coming and I honestly don't think I did, but the clues are out there to what the ending (no spoiler!) will bring. Especially when you see this a second time. And hilariously, one of the clues I DID catch first time around, but thought it was a major movie flaw.If you're a fan of the Final Destination series, you might like this one. Even if you're getting tired of it, you might want to just watch this quick episode if only just for the twist ending and, of course, Nicholas D'Agosto.",Final Destination 5
28,FeastMode,my notes,7,23 July 2019,"Wow finally they made what they should have been making. a fun horror movie. this one is so much better than the previous ones, only the first is close. they didn't try to get too complex with the story, and everything made sense. there was finally some semblance of characters and motivations. great music. and creative and beastly accident scenes. i actually cared about the characters dying, and it got me to drop my jaw a bunch of times. this movie is highly entertaining. they also eased up on the ridiculously complex ways that these accidents happen. in the last two, death would go through like 10 steps that lead to the accident when it could have been so much simpler. and you could tell this felt like a real movie with good directing and well shot scenes. also lots of funny moments and good banter (1 viewing)

it was a really cool ending to connect with the first movie, and the fact that it all took place in 2000. so much better than what they tried in the fourth movie, to have some supposed twist that makes ZERO sense and isn't even really one",Final Destination 5
29,Robert_duder,Welcome Back and Way to Go!!,9,20 January 2012,"I love horror films. I'm not going to lie and say I'm not biased towards a great horror film or series. I have always thought Final Destination was a unique new Horror idea but really just used the same premise over and over again BUT did it so brilliant each and every time. The thing that made Final Destination so perfect was the incredibly unique and twisted death scenes, the linking of all the films, and the idea of a killer who is the same in every movie without ever seeing them or it being a real person or thing. Death is the killer. So now they come back for number five and I think this might be the best one of the entire franchise. As one reviewer said...it will make you fall in love with the whole series all over again and that is exactly what it does. It brings the series full circle in many ways, offers a host of new insane death scenes (one of the most brutal and awfully terrific of the entire series involving a Gymnastics incident), and one of the best twist endings I've ever seen in a horror film. No one will ever say the movie is unique or different because it is the same as it has always been but its perfect the way it is and incredibly entertaining and wickedly fun.As with other Final Destination films the characters aren't exactly A+ actors. They are really the means to the end for the film but still they do well in the film. Nicholas D'Agosto and Emma Bell play the lead couple of the film. They don't have the best chemistry opposite each other but individually they made for good strong lead characters. Miles Fisher is good in his role as the cocky best friend, and Ellen Wroe is terrific in her role although she doesn't last long ultimately but gets to be a part of the previously mentioned horrifying terrific death scene of the gymnast. Jacqueline MacInnes Wood and Arlen Escarpeta round out the main cast and do decent in their roles. Cult favourite Tony Todd also returns to the series, his first time since Final Destination 2, and I wish he had a bigger role but its still fun to see him.Slapping such a huge rating on the film seems extreme. I mean especially when you consider that I don't think the cast is anything to even think twice about. But I review films, especially films like this, based on pure entertainment and for that purpose alone, this was near brilliant!! I think they have a terrific premise that they've kept alive and well and fresh for the past decade and more. I didn't get to see Final Destination 5 in 3D and that doesn't matter to me (I hate 3D for those of you that don't read me regularly) but there was definitely scenes that you knew were meant to be in 3D. There were also absolutely outrageous death scenes that you will accept because the series is just plain fun. If you gave up on this series...COME BACK because this one will blow you away and the twist is pure epic!! 9/10",Final Destination 5

In this one, Sam has a vision of a bridge collapsing and he and some of his co workers die. It's pretty good special effects. So Sam and 7 others survive the accident by getting off the bridge in time and now death is after them. So they begin dying just like in the other movies of this franchise, meaning in really weird unbelievable ways.In this installment, it's a little different because they think if they kill someone else, then they will take their place and death will skip them. So that leads to some back stabbing at the end.(SPOILER) The movie ties into the first one because Sam and his girlfriend, whom survived, board a flight for Paris, which turns out to be the same plane that went down in the first film.FINAL VERDICT: More of the same, but good enough for 90 minutes of mindless entertainment.",Final Destination 5
31,CuriosityKilledShawn,Anticipation of death is worse than death itself,3,18 October 2012,"Horror franchises typically stumble when they get to Part Fives. Friday the 13th Part V: terrible. Saw V: awful. Halloween 5: appalling. Strangely many of them use 3D as a way of pulling in the punters for gore effects that splatter into three dimensions. Final Destination 5 is nothing new and no exception to this rule despite not being completely awful.A bunch of cronies on an office retreat survive a suspension bridge collapse after one of the group inexplicably has a premonition (sounds overly familiar) of said disaster. Death doesn't like to be cheated...Tony Todd...ironic accidents...blah blah...exposition...you're all going to die...yadda yadda...one by one...blah blah blah blah. It's the same old rehashed plot, recycled dialogue, and overdone deaths that seem to defy logic and physics. As usual there is a last minute twist, which by this point you're just waiting to be revealed and get it finished with, that doesn't quite add up for many reasons, but coherence has hardly been a strong point of the series.Basically, all this film offers are a few scenes of dread and tension which are all undone by cheap, fake, quick, deflating CGI gore effects. Not once in my life have I ever been horrified by computer-generated blood. Give me some tangible gore by Chris Walas or Tom Savini any day over something half-heatedly cartooned onto the movie in post-production.This series has been cheating death for 12 years and it's high time that Final Destination reached its final destination.",Final Destination 5

And that is an awful movie. Final Destination 2 is a better movie. And that is an awful movie. Final Destination 3 is great movie. That is the best Final Destination movie it is one of the best horror movies of all time. And this one is just pooh pooh. Final Destination 3D is a better movie and that was awful.

34,paulclaassen,"Wow, loved it!",6,26 April 2020,"We simply can't get enough of these Final Destination slasher movies, can we? With a new director on board, the franchise gets a look that makes it feel fresh.With the fifth movie in the series, we are only too familiar with the premise. It follows the same pattern as its predecessors, but somehow this film almost feels original. In this installment, disaster strikes on a huge bridge. The FANTASTIC bridge collapse scene is the best disaster scene yet in the series. The action is relentless, fast-paced and frightening.'Final Destination 5' has a lot more substance than FD2, 3 & 4. The acting is also much better. The script is much better. The make-up effects are bloody marvelous!! Some of the death scenes are so graphic, they are cringe worthy, to say the least! I guarantee some scenes will have you cover your face with your hands, watching it through parting fingers. Yes, it is actually that gross. Having said that, this nevertheless remains a very classy slasher horror film. FD5 certainly exceeded all my expectations.This installment is also the most suspenseful in the serious - yes, actually more suspenseful than the original. Death itself is in many instances portrayed as a presence, almost ghostly. The final act is a nail-biting thrill ride with an unexpected turn of events. I'll say it again: the acting is the best we've seen since FD1. Wow, this was actually really good, with a clever script.Probably another reason why the film feels so fresh, is due to the fact that this actually serves as a prequel, and in the process closes the circle - or does it? (Through fantastic editing, the end credits pays homage to all previous films.)",Final Destination 5
35,sol-,These Final Hours,6,11 November 2017,"Several youths once again discover that ""death doesn't like to be cheated"" after surviving a deadly bridge collapse accident in this final chapter in the 'Final Destination' franchise. Part Five shares some of the weaknesses of the earlier entries - particularly the lack of any clear explanation of why the premonitions occur in certain individuals and why Death chooses to avenge in such complex and grisly ways. Some of the victims to-be in this sequel are also so obnoxious that we simply cannot wait for them to die; P.J. Byrne is especially unpleasant and a grumpy David Koechner is not far behind. For all its drawbacks, Part Five is, however, also a lot more fun than the previous couple of chapters with large doses of humour (especially in a health spa scene) and multiple elaborate death sequences in which it is hard to predict what exactly will deliver the fatal blow; the gymnasium scene is particularly well done in this regard. The absolute best aspect of the film though is the surprise ending that cleverly drums up incredible tension. It is an ending that also makes this a fitting concluding tale in the horror saga. Of course, knowing the current climate in Hollywood, the series could be given the green light for a reboot at any minute, but after the lousy 'The Final Destination', it would be nice for the series to be put to rest on a high note like this film is.",Final Destination 5

They will understand of course later that none can cheat Death and always Death is the winner.I liked this movie more than the previous except the first which was really good and in my opinion it was the best from this series. Although I believe that this movie has nice plot and the story of it, it's really nice because it combines very well horror and thriller with suspense and mystery.Finally I have to tell you that I strongly recommend it and if you have seen all the previous movies of this series then you have to see this one.",Final Destination 5
37,Floated2,Well crafted thriller,8,7 June 2013,"What's fun about the franchise is that going into the film, you know a couple of things are bound to happen. One, there is no human villain. The objective is to cheat death, which in these films, never happens for long. Most of the characters are going to die and folks come to the theaters to see how it will happen.To explain each death scene would be pointless since that's the sell of the film and franchise. Credit the writers for coming up with new inventive ways of keeping audience entertained for over 90 minutes. For those fans who have seen all of the films in the series, the writers have also thrown in some surprises that will keep them coming back for more.The deaths were surprisingly realistic. At least realistic enough to still be entertaining. There was a point where I actually sympathized with certain character's deaths because...wait a second, how have I gone this far into a Final Destination review without mentioning the gore? You guessed it, there's lots of it. There were twists, turns, and scenes that made your stomach churn. Hell, even the minor amounts humor were 'deadly' & the plot was believable and well constructed; Dark and ominous, the style this franchise first thrived off of.
===
After a rewatch 12/13/18' Final Destination 5 remains a very fulfilling and entertaining end of the franchise. Arguably the best film of the franchise, in terms of overall, as the deaths are creative, the characters are quite decent and the overall plot is interesting enough and has a tie in to the original (This film being a prequel to the original). The deaths are much more realistic than the fourth film, and there is more action given the stakes. Overall Final Destination 5 was a great finale to the franchise. As another rewatch 03/13/20' and after revisiting the entire franchise in chronological order, think that this fifth film is the best of the series. There is success, mystery, thrills, action, fleshed out characters and as a whole this film tying it to the original is what makes it stand out as the best.",Final Destination 5
38,TheMovieDiorama,"Final Destination 5 is five times familiar and five times ""3D"".",4,31 January 2019,"As an individual that believes gimmicky 3D effects are just, well, unnecessary gimmicks, this fifth instalment purely focuses on blood, guts and eyes flying at your face. Whilst a step up from the abomination that was 'The Final Destination', this time around we see a group of young students avoid yet another catastrophe (suspended bridge crumbling because of ""high winds"") thanks to a premonition. However, Death has nothing better to do than to be creative again and find the most unlikeliest of methods to kill these individuals. You all know the drill. A formulaic disposable horror that is rapidly feeling dry featuring a cast of dull actors that portray one-dimensional characters. You watch in the hope that you'll be invested in the story, but you stay for the absurd death sequences. And that is exactly what makes this movie tolerable, the ingenious deaths. Another chapter that has scarred me from going to the safest of places. No more do I want to go to an acupuncturist, nor will I ever fix my eye sight and receive laser eye surgery, and I definitely will not be doing gymnastics (which is a shame because I have the potential...*cough*). What makes this entry that little bit more spicy compared to its predecessor, are the ""red herrings"" that are precariously placed. The camera focuses on water dripping next to a live wire, building the anticipation that this oblivious girl is going to get electrocuted, only to find she gets killed by something else. Classic misdirections that make the experience that little bit more enjoyable and anxiety-inducing. It strangely concludes by linking back to the first 'Final Destination'. It's a nice touch for fans, but feels wholly unnecessary and a huge amount of wasted potential. Particularly as a coroner constantly keeps babbling ""Death doesn't like to be cheated"" and that he has ""seen this before"". The visual effects were mediocre and the weird tonal shift towards the third act felt misplaced. It's not a return to form for the franchise, but it is an improvement from the fourth entry.",Final Destination 5
39,taylorkingston,The One That Turns Out Is Actually A Prequel...,10,18 October 2014,"I love this movie. It was great to see the Final Destination franchise get to five movies. I'm still wishing for a sixth, but whether that will actually happen or not, is something I'll just have to wait and see. In this movie we see another fatal accident. This time, it's a suspension bridge collapse. Sam and his co-workers are on their way to the annual company retreat. Whilst going over a suspension bridge, Sam has a horrifying vision that the suspension bridge will collapse, killing everyone on it. Including his best friend and his girlfriend. He wakes up from his vision, and the same things are happening. The same song comes on the radio. He cuts his finger the same way. And that's when he realizes that it's going to actually happen. He warns his friends and they all get off the bus, just as the bridge collapses. They watch from the other side in horror and are thankful to be alive. Then Death starts coming, and you know what Death does? He kills. Obviously. People who got off the bus, start mysteriously dying. Sam and his girlfriend, Molly realize what's happening. And we see the same creepy mortician explaining the situation, once again. They find out that if they kill someone, they take over their lifespan. So if they kill someone who isn't supposed to die for another sixty years, then they will live for another sixty years. With only a few people left, they all accidentally or in self defense, kill someone. And they think their safe. One of the survivors given a new life, finds out that the man he accidentally killed, had a brain tumor and was meant to only have a few days left, at best. So unfortunately, he dies. Sam and Molly board their long-awaited plane trip to Paris. They get on and we see their flight number. Flight 180, in the year 2000. Wait, what? This is the plane from the original Final Destination movie? What!? We see Alex get off the plane with his friends and then Molly and Sam unfortunately die in the crash. So, Molly was never meant to die, because she wasn't in Sam's vision. Because she was destined to get on Flight 180, and die then. And since Sam took someones life, that person was obviously meant to be on Flight 180, so he died. So it's really a secret prequel, that we don't know is a prequel until the very end. Mind f**k. Definitely a mind f**k.Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",Final Destination 5
40,jtindahouse,About standard but a nice way to wrap it up (if they do),7,17 January 2013,"Final Destination, when it was first released in the year 2000, was my favourite film for a number of years, so I've made a point of seeing all of the sequels. Very few film series get this privilege on my part (Saw and Paranormal Activity are some of the few that come to mind for me). And if there's one thing I've learnt along the way from the Final Destination films, it's that there isn't a lot of areas to continue to be creative in. In fact for me the only interchangeable area is really how the characters die. And fortunately that's been enough to keep some of us coming back.So was Final Destination 5 inventive enough with the death scenes? Not in my opinion no. It all felt very 'seen it all before' and while they were able to shock us occasionally with the resulting method of death, there still wasn't enough surprise there.I think Final Destination 5 needs to be the last film in the series. And not just because it's all getting a bit stale, but also because it was a really good way to wrap it up. At the end of the film we are treated to a twist that the whole film was in fact a prequel to the first Final Destination. And no they didn't cheat, there were indeed hints to it throughout the film. This was a nice touch and would mean that the fourth film in the series 'The Final Destination' was actually still somewhat true to its title. A really great series that I will remember for a long time, I just hope it stops here.",Final Destination 5
41,dee.reid,"Fifth time's the charm, right?",8,30 December 2011,"By now, we the viewers should all know the formula: kid has a premonition of a horrible accident, warns others about the impending doom, seconds later said tragedy does actually happen, and then the survivors start dying in horrible Rube Goldberg-style accidents manufactured by Death itself.""Final Destination 5,"" directed earlier this year by Steven Quale, is no different from its predecessors. One thing about ""Final Destination 5"" is that it is a significant improvement over its 2009 predecessor, ""The Final Destination"" (the fourth film in the series, in case you didn't already know). However, one element that ""Final Destination 5"" has gotten right is the macabre sense of humor that Death has in stalking Its victims, and the darkly macabre humor arising from the entire set-up itself; this sense of humor has pervaded the series from the get-go. (Who knew that Death was such a funny character, toying with the lives of Its victims and making them think that they could escape Its clutches?)This is where screenwriter Eric Heisserer really shines. He sees the utter preposterousness in this series for what it all really is and runs with it, although this darkly macabre humor never ventures into full-blown camp territory. ""Final Destination"" (2000) more or less played it straight and was a genuinely frightening horror picture when it needed to be, but ""Final Destination 2"" is where the humor was starting to become more apparent as it went for pure shock value in its gory special effects sequences.One thing that ""The Final Destination"" did right two years ago is the fact that its humor was starting to become more and more apparent; finally, the series was getting it right. ""Final Destination 5"" also continues the mix of dark humor and gruesome gore. Another element that returns to this series are fully developed and believable characters, something else that hasn't really been seen in full effect since the first movie. We believe in some of the characters and attempts are made for real acting performances and dramatics.But let's not kid ourselves here: they're all on Death's hit list, so let's not get too attached to everybody.Although ""Final Destination 5"" (supposedly) brings this series to a close, I wouldn't really count on it: as long as there are teenagers (or if you prefer, ""young people"") out there, there will always be a market for Death to come and slaughter the lot of them in increasingly shocking and gruesome ways.8/10",Final Destination 5

(More on the 3D later).The Deaths scene in this movie are really intense and first death scene in this movie was really nail biting death scene, you will think they will die one way but they total different way and it will shock you. The first death scene in this movie as to worst death of the whole series. Really liked the fact they got the dark feel back to this movie, when victim hear or feel something strange with them before they are killed, That reminds me of the dark shadow from the first Final Destination movie but I was little disappointed that they didn't use it for all of the death scenes. The deaths scenes in this movie are really great and gory and can also be funny as the same time, (some Dark Humor is added into the mix)The acting from 85% of cast was outstanding, Nicholas D'Agosto who played Sam acting was not great however he was a enormous improvement from Bobby Campo who played Nick in (The) Final Destination 4 and I was little disappointed with Emma Bell.I thought she would do really well in this movie, Her acting in Frozen was outstanding but in this movie she could have done a lot better, saying that she only really stood out in two main scenes of the movie the rest of movie she looked a bit bored The ending of this movie still really surprising (Already knew it was going to happen (it my own fault for reading spoilers ) but still it was really good twist and makes the movie even better and also little sad at the same time.Now the 3D effect, I don't know how to describing how I felt about the 3D, For me this was the best 3D experience I have ever seen, it's was trillion times better then 3D effect in last movie, The 3D in this movie was phenomenal.As huge fan of this series, I would not mind if this was THE Final Destination movie in series as It would be the perfect ending to a great underrated franchise (Also liked how references that had in this movie for for other movies in series!) 10/10",Final Destination 5

By far the best parts of this film is its opening and it's ending, being able to start something so terrifying and end it the same is quite an accomplishing feat to match- let alone when its majority is somewhat bland. The deaths are nothing too original in this film, and none of the characters prove to be very likable. Most of the actors can be a bit annoying on some level or another, and the pacing can take a dip at times. That being said there is some good moments of suspense throughout the film, as well as the best premonition scene in the franchise yet. It's hard to talk about this film and all the spoilers it may encompass, but needless to say, the ending really saved this film as a whole- and really lifted it up in quality in my mind.

A lot more for a Final Destination movie that is. The survivors seem to actually care about living, which at least gives us some connection as an audience. Unfortunately it lacks in the kills department. It sets up these elaborate death sequences on cartoon proportions, but decides to suddenly throw in something you didn't see coming. Usually this is something dull, like falling down or something falling on them. It kind of makes it an anticlimax. Again it tries to add a new rule to the franchise, where killing people adds their life to yours. Some kills are fun, but I actually stopped caring about how they were going to die. The only death that had me flinching was the gymnastic scene. The acting was fairly credible, but with so many deaths I still think people would act differently, possibly manic. Saw a little bit of this with the Christian Bale/Tom Cruise crossbreed guy. If you still want more after the last four, by all means you should see this.",Final Destination 5
49,raulfaust,Nice one,7,26 March 2012,"After the shameful release of ""The Final Destination"", many would feel this franchise is over-- including me. ""Final Destination 5"" is a movie very similar to the first one, sometimes looking like a remake of that. The cast is very professional, with exception of Emma Bell, since sometimes she seemed to overact in this picture. The deaths aren't recycled from any other final destination movie, they are all fresh. Also, they are extremely agonizing and painful to watch, sometimes remembering movies from ""Saw""'s franchise. The deaths aren't only terrifying-- they are also sad. I felt they could've turned this film into a drama, since it's full of sad and emotional scenes. Steven Quale proves to be a strong director, making a good mix between horror, mystery and even drama, which is rare nowadays-- most of them just want to be trash and that's all. All in all, ""Final Destination 5"" is maybe a new life to this so criticized franchise-- that I hope to go on.",Final Destination 5
50,eric262003,Death Come Back To Haunt You,9,3 June 2013,".They've tried many time before, but one thing's for sure, no one can beat Death. For over 13years, the ""Final Destination"" series has sprung an abundance of remakes and torture films that has been ranked as one of the most exciting, creative and highly budgeted horror films that ever hit the big screen. Sadly like a number of sequels of all genres, this one also started to get stale through the years. In 2009 the forth instalment was rightfully titled ""The Final Destination"". But like other iconic spooks like Jason, Freddy, Michael Myers, it's just not that easy to leave a good series alone. ""Final Destinatio"" has fallen into that category. But I have to ask you and myself as well, can a fifth instalment hold up with the other four instalments? I can't speak for anyone else, but I would like to think so.The central focus on this instalment is around a group of workers who are at the midst of a retreat as a few people has avoided death after a deadly bridge collapse under the rather unexplained premonition of Sam (Nicholas D'Agosto), who also seemed reasonable to rescue his icy-hearted girlfriend (Emma Bell) after her broke up with her. How nice! In the time honoured tradition to the ""Final Destination"" franchise, things go from bad to worse as Death calls upon the elite and kills them off one after the other in some unorthodox, but horribly graphic and extremely violent ways, Tony Todd returns to the story as the eccentric mortician as he educates the group about the modus operandi in death's approach to his victims which leads one brave survivor to duke with out with death personally. Now that Daeth is on their paths, they not only have to watch out for themselves, but they must look out for each other as well.Rookie director Steven Quale releases an antidote from the previous other two instalments (under the direction of James Wong and David Ellis respectively) who had sadly lowered the bar to the max. Quale has over the years worked under the belt of James Cameron seems to have the humour factor placed quite nicely here as this series is not only scary but also strong in tension as well. And not only is the film gross and disgusting it's also quite methodical and unpredictable in its intentions. Horror scriptwriter Eric Heisserer (who wrote badly done remakes like ""Elm Street"" and ""The Thing"") seems to have improved here a bit as his characters have dimension and some much-needed development. The ending of the movie wraps up quite nicely with a great montage featuring AC/DC's ""If You Want Blood, You Got It"". The 3D effects are quite astonishing you got yourself a film that makes up from the dreaded third and forth instalments.At heart, it's a standard coloured-between-the-lines horror film, but ""Final Destination 5"" has enough engaging energy for a long horrific exciting roller-coaster ride of horror fun. Sure it's far inferior to the 2000 ""Final Destination"", but it's still equally riveting to watch. Go an expect gory, vile disgusting scenes, but I can assure you this will go beyond one's expectations. It's a rare delight that these kind of horror comes along, but I guarantee this will please all those who enjoy and appreciate the horror genre.",Final Destination 5

After watching the others I saw this one as the favourite! The film entirely was dark & gloomy which added to the things going on in the film! The omens suggesting how they were going to die were cleverly done not to mention the bridge collapse sequence which was brilliant! Then them tying in the Flight 180 scene from the first film to the 5th Installment, which completed the film along with the franchise explaining the 5th Installment was the events before the Flight 180 plane crash scene starting off the franchise all over again!

It's still mostly the same scenario with new deaths and new actors, but the formula is tweaked a bit to make it interesting again.As for the deaths, overall I'd say these are a couple of the most memorable in Final Destination history. I'll just say that there will be no laser eye surgeries or acupuncture appointments in my future. The actors are just another round of disposable (and vaguely familiar) pretty faces, but they die convincingly enough and aren't excessively annoying, and that's all you can really ask for. If you're still up for more Final Destination, this one has as much or more entertainment value as any of the rest.

Although I'm a fan of the series, I'll admit it did show its staleness after FD2, which is arguably the series' high point. As expected, the formula hasn't changed, although there are a few new tweaks here, the main one including the addition that the survivors can now kill someone to take their life and maybe, just maybe, escape Death's clutches. It's interesting to note that this new twist is the opposite of what was offered in FD2, in which new life can defeat Death, but taking life is much more readily apparent and dramatic than creating new life. Not only do they have to worry about Death, but they also have to worry about what they are willing to do to survive, which provides some very tense external conflict between the characters. As you guys might have figured out from the above, yes, FD5 has a plot this time around. There's also an unexpected ending that you will make you go OMG or WTF, if it isn't already spoiled to you, of course. It's also good to know that Eric Heisserer's tight script devotes some time to the survivors that are getting picked off. You start to feel for them as they are about to die. As much as I'm thankful for this, it's obvious that people still see these films for the opening disaster and death sequences, and they do not disappoint. Without spoiling anything, the opening bridge disaster is a nasty piece of work, utilizing the 3D to the fullest extent. I'm a huge horror fan, but even I found it very hard to watch, jerking my hands back as each character is killed off in grisly ways. Without a doubt, it's the best opening disaster since FD2. And the death scenes. Wow. They are disturbing, funny, and shocking and sometimes all at the same time. This is because newcomer director Steven Quale plays with the audience's expectations. He lays out so many things that can kill off a character in a certain scene and when you think this sharp object will impale them, they die in a completely different way. The build up is what makes these films fun to watch (apart from the last one). I also liked the fact that this film returned to the original film's serious roots, which isn't to say that it takes itself too seriously because there's an underlying sense of dark humor that's strangely entertaining and self-aware of itself. The ensemble cast is a mixed bag for sure. Our protagonist, Nicholas D'Agosto, doesn't really live up to his character's dramatic arc. He seems to overact his lines although he was much better in the second half. Emma Bell is a bit better although she wasn't as good as she was in FROZEN. Miles Fisher also doesn't live up to his character's internal struggle when giving off a whiny performance. However, the other supporting castmembers are quite good, including Ellen Wroe, Jacqueline MacInnes Wood, and Arlen Escarpeta. P.J. Byrne, in particular, is someone you should look out for, providing some of the film's biggest laughs, playing a character you just love to hate. David Koechner also provides some great laughs. I was disappointed with Courtney B. Vance though because he had little to do. Tony Todd is back since he was last seen in FD2 and he's like the American version of Snape (from Harry Potter). I love the way he delivers his lines with one...word...at...a...time. Visually, the film has some above average production values. As said before, the bridge sequence is like something from a $100 million budgeted action flick. The 3D is the best that has been offered so far this year, which comes to no surprise seeing that Quale has worked with James Cameron on AVATAR. Even from the film's ingenious and original opening credits, we have shards of glass, knives, bodies, and blood flying at us in amazing sharpness. Yet the 3D gimmick can only go so far, and Quale knows that so he doesn't overdo it by providing us with scenes of depth. Honestly, it's the best of both worlds. The soundtrack by Brian Tyler is great as well and is definitely different from the previous entries. All in all, FD5 brings unexpected new life to the dying franchise. The plot is handled well and most of the performances are good. If anything, this sequel proves that with new blood working behind the scenes can come a refreshing film. If you want to see the film, by all means see it in 3D because it is worth every penny. FD5 is shocking, entertaining, suspenseful, funny, disturbing, and is probably as good as FD2. It seems to be a good year for 5's (FAST FIVE included).",Final Destination 5
54,bob-rutzel-1,Still Outstanding,7,4 January 2012,"On the way to a company retreat Sam (D'Agosto) has a vision that the bridge they are crossing will collapse and many will die. He gets them off the bus and eight survive and cheat Death.All Five of these Final Destination movies have been terrific. Good acting performances by these no-name actors and very clever ways Death gets his revenge along with perfect timing and great photography and CGI are the keys to this successful series. This may be the last one, but a new wrinkle was introduced this time. Some of the survivors now are led to believe that in order to escape their own deaths, they must kill someone else to balance the books as they are told by the Coroner (Todd) that Death doesn't like to be cheated. This is the new wrinkle. This aspect did not occur in previous FD movies. (Does this open the door to more FD movies?)The opening scenes on the bridge will have you gasping for air and ducking everything in sight. You wonder how in the world did they do this so convincingly. I checked myself into a hospital just in case, as I felt as though I was on that bridge too. Yes, you will see a lot of gore and some scenes later on are just too hard to watch and I had to avert my eyes from time to time as the scenes were just too real.Okay, so why watch? Mostly because of the clever ways Death gets his revenge. And, even though the survivors are now aware that Death is on the march and they try to be extra careful, they really don' t stand a chance. One of the last scenes shows an airline ticket to France and if you have seen the previous FD movies, you will note that the Flight number is 180. And, you know what that means.Not for kids for sure. Too violent and gory with blood spurting here and there and everywhere. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Some F-bombs, not many",Final Destination 5

56,Luigi Di Pilla,Entertaining horror sequel but too bloody,6,21 January 2012,The ideas were well developed with suspense and many plots. It includes even a new dimension about killing an enemy that I don't want to spoil further here. Each death sequence has been studied accurately with each detail. I was guessing all the time which person has to die and how. The special effects were well executed especially the one with the bridge. What I didn't like therefore were the many unnecessary bloody effects. These ones could have been deleted without any problems. This horror trip convinced me and I can recommend to anyone of the Final Destination fans. Final vote: 6/10,Final Destination 5

59,MrGKB,A tidy faux-finish to a franchise that refuses to die...,6,15 February 2012,"...this latest installment of the gruesome ""Final Destination"" series fares rather well (as in better than expected) under the guidance of a director helming his first feature film, with a passable script from a guy who gave us one dreadful remake and one not-so-bad-but-could-have-been-better. This time the Grand Guignol disaster is a visually well-executed bridge collapse; otherwise the plot, such as it is, sticks to the established template of Death refusing to take a holiday, as each survivor-by-premonition of the set-piece accident is dispatched in appropriately ironic fashion.The leads--Nicholas ""Rocket Science"" D'Agosto, Emma ""The Walking Dead"" Bell, and Miles ""Tom Cruise ain't got nothing' on me"" Fisher--acquit themselves as well as might be expected in such throwaway roles, and it's fun to see Tony ""Night of the Living Dead 1990"" Todd back in action, not to mention the always reliable David ""The Naked Trucker..."" Koechner and Courtney ""12 Angry Men"" Vance. Shot in 3-D, with a disappointingly banal and boring title sequence (rendered all the more banal and boring in 2-D, btw), the story ends with a neat little Ouroboros twist that stills leaves room for as many more sequels as a bloodthirsty viewing public will lap up. Possibly the strongest entry in the franchise since the original, ""Final Destination 5"" inhabits the swollen ranks of fun-but-easily-forgettable horror movies; beyond the visual titillations of dismemberment and disaster, there is little to recommend it. For a library freebie, I won't complain too loudly.",Final Destination 5
60,AngelHonesty,Not Again!,4,7 February 2020,"Every time I watch the newest movie of ""Final Destination"" I expect it to get better somehow, I was greatly disappointed with this film. It may have been a little better then Final Destination 4, but no where near as good as Final Destination 3.The movie is filled with mediocre actors, a beyond predictable sequence of events, poor lines, horrible CGI, distasteful gore and one death that really makes you squirm in your seat from absolute disgust.",Final Destination 5
61,deatman9,best one since the first and 2nd,7,14 October 2012,"I know most people already hate this movie before it even comes out. That mindset is based on countless other films who have had this many sequels which are just garbage I.E the saw franchise. But let me say this one was actullay different it was actullay a good movie.If you seen any final destination you know he drill. Guy has a vision that everyone will die. Saves them for the prediciment and then death starts to stalk them killing them one by one.This one I actullay very much enjoyed. The actors did a good job, the deaths were not too ridiculous. In the other movies some deaths were just stupid. This movie is just a lot of fun much better then the third or fourth garbage installments",Final Destination 5
62,acidburn-10,Much better effort,7,2 August 2012,"It seemed as though that the Final Destination franchise hit a rough patch with part 4 which was terrible, and although part 3 had its fun moments but it still wasn't on par with the first two. At first I wasn't keen on the idea of a fifth one being made, but when I saw the trailers I was intrigued and when I finally got round to seeing it, I was well and truly surprised. I was glad to say that this franchise has well and truly bounced back, it seemed that the producers had listened to all the complaints about the previous outing and has fixed them all with this one.Of course as always we get the big tragic accident at the beginning, where a character has a vision about what's gonna happen and well it's the same as always. In this one we get a collapsing bridge which was well and truly effective, entertaining and thrilling, definitely the best opening out of all the sequels. Another aspect that I liked is that they offered something new to the mix like a person can save themselves in which they sacrifice someone else in their place and live out the rest of they're life. I don't know why they waited until part 5 to showcase something like this, I mean they could have showed this in a much earlier entry like part 3 or something, because part 2 offered something different to the mix as well.Another thing that I am glad of as well is that they brought in a decent cast this time round, unlike the forgettable mannequins they had in part 4 and for the first time since part 2, I actually cared and liked these characters this time round. Nicholas D'Argosto gave a credible and likable performance as the lead character and Emma Bell held her own and had decent chemistry with the male lead. Miles Fisher played his part well as to what would become the villain of the piece he did well at being unlikeable and P J Byrne was also decent as the comic relief character. And lastly it was nice to see Tony Todd back again for his third outing in a credible cameo role.All in all I would definitely recommend this one, definitely one of the best sequels in the franchise on par with the first 2 and definitely looking forward to part 6 and 7 back to back.",Final Destination 5

64,asda-man,Bloody brilliant!,8,1 September 2011,"We've all seen the first 4, we all know the score here. Disaster then death. That's basically it but what makes them so popular? The outrageous death scenes? the opening disaster? Well in this sequel it's a combination of both plus brilliant directing and good characters. I didn't particularly like the first one, but I loved the second, liked the third and sort of felt cheated by the fourth, now unusually its this fith one that puts it on par with the second, or maybe actually better!Let's start with the opening. We all know the opening is usually the best bit, well this is certainly no disappointment what so ever! The bridge collapse is easily the best disaster from any other final destination film. It is completely insane and horrific and will have any gore-hound delighted with the sheer carnage that caresses the screen. The special effects are nothing short of amazing and the tension is fantastic! Even though you know that they'll all going to die in the opening, you actually feel quite scared for them and find yourself biting your nails at the suspense of the suspension falling. The opening is just one reason alone to see it.Then we're introduced to the characters who are actually quite likable, even the ones who are obviously meant to be unlikable actually have a character and even though the fat womaniser is a horrible character, he was quite funny to watch. The first death is a masterclass in suspense, it had my heart pounding about a little prick (stop it!) The directing by Steven is incredible. It's taken seriously and is full on high tension (a bit like Aja's directing in ""High Tension"").This is what sets ""Final Destination 5"" apart from all the other films in the franchise. It is actually tense and fun at the same time. The death scenes are easily the goriest yet. The laser eye surgery bit had me squirming and cringing in my seat (I can't deal with eyes) and even the death scenes without eyes were really intense and quite shocking.If you're a fan of the ""Final Destination"" series, then without a doubt you must see this (I suppose you would anyway if your a fan) and seeing it in 3D only enhances the shock value! It's full on suspense, tension and great gore. The ending is also quite clever but not as great as everyone's saying. My only complaint would be it wasn't long enough, I could have see more. Anywho see it, it's worth your hard earned money.",Final Destination 5
65,LazySod,A fitting finale,6,7 September 2011,"Being the fifth part in the series there is nothing left to be explained. The motto is the same: an event that causes several fatalities happens and for some reason a number of people survive it while they shouldn't have. Death doesn't like this and comes after them to finish the job.As expected this film tries to show some new ways for people to die using some new gruesome ""accidents"". It doesn't entirely succeed at this but does well enough to be better than the previous two installments in this series. Overall it runs at a pretty decent speed and there's enough in there to keep it interesting. It never gets to the level of the original film or even its direct sequel, but it's worth a watch and most definitely a fitting last part. I do hope they keep their promise and leave it at this though, this cow has been milked dry.6 out of 10 mistakes cleaned",Final Destination 5

I loved the first one in the series, but after that it goes rapidly down hill.There are some very good deaths in this film and they are generally well done... but in total, it was pretty much the same as the other movies. I think the best scene for me was the eye laser surgery scene... if you have scene it, you know what I mean... but then the gymnast was also very cool. The acting was terrible... All of the main cast had some bad moments. The movie stars Nicholas D'Agosto, Emma Bell & Miles Fisher. There is also a cameo by Candyman himself... Tony Todd. But then he pops up in parts 1, 2 & 3 also.I think the best thing about this movie was the ending... i loved the way it ended. It was very well put together and the way it was all connected was excellent. I won't spoil it for you in case you have not seen it... but there is a great twist at the end that I really didn't see coming.I will give this film 6 out of 10.Not bad, but I don't think they should make any more... this franchise has been pushed too far.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Final Destination 5
69,chicagopoetry,Handful Of 3D Gags Can't Save Final Duncical,5,14 August 2011,"Granted there are a handful of neat 3D tricks in Final Destination 5 but you'll have to see them on the big screen in order to enjoy them, so beyond the week or so that this lemon is going to be playing in the theaters, what good will it be? I had the choice to pay $11 to see a regular old movie, $14 to see this 3D movie, or $15.50 to see this movie in the right way on a bigger screen. I paid the $14 and just sat up close. The opening and closing sequences are okay but I just have to wonder if they can spray glass and blood all over the audience like that, why didn't they do it in the body of the film. There are really only two very spectacular 3D shots, both involving someone getting impaled and both part of a very horrific bridge collapse depiction, that impressed me. After that this film peters out in the 3D department and you have to wonder why. For example, there's a scene that could have really taken advantage of the 3D because a woman is getting laser eye surgery (of course we know it's going to go horribly wrong), but they don't show the laser coming straight at your eye and they don't show the doctor sticking instruments into your eye. It's like they aren't having fun with it. I have to wonder if the makers of 3D films are purposely avoiding making a really spectacular one, because once that is done all the other ones will pale in comparison to it as audiences will have a higher expectation. 3D films are about stuff popping out at you; they're not about sitting there for two hours being fascinated with the depth of the background. That actually gets annoying after a while and can even cause you to get a headache. It's when something flies out of the screen and makes you jump that makes 3D films fun. There's a scene when they are fighting in the kitchen and all the utensil fly into the air, but that happens for about half a second and they don't fly right at you. Why? How much fun would it have been if they came at you in slow motion or something? So, for $14, I jumped twice at two really good special effects and then sat through another generic Final Destination film, the absolute most boring one in the series, with unlikeable characters, a ridiculous plot that adds nothing to the series as a whole, and BAD, BAD acting. And I kept the stupid glasses because I paid for them. So there.",Final Destination 5
70,nitzanhavoc,An unnecessary (failed) attempt.,5,28 June 2016,"Many of you FD fans out there who'd been there since the first film probably wondered what as to the point of FD 5 (and by that I mean the point of making a 5th film to begin with and making it the way it had been made). FD 4 was excellent, resembling the first in its level. FD 5, on the other hand, felt like nothing more than an unapologetic attempt at squeezing the franchise for another few bucks.The plot has nothing of interest and nothing worth mentioning. The cast, the acting, all is adequately planned and executed, just like the previous films (good to see Candyman Tony Todd back in this one!) The only thing that should have given this film the edge and added value is its being a ""prequel"", but even that was poorly done. The ending does connect this film with the first film (and very nicely, I must say), but besides that - one of the key plot points is when the group realizes people are dying in the same order as they did in the premonition. Obviously this was for the sake of new watchers beginning to follow an anthology on its 5th film (there might 2 or 3 people like that, good for them then), but the rest of us had already known everything the characters ""learnt"" in the film.Besides the nice ending adding a sense of nostalgia and Todd's dominating presence (regardless to short screen time)? No point whatsoever in watching this except for crossing it off the list and unlocking the ""watched all 5 FDs"" achievement in your Horror scrapbook. Not bad, enjoyable at times, but unnecessary and not the least impressive. I feel bad that FD has to finish on such a low note instead of going out with a bang (as it would have had it ended with number 4 the way it should have had).",Final Destination 5

Unfortunately, this movie is SO BAD I just can't find ANYTHING!
The twist with the plane could have been good but the movie was so bad that by the end of it, I couldn't care less.
Here are some pros and cons:
CONS:
The writing was terrible. If you find yourself yawning in a horror movie and wanting to skip forward, you know it's not a good movie.The acting was mediocre - the characters were so unappealing, I couldn't care less if they lived or died.The deaths were so disgusting - horror movies should be scary. It's not a contest of how much gore they can shove down our throats but in this movie it seems that that was exactly what they were trying to do. Well, mission accomplished.PROS:
Nothing! Except, thank God it's over!I don't know why I kept watching these films. I guess I hoped it'll get better because the premise is so good. The idea that death is coming for you and you need to find a way to cheat it can be so good and scary but instead it's cheap, stupid, disgusting and boring!Well, enough!

73,kdnor2011,My second favorite but probably the best of the franchise,8,4 January 2012,"I was actually looking forward to this movie. By this point, a lot of people had given up on this franchise, after the fourth one became more of a parody. They bashed the trailers, called the series repetitive, and instantly predicted it would suck. Meanwhile I was defending it, and what do you know, it turns out I was right. This movie surprised many people, including me, I was hoping to like it, but I was not expecting it to be that good.OK, bad stuff, the ending felt a little tacked on with the plane engine coming down on him. Some things don't add up when you know the twist. Such as why the corener never told any of the other groups that you could kill someone. And it does have it's share of stupid moments.I loved this movie, this comes close to beating the third if it weren't for the fact that bridges don't scare me in the slightest, no matter how much Hollywood tries to make them scary. Most of the death scenes are completely unpredictable and really surprising, I cringed more than once. It's funny, I laughed Hard at some of the stuff Issac said. The special effects are great. The acing isn't bad. A lot of people say that the Tom Cruise look a like is horrible, personally I didn't find him THAT bad. Speeking of Tom Cruise look a like, did anyone think Candence looked like Amanda Bynes? The twist was amazing, my jaw dropped when I saw it. And it has rewatch value so you can look for clues about the twist.While FD3 is my favorite, I would actually say that FD 5 is the objectively best of this series. It got the right tone, was unpredictable, had funny and likable characters, descent acting, great effects, added something new to the story. This was actually one of my favorite movies of last year. Please, if you thought the series was played out, give this movie a chance, it should surprise you. But if you don't like any of the movies then you won't like it.",Final Destination 5

After The Final Destination, I wasn't really sure what to expect but this was an excellent return to form for the series, boasting all the dread and suspense that this series is known for. Every performance in this one is gut-wrenching, that ending was thrilling and incredible on every level, and I think the story this time around held the most emotional weight. It's hard to tell who really steals the show more, D'Agosto or Fisher, because both of them are fantastic. Emma Bell is lovely as always. I hope this is the last film because if they end it here, they will be finishing up the series on a major high note. Not only was every death fantastic and unexpected, but the last ten minutes had me practically biting my fingernails in terror. One of the year's best sequels and all-around best features.",Final Destination 5
76,Meven_Stoffat,Getting' deathy with it.,6,13 August 2011,"Allow me to preface this review by saying that as you may have guessed from the trailer, this film is absolutely no different from the previous 4. So if you're going to this movie expecting a bit of a shake-up, you may want to skip it. But if you're going to this movie for how it should be viewed: good old gory and stupid fun, I'd say go right ahead.I was a little bit disenchanted with the series after I saw the fourth movie. Maybe it was because I was getting tired of the series at the time, but I just wasn't drinking the kool-aid anymore. Furthermore I was dumbfounded when they were making a 5th movie, wondering how they could after the fourth movie was called ""The Final Destination"". However, the trailer looked fun, and some 3D gore fare will be some bang for my buck.I'm glad to report that this was a big Improvement. In fact, dare I say it, this has been a good year for fives. While I'm not a fan of the Fast And Furious movies, I enjoyed Fast Five in IMAX. And so I figured maybe the fifth FD movie could be good and I was surprised at how much I liked it. The deaths are probably the most gory and brutal in the series. I kid you not, the filmmakers really do go for broke, the deaths in your face like a lunatic. In other words, death is ticked the frack off in this. One particular death pretty much sums up why I will never do gymnastics, in the same way that FD3 confirmed why I won't ever step foot into a Tanning salon, nor will I go on a roller coaster. Oh, and David Koechner is in this too, which I will say is a nice surprise. There is a lot of humour too. And thankfully so, because the previous installments took themselves too seriously. The spa scene had me laughing to the point of tears. Also, the deaths are beautifully campy, and I must say I found myself laughing at pretty much all the gore.In addition the 3D is a nice campy touch. There's stuff flying out at you, like the Ships mast near the beginning, as well as the opening credits with the wooden logs, the burnt bodies and the broken glass and what not. In fact, I'd say go for the 3D alone.However, I can't give this a higher rating because it is exactly the same as the first four. I mean really, things happen the exact same way They did in the previous movies. I mean, as with the other movies, there's little to no surprise, so if you're expecting something fresh, do skip this.Overall, this movie is good for some light fun and campy, gory entertainment. If you liked the previous four, you'll like this one. If not... Well, you get the idea.OVERALL: 6/10Pros: Final Destination 5 is good, campy gory entertainment for those wanting just a bit of brainless (no pun intended) fun.Cons: The film is exactly the same as the first four. Plus, it would have sucked out loud in 2D, but 3D was good fun.",Final Destination 5
77,whatch-17931,"Pretty good visit back to this land, with annoyances",8,13 October 2020,"The opening bridge scene is pretty darn spectacular. But, with some misgivings. The most glaring is the dude in the bus, falling to his death- uh, not only is it theoretically known that objects like that fall at the same speed, meaning the dude wouldn't have fallen to the front off the bus, this has been proven on the ACTUAL FREAKING MOON. Geeze!That is annoying, to be fair, and it was a very short segment of the movie. It's frustrating because they could have hired an English major in undergrad and they probably would have pointed this out.But that was just a tiny bit.Your mileage may vary, but the bridge collapse is not scary, it's actually really funny. You could make a drinking game for every time D'Agosto jumps over something. I guess really all of them went more and more campy, compared to the original.But further issues:, for one, NO MORE 3D. It's not that great in the theater, but at home, it's just annoying. ""Hey, a 3D shot was here!""

81,bhernandez2216,You have reach to your 5th Destination,9,2 June 2019,"Final Destination 5 is now one of the best horror film in history of Final Destination franchise. Somehow it finally got good, scary, gruesome, and intense, since The Final Destination, the fourth film. And at the end of the film, something will surprise you that no one can guess what's gonna happen. This is what you'll get thrilled at the movies.",Final Destination 5
82,mattiasflgrtll6,"Decent final destination. Way better than the fourth, for sure.",7,29 January 2016,"Remember The Final Destination? Yeah, I prefer not to...But with this one, they kinda get back-on-track. It's still flawed, but brings back some of what I like about this franchise.First off, the characters. There were actually some pretty good ones. Sam is far from my favorite, but he's a better protagonist than the previous one. Molly is cute, Nathan is fine too, but best of all is Peter. He was by far the most interesting one, and got some great development in the movie. The actor playing him, Miles Fisher, was absolutely incredible. He gave the character true diversity and was also the most believable one when it came to dealing with death. He acts like a real person would, someone who becomes very down and might even panic. I won't say more than that, but he's a highlight in the movie.The plot, while not exactly original, has enough new things going for it. For example, Bludworth shows up and informs the group of another trick they can use to (maybe) cheat death. Speaking of Bludworth, I'm glad they brought Tony Todd back. He was at least voicing a roller-coaster announcer in the third, but in part 4 he was absent. And once again, he is a scene stealer. Not only does he have a perfect smooth, creepy voice, but he also has a face you can't forget.The deaths themselves are for the most part very good. Several of them have pretty intense build-up and I sat there nervous, hoping nothing terrible would happen as most of the characters you can root for. Sometimes it gets pretty damn crazy, and while it often is ridiculous I go along with it and get some solid chills and laughs. But it's not an all-out comedy like TFD is, it does try to be engaging and make you invested in the story. And if you ask me, not a half-bad job. The cinematography is all right. It's not the best I've ever seen, but it's perfectly fine and I really like the lighting in the last scene.Unfortunately, there are a couple of holdbacks. Like I said, the plot is not so original. I appreciate that they are trying to honor the audience who fell in love with the first, but perhaps they tried a little too hard. There were moments like I felt like I was watching an updated version of the original, which was a little jarring. And not ALL of the characters are good. Olivia and Isaac had some chuckleworthy bits, but for the most part they were just annoying. Olivia in particular was a complete dumbass, who at one point blurted out such a ridiculous comment when everyone was at their most grieving that I wanted to punch her. Isaac was the typical ladies man character which the series always has a tendency to include since the third. The first of them was by far the funniest, Isaac only p'issed me off. He got on my nerves with his obnoxious braindead lines he would blurt out and in all honesty is the character I had least sympathy for.Final Destination 5 might not be the most memorable of the bunch, but I was satisfied enough that I can safely assure I had an enjoyable time. A worthy watch for all FD fans.",Final Destination 5
83,RichardSRussell-1,"Grisly, Gory, and Gruesome, but Winkingly Wry",5,15 August 2011,"Final Destination 5 (1:32, R) — fantasy: supernatural, 3rd string, sequel, OSIT cynicsThis movie suggested its own rating: 5.After I position a movie on my customary scale of 1 to 9, I take a little time to look at other recent films the in same vicinity as a kind of reality check. Did I REALLY like Final Destination 5 about as well as Green Lantern and Kung Fu Panda 2 (also 5s) and a little better than Green Hornet and Cars 2 (both 4s)? Honestly, and somewhat to my own surprise, yes I did.There is nothing whatsoever different from the previous 4 FDs as far as the basic plot goes: A young guy gets a premonition of a calamity soon to befall him and bails out, bringing half a dozen others with him. But this amounts to cheating death, and death will not be cheated, so they commence to die off, 1 after the next, in the same order in which they WOULD have perished absent the precog. (It is never clear why this rigorous sequencing is an immutable law of the Universe, especially since they obviously didn't die in the proper order compared to everyone else in the disaster, but none of this bears very close examination, so it's best to just go with it.)The various means of demise are uniformly grisly, gory, and gruesome, but each one is different and requires a string of improbabilities before the final strike (or blow, or cut, or smash, or shot, or blast, or  well, you get the idea). FD5 teases you with various false leads and red herrings as to what the exact mechanism will be for each event. It also establishes a pattern of intricate attention to detail for each setup, then, just as you've been lulled into thinking you've figured out the pattern of the pacing, it abruptly snaps you out of it with something shockingly sudden and unforeshadowed.The prior films featured high-school and college students; this one keeps pace with the aging audience and goes for young office professionals, all employed at the Presage Paper Company, headed out for a team-building retreat on a bus crossing a suspension bridge that's under construction. This is where the premonition occurs, and we get to watch each of the characters die for the FIRST time in the imagination of Sam (Nicholas D'Agosto). The collapsing bridge offers up a spectacular piece of mass carnage for the most part, but it's strung out enuf so that each character gets about a minute of her or his own before being speared, or fried, or smashed, or drowned, or guillotined, or  well, you get the idea.Both here and in the more leisurely SECOND death scenes, the resultant corpses are so horribly broken and mutilated — well beyond any reasonable consequence of the proximate cause of death — that it's clear the film-makers (Director Steven Quale and Screenwriter Eric Heisserer) figure nobody at all is taking this seriously, so they may as well have fun exaggerating to their heart's content. They also take full advantage of 3-D. This may be the ideal film for it, and it wastes no time whatsoever, as various lethal objects come right at you in slow motion thru bloody shattering glass under the opening credits. There's also a quick- cut montage at the end reprising the fatal moments from each of the previous 4 movies, highlighting stuff headed your way.Miscellaneous random thots:  I still like Dust in the Wind, despite it apparently being ole Azrael's entrance theme.  However, I will never, ever get lasik eye surgery.  Miles Fisher (who plays office supervisor Peter Friedkin) sure looks like Tom Cruise.  It's nice to see that the token black guy didn't go 1st for a change.  Instead, it was the 1 person in the cast who HAD to have some talent besides acting.  Probably the most dangerous room you will ever walk into is a kitchen.So this movie is clearly not for everyone, which is why it's in the middle of my ""up to you"" range. But, if you're part of the target audience, it delivers the goods. Just as you'd expect, people get electrocuted, or fricasseed, or impaled, or hanged, or dismembered, or  well, you get the idea. It's not WHAT happens, it's HOW it happens that keeps you shaking your head, murmuring ""Oh, no, they didn't!"", and coming back for more.Say, I just realized. The 1st 4 movies came out 3 years apart, in 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009. This is 2011, only a 2-year gap. It's not supposed to happen until next year. You don't suppose .

85,perkypops,"A much better sequel than two, three, and four.",7,6 October 2012,"The effects in FD5 are particularly spectacular which is why it seems the franchise has at last got a sequel right. The carefully woven sequences which lead to death are also cunningly fitted into the character types. There are also a few little twists to keep us guessing. By the conclusion we know why we stayed until the end which I cannot claim for the previous three sequels.This is not a film which overtaxes our brains but it certainly plays havoc with our eyes and ears except, perhaps, for some overacting which is pretty standard for the franchise. No one does any more than they have to.The camera work and stunts are exceptionally good. If you have never seen a Final Destination film and want an introduction to the genre I'd still recommend the first release but FD5 is a very close second.Seven out of ten.",Final Destination 5

It's a prequel to the first one but it feels a bit dull. this movie is a letdown to me. I like the opening scene though.

87,Fields201,Take A Date,7,13 August 2011,"I brought an old middle school crush after not seeing her in years to Final Destination 5. She was hugging close to me on the gross parts, and this was where I see why horror films are so popular.The plot is the same in every single one of these movies. It's just a different scenario. The first one is a plane, the second one is traffic, then a roller coaster, race car track, and now a bridge. A disaster happens, the main character zaps out of it, finds out what's about to happen and saves people who will later become death fodder from dying.Then one dies one by one in the order of how they are supposed to die and our obnoxious heroes must find a way to trick death.... in the same way as the other movies. Really, it's the same film over and over again. There's not a whole lot of substance to be had, other than the fun in the kills. That's it. There's not much to say other than if you like these kind of films, go see them. The formula never changed, and honestly, you come to see the inventive kills and that's really the fun. The bridge scene was really well done. It's actually amazing to see from the characters' eyes as the bridge collapse is pretty awesome. Some of the kills are nail-biting and the payoff grossed even me out.It's not a bad film, and it's a lot of fun as long as you turn your brain off. It just doesn't separate itself from the rest of the Final Destination movies. Also, the very end of the movie shows kills from each of the Final Destination movies. Why did they show that? It makes you not even want to see the previous installments. Nice going, filmmakers.",Final Destination 5
88,havoke-74121,A mild improvement of the previous one.,3,14 November 2020,"Some people consider this to be the better film and/or one of the best. For me a manipulative slog, with an ending that some say is good, but I just say......who cares?",Final Destination 5
89,achyutaghosh,Somewhat satisfactory,6,16 December 2011,"You know what to expect before you begin watching a Final Destination movie, the name being the biggest giveaway. The plot remains pretty much the same; a group of teenagers escape death at the outset, and then meet their maker in gruesome ways. The only difference in the 5 movies is the manner of death. And on this count, Final Destination 5 does achieve what it set out to do- ie. Provide shockingly creative kills to a merry band of death-cheaters, and gets a High ""5"" from me.Final Destination 5 starts well enough- a brilliantly executed waterway bridge collapse, accentuated by superb 3D play, good enough to rival the car pile-up in 2 or the roller coaster crash in 3. And the film manages to be pacy throughout you see- 8 people to kill in only 80 minutes, and perhaps there-in lies the fault- that you do not get enough time to feel for the characters. Things take a special turn when some folks begin to act on the new rule- kill someone else to reclaim their lifespan, which means we have villains beyond the supernatural in this one. And the actors do not really get to act or need to act in a Final Destination movie, right? Because all they have to do is to look good, run, scream, and do some more running and then screaming, until their innards are splattered all over the screen. Again on this point, i was satisfied as the actors looked good, ran and screamed rather well ;) and pardon my gore-lust but i have to say my favourite death scene in this one was that of the gymnast who ends up a tangled mess.What's up with the 5's this year? They seem to be turning up swell- Fast Five, and now this :) For fans of the series (and that includes me), hallelujah- Final Destination 6 and 7 is in the works. And you know why i am a fan of this series? Because i too believe we can't cheat death, so might as well enjoy the ludicrous show while it makes short work of others, our time will come soon.",Final Destination 5
90,blacklist-1,A Somewhat Return to Form for the FD Franchise. Entertaining Enough.,5,5 November 2012,"Initially after hearing of an FD 5 hitting the big screen, I put off seeing it after the last one, which churned out the worst of the series. To me having a fifth movie seem to taking it too far and really solidifying that expression milking the cow for all it's worth. But I am happy to report after deciding to sit down one evening with my friend who rented it from blockbuster that this was actually a decent addition to the franchise and is worth watching at least once. I would rate it as the third best in the franchise certainly surpassing the last two, which is nice. The problem with the last one was it just wasn't scary (but that was the same with two and three anyway). The main issue was that the deaths were pathetic. They were far too predictable and had lost their edge and just become tiresomely repetitive, which is what made the franchise fun (and with the first movie scary to begin with) This fifth addition sees brand new people finding themselves facing the force of Death. As a bunch of corporate firm colleagues with friends and loved ones are going on a retreat. On the way as the bus travels over a suspension bridge, Sam Lawton (Nicholas D'Agosto) has a premonition of the collapsing of the bridge. Obviously some of his friends and colleagues get off with him and are put on Death's list where they are killed one by one in the order they are meant to if they had died in the premonition. What sadly this film lacks is anything resembling a decent script, which is truly dreadful with characters you don't come to care about and actors who cannot act to save their lives. One disappointment is Emma Bell who plays Molly (Sam's girlfriend). She gave a great performance in the chilling horror Frozen, but she was next to hopeless in this. However I'm pleased to see the return of Tony Todd as Bludworth who was sadly absent in the last movie, but returns to give the best performance in the film with a creepy demeanour as he makes the most of his limited screen time.Anyway even though most of the acting is abysmal I'm pleased to report that the death scenes are terrifically choreographed once again, something that had been lacking since FD3. Director Steve Quale teases the audience wonderfully with how the characters will die with planting red herrings in the build up to the death, which replenishes that suspense and tension with how the death scene is built up, which was apparent in the first three films. Two of the deaths I'm referring to in particular is the gymnast one and the one at the massage parlour. The CGI as well adds to the dramatic effect as it is still impressively implemented. The story itself has had a couple of tweaks, where instead of intervening to save the person for Death to skip them. Those on the list have to wrestle with the inner turmoil of killing someone else for Death to leave them alone. This presents some conflict with some of the characters pitting them also up against each other, but unfortunately it isn't acted well. However the ending itself was a big surprise, which I didn't see coming, which I enjoyed, even if how it was implemented looked a bit choppy. It's true FD5 has it's flaws, but Steve Quale really does try and offer us something new and tries to capture the freshness of the first two movies, which is done somewhat successfully and I commend him and the other production staff for that. I'm glad I saw it as it was enjoyable enough to watch. By far not the best of the franchise, but it could have been a lot worse. A decent effort.",Final Destination 5
91,troy-manatunga,If you watched one you have watched them all is my opinion!,3,11 December 2011,"Sequels  Prequels FINAL DESTINATION 5. I did have a moment myself when I did foresee into my future and realized that this franchise is going no way other than down! I am not half as smart as Nicholas D'Agosto. If I were, I would for sure have saved myself the agony and directly skipped onto watch a less painful horror flick. This IS the issue with franchises and genre specific productions. Final Destination has always been about some kid having a vision and saving a few friends just in the nick of time only to find out that eventually they all will die; since death does not like being cheated. Being the 5th movie in the franchise it's still the same old approach and the same old ending. The Directors changed, the writers changed and the plot still remains the same! YES I AM CLEARLY VERY ANGRY! NOTE TO PRODUCTION HOUSES: 3D DOES NOT MAKE A CRAPPY MOVIE LOOK ANY BETTER. VIEWERS ARE SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT IT'S JUST A SCANDOULOUS MARKETING TOOL! Only If I could pull my hair out right now! This is one of the very reasons I have a shaved head! #Breathe# There are always 2 sides to any story. This is something I have forced myself to believe in since I took into movies. Our perceptions are clearly subjective and one man's trash can be another man treasure! Some of us sit down for movies like FINAL DESTINATION and SAW quite frankly to watch the bloodshed and the gruesome and creative methods of how to kill a human. Since the killer in the entire franchise is never a person and it's an intangible force maybe it's only saving grace. I need to give credit that none of the deaths were a parody of its predecessors. Each is unique in its execution and each bloodier than the other. THIS IS AWESOME! (Yes the bloody images are quite entertaining- not for the faint hearted) Now here I have taken a rip at the production plus I seem to have somehow crafted in the word awesome as well. Clearly I need to make my mind up. Only one last area to explore and that is the cast. Since the teen horror flicks took to screens back in the late 90s there has been always a mixture of talent. Some of the cast would be veterans and some would be quite new and some would be in their first production. FD5 has no fresher's in her line-up, everyone has been mildly exposed to Hollywood and do have a better understanding than I do of what they are expected to deliver. I am guessing maybe they FORGOT all that when they got on SET! Tony Todd who appears in all 5 movies himself seems quite uninterested in acting. Maybe he was just too tired of the plot and just too tired of delivering the almost identical lines! Don't say I didn't warn you! If you have been a close hardcore fan of the franchise you may enjoy the bloodshed and the numerous ways death devours its prey. Nothing else other than that would fascinate you nor thrill you! If you watched one you have watched them all is my opinion! Title: Final Destination 5 Directed by: Steven Quale Starring: Nicholas D'Agasto, Emma Bell, Miles Fisher, Jaqueline Wood, Ellen Wroe, P.J.Byrne, Arlen Escarpeta, David Koechner and Tony Todd Rated: R for strong violent/gruesome accidents and some language.

92,iguth,"Perfect ending, less fun",5,19 May 2019,"This is just the last one. I'm glad that this is the final one because I feel like the last three movies of this series are all remakes of one another with barely anything original. Each one has the same plot and hits the same beats. The difference here is that the characters are all adults and it delves slightly into the characters personal lives. The deaths are interesting, gory, etc. I appreciate the return of death as a character (also known as the coroner). This one has an antagonist and better music but still is not enough. There is a new mechanic and if I'm being honest, the ending is almost as good of a wrap back around as Saw VII's ending. Added a little to the score because the ending is so good.",Final Destination 5

People avoid death. Death finds them one by one. The end.
I wish they at least brought some difference in them. The deaths are more gruesome for sure but clearly CGI and unrealistic deaths. I am all for gory and good death scenes - but i just laughed at the deaths, they seemed so ridicilous. If you are and dont have anything else to watch, go ahead.",Final Destination 5
94,bgaiv,Great FD,8,16 September 2020,"""They're called tits.""Haha, this is a great FD. If you're not familiar with the gag, well, stop reading my spoiler.The late stages of dot-com are on display here. It's kind of neat to have this, going back to FD's roots, albeit roots that weren't present in the original because the kids in that one were too young for that aspect.The bridge scene is spectacular, and, for fans of the series, kind of hilarious. But there's a lot of horror here, if you forget for ten seconds what franchise you're watching ;)Tony Todd is his magnificent ass self.My only complaints:Well, it's annoyingly obvious this was shot for stupid 3D that just suck. Because, 3D is just an abortion every time , because faux 3D sucks. Everybody knows, 3D shtick only works for things five feet away. Everything wide angle, from 10 feet away has been 3D from the start of pictures.More mildly, the fat kid on the bus, falling faster than the bus. Come on, gravity don't work that way, and I think most viewers get that. Can we just give a kid at Starbucks with a high school sophomore of physics award a $5 gift certificate? How can you make a rather spectacular and mostly physics correct scene and fumble on the three yard line?And one thing weird, but, I can't say it's a goof. To me, it feels a bit like a goof, because I lived in dot-com at the time, but they clearly have some dot-com company in a dot-com suburban workplace with- down below, an iron and steal workplace with union guys with 15+ years experience. From a narrative POV, it's a selection, so whatevs.And BTW, 3D sucks, because it's always unnecessary, and always gratuitous.",Final Destination 5
95,JimmyCollins,Still the coolest horror franchise around...,8,7 September 2011,"If anybody has seen any of the other 4 Final Destination films they already know what to expect from this addition: guy has premonition of himself and his buddies dying therefore he persuades them to escape whatever situation is causing the death, this case being a suspension bridge collapse, which in turn means they cheat death, but as we all know, YOU CAN'T CHEAT DEATH TWICE!!!!! The plot is exactly the same in every film which is kinda lazy but hey it's a franchise, and a damn good one at that.One thing I really like about this franchise is it's ability to have the same plot film after film but still have lots of surprises, ie: the ending of this film. The filmmakers out do themselves with each new addition with the death sequences, with the exception of the fourth film I think all of the deaths have been extremely creative, one particular death in this film involving a gym beam and a fan is a truly on the edge of your seat style scene, I was so glued to the screen during those few minutes, when that person died the reaction from the people in my session was great, there were laughs, screams and sighs. So cool.The use of the 3d in this movie is OK, better than a lot of other 3d horror films, it's kinda unnecessary but it's a cool gimmick for a movie like this. The leading man was impressive also, the only problem I had with the characters was the feisty brunette who is half blind, her character was totally annoying. I looked forward to her demise.Another big plus for this movie is the suspension bridge collapse, it's so well filmed and executed, i am so happy Sydney harbor bridge isn't a suspension bridge because after viewing this movie I doubt I'd be venturing onto one very quickly. Very very scary.I'm my opinion this is probably one of the best franchises around, and this addition is Grade A. The series just gets better and better. Fingers crossed for number 6. I'm sure there's lots of cool ways for people to die that Hollywood hasn't thought of yet. :)",Final Destination 5
96,Minus_The_Beer,Death Springs Back To Life,7,23 August 2011,"Try as you might, you just can't beat Death. For over ten years, the ""Final Destination"" franchise has weathered a wave of remakes and torture flicks to become one of the most wild and inventive (not to mention, profitable) horror series of its time. Unfortunately the series went stale rather quickly, culminating in 2009's underwhelming fourth and ""final"" installment, ""brilliantly"" titled ""THE Final Destination."" But just as Jason and Freddy taught us oh so many years ago, you can't keep a good franchise down. In that spirit, a mere two years later, ""Final Destination 5"" is upon us. Can a fifth installment in the series make up for the sins of its predecessor while keeping things fresh and original, not to mention faithful, to its origins? The answer is a surprising ""Yes."" The plot this time revolves around a group of co-workers on their way to a company retreat. A handful of them manage to survive a colossal bridge collapse thanks to the unexplainable premonition of Sam (Nick A'Gosto), who is nice enough to save his cold-hearted girlfriend (Emma Bell) just minutes after dumping him. What a guy. In true ""Final Destination"" fashion, things take a turn for the worse as Death comes calling for the group, picking them off one by one in unimaginably brutal and outlandish ways. Back in the picture is the morbid mortician played by Tony Todd to enlighten the group about death's design, leading a member of the group to take matters into his own hands. Now not only do the remaining survivors have death on their back, but they also have to be cautious of each other and even of themselves.First time director Steven Quale gives the series a serious shot in the arm after the previous two installments (tackled by original Final Destination director James Wong and Final Destination 2 director David R. Ellis, respectively) lowered the bar both visually and story-wise. Quale, who has spent a considerable amount of his career working under James Cameron, obviously has a keen sense of humor as well as dread, and it shows through in what is not only the series' most insane and over-the-top installment, but also one of the most intense as well. Not only is the film gruesome and gross, but it is also grim and unpredictable to boot. The script, penned by Eric Heisserer (whose credits include 2010's less than stellar ""Elm Street"" remake and the upcoming ""The Thing"" prequel), freshens up the formula quite a bit, adding dimension to characters and giving the third act some much needed tension. Not only does the ending take a left-turn for once, but it also serves to wrap the series up in a nice bow, complete with a montage set to the tune of AC/DC's ""If You Want Blood, You Got It."" Add to that a batch of well-executed 3D effects and you've got a package that just can't be beat.Sure, it's still pretty formulaic at its heart, but ""Final Destination 5"" has enough tricks up its sleeve to surprise and satisfy those seeking a genuine roller-coaster ride of horror. No sequel could ever hope to top the 2000 original (which was pretty unique in its time) but this one comes about as close as possible. Go into it expecting a gory and gross good time that plays with your expectations and you'll have a good time. It's rare a horror film comes along these days that does its job this efficiently, so enjoy it while you can.",Final Destination 5
97,MUFCOK,"Entertaining, lots of suspense and as gory as ever.",6,6 August 2013,"I watched the first 3, enjoying 1 and 2 but found 3 to be quite poor. For that reason I didn't bother watching the 4th instalment, however with nothing to watch last night I decided to give Final Destination 5 a watch.The one thing that I always enjoyed about these movies was the suspense. You knew something was going to happen, but no like in your usual horror films where somebody would jump out etc, etc. In these films its all about real life situations and objects that are the cause of death. Final Destination 5 did not disappoint in that aspect. Many of the scenes felt very edgy and dark and the deaths were as hard hitting and graphic as ever.I only gave this film a 6, because as a film its not that great. As I have said the deaths and suspense is entertaining and as good as some of its prequels. But the characters and script really aren't up to scratch.I feel 6/10 is an accurate rating on this, it does the job to make you cringe at the deaths, keep you on edge but ultimately fails where most horror films do: The script, characters and acting.Definitely worth a look if this is your genre, its not a bad way to pass 90 minutes",Final Destination 5
98,piratecannon,The Final Destination for Final Destination?,4,27 December 2012,"In a sense, if you've seen one Final Destination movie you've seen them all. If you're not familiar with the concept, the movie thrive on the idea that ""death"" is a conscious entity that actively chooses when and how people die. In the movies, this typically is prefaced by an ethereal black shadow (or haze) that serves as an indicator to the audience that the gore is about to fly. When the first movie was released in 2000, it was a novel idea, and, in this critic's opinion, made for a tense and fun take on a genre populated with masked slashers and ridiculously overblown monsters.The question, then, is this: does the fifth installment break any new ground or is it a retread of everything that's come before? Though the first hour is a mind-numbing rehash, the final third of Final Destination 5 actually asserts some brainy aspirations. In many ways it tries to address some heady themes centered on mankind's survival instinct and just how horrific we as a species can be when the chips are down. This is admirable, and the final moments of the movie take things a step further by making an effort to neatly tie things up with the rest of the series.All of that said, the movie doesn't do nearly enough to distinguish itself as a standout horror feature (especially when compared to its predecessors). These movies are all about the grotesque and elaborate death-trap setups that ultimately lead to the grisly demise of characters we can't stand. Here, the payoff never measures up, as the characters are dispatched in dull ways that were clearly designed to make use of gimmicky 3D effects (a-la the 3D iteration of Friday the 13th). And every time the inevitable death occurs, the movie feels it's necessary to pull a somewhat unexpected distraction maneuver that may or may not elicit an annoyed chuckle from viewers.There are some admirable moments in Final Destination 5, but here's hoping that this is the final iteration of the long-running Rube Goldberg style death extravaganza.",Final Destination 5

100,glenmatisse,"Good ""Final"" Sequel",8,17 November 2020,"For a franchise that's essentially done the exact same thing for 4 movies, the Final Destination series has no right being as entertaining as it is. They wrap things up well with this ""final"" installment that features some of the franchise's most gruesome and cringe inducing deaths such as a gymnast who doesn't stick to the landing and ends up a pile of broken bones and gore on the gym floor.",Final Destination 5
101,rawiri42,Lts forget the law of averages!,5,11 June 2013,"I guess the premise of Final Destination 5 is OK as a theme for a horror movie. A bunch of colleagues head off to a retreat on a bus - Believable. They come to a suspension bridge where maintenance work is being conducted - Believable. The wind gets up all of a sudden and causes some problems - Believable. That the weather forecast didn't indicate closure of the bridge - Unbelievable because in such cases, authorities are almost paranoid about safety. However, in this case they weren't so, moving on, the problems caused by the wind don't just make a few small mishaps occur - they snowball into a major disaster - Not so believable but not impossible I guess! The result is that all but eight of the colleagues on the bus are killed - most of them spectacularly! But then that's what you watch horror movies for isn't it? The fact that the survivors were probably only survivors because of a premonition that one of them had which prompted him to act before the real disaster began is also believable if you happen to believe in psychic phenomena.However, when the eight survivors start to die in equally spectacular and gory fashion, suspicions begin to arise as to how they were able to escape - not only amongst the survivors themselves but also with the FBI - very understandable. The FBI agent in charge obviously is not such a paranormal believer since, other than Fox Mulder, FBI agents aren't too keen on that sort of stuff - believable.Then along comes a strange man who appears at each death scene and warns the remaining survivors to ""be careful"" - starting to get spooky now. What he also tells them is what leads the film to its climax (almost) but I won't write about that. You need to watch for yourself.Not a blockbuster by any means but, if you like to see new ways of grotesquely killing people, you certainly won't be disappointed. For goodness' sake don't show it to your grandma though!In passing, is it just me, or is Miles Fisher (who plays Peter) the spitting image of Tom Cruise? I'm sure he could act as a stand-in for him or, perhaps more usefully, play him as a young man in flashback scenes, after all, he is 21 years younger.",Final Destination 5
102,jamericanbeauty,"Clever, Creative, Philosophical Horror Movie that most dismiss as Dumb Gore.",7,1 November 2021,"My first time seeing this one last night. I overlooked it for some reason. I saw Parts 1 and 2 in theaters and caught 3 and 4 at home. I am amazed at how the Final Destination franchise continued to come up with fresh, creative horrifying ways to kill characters, and this final movie delivers too. Each movie has a simple premise: A young protagonist has a premonition of an infrastructure disaster, escapes before said disaster along with some peers, and death comes for them one by one in the future in hilariously or disturbingly violent gory fashion. This final-Final Destination ties up the franchise and comes full circle with a satisfying twist connecting the franchise from beginning to end. There are two near deaths that made my heart stop. And it stays on message: You cannot cheat death. Tony Todd slides through to remind us of fate/realms/deadly destiny in his iconic made-for-horror voice. I miss horror movies like this - simple, coherent writing that delivers thrills and gore minus any agenda-pushing or any identity politics.",Final Destination 5
103,JohnLeeT,Stunning,10,21 January 2015,"The five minute opening bridge sequence of this film may be one of the most realistic and overwhelmingly exciting in motion picture history. And that is only the start. With electric intensity the suspense continues to build and the horror eventually reaches an unendurable climax. Unmatched special effects work and cinematography of Oscar caliber will have the individual viewer fighting for breath as an outstandingly written script goes for the jugular. Beautifully and skillfully directed with an exciting cast of young actors you will be seeing much more of in the future, this is not only the best entry in this franchise. It is also a truly magnificent motion picture of incredible proportions on its own and could hardly be more highly praised.",Final Destination 5
104,Billy_Crash,The Best in the Series?,8,24 January 2012,"People avoid a major disaster – but they can't cheat death for longThough originally a 3D venture, which is obvious thanks to that annoying ""in your face"" camera angle, and sometimes shoddy looking special effects, this the first of the movies to hold my interest throughout.Granted, it's over-the-top and corny to a degree, but the characters are a bit stronger as well as the suspense. Director Steven Quale did a solid job in making certain tension was maintained throughout, and for not allowing the audience to catch their breath.Definitely not as silly as the other installments, this one definitely had its surprises. Although I wasn't jolted by the scares, I was entertained and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. However, the scariest part may be how much actor Miles Fisher resembles a young Tom Cruise.The original FINAL DESTINATION (2001) had one of the strongest and most un-nerving first acts I've seen in a horror, but the final two acts were ludicrous and destroyed any true sense of fear and trauma. This latest installment is what it is from the very beginning and continues on a wild ride of gore and horror, thanks to the steady writing hand of Eric Heisserer.For a great horror romp, this makes for a solid rental that should leave you cringing.",Final Destination 5
105,ravenclaw_girlrules,Excellent ending to an iconic series,8,1 June 2020,I absolutely love this movie. It is a great ending to an iconic horror series. It brings the whole series full circle in the most marvelous way (the main character ends up on flight 180 - which is the plane that crashed in the first final destination movie). The movie itself was a new exploration of old themes - the protags tried to outwit death by claiming another life.,Final Destination 5
106,politehere,"Wow, a comprehensive review",10,17 August 2011,"Now if you're reading this, you've already seen the movie. Let's get to the good part: The special effects were top-notch. What I really liked is that the characters were not stupid. In FD 4, it took the hero too long to say ""Hey, something's wrong!"", but in FD 5, he gets that right only after the first three clues are repeated before he warns everyone to get off the bus. That was really cool. Also, he realized death was after them after the first two deaths and took it seriously unlike FD 4 where the characters were in disbelief until they were all dead. Well, they deserved it, but here the characters act in an intelligent way, even consider taking other people's lives to cheat death again.Something about this movie was different, that most of the clues were misleading. Now you might argue that it's a good thing for the characters to die in unpredictable ways, but it doesn't mean it feels good to get fooled so much. For instance, in the first death scene, I expected to see the gymnast get electrocuted, but she died in a ridiculous way. If there's even any possibility of gymnasts dying like that by simply falling, many must have died during their training sessions in the real world, you think? It's OK to break your neck by falling to the ground, but die in a bloody manner like that? Nah, that's too far-fetched.The second death scene was my least favorite, but the guy was funny. He actually made me laugh ""Do you come with subtitles?"" LOL but this time the clues were too misleading to be acceptable. He didn't die because of the fire, but I don't know, a statue smashing his head? And what was that all about him being unable to move? He just rolls down the bed and falls to the floor, while he could walk away instead of shouting ""Fire, fire!"" Well, if there is a fire, just RUN! Save yourself first, save the spa later! Then there comes the ""creepy dude"" and God I love it when he explains everything and even tells the characters how they can possibly cheat death again! Kill or be killed! I hated him being so vague in FD 1 and 2.Oh my God, the eye surgery! Don't do that, I was actually considering doing that you know, but after seeing this.........That was quite disturbing!And then the detective comes along, ""You know something you're not telling me."" Well, I'd say he was smarter than the detectives in FD 1. I mean he actually figured that ""there was a pattern."" Smart guy! Too bad he got killed.Now we have only 25 minutes left for the rest of the characters to die and I'm starting to wonder how they're going to wrap so many deaths in just 25 minutes! Peter, a villain? I don't think so. He was just fighting for his life. I mean who wouldn't? But I don't get it. Killing a stranger is a lot easier than killing your friend, right? What's all that about ""After giving it some thought, I realized I ""could"" kill somebody, but then I realized I ""couldn't"" kill a stranger, but I think I ""can"" kill a friend!"" Yeah, that makes sense! Did you really think Peter?And the ending, Wow, I didn't see it coming! I think they'd cut the scene from FD 1, because the characters in FD 1 would be much older now, you think? And I have to let you know of a HUGE plot whole in the sequel. You all remember how the characters in Final Destination 2, 3 and 4 made references to the Flight 180, because the Flight 180 event predates all the rest, right? But since it's revealed that the events of FD 5 actually predate those of FD 1, it begs the question of ""Why aren't there any references to the bridge incident in FD 1, 2, 3 and 4 considering the fact that the collapse of a bridge THAT BIG is a lot more serious event than a plane crash. Now, since the story of FD 5 has been written after FD 4, this is forgivable, but well, I'm just smart like that. What can I do, right? ;)The director said (and I read about this on Wikipedia) that if FD 5 sales good, we will consider the production of FD 6 and 7! That's some awesome news!The movie's selling like hot cakes and it's getting all the positive reviews, but there's a problem. The sequel was sealed with what they did in the end, unless they come up with a new twist to get FD 6 started, which is going to be difficult. Anyway, well done! This is what I call a good movie! Made my day! Oh and before I close this review, I came up with an idea! The guys who were supposed to die killed two people who ""were not"" supposed to die, right? You know, I'm just saying you could use this to make FD 6! And something else. The sequel is not really sealed yet, because in FD 1 the hero had a vision and saved others in spite of the fact that death had not yet managed to kill the two survivors from FD 5 (which in fact predates FD 1), yet we still get FD 2, 3 and 4, so there's room for many more Final Destinations! But for God's sake, stop using that scenario of spilling water over electric wires. It's getting stale already!Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie not only as a Final Destination fan, but also because it was so great you couldn't really help but enjoy it.10 / 10, go see it. Wait, you've already done that! :)",Final Destination 5
107,LinkGoku,My favorite in the series!,8,18 August 2011,"I gave this movie 10/10 stars because at the moment it's at 6.6/10 and I think it deserves more.If you've seen any of the last 4 then you'll know the story.So what makes it so great?

108,JamesIan2021,Unbearable Suspenseful,7,12 May 2015,"For ten years characters have been succumbing to death in inventive and visceral ways, but in some of the franchise additions the stories and actual characters have sucked, it's only 3 and 5 that have freshened up things. Final Destination 5 is hands down the best in the franchise, and the use of 3D is alarmingly terrifying and jarringly realistic, the effects, shot in native 3D, truly make this movie the best 3D horror. Nicholas D'Agosto plays Sam, a hopeful Chef who has a vision of a Bridge collapse whilst on a business retreat. After realising his premonition is a hint of things to come, he flees the bridge along with seven of his co-workers narrowly escaping death. But they have cheated death, and now it's coming for them. The biggest bit of praise I will give this new entry is the cool premise of ""take a life, to save yours"". Essentially the characters think if they kill somebody else death will skip them, it's a great premise to keep the franchise fresh, especially after the abysmal entry Final Destination 4. Although Mary Elizabeth Winstead remains my favourite lead in the franchise, D'Agosto is excellent, he plays the part very well as Sam, who after the disaster tries to go about life normally. The supporting cast in this one are the best, I loved Jacqueline MacInnes' Wood whose performance is witty and sexy, and Emma Bell ups her game yet again which I didn't think was possible as she was incredible in Frozen (2010) Every single entry to this franchise, even the shoddy fourth entry, feature wonderfully gory death scenes that crank the inventiveness level up each time. Number five boasts the most suspenseful deaths, Director Steven Quale literally keeps you affixiated to the screen gritting your teeth as he builds up to the terror before the death. The first death is gloriously gory and painful to watch, as Ellen Wroe's Candice dies after a horrific gymnast accident where her whole body snaps, but it's the consistent shots of that damned sharp screw in view that will keep you on edge. P.J Byrne's Oscar gets what he deserves after thieving a dead co-workers massage therapy appointment, involving acupuncture needles and a bloody big Buddha statue, I needn't say no more. Best of though is Jacqueline MacInnes' Wood's character, Olivia, who undergoes laser eye surgery. It's visceral, no holds barred and unbearable, feeling sick is how I would describe this fine horror moment. All this in absolutely glorious and proper 3D only adds to the twisted nature, those acupuncture needles poke out the screen, the laser eye breaches the barriers of the TV screen plus many loose objects pop out at you. Although the highlight is the frightening bridge collapse, it is undoubtedly one of the finest visual set pieces ever and the best premonition in the Final Destination series. Sam foresees the collapse, each of the key characters is either sliced up, flattened beneath falling debris or splattered, and the depth effects sprawl into the screen spectacularly, I was in awe at the whole sequence, 3D has never felt more alive or far away. Blood splatters onto your glasses, and even simple shots of the characters talking you can tell how convincing the depth is.",Final Destination 5
109,TheHrunting,Death's fuming for the 5th time!,5,14 August 2011,"At one time, before it became the franchise and formula it is today, ""Final Destination"" was entirely fresh and new. It created a twist to the revived slasher genre that was building up and starting to die off again when it hit theaters in 2000. There were teens and they got knocked off one by one just the same, but it had such an ingenious reason for doing so: a deadly shadow was following them around to collect owed lives for dodging its originally intended plan. How are you supposed to escape that? An invisible killer that can be anywhere at anytime, not just some psycho that you can at least run through the woods from, or get on a plane and fly to some other country. But here this is the supernatural we're talking about, something that's probably as ancient as the first people to accidentally die doing an everyday thing like eating the wrong plant and berries or running off a cliff chasing a saber-tooth.""I had a vision,"" Sam (Nicholas D'Agosto) said as he's being grilled by the no-nonsense agent Block (Courtney B. Vance) before all the facts are in about the bridge collapse that he and his friends got away from just in the nick of time. At first the eight survivors don't think anything more than they're just lucky, that is until the snide, low-toned William Bludworth (Tony Todd) shows up with ambiguity because he either has a message to tell--or is it a warning?--or he's just passing by to do his job as the local coroner. Each of the other movies had a gal and a guy who tried to prevent each accident but, of course, were always just too late. This plays on that somewhat with a cell phone call here and a show up there, but instead proposed a new rule that would allow said person to accumulate someone else's life total if you kill them. It creates a moral dilemma and inner tension to the story, though it got quickly stopped by its own creative hand when it pulled the plug on itself for a shock--a shock that might just make the audiences' mouth do an ""Ohhh."" There are a few aspects thrown in to give the new set of characters--or should we say victims?--personalities, such as the young foreman named Nathan (Arlen Escarpeta) at the factory catching flack from the union rep, and Sam going through a split decision with a far away internship or a life with his girlfriend named Molly (Emma Bell) in New York. Though the thriller-like pacing often moved so fast as to run over its own dramatic scenes at the same time as building them up. It feels like a few back and forth views on what the filmmakers thought the flow should have been in the editing room. One foot in to make them memorable, one foot out because it's going to eventually not matter.If you have no recollection of the other films, then this might be a more titillating experience. You can still definitely count on it to deliver the gory bits but it didn't always capitalize on the nail-biting anxiety and anticipation of something chasing the characters. The performers often act oblivious, helpless or like hamsters in a cage with something so much bigger to the point of being a condescending bully looming over top that they can't even focus on it with their eyes. The other films had a certain nervousness at the forefront about them, especially the first film, in that Death could be anywhere at anytime. ""FD3"" at least proposed the question of: Would you want to know or not know when you're going to die? Because knowing comes with extreme unease and paranoia, and not knowing comes with numbness, even though you don't get to say your goodbyes. ""FD5"" could have taken it to the hilt but plays on a tense and release outlook instead. It has a number of quips and one-liners to get the audience loosened up--especially with P.J. Byrne and David Koechner--but it makes the shadowy, people-dying-left-and-right experience less oppressive than made out to be to cater to the portion of the audience who's a cross-armed skeptic of the supernatural.The gore traps look pretty grisly and can often catch you by unawares. Though some deaths aren't always playing on something that would be a relating experience to a general audience, since they have to tap into what hasn't been done beforehand. It creates some distancing from the screen, as the first and second film had more relating elements that made seemingly innocent areas now have a deadly shadow cast across in your mind: a kitchen, a bathroom, a stove, an elevator, crossing the street. For instance, here, a factory with dangerous machinery is only going to lead to dangerous accidents or most people aren't going to touch a gymnasium.The cinematography and the picture quality looked great on screen compared to the slapped together job ""FD4"" was. This time around the new director has the technical side well worked through and used the 3D aspect to its advantage at points with various objects actually projecting out compared to the depthless job the recent ""Harry Potter"" had and ""Captain America"" with only so many things popping out. ""FD5"" still feels more a ritual and routine than a complete refresher. Though there's still some sadistic fun to mine at times and effort put into this as a fifth installment, even if the novelty is diluted if you've kept up since the beginning or at least watched the previous films a few times.

110,fritzlang,THIS is the reason to go to the movies!,8,13 August 2011,"Before I comment on the film, a few caveats1) I really enjoyed FD1-2,and 4. I couldn't stomach #3 for some reason.2) In general, I can appreciate a 'leave your brains at the door' horror movie and accept it for what it is. 3) I saw this in IMAX 3D 4)I DESPISE 3D and think it is the #1 killer of the movie industry. I only saw this in 3D because of some reviews that said that was the only way to see it, and after seeing #4 in 2D it strangely looked like it would have been better in 3D.So I took a chance and spent $14 to see this film in IMAX 3D.I can't comment what this would look like in 2D or non-IMAX 3D, but I can assure you that this film was MADE for IMAX 3D!EVERY SCENE had a 3D effect to it! Whether it was just adding depth so you felt 'right there' or some body parts or killing instruments being thrown at you, this was the ONLY film that I thought actually made effective use of the technology. (Caveat #5 - I did not see Avatar in 3D).The movie was a typical FD film until about 2/3rd into it, when it became something else for 10 minutes. To keep this spoiler free, I won't tell you what it became, but it was GREAT! Changing genres at the end of a movie almost never works, but somehow the director made this feel a natural transition and it really AMPED up the action! Based on those scenes alone, I feel the director has more talent than just a standard horror film and am looking forward to seeing what else this guy does.For FD fans - you know what you are getting into. Though I felt this film actually a little more depth to at least some of the characters, and the lead wanting to be a chef was a nice change of pace for a film like this.The deaths do not disappoint, and there were quite a few scenes that built up tension nicely, so I was actually biting my nails in suspense (something I rarely do, folks!).The ending was also a nice variation on how these things end.Of course, like FD2-4 this is not a sequel, but really a remake with different people.. That's fine as long as you understand the formula.I had a BLAST!! The opening credits on a huge screen in 3D was worth the price of admission alone! And the big death scene in the beginning? In my humble opinion, I felt it ranked up there with the motorway incident on #2. Yes, I felt it was that good.I actually would like to see this again! Some of the kills came so fast that I wanted to back up the DVD to watch it again - but I realized I couldn't because I was in the theater!Spending $14 for ONE ticket and coming away feeling that it was worth every dollar says a lot.If you love FD1-4 then this is a no brainer. But PLEASE see it in 3D.. And IMAX if possible.8/10.For those who never saw or hated FD1-4 : please look elsewhere. Nothing really different here.",Final Destination 5
111,bobbybits,Boring,4,17 December 2011,"This instalment was boring. The characters made you want to end them, they had no depth and more time in this sequel was given them. This took away from potential action with there scenes being very short. The accidents, well it is clear the producers are running out of ideas as they weren't as clever and were very easily anticipated to the point of obvious. They even added CGI 3D effects or animated paint to them making them feel cheap.There was a great twist in the plot ""kill, to gain the death"" in this sequel which can make future sequels fun but I am not expecting much at all after this one.

112,Redcitykev,Well crafted bit of nonsense!,7,30 August 2011,"The Final Destination films are never going to win any major awards, nor will they stretch your intellect much beyond that of working out who is next to be killed in a nasty manner, but what they are is well crafted bits of nonsense, and FD5 is no exception to this.The rules remain as before - a group of mainly good looking youngsters survive a big disaster after one of them has a premonition of its occurrence. Here the big start is massive bridge collapse, which is filmed in a wonderfully realistic fashion, and the chosen few escape, only for death to... well, if you have seen any of the previous FD films than you know the rest! What tends to lift this particular edition of the franchise above the rest is that the characters are much more believable (well, within the context of the film anyway!), and the tension is handled with style (I was really gripping the seat during the kitchen scene!) The one thing that was bothering a little throughout the film was the question, why was it set in 1979? This did not appear to add anything special until the final twist at the end, which for any fan of the series is well worth waiting for (and I am not going to give it away here!) If you want cultured intelligent horror then stick with the likes of Del Torro, but if you want a thrill ride which will drench your mega bin of popcorn with dollops of the red stuff (and I'm not talking Burgandy here!) then this is a Saturday night special for you.

115,TourettesPersonal,Same Crazy Deaths,5,27 August 2011,"I really loved the opening credits of this film. It introduces the killers of the series. Random objects are the true killers of the these movies. They jump out of the screen and shows us how dangerous they are. Even the most innocent objects can be dangerous. The mysteriousness of the intro is obvious and it became intense when a dead corpse flies out of the screen then random blood splatters the broken glass. The film itself is a remake of the last four films. They added some new rules here but it doesn't change anything. At least this is better than the fourth one but in the end, this is just another sequel(or remake).Here's the thing about Final Destination. It's an intriguing high concept horror movie. But after the second film, they decided to repeat all the things from the first movie and make the deaths more gory than ever. They added new things here like the ""Kill or Be Killed"" concept. It's pretty interesting but it doesn't make any changes. That concept just made the climax more psychological and create some twists. Like I say, this is just another Final Destination sequel.If you're a fan of the film then you might enjoy it by its silly death scenes. Yep, the 3D use is gimmicky. Dangerous stuff, even the ones that aren't dangerous jumps out of the screen. Blood and gore throughout. See how fragile these people are. Here's the big problem, The film points at Molly as the important character of the film but she is really/very bland among all of them.Final Destination 5 is just another Final Destination movie. Told some new rules but still no changes. The twist in the end reveals something intriguing but after that, it became pointless. This series means nothing but to show how dumb gory violence can happen by random accidents and little objects. The movie itself will make you unsatisfied but if you are seeing this for the stupid gory violence then this repetitive sequel is your satisfactory. Kind of.",Final Destination 5

But soon after, a series of weird accidents begins to collect the survivors, is it just coincidence, or death setting out for the souls he missed that day?The Final Destination series is an odd one, a premise that mainly focuses on gore and guts, it's hard to stun the audience with what the first film had to serve. But, the previous film proved that if it's too hot in the kitchen, you should just throw out the dish, with the low serving quality of the previous film, on all levels of depth of field, acting, and directing, fans weren't too sure, but New Line was, allowing one more script of the series to come to the silver screen, was it worth it, yes!This is surprisingly the best out of the series, right next to the first one! Usually, if a series hits this milestone of 5 films, it is swallowed in cheesy acting and story telling, but it managed to captivate me! The visuals were much better than the last one for one, but this isn't too hard to not believe, with director Steven Quale having experience with 3D and visual pioneer James Cameron, it gave the film light in a new way!The acting may fall cheesy in some scenes, but this is excusable in my mind with the spot on timing of the characters!I give the film an 8.5 ticket stub out of 10!",Final Destination 5

Why? The script was improved and the movie is well-directed. The special effects were astonishing. The bridge collapse sequence was epic and unforgettable. This scene has the best CGI I have seen, everything looked so real. Also, the sound mixing and the editing were surprisingly well done. Final Destination 5 has the right director, writer and cast. The main character played by Nicholas D'Agosto did a good job, and his co-star Emma Bell clearly knows how to scream out loud, I loved her final scream in the bridge collapse scene. The rest of the cast was good enough, nothing special. Moving on, most of the characters were likable and I cared about them. There was only one character that was painfully annoying, Isaac performed by P.J. Byrne. He was unnecessary and silly.This is my favorite movie of the franchise. Final Destination 5 may be as messy and pointlessly gory as the other installments of the franchise, but the difference here is that the script is better, and no line is wasted. Also, the movie had no jump scares, I loved that. The director created a suspenseful and scary atmosphere throughout the film. The death scenes were amazing, intense and sometimes exaggerated. Steven Quale has potential. He did a pretty good job with this movie, and must do more movies like this in the future. Anyway, my conclusion is that this entry is as messy as the previous installments, but the writing was improved, the suspense and the direction were neat too. I have heard that the 3D effects here were eye-popping, I can not wait to see it on 3D. Surely FD5 has flaws, but I do not care, it was entertaining as hell to me. I highly recommend it for fans of the franchise. (B+)",Final Destination 5
120,jabrbi,Mr Physics Goes On Holiday,2,17 March 2014,"I know that you have to suspend disbelief for many films, particularly supernatural ones. But when the deaths are all meant to be freak accidents happening in the real world, you expect physics to work as normal, and for people to behave properly.Not in this film.Cue impossibility after impossibility after impossibility. If you can get through this film without saying at some point, ""That would never happen"", then you need a good, solid dose of reality injected directly into your brain.And I know that the FD series is known for it's general lack of reality, but film makes it impossible by using really cheesy, overdone special effects: sprays of blood that are too big, broken bones sticking out all over the place, skull-crushing statues. The effects are cartoon like with no sense of reality, but none of the humour of Wile E Coyote and the Road Runner.I don't know what Universe the events shown in this film are possible, but it's certainly not ours. And that robs the film of any tension and entertainment value.",Final Destination 5

The characters were interesting, the action moved well and the suspense was steady. I look forward to more sequels. I think these movies are fun and not expected to be much else but this one really works and I think that's good cause some of them have not. I think this one has great special effects to, I recommend it. For either final destination fans or shock movie fans, go see it. I also highly recommend you see it in 3D and not wait to see it on Blu Ray as I don't think you will enjoy the same experience I did seeing it in 3D.

122,ratpackaustin,Go back to what works,7,12 April 2019,"I love the final destination franchise. I know they're not award worthy movies, but it's just entertaining to watch how the characters survive the first ordeal and then get picked off later. The first movie in the franchise is gold and took its time with killing off its characters, something the sequels wouldn't do. They became lazy with the deaths and just had a bus hit someone or some other quick and cheap disposal method. But this entry in the franchise has more elaborate chain reactions leading to death that were so awesome in the original. And believe it or not the plot twist at the end of this movie is actually one of the best pieces of storytelling I've seen in a movie in how it makes it work. Overall good experience watching this movie.",Final Destination 5
123,Vezon123,"Death came for us again, oh no ... again",5,21 August 2011,"An ending can make a movie. Final Destination 5 was teetering on failing or being good, and the ending just shot it over the top. I was almost done after the last Final Destination movie because of how bad it was, and this one brought it back to the standard formula, which will keep me in the seats. Major improvement.One thing that changed it from it's standard film isn't what you'd think I'm about to say: it didn't have your standard hotties. Final Destination 5 has a beautiful young woman in Jacqueline MacInnes Wood, the rest not so much. Damn.It did give a little more insight into the pattern of those people dying. It moved how you actually can avoid it forward. It also hints into how much longer they'll live. If they added those small things into the other ones there would have been so much progression into the movie. But it's Final Destination. What am I talking about? Tony Todd (of Candyman fame) is back. After not being in the 4th installment, he's the only repeat character, having only missed that one. Nicholas D'Agosto is OK. He was in a movie called Fired Up! and hugely funny. He's fair in Final Destination 5, as was the rest of the cast. Nobody stood out. Even David Koechner was just OK. He's funny, but pretty much the same character in this one that he is in every other movie, just not as funny in this one.The writer and director both did fairly well. Writer Eric Heisserer wrote a decent script. He also wrote the Nightmare On Elm Street reboot, which failed miserably. We'll see whether he can progress when he does the Thing remake coming out soon. Director Steven Quale has done a little bit of everything. Almost literally. I would love to see what he could do if he focused on one thing like directing. I think he'd do a good job directing. Much better than he did here.Final Destination 5 is OK. If you've seen the other ones, you know what you're walking into, with a much better ending. If you haven't, don't expect any depth what-so-ever, and the ending won't mean much. It's still entertaining.",Final Destination 5
124,kdorsey321,Death Doesn't Like to be Cheated,7,18 January 2012,"In this review I am reviewing the movie ""Final Destination 5,"" starring Nicholas D'Agosto, Emma Bell, and Miles Fisher. If you want my honest opinion, when I first saw the previews for this movie I said to myself ""another one?"" ""They can come up with Final Destination movies forever."" Then I see that the ""Candyman"" is in it and I thinking maybe he is the key to some kind of conclusion to this series. I was wrong. As long as people are paying good money to see this unreasonably crazy deaths. They'll keep making the movies.The most important things about this kind of movie is that there are six to seven characters, somebody has a futuristic vision, and there are many crazy, unfeasible, unthinkable, DEATHS! Being though this movie has that I can't go too hard on it and the deaths weren't always easy to figure out. On the previous movies you could just about figure out how all of the deaths were going to happen. This one it made you think one thing was going to happen and another happened.Hear are some problems I have with this movie. For one the ""Candyman"" has three parts. Which is cool, but then he just disappears. You don't see him for the rest of the movie. You really don't know much about him...its a little weird. After all he did tell them how to beat death...I just feel like he should have had a part towards the end where he said or did something. Just my opinion. Then the sub plot about Peter turning on them to make sure he stays alive felt a little lame. I understand the premise and I'm not expecting an intricate plot, but I still feel like it was a little cheesy. Nevertheless, not a bad movie for this kind of movie so I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. You don't have to buy this on DVD unless your a big fan of the series. If you have the first four then buy it. If not, just watch it on netflix.",Final Destination 5

126,asafko-96168,Best FD entry,8,21 October 2020,"Honestly this is one of the better FD movies. It features one of the cringiest deaths (gymnastics), and I personally think the bridge open would be the scariest to actually go through, with the height and water and everything. While a lot of the characters are not that likeable, the plot line is more interesting than past FD movies. Probably the most comical entry as well.

127,alexdelliott,One of the only films worth the money for 3D,7,4 September 2011,"I am familiar with the Final Destination series and have seen 1-4 numerous times over. I had concluded that 1 and 3 were the only good ones as they were the only movies that carried off the suspense. 4 or The Final Destination was an attempt to be more gory than the others but other than that had nothing to keep me interested, similar to how the Saw movies became.5 surprised me as actually being quite good, it managed to get the suspense of the series back whilst making it a total gore fest. The good thing about 5 is that it actually stopped taking itself seriously and many of the deaths were fairly comic and in my opinion once you get to the 4th sequel you probably shouldn't continue to take it seriously as you will end up repeating the other movies yet again.There were some memorable moments and many of the characters were likable with less clichés and stereotypes. The acting from the main cast was spot on and the supporting cast had their moments, including one of my favourite movie characters of all time the freaky coroner played by Tony Todd. I had missed him throughout the series despite not knowing exactly what his role is.This movie was made for 3D and should be watched in 3D as the effects are very well carried out. The gore flies out at you and adds to the atmosphere. It is so much better than those other 3D movies which are done purely for the extra money as this has the feel of a classic 3D movie.Overall this film is good for people who have watched the series and enjoy what is basically a teen slasher movie. But not if you're looking for a serious horror movie as this is closer to a comedy.",Final Destination 5
128,iheart_ny,"A strong sequel, better than I expected.",8,24 August 2011,"After witnessing 2009's cinematic train-wreck, and I was hoping, last, installment of the ""Final Destination"" series, I was kind of appalled and disgusted when I heard that there was going to be yet another one. I generously gave ""The Final Destination"" a D- grade, for many reasons. It gave into the at-the-time lucrative and exciting 3D gimmick, and didn't deliver on the concept as it was said to. It was a typical horror movie, not bringing anything new to the table at all. While that was expected, it did give some mildly entertaining death scenes, while not necessarily being creative. It featured lousy acting, and an ending that made me happy I didn't pay to see it, as I was working at the movie theatre at that time. It wasn't even good, on a comedic level. However, I left ""Final Destination 5"" a little happier than I did its previous installment. While it's still only for horror fans, it's pretty damn entertaining, and it's more character-driven than the last couple installments have been. Its death scenes are just as creative and fun as they should be, and it made me regain a little bit of my hope in 3D film-making. It's the same story as it's always been. A gifted (and hot) early twenty-something (Nicholas D'Agosto) with apparently psychic abilities has a vision of him and all of his friends dying in a dramatic accident. He tells everybody, and witnesses them all die one-by-one, doing everything he can to stop it, but realizing, death can't be cheated. In this one, though, there's a little twist, which is a small reason why this film isn't bad as the last few have been. While there's a selected list of who dies next, if the person who's next kills someone, death skips themor does it?It's no spoiler, as it's been proved in the four previous movies, each character meets their coup de grace in a quite dramatic way. This one gives you a brief, but worthwhile back-story on each of its characters. It makes you see them as semi-established characters, rather than just teenagers who are about to kick the bucket. However, why I liked this one is because of its death scenes. They were ten kinds of awesome. There's even a little montage at the end, of creative death scenes from the previous four movies, like a compilation. While its death scenes have never been plausible, as if they could happen in real life, they don't ask to be taken seriously. In a particularly good (and kind of sad) scene, a character is killed by a Lasik surgery machine. That could never happen in real life, for a lot of reasons. But, it's great fun to watch. As is the death-by-acupuncture scene. Also, the film should be noted, because it was filmed in 3D. It shows. As you might already have noticed, I don't particularly like 3D films. I'd forever opt to see the 2D version of a film, if it was offered in addition to the 3D, this is because most films are shot in 2D, and converted to 3D at the last minute. This was CLEARLY filmed in 3D, and it makes damn good use of it. Stuff pops out at you, almost constantly, throughout the film, and it looks, and feels kind of awesome. This is probably not the last film in the series, as it will more than likely be a box-office success. I feel like this is a good time for them to end the series. They made two good ones, had a couple lousy ones, and if they end the series now, they will have bowed out on a relatively good note. But this is not a ""Saw"" movie, I will welcome whatever they bring out next.Grade: B",Final Destination 5
129,xJags,The fifth installment to a horror series...I think you know where this is going.,6,17 August 2011,"Final Destination 5 has the typical Final Destination plot - Survivors of an incident that are supposed to be dead now have death coming to restore order.The film starts off decently, the character introductions and in this movie we get a little bit of character development which was nice, its rarely done in horrors but I think in any movie it should be done! However we could have gotten more story behind the characters. As this is the fifth installment, for consistency the script,acting and plot must be interesting to ensure that its not something we have seen four times already. The acting was nothing spectacular but it was solid and I think the plot and script were good also.In a way this movie was different but at the end of it all, there is nothing really that makes it stand out. Sure there is a twist at the end and it makes the movie more interesting but the first hour of the movie is nothing really new.All in all, fans of this series will definitely enjoy this film and for those who are in the mood for a horror flick, check this film out.",Final Destination 5

131,birdieleigh,Gruesome and impressive,9,12 August 2011,"I'm a huge fan of the Final Destination series. They aren't Oscar contenders, but they are certainly quite entertaining. However, after hearing a lot of negative feedback on the 4th FD, I decided not to watch it and hung my head in disappointment. I genuinely thought my favorite deadly franchise had finally bit the dust itself, and in a bad way. But when I heard about this fifth and final Final Destination, I decided to give it one more chance. Because hey, I hadn't been to the theater in awhile and if it sucked I'd at least have a good laugh. But, I am very happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised by Final Destination 5.The story, as other reviewers have mentioned, really sets FD5 up to good prospects. It feels a lot more like the first FD, much darker without being too complex. I honestly liked the 2nd and 3rd ones a lot, but they were missing the creepy factor that the first installment had. This fifth episode really brings it back. The characters are surprisingly believable. Granted, you have the gratuitous hot chick and ladies man, but the characters never feel contrived or forced. Kudos to the actors for keeping this from being a $5-bin campy horror film.The effects, even in 2D, were just as I think a film's effects should be: realistic enough to avoid the fake-factor, but not so excessive that they drown out everything else in the film. Yes, one could argue that these movies are all about death, but what always made them different for me from other horrors was the focus on build-up. The FD franchise has it's fans trained to watch for every little thing in a scene that could cause someone's demise until your skin crawls--and FD5 gives the audience this ""detective"" feeling perfectly.To be honest, I wasn't expecting much out of this movie. However, from the very beginning, I was impressed. A few points of warning: it is very graphic, but anyone who has seen any of the other FD films should know that already. Also, you will not enjoy this film as much if you haven't watched at least the 1st FD, if not the 2nd and 3rd as well. When you factor in the story and characters, the death and mayhem we've all come to love, and one of the best plot twists I've seen this year, FD5 is very worth watching. Go on, have some fun.But you all just be careful, now. ;)",Final Destination 5

If not, it's neck-and-neck with the original.Unlike the fourth film, this one has some really likable characters, similar to the first two films. The deaths involved in this one were extremely elaborate and interesting and the ending involved a gigantic bamboozle that I still get goosebumps over.Made 11 years after the first one, you can see how much the franchise has changed and grown and while the fourth one was bad, the fifth one made the franchise fresh again.I almost want a new Final Destination film.

133,arginnon,Surprisingly good!,7,4 May 2012,"I've only seen the first and the fourth Final Destination movies before this one, but from those I got a pretty good idea of what might be going on in the other two (main character sees accident, some people survive, they all die one by one), so I didn't bother watching those. I went to see this one mainly because of the 3D, and that didn't disappoint at all. However, the film was disappointing – but in a good way!In the other movies the characters had to save someone to break the pattern of death in order to survive. In this one a fresh idea was introduced, which made the movie more interesting, exciting and fun. I won't spoil it for you here, go check it out yourself!Another surprise was the ending. It was cleverly done and unexpected, but you have to see the first movie to understand it.The actors weren't as bad as they usually are in horror films, the main character, Nicholas D'Agosto actually did quite a good job. The effects and deaths were good, intense and creative, the movie is fun to watch. I'd recommend seeing it once for horror fans. It's not the greatest, but definitely good.",Final Destination 5
134,thepsychocritic,FD5 is to death what Kama Sutra is to sex.,5,31 August 2011,"Death has always fascinated humans. The more gruesome, the better it is. In came the 21st century and in came Final Destination, which followed by four more was anything but the final destination. They redefined the meaning of dying; it was no longer just the end, it became a piece of art. The concept then was original and clever - a group of people are saved from a fatal accident after one of them has a premonition. Death gets angry and starts topping them off one by one. Very basic and totally hardcore; something like a sadist's wet dream.Eleven years and four movies later, the concept remains the same. Originality was killed in the first film along with the unfortunate characters. 'Death has never been closer,' the posters proudly and ominously proclaim, just like it hadn't been in Final Destination, Final Destination 2, Final Destination 3 and The Final Destination.The biggest challenge for the film-makers in this time period has been inventing increasingly disturbing methods to massacre people, which isn't a very difficult task per se. All you need to do is take a bridge, take a person, demolish the bridge and ensure that the person coincidentally falls and gets impaled onto the mast of a sailing boat. Bonus points if the person is a semi-hot female who screams really loud and dies with blood spattering in your face. The deaths are funny, gruesome, disgusting, sudden, painful, ironic, and accidental - things you can't imagine, but can certainly foresee. You could appreciate the creativity, though - they do it better than Hitler himself and he's a man who had over six million chances.The opening reminded me of my imaginary son's third grade annual day. Every character comes, speaks two lines as an introduction and walks away. You can almost hear them saying 'Hello, I'm so and so, and I am going to get crushed to pulp by a pregnant angry Yeti,' before fading away into the background. The actors are nobodies so don't expect too much from them. They almost seem apologetic while acting. They are here to die so let them just die is peace. They are all hoping that someone gets hooked seeing them get slaughtered and gives them their long awaited shot at glory. I'd certainly cast them as props if I could - you know, rocks, trees and maybe even a statue.The film seems like a big, goddamn parody at times, but then you see the serious expression on everyone's faces, the impression soon passes. Except for the kill-skills, everything is a cliché. The protagonist (the guy who you suspect may not die), Sam Lawton (Nicholas D'Agosto) is the stereotypical front-man - brooding, non-skeptical, heroic with occasional abilities of getting sneak-previews into the future. The dialogues happen in your head before they happen on the screen, leaving a 'this has happened before' taste in your mouth. There is the musical crescendo every time someone is going to get annihilated, the glorious revelation by a mysterious guy, the blame-game, the 'imma-wanna-cheat- death' - déjà vu.The movie has a morbid sense of humour which manages to evoke more laughter than the recently churned out 'comedies,' though I am not very sure if it that was intended. The abruptness of some deaths tickles the funny bone. No sane person would deny that there is something oddly hilarious about a man getting impaled onto the hook of a crane. But that could just be me.Creating suspense just seems pointless and futile. After making four parts with the same freaking story, you kind of expect the audience to know what's coming next; they only want to know how. That's where the movie earns some brownie points. The tension has been built well. The film plays well on your fear of small things, like nails, candles, needles and other objects that make you cringe. The moments just before someone dies are the only highlight in this detritus of blood, gore and flying body organs. To top it all, there is also the unwanted yet obligatory romance which is totally devoid of emotions and sensuousness. After reaching a point where you eventually get tired of seeing people get eviscerated, chopped, mutilated, lacerated and burned, the end only comes as much awaited.But, four sequels down the line, they still don't answer the question – why or how are the visions, or premonitions happening? Maybe they'll make a sixth part explaining it all. If they do, I can bet my house that a man will die due to accidental ingestion of a zombie rabbit who is actually Death is disguise. On a random note, I do suffer from fits of exaggeration at times. But then, so do the movie-makers.",Final Destination 5

I do enjoy these films.My only beef is the Tom Cruise look a like. He goes more than a little mental during the film (like Tom in real life I guess!?)

136,marcusdestorm,Is this the Final Destination?,9,25 February 2012,"First of all, we can reveal that Final Destination 5 IS the Final Destination instalment in the series which has brought ""Death Experiences"" to the forefront of many people's lives, especially where the sunbeds, plane journeys and motorway examples are concerned.Leaving the very best until last, the instalment brings you face-to-face with the horrific tragedies that result in cheating death – and as William Bludworth points out ""Nobody escapes death – because Death has a design which is not only flawless, but is imprinted on a greater design.Starting the last instalment off with the introduction of the character's, Sam, Molly, Peter, Candice, Olivia, Isaac, Nathan, Dennis, Roy, Jon and Cho, it is worth knowing that only eight out of the total number of passengers on the bus survive the awesome and yet terrifying consequences of Chaos and Fate; the coined phrase 'Being in the wrong place at the wrong time' comes to mind. All the same, the lead character – as in all the past films – has a vision before the calamity and in their wisdom pre-warns everyone on the bus. And, like previous instalments there are those that listen, while there are also those (probably amateur actor's looking for a big break) who don't want to listen to the crazy ranting's of those who didn't want to go on the ""Retreat Trip"" in the first place.As soon as the bus pulls up onto the suspension bridge, it is at this point the film really starts to tickle those senses which bring us fear, terror and a sudden ability for our bladders to work by themselves. The special effects alone bring us up close and personal to the real gore horror of some ways in which we could die during such a disaster; impalement's, scolding's, crushing's, slices and dicing's, it is Final Destination that seems to have the angle on the varied differences. As well as the great onslaught of horrifying carnage of the suspension bridge, there is, of course, the matter of the eight survivors who must now dodge the lurking pit-falls of death and somehow escape their demise completely.Personally speaking, the weak and similar attributes brought to us in Final Destination 3, has certainly been tweaked and better tweaked in the final episode. The characters are strong in their acting, the plot is smooth as well as well balanced and the 'Love to Hate' combo's in some of the characters who are arrogant to the fact that death is following them is eventually paid in full by the great death scenes that they endure – Dennis and Isaac in particular.For those who have been following the franchise, which has had one hell of a great run, Final Destination 5 will certainly not disappoint in the areas that truly matter. As for anyone who has never seen an episode (Yes, any more than two movies constitutes an episode run of films), then this finale will definitely have them reaching for the others, too. Laden with awesome visual effects that will perturb, scare and terrify even the hardest amongst us, the final twist will have everyone gasping in awe and raising the roof with sighs of respectable applause that now the story lines and hard work have come to an end.DVD Archive Rating: 9/10",Final Destination 5

No matter how routine the story is if you make it entertaining(not just some none sense action) you still have a chance of people enjoying it and 3D is one of the ways that can you make this happen. Honestly i didn't have any expectation watching this in 3D, but after i realized that it was worth it.5.The ending. this also really worked for me. We know the ending is always surprising, but this time is just slightly different. So get ready to hear lots of HOLY S***** in the theater.6.Last but not least, is the Humor that's added to the film. there are bunch of funny lines that you didn't have before in the series, so you don't really expect it coming. a good change . but some might find it quite awkward because your dealing with death.So for those of you who wanna see a good 3D film, or want to be grossed out a bit, or just want to spend a night watching a different movie that you usually watch with your loved ones, this would be a pretty good choice.Overall : 6/10",Final Destination 5

The story itself still the same as the previous Final Destination series, a group of people saved from a tragic accident but what happen later are beyond their imagination : death are chasing them one by one.. The only difference is they can live if they kill another people, well it's not a bad idea.. The effects itself still have no difference with the fourth movie : brutal yet so fake, but that's okay with me.. Overall, it's still be an enjoyable movie to be watched, but just don't put any expectation while watching it because these actors still need more acting lesson..",Final Destination 5
142,MDOmarMakki,"Like other parts, Final Destination 5 is creepy, tense and enjoyable",8,30 August 2021,"I don't care what anyone says ever about these films, but I stand by the Final Destination series. It tackles the biggest notion of fear and horror ever- death. How do we cope with it and is there really a pattern and type of design out there? I am personally a big fan of the first 3 movies in this series and the 5th one kind of has a fresher take on the series. The deaths are a bit more suspenseful in this film and it's hard to tell exactly how the survivors are going to die. The acting is also a bit better, j think. I think it's interesting how the end of this film ties back into the first film, concluding the series. It adds some weird comfort to know that this is ""closed out."" Also, Tony Todd is amazing.",Final Destination 5
143,shanc_sk,FD5: Can be considered the best of the series,7,21 August 2011,"Now, this is one movie I didn't repent watching in 3D. This has to be the best of the series, the only thing which pulls it down is its following of the standard formula - hence, kinda predictable. Else it scores.To the positives, they reserved the best choreographed opening disaster for this one. And Coming from the fourth FD (which was plain & the death scenes coerced), this has some of the most ""jaw-dropping"" death sequences, as this might be probably the last one in the series - ends a full circle.Don't miss the premonition neither the final scene. The 3D is really worth here.",Final Destination 5
144,MovieCritic33-6,"""You all just be careful now!"" A Final Destination Review:",10,7 February 2012,"MAIN CAST: Nicholas D'Agosto, Emma Bell, Jacqueline MacInnes Wood, Miles Fisher, Arlen Escarpeta, David Koechner, and Tony Todd.PLOT: On their way to a company retreat, the films protagonist Sam (Nicholas D'agosto)has a vision that he, along with his co-workers are going to die on the North Bay Bridge. However, being able to see his own death before the actual encounter he alters fate and saves himself along with his girlfriend Molly (Emma Bell), friends and co-workers from their untimely demise. Thinking the worst is behind them, each try and move forward with their lives, unaware that death does not like to be cheated and will go to extremely gruesome measures to fix that ripple that they have caused in death's design.ACTING: Decent. (But does it really matter when it comes to this type of genre).TONE: Serious, with a humorous undertone.SCRIPT: Clever and refreshing. Familiar, yet finds a way to make the film slightly less predictable. Full of little notions to past Final Destination instalments.PROS: Jaw dropping opening sequence, with incredible special effects with both CGI and make-up. Deaths are unpredictable. Creative and unsettling death sequences. Rejuvenating storyline, with a spine tingling twist. Takes itself seriously. Convincing characters.CONS: Plot may still feel too familiar for some viewers. The 3-D effects may be unappealing to viewers who watch in 2-D.VERDICT: My personal favourite out of the entire series. Highly recommended for any fan of the franchise. Definitely worth watching. As it was intended for 3-D viewing, I recommend watching the 3-D version if possible. If not the 2-D version is still as effective minus the eye-popping WOW factor.",Final Destination 5

I should say, the franchise is saved. But i personally feel FD5 not surpassing the benchmark set by FD1,2&3. But this one is big enough to rock you. It follows the same pattern as in all the other FD movies. But it brings in new stuff. Watching it in 3d pulls your heart out,if you have a weak one. The new director, Steven quale is promising.Tony todd is hauntingly( i should say) superb.FD5 is deadly insane. So you need to be tough to watch this movie. Overall i give it a 7/10. This is a must watch in 3d.Anyway Final destination is BACK....",Final Destination 5
147,arlum_meow,not better than the first 2 but defo better than 3 and 4,6,29 July 2012,final destianiton 5 starts of with Sam and his mates on a coach. I'm very glad that this final destination gave us time to like the characters and to get to know them a little bit more before they actually died.so Sam has a premonition that the bridge was going to collapse and him and his friends were going to die. so his vision comes true and history repeats its self for a 5th time and saves his friends that were meant to die on the bridge but they cheated death.even from the first ten minuets i liked this better than final destination 3 and the final destination because it had a better cast for a start and has a much better build up to the big distatser. but then again its the same stuff that happens in the first 4 movies the people who was saved from the bridge are going to die anyway in the order they were meant to die on the bridge.when the end comes i was very surprised and it was a well thought threw ending.BIG SPOILER the ending involves Sam and his girl friend on a plane on there way to Paris ring any bells. so he sees a boy that had a premontion that the whole plane was going to explode ALEX the boy from the first final destination. so Sam and his girlfriend die for not getting of the plane.final destination 5 was a well done movie that earned the respect that was needed after the dreadful embarrassing final destianiton 3 and 4 a well earned 6/10,Final Destination 5
148,sleepholymtn,Death be not proud...,7,13 July 2020,"To say I like these as movies wouldn't be accurate, it's more about fun of the how it's going to happen, the deluge of mostly awesome gore and creativity interconnected stories make the series well worth the watch. It's had it's ups (the chaos of the premonitions in 2) and downs (really crappy people as characters and jinky CGI over-top what was really good particle FX is the second worst idea Hollywood's ever had, next to all the sexual assault) as a franchise I would give it a solid 6.
Final Destination ends on a very solid 7.5 and my favorite of the movies. The characters are mostly likeable and fairly well acted...mostly. The vicious Rube Goldberg traps are really top notch and well executed (even with some dated CGI overlay and 3D gimmick) and boasts the best kill of the series, a feat in itself! I didn't see the end coming at all and the impact of the death good characters gives it a quasi-emotional punch to it that the others lack. If it worked a little harder on rendering the CGI, some better characters (it also wouldn't hurt to throw in some boobies but that is a gripe not a criticism) and played down a lot of the black comedy slapstick it really could have been an 8.5.",Final Destination 5
149,white_fire4,"Same title, same downward slope of creativity",3,9 December 2011,"*insert raspberry sound here* This was baaaaaaaaad. I thought 4 was bad, but this makes 4 look like a shining gem of a movie.Plot is same as always, group of people cheat Death because one of them inexplicably has a premonition about how they're all going to die.This was interesting in the first movie, because it was something new, we hadn't really had a horror movie where we didn't actually ever see what was doing all of it, and because the ""villian"" or bad guy killing everyone, literally could not be stopped.Unfortunately, unlike the first two, it has devolved into basically setting up grotesque looking death traps. Whereas in those first two movies, it actually explored how freaked out people would really be if stuff like this happened, and how the person who had the vision would essentially go a bit nuts, they just keep losing things that made them great.Like, for instance, the small warning signs. There was one that I can recall in this movie, and it was the girl who gets her eye all burned up by the laser, she drops a photo of her and a friend and it shatters outward from that eye. Everyone else, no warning signs whatsoever.Ominous and inexplicable audio and visual cues when ""Death"" shows up to start the trap, sure, but small things like the warnings, made these films originally very interesting, kept you guessing.This just basically tries to fool you. Such as in the gymnasium, there's the screw on the beam, the electric cord in the water, the fan. They make them all seem very evil and it's really about the only death trap that does this. But it's essentially just a slap in the face, as what happens - girl to die gets off beam, goes onto swinging bars, another girl gets onto the beams. She eventually stabs the screw into her foot, falls down, knocks the fan onto it's side, blows dust around the girl on the beams, she STUPIDLY dismounts, twirls around, lands on her neck.It just makes you want to put your head in your hand and shake it.The girl with the laser, does actually get her eye/hand burned pretty good by it, but actually dies by slipping out of the window and landing on a car. Chinese looking guy, same thing, falls on the needles in his body, fire envelopes the room....what kills him is the buddha statue falls on his head.Two deaths actually occur with absolutely no warning and little build up, the jerk boss gets a wrench smashed into his face at high speeds, which you basically see rattling around and then falling onto a belt about 15 seconds before, and the guy at the end gets crushed by a plane wheel, right after he finds out the guy he ""killed"" to steal his life, was going to die anyways.Oh, and the main character realizes they're screwed on the plane about 15 seconds before it actually goes boom and takes him and the girl with it.On that note, there are two things this movie did somewhat right....the ""twist"" of this being a prequel to the first one, had you heard NOTHING about this before seeing the movie, would probably make you go ""Ohhhh...nice!"" And they setup the inevitable continuation of the series, as the Coroner from the first two movies, in one scene, explains that ""He's seen this stuff happen before....a group of people cheat Death and then one by one, it comes back for them...to reset the balance"" and blah blah blah.Once you realize this is a prequel....DING DING DING!! This stuff was happening for god knows how long BEFORE Alex ever got off the plane in the first movie :O Shock and awe!! And likely where the sequels will come in.However, they made a BIG BIG BOO BOO in continuity here (actually, there's major continuity issues throughout this whole movie if you pay attention) ..... when they board the plane at the end and after Alex and everyone gets off, the main guy looks at his plane ticket.The first movie took place in 1999, starting on September 25th. That was when the plane took off for Paris, and Alex and everyone got off, blah blah. The ticket in ~this~ movie shows the date being May 13th, 2000.Again, face in hand, shake at the sheer idiocy.Every time a new installment comes out, I keep hoping they'll do it wisely, do something actually new (the concept of taking anothers life for you own is not new, they did a version of this in 2, trying to save the baby, escaping deaths grip by being drowned and clinically dead for a few minutes) and of course, it never works.Even just somehow tie the rest of the movies together, like they did with the second to the first one. Actually go somewhere with the damn story for once! Bring back the thought provoking of the first movie.If this is any indication of the future movies, then I know it won't be happening, unfortunately.",Final Destination 5
150,abjerg01,"More of the first movies, but still not quite enough...",7,10 December 2011,"I tried to keep my expectations low on this one, even though that was pretty tough, since I hated the 4th movie and people keep saying this one was way better. And no doubt it is. At some points I actually sat speech- and breathless and had that old classic FD-feeling I had when I watched the first 3. The deaths were better, the acting was better, the character development was better. There was only two things I wasn't satisfied with. Although the 4th one was a massive fail, they oddly enough decided to keep a little humor in the deaths etc. as they did in the 4th one; which I just, in my opinion, stupid. I still don't get it? Why do they build up a perfect and scary death-scene and end it of with silly humor? Well, this still get 7/10 cause I enjoyed it although it had some elements from the 4th. The last thing I didn't really like was the CGI-effects, mostly the blood, and why this one also needed to be in 3D. I hate movies were they just over-uses that 3D effect it kind of ruin the movie. But because I was entertained, I felt classic-FD-moments, and the story and twist were great, I'll give this 7/10.",Final Destination 5

However in terms of horror its more like a bloody looney tunes movie, watching death constantly f##k up and his victims getting away. It does mildly expand on the story by introducing a new rule to fight death and the twist at the end was different but apart from that its definitely little more unpredictable and it does definitely fall in the top three miles above 3 and The Final Destination.

In 2009, the fourth installment in the series was released. While it did great at the box office, the film received terrible reviews from critics and fans across the nation.In 2011, a fifth film was released. The film is what I would call and what others may believe to be the best sequel in the Final Destination series. It has everything that I could ask for from a final destination movie. It has the gruesome death scenes, suspense, stylish directing, a dark feel to it, great acting, etc. As the sequels were released they all started to lose that dark side. But this film brings the dark side back. The 3D was fantastic and was used perfectly. The ending is so amazing. I had chills the whole entire time.If your a fan of the series, GO SEE THIS MOVIE.

I think this is the best one. I haven't quite decided. It is fantastic. The acting was good. Way better than the 4th one's. The kills were great. Very cringe-worthy. The effects were very good. Especially the bridge collapse. Although, there was one shot at the end of the premonition that was very bad. I won't say what, but once you see it, you'll agree. The cast was great. I can see a lot of people disliking D'Agosto's performance, but personally I thought he was great. The ending was amazing. Definitely the best part of the movie. There are many hints leading up to it, but it is still very shocking. Unfortunately, I had the ending as well as many of the deaths spoiled already. But, they are still very shocking. I guarantee die-hard Final Destination fans will be very pleased. I definitely recommend it.9/10.",Final Destination 5

These twists allow for more depth both in character drama and in plot. The space between the death scenes are no longer painfully dull with cringe worthy dialogue; it's not gripping drama but it's a huge improvement and the characters aren't so paper thin. the film also manages to get the tone pitch perfect, keeping things serious and intense but tongue in cheek when it's needed.The death scenes are fewer and far between this time around but they still pack a punch being significantly more suspenseful than usual and the disaster on the bridge is probably the best and most intense opening out of all them.The twist at the end actually blew me away and I was not expecting it at all. It's not draw dropping but those who have stuck through the series since the beginning are sure to get a big kick out of it.I think most importantly, the film just feels like a film again and not just another Final Destination movie. It felt so much more refreshing and new; something the series hasn't felt like in quite some time. Rivals the first film in serving up equal amounts of guilty gory thrills and interesting characters and plot.",Final Destination 5
157,lindsaykeaton,Good Final Chapter,7,3 October 2020,"By this point, the Final Destination series was on its last legs, especially due to the horrible 4th installment that came out a few years before this. I suppose someone in charge decided to end things once and for all and, thankfully, this entry allows the series to rest peacefully...for now.The story is the same as all the others except this time the big prologue disaster is on a suspension bridge and all the survivors are taken out by death one by one. If you're coming to see a Final Destination movie, you know it's all about the crazy death scenes and this one does deliver. The most memorable involves what happens to a gymnast when she doesn't stick to the landing.There's an awesome twist that ends up connecting this one to the original film and brings the entire franchise together in a beautiful, full circle kind of way.

A new theory if you take a life you can keep it AND it coincided with the First film being everything full circle. What more could you want?!

160,DeaditeGaz92,The Best of the Series So Far,8,1 September 2011,"Just got back from seeing this film in 3D and I am totally stunned by how good it was. I mean I obviously expected it to be good but not THAT good. First of all I'll start off by talking about the deaths. They were a LOT more gorier in this one than what they were in the previous four, great examples of this are the opening sequence, the gym scene, the lazer eye scene and the massage pala scene. These scenes really use the 3D effect as much as they can and whilst we're on the subject of 3D, if you have a choice to see this in 2D or 3D, I strongly suggest you choose the 3D option as the 3D in this movie was some of the best 3D I have ever seen.*SPOILER ALERT* The ending is my personal highlight of this film. For those who have not seen it I strongly suggest you do not read this and see the film for yourself. Basically it reveals that the first hour and 20 minutes is set before the first movie and the final five or ten minutes is at the same time as the first movie so basically we get to witness the plane crash after Alex and his friends got off the plane.Overall I think it's one of the best entries in the series and if you're a fan of the series you won't be disappointed, and if you ain't a fan of the series I still recommend you check it out10/10",Final Destination 5

The bridge collapse and the deaths were very well thought out. This film also has the best opening credits I have ever seen.I don't under stand why the rating is so low this film is awesome. This has been my favorite film series for a long time and this is a good addition to the series. This is a step up from the past two failures of films I saw Rio and Gnomeo and Juliet. I liked this movie so much I had to see it twice in theaters. I am looking forward to the sixth and seventh installments in this brilliant series. The reason this film has has such a low rating is because you idiots prefer s*** films like rio and twilight new moon. I have seen those two bullsh** films and I can tell you this they are two of the most retarded movies I have seen. Watch this movie instead.,Final Destination 5

By the way because some people often treat final destination fans as heartless and bloodthirsty come on the violence in these movies is so over the top and ridiculously impossible you just cant resist laughing at some points, I had a good time in the cinema watching this little horror-flick, its no Shakespeare just some pretty nice death scenes, a cool ending that i wont spoiler and actually some good 3D effects (which is rare nowadays).So if you're a final destination fan go check this movie out you wont be disappointed.",Final Destination 5

The first movie is the least of the series, actually. After that, they become technical marvels of ingenuity, imagination, and craftsmanship. Compelling characters, interesting plot and stories, sometimes chessy, but usually good or even awesome cgi. These is an amazing movie series. This last one didnt drop the ball. Why arent we shooting for 30 movies in this series??? If James Bond can do it..... Theres unlimited source material ( ways to die) . Exponitentially more than Bond could ever dream of. The movies are well shot, with interesting characters. Yes the whole thing with death and how it operates is "" blown up "" ( pardon the pun) to a point of making the plot pointless. Thats the real fault with these movies. Make the rules stick. And explain things. These two important points would lend a lot more credibility with the audience. Having free license to do whatever , whenever, and whyever, is the one bad thing in this movies series. That being said, i highly recommend these as great Twilight Zone style entertainment. Visually striking and imaginative and entertaining . Yes it is horror too...not too much though if you think of it more as sci-fi. Get your popcorn ready. Yes these can be really good in 3d too.",Final Destination 5
168,FireWave,"It has just a little bit improvement from the last one, but it's in the same bin with the last one",5,18 August 2011,"All right, I didn't have any high hopes or expectations before seeing this movie. After I did that, my expectations were even on the lower level. First, I will start from the acting, which is very bad. When we talking about it, just Jacqueline MacInnes Wood did very good job. She really got in the role of Olivia Castle and i just didn't want for her to die very soon, which again didn't happened. She presented fear very well and was open-minded person. Beside her can stand Courtney B. Vance, Tony Todd and Arlen Escarpeta with weaker performances. I was let down by acting of Miles Fisher, Nicholas D'Agosto and Emma Bell. The opening disaster was nothing great. Disaster from the second was just great. So, from that I wanted more, but I was cheated, apparently.The story is the same, and there is no change in it, but my big problem with movie is that characters of Emma Bell and Nicholas D'Agosto never really tried to help any others survivors except Olivia. They were selfish and really didn't care, at least they didn't convince me that they were sorry and they ever cared about anything and anyone. Deaths were just average, but again too much gory for prequel thing. 3D effects were very good, but that can't made better movie, far from that. Without them, this movie is just on pair with it's predecessor. And there is a ""shocking"" end. There is just nothing clever in it. The end of this one is the beginning of the first, which means that every fatal events comes two days after the other fatal event and in the circle. And, in the fourth part we found out that there were just few fatal accidents (from previous movies) that involved people with visions. And the whole town and things are just so much modern for 2000. My sister bought cell-phone like Olivia's two months ago. Bludworth said that he saw the same situation with survivors from some creepy and big accident before and this is a prequel. Even if this happened before, it's just don\t make sense, because this accidents should be rare in the world. Just few people can see them coming and manage to crush down Death's plans. Alex went crazy about premonition like Sam two days ago. That's no weird for nobody in that town, just for Molly and Sam? Really?! Just two many plot-holes in two minutes, it's too much. Overall: Trailer is great, but movie is just... eh. On pair with the fourth part. No enough scares, again cheap trills with Ellen Wroe's final scene, but nothing new and fresh. My rating: 4.8/10",Final Destination 5
169,goryverbinski,How did this one actually work?,8,8 October 2013,"Part one was amazing. Parts two and (to a lesser extent) three were solid. Part four was God Awful on every level, and that was why when it came to part five, I admittedly went in to it with a severe bios. That being said, Final Destination 5 actually works. Granted, it was mostly just a by the numbers rehashing of everything that made the first one great, but there was also a dash of something extra. The direction, though completely mechanical, is not without joy here. The kills in this movie are staged so amusingly that I started to feel as though the film was interactive. The filmmakers just screw with you so much leading up to the demise of every character in the film. Which by the way is practically all of them. The script is so gleeful in its antagonizing approach that after a while you stop feeling annoyed and start having a blast. Also, the ending is so cheap, and yet, the greatest way to wrap up the franchise...and hopefully for good this time.",Final Destination 5

It has pretty much the same plot as all of the others and characters do not seem overly upset about their friends dying or act logically.. But you don't watch the FD films for the story you watch for the freak accidents and they are all pretty ""good"" and very gory. There is one in particular that I couldn't watch (being a bit eye phobic).There are a lot of intentional laughs (from Isaac and Dennis) and a few unintentional ones too/ The CGI bridge collapse at the beginning is fantastically well done and worth the price of admission. Likewise the twist ending.In summary - the series seems to have gone out on a high. Please don't make another one and spoil it!",Final Destination 5
171,artrambler-ru_96,"Not bad, pretty good",7,18 August 2011,"I do not like this franchise, you know why? I think, you know. Each piece is removed by this algorithm: I saw a vision of death, saved by friends, others die and heroes will die in the course of the film simply absurd deaths. This was repeated four times, well, perhaps not tired? The first part was good, it was the original. The second part was boring, but all the same with some new ideas. The third part I consider the best in the series. The fourth part is utter nonsense, but this is the part most of all to work.I waited for the fifth part? Not really, but he believed that Tony Todd will be given more screen time, actually, I thought that it plays an important role in the plot. But everything I hoped it would not be such nonsense, which was the last movie. Trailer speaks for itself, in this part (again) there is nothing new.I think, I did not write it, but all the same give my opinion on the new film. Fortunately, I was pleased the film more than its predecessor. The first 20 minutes I was even interesting to watch what was happening, but then went went. It's almost exactly like in the movies, but the other actors and other deaths.I watched the movie on kamripe, because it was just a burning desire to behold this movie. In the cinema, I would not have gone in 2009, I had enough, stupid waste of money.Special effects themselves are not really the best (although I looked on the computer), sometimes even catches the eye is that it drew on the computer, even killing some bad look. Tupizm and absurd enough, but at least not in such quantities as in the past film.As for the role of Tony Todd, it is low, namely 6-7 minutes of screen time. Most of all I remember the trick with the bridge (yes, early in the film) and a scene in the hospital.As for the ending, the writers obviously wanted to freshen up the film, I liked it at first, but then I saw on the screen the words ""Two weeks later,"" I made everything clear, and I was very disappointed.In the end, I want to say that this is not the best film of the series, but it's not a bad sequel. Yet, these ""destination"" it's time to tie in some places five part was boring because the plot moves were repeated and repeated all too predictable. And it's interesting to me, well if this movie will be repaid and will be released if (God forbid) 6 part? A matter of time.",Final Destination 5

174,jvilla53,"Really, really, REALLY fun 3D roller coaster ride - worth the 2-year wait and more!",9,28 August 2011,"What would you be willing to do when Death comes for you? That's the question explored in the popular franchise's fifth installment that delivers a solid experience for fans and non-fans alike.Sam Lawton, his girlfriend Molly Harper and their officemates head out to a company retreat that fateful day. However, as they are crossing North Bay Bridge, Sam has a violent premonition of the bridge collapsing, killing everyone on it (well, almost everyone) including himself. As he pulls out of his dream, he convinces Molly and some others to get off the bus. As his officemates wonder about his actions, his vision plays out and gives everyone a run for their lives as the bridge (spectacularly) begins to collapse for real. Now branded ""The Lucky Eight"", the survivors begin to accept the tragedy and move on with their lives.But however lucky they might have been, something is not willing to let them live for long. Sometime afterwards, the survivors start to die one by one in bizarre and gruesome accidents. As the terrible reality that Death will come for them as well sinks in, Mortician William Bludworth approaches them and tells them about a new way to survive. According to him, they must kill someone so that they ""take their spot in the realm of the living... all the days and years that they've yet to live"", and their victims would then take their place in death, ""then the books are balanced."" As the body count rises, it becomes a nerve-wracking struggle to survive Death's sadistic game.Final Destination 5 is not your ordinary FD movie. Sure, it follows the mandatory premonition-escape-Death comes for them all approach, but it is the addition of this new rule that steers the movie's plot to a whole new direction, because really, you should never EVER kill someone, albeit a completely random stranger. But if it was your ONLY path to surviving?The premonition is superb. The bridge collapse is unnervingly realistic, but not realistic enough to make you forget you're watching an FD movie. Sure, it's unlikely that people would get impaled by boat masts and rebars and get sliced in half by corrugated steel metal sheets when an actual collapse does occur, but that's what it's all about. It's gory, in-your-face violence that makes your jaw drop but still lets you enjoy the experience.The death scenes are crazier and more realistic this time around. A problem with the last movie was that the deaths were too implausible and takes the fun right out of the movie, but in this installment, the producers aimed for the ""more likely to happen"" approach. Take for instance the gymnast's death. Sure, not every gymnast could die like that, but is it really impossible? More likely would be a very slim chance of it happening, but likely nonetheless. The chain of events leading to the deaths affects the characters in such a way that it seems more natural altogether...... which brings us to the characters. They are not the stereotypical 2D cardboard cut-outs that you usually see in these type of films, but they actually have depth this time around. You can feel their excitement when good things come their way, and their grief and sorrow when someone dies (not necessarily) in front of them. Most evident is the emotion between lead Sam (played by Nicholas D'Agosto) and his girlfriend Molly (Emma Bell). At first, they feel that their relationship is going nowhere, but when Death comes for them, they realize that they still have feelings for each other. They reconcile, and then they start to work together. They are actually as 3D as the movie itself.And now comes the fun part. The 3D was AWESOME. In most cases, it tends to blur the action especially in dark settings such as nighttime, but not in FD5. Even at night scenes, the depth is there and doesn't make you have a headache or anything like that. Also, things that aren't supposed to be popping out the screen stay there, giving depth to the scenery, and those supposed to jut out or be poked or thrown right at our faces do their job wonderfully. Glass shards fly out the screen in such a manner that your neck feels like it's gonna be sliced, needles look like they'll really puncture you, and lasers look so close to you that you may actually feel it burning your eyeball. To say the least, it was crystal-clear, super-fine and simply amazing. Kudos to the filmmakers who really exerted their effort.FINAL DESTINATION 5. Not exactly the best movie in history, but certainly the biggest, bloodiest, craziest and most terrifyingly fun 3D experience of the year! Haste no more and rush to theaters near you,and if you can(and I'm telling you, you SHOULD), watch it in 3D. Best way to go, it'll be worth your every penny. :-D9/10",Final Destination 5
175,MovieMadChrisB,Final Destination 5,8,28 August 2011,"I have just come back from the cinema after watching this film in 3D, and i have to say that it is one of the best horror films that i have seen this year so far. I wasn't the biggest fan of this franchise, after the third film which i found predictable, and the fourth film was a pointless film. So going into this film i was expecting the same old storyline and characters that made the last two films poor. But I was wrong, Final Destination 5 takes all your expectations from watching the previous films in the franchise and uses them in the film to give an unexpected outcome. The acting is outstanding from all the cast, and the character development is amazing, unlike The Final Destination (2009), you care about the characters after the initial disaster. Another great aspect of the film, is the return of the creepy coroner, played by Tony Todd. The 3D was incredible, even my dad who was reluctant in going the see the film, enjoyed it. Which was a shock to me, he isn't a horror fan and he hated Scream 4, which i loved. The death scenes were unique and inventive, and unlike the fourth film, the 3D was used to great effect in them. And the ending was the best part of the film, which was another thing i wasn't expecting. I thought i had seen it all in this franchise, but the director did a brilliant job of keeping the film fresh and unpredictable. I am trying not to give too much away, but to put it in perspective for the franchise it is the second best film, with the first obviously being The Final Destination (2000). The high rating this film has received, it deserves. It is probably the best 3D horror experience i have had, i have seen Resident Evil Afterlife, Piranha 3D, Priest, SAW 3D and My Bloody Valentine, but none of those films were as good as this film. I really did enjoy this film and i was highly entertained. Highly recommended if you are fan of the franchise. The Final Destination Franchise Rating: Final Destination (2000) - 10/10 Final Destination 2 (2003) - 8/10 Final Destination 3 (2006) - 6/10 The Final Destination (2009) - 1/10 Final Destination 5 (2011) - 8/10",Final Destination 5
176,cgsoldier22,Best Final Destination in series!,10,16 January 2012,"I will admit, I came into FD5 and expected another disappointment like TFD and an attempt to make a quick buck on a franchise that makes a lot of money. That was not the case with this one. FD5 showed there is still hope in the franchise. They didn't try and make us laugh the whole time like in the 4th one. They made this one very dark, but of course with some black humor that only fans of the series will laugh at. And when I watch a final destination movie, I go in expecting the same plot, but over the top gore and clever kills. And this one fulfilled my expectations.The kills are very clever and timed greatly. You keep thinking that a person will die a certain way, and then you are wrong because something completely different will happen. They do that in the first death, which was clever and unexpected, you'll know when you see it. The effects are perfect and opening disaster is visually stunning. Gruesome! But awesome! And I did like how we actually cared about the characters and they gave us a good story and twist to the plot, where they can kill someone else to take their place, that put more room for a better story.And of course the best part of this movie was the crazy shocking ending! I won't spoil it for you but you are going to sit there and be like WOW! The ending is hinted several times throughout, but not to a point where you will be like Oh yeah that is probably what will happen. Its a very shocking ending and not a retarded one like the last one. You have to watch it to see what I am talking about.Overall, great sequel. You have to go in expecting to watch a Final Destination movie, but you will be very pleased and not disappointed. Best one of the series.",Final Destination 5

But that didn't take much.",3,31 August 2011,"Eleven years ago Final Destination took horror fans in a fresh new direction. The film had gruesome death scenes (not nearly as bad as the later installments.) But fate -and whether one could escape its plan- was where the real intrigue lied. Final Destination 2 traded character development for sillier death scenes, but at least some were mildly possible and interesting. I had the foresight to avoid what i felt would be ridiculously bad films in the third and fourth installments of the franchise. Something told me this one would be different. The film is directed by James Cameron's understudy, David Quale; who admitted the last films didn't live up to the first two. Quale claims to have attempted to use what worked in the first films to construct his fifth installment. One would think at the very least this film would have made brilliant use of the 3D technology that was, of course, extraordinary in Avatar. Horror movies are possibly the best genre for 3D -because you're meant to be jumpy- but this film attempts to ease us in through credits that slowly come closer and closer to the audience, but it becomes rather boring. Moving forward, Quale decides to splatter our cool 3D shades with blood and guts rather than use the technology to scare us. Sure... the bridge scene was nice, but after that the film stumbles from poor dialogue to atrocious acting to fantastically unbelievable death scenes. I know there are those who will say I should have seen that coming. Maybe they're right, but the first film wasn't nearly as grotesque and was written much better. Even the second installment looks very believable in comparison. The deaths are way too much, I wanted to scream at the screen in my best Mortal Kombat voice ""finish him"" (already). We always get plenty of plausible ways for characters to meet their demise, but instead we see something like a character getting their head knocked off by the torso of a deer being propelled by a tornado. Who am I kidding? That would be much too interesting for this film. One or two scenes should have surprised us by taking one of the more obvious deaths. Sam and his friends are mostly played by relative newcomers, but along the way, we meet some nice characters. Tony Todd (Candyman) is back as the coroner. He actually has a few terrifically ominous lines. And David Koechner (The Office) plays his usual oblivious character well. As a fan of the original I did enjoy the plot twist, which does something that I can't remember ever being done before. In the end, this installment may have done what it set out to do; make a better movie than Final Destination 3 or The Final Destination (the fourth film which claimed to be the last.) If the filmmakers wished for anything more however, they should have spent as much time crafting dialogue and story as they did dreaming up 1,000 ways to die.",Final Destination 5

The storyline also amazing, especially the ways the characters dead are so creative and unpredictable. the comedy scenes come in a very right time without ruined the horror scenes.

Forget the other four if you have to, but don't miss this one. (well, OK , the first one was very good also, but this movie beats them all in the visual effects.) The cast did a fine job and the director knew exactly what to do to keep you in suspense. Yes, the outcome was predictable, but the ending had a special little twist to it that was not in the other sequels. One character in the movie whom I won't mention starred in another horror movie that had sequels and his presence in this movie gives us an idea that not so nice things are going to happen. The very ending of the movie was not what I expected, and let me tell you that seeing the ending will stay in your mind long after seeing this well done 'Final Destination.'

With the cast,  director, writer, and budget on board I felt it could be good but I had  a lot more fun than anticipated. Opening scene was one of the more  intense and crazy. (I'm a fan of the 2nd). Very much improved visual  effects here. The 3D was executed better than the 4th as well.  Character wise it was obvious they did better casting (Nicholas, Tony,  Emma). I truly wanted some of these randoms to live. Deaths here are  top notch, very blunt and very cringe worthy. This movie truly did  improve on all aspects that the 3rd and 4th lacked...a creepy realistic  feel. A few new aspects are thrown in as well which help keep the story  fresh and not feel repetitive. If you are ready for this 3D  roller-coaster then go see this well made guilty pleasure.",Final Destination 5
183,Jpeffer,Has it's moments but feels just like the others,6,14 August 2011,"For the last 11 years we've watched people get sliced, decapitated, hung, stabbed, impaled, and blown up, among other things, in the Final Destination series. What else could they possibly do in a 5th movie? Like the first four movies we get someone who has a vision of a horrible accident about to happen and then rescues his friends, and possibly other, from the situation only to have death hunt them down and try to finish what he started. This time around we have Sam played by Fired Up's Nicholas D'Agosto. He sees that him and his friends are supposed to die in a horrific bridge collapse, but safely gets a handful of his friends off their bus before it happens. Along for the ride are The Walking Dead's Emma Bell, Tom Cruise look-a-like Miles Fisher, the Friday the 13th remake's Arlen Escarpeta, Anchorman's David Koechner, and a slew of people you've probably never seen before. As the movie progresses one by one they start to die in the order they would have in the accident they all avoided. Once they learn that death is out to get them they try to do whatever they can to avoid death once more.In more ways than not this is exactly like the first four movie. Same set-up, characters you don't care about, bad acting, death's pattern is the same, etc. They do try and bring back what made the first two movies in the franchise entertaining and fun but they don't end up executing it well enough. A lot of the deaths still feel very cartoonish because of the heavy CGI on most of them and the 3D adds nothing to any of the deaths.They do try to add some small things that differ from the previous movies. For instance, if you kill someone who wasn't already supposed to die then that would cancel out your death and you'd be off the hook. Also what they do with the ending I thought was very creative. I won't spoil anything but they do find a nice way to tie in this movie with the first movie. While I did like the ending I did not like the, literally, last two minutes of the movie because they go out of their way to do something that is just even more ridiculous than most of the deaths in the movie.As far as the acting goes your not going to find anyone here who is giving a good performance. All of the kids are mostly hamming it up every second their on camera and David Koechner is clearly there just for the comic relief. We get a pointless character in an agent, played by Courtney B. Vance, who is interested in finding out what is happening to these people that survived the bridge accident. Tony Todd makes a cameo appearance that isn't much but he at least tries in his very short amount of screen time.The deaths I found to be pretty weak. They actually started off great with the first death but then turned into great build-ups and then blowing it on the actual death. Most of the deaths don't look too good either because they are all CG and it just makes them look too unreal. Had they at least maybe tried to use some practical effects I think the deaths would have had more impact that just looking like a cartoon.All in all this movie does have some entertaining moments and the ending, except for the final two minutes, is done really well. It's not as good as the first two movies in the franchise but it definitely beats part three, and is leagues better than part four.Rating: 5.5/10",Final Destination 5
184,ajharper18,"Better than the last two, but not the best in the series",5,12 August 2011,"I thought for sure this was going to be just as bad as the 4th when I saw heard about it and saw the trailer. I mean a bridge collapse? Sounds kind of dumb. And I do believe the collapse in the film was really kind of dumb. I didn't believe the character felt like he really wanted to save his friends from death. All of the other films, except 4, the characters were somewhat believable after they witnessed the incident.I did however enjoyed the rest of the film after the bridge collapse. The individual deaths were pretty entertaining and suspenseful, which I was surprised because I'm not really on the edge of my seat during these kind of films. However, others were very predicable.One other thing about this film that I disliked the most was the acting. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE. The actors/actresses were horrible. The only actor that I can give credit to for being good is Tony Todd who played William Bludworth. He was the best actor and character in this whole film. The others were just too unexperienced to believe.So to sum this film up, it's not a good film. Honestly, it wasn't good as a film. However, it was good for a Final Destination Film. Just not a film in general. It was better than the last 2 (3 & 4) which I thought were weak. Even though 3 was one of my favorite, it just wasn't as good as 1 & 2. But 4 was just plain dumb. So it's entertaining, if you like those kinds of films (bloody, gory, with cheap acting). If you do, I say go see it, and have a good time. But if you're not into the Final Destination films, or any kind of bloody and gory films, most likely you're not gonna like it. So it's your decision.Not gonna spoil it, but if you are familiar with the other films or are fans, which I am. You are definitely gonna wanna watch this film for sure. Has the BEST ending of the entire franchise.Well that's all I have to say. Like blood and gore, see it. Don't like those kinds of films, don't see it.

OK, now the my opinion. The film starts of with a spectacular bridge disaster (great effects) and an awesome build up. The acting is much better than The Final Destination. Though not fantastic. Now for the deaths after the bridge collapse, they are inventive, brutal and stuff that you could do. The final twist is fantastic but with a major goof (you should notice when you watch it).Many people will say that this is just a typical sequel, but it is not.

They give you a sense of suspense and thrill without being super scary and give nightmares. I've only seen Final Destination 4 of this franchise, but I can definitely say that this one is a bit better. 8 is the highest I've ever rated a movie on here (because I only wrote two reviews before this one), so I definitely love it. I can't wait for the new ones to come out! The scenes could get a bit gory at times and there could be less gore. The surprise at the and caught me off guard and it leaves a good opening for Final Destination 6. I noticed that in Final Destination 4 that they had a different strategy, if you save someone you get to live. In this one they have a different strategy that if you kill someone you get their life and you get to live. Death lets them play their silly games and two weeks later, splat their dead in both.Overall it was a good movie to watch on a boring day, and I'm afraid to go on the flight I'm planned to go on in two days!

The problem with this film and the whole genre of post screamesque horror films is that although they may be good to watch with a fair few thrills and chills, it's an ever so worn out genre. Hollywood will still churn this sort of film out year upon year because it sells. Try imagine this film and the entire genre to be a mediocre roller-coaster, it's fun when your on it but afterwards your left with a feeling that it just wasn't what it could of been. To sum it up, it's not a bad film - just predictable. I recommend giving it a watch for the elaborate (as always in the final destination films) death scenes, sexy cast and the fairly good link up to the first film. Afterwards you'll forget about it within minutes.",Final Destination 5
194,lmallon777,Brilliant! A must see!,8,26 August 2011,"Absolutely loved every single minute of it. So many unexpected and gory moments involved, like the boat impalement and Peter and Sam's death in the premonition was pretty gory too. The acupuncture death scene was really gory too, and the gym scene was pretty squeamish. The best was the laser eye surgery death! Well, kinda because it was realistic in the fact that could actually happen but the fact that she moved towards the window rather than towards the door for safety annoyed me a bit. The two twists were really good and I loved how dark the movie got when Peter snapped and tried to kill Molly, thinking she wasn't worthy enough of her life. I was shocked when Peter shot the inspector dude, having his life and still trying to kill Molly, added a darker tone to it. Fantastic character development! Amazing ending! The fact that it was a prequel and happened before FD1 really blew my mind! It was the best in the series in my opinion. This is what 3D was made for! Just a tiny heads up, (not really a spoiler but;) make sure you remember the first film. All I'm saying. Great movie, 5 stars :)",Final Destination 5
195,jackie-135-447584,Its not what it seems,8,16 August 2011,"If you're going in to see FD5, it's because you know what you're expecting. Although I'm a fan of the series, I'll admit it did show its staleness after FD2, which is arguably the series' high point. As expected, the formula hasn't changed, although there are a few new tweaks here, the main one including the addition that the survivors can now kill someone to take their life and maybe, just maybe, escape Death's clutches. It's interesting to note that this new twist is the opposite of what was offered in FD2, in which new life can defeat Death, but taking life is much more readily apparent and dramatic than creating new life. Not only do they have to worry about Death, but they also have to worry about what they are willing to do to survive, which provides some very tense external conflict between the characters. As you guys might have figured out from the above, yes, FD5 has a plot this time around. There's also an unexpected ending that you will make you go OMG or WTF, if it isn't already spoiled to you, of course. It's also good to know that Eric Heisserer's tight script devotes some time to the survivors that are getting picked off. You start to feel for them as they are about to die. As much as I'm thankful for this, it's obvious that people still see these films for the opening disaster and death sequences, and they do not disappoint. Without spoiling anything, the opening bridge disaster is a nasty piece of work, utilizing the 3D to the fullest extent. I'm a huge horror fan, but even I found it very hard to watch, jerking my hands back as each character is killed off in grisly ways. Without a doubt, it's the best opening disaster since FD2. And the death scenes. Wow. They are disturbing, funny, and shocking and sometimes all at the same time. This is because newcomer director Steven Quale plays with the audience's expectations. He lays out so many things that can kill off a character in a certain scene and when you think this sharp object will impale them, they die in a completely different way. The build up is what makes these films fun to watch (apart from the last one). I also liked the fact that this film returned to the original film's serious roots, which isn't to say that it takes itself too seriously because there's an underlying sense of dark humor that's strangely entertaining and self-aware of itself. The ensemble cast is a mixed bag for sure. Our protagonist, Nicholas D'Agosto, doesn't really live up to his character's dramatic arc. He seems to overact his lines although he was much better in the second half. Emma Bell is a bit better although she wasn't as good as she was in FROZEN. Miles Fisher also doesn't live up to his character's internal struggle when giving off a whiny performance. However, the other supporting castmembers are quite good, including Ellen Wroe, Jacqueline MacInnes Wood, and Arlen Escarpeta. P.J. Byrne, in particular, is someone you should look out for, providing some of the film's biggest laughs, playing a character you just love to hate. David Koechner also provides some great laughs. I was disappointed with Courtney B. Vance though because he had little to do. Tony Todd is back since he was last seen in FD2 and he's like the American version of Snape (from Harry Potter). I love the way he delivers his lines with one...word...at...a...time.",Final Destination 5
196,winningsteven,Nice Movie but not the best Final Destination,7,13 March 2012,"First of all, I'm a fan of final destination and i love it when it shows how several small things can cost somebody's life .It started just like other final destination, when the main character Sam (Nicholas D'Agosto) got the vision that led to the survival of him and several of his friends from fatal accident in the bridge. The plot of the movie is good as you expect from the final destination sequels. However, it lacks of ""something"" that usually makes you to stay on your seat. The movie didn't give me enough curiosity to see what happen next in the movie as the Final Destination I, II, and III did.The best part is the ending. Despite the ending is similar with the rest of the final destination , it give us the twist that connect us to the ""previous"" final destination. One thing I'm not so sure is the death of Molly (Emma Bell). She is the only one who survived from the bridge in Sam's vision. Which means, she ought to have a longer life. But, what did you expect from the final destination other than the death of all characters, right? Anyway, this movie is worth to see especially if you are the fans of final destination :)",Final Destination 5

That's what I like about these films, it's very creative how they think of all the ways that they could possibly die. They all have interesting story lines, I would recommend anyone to watch it, if you're not afraid of blood of course, some people are squeamish, but I'm not I love slasher films.",Final Destination 5
199,sugarnitekawaii,A wonderful conclusion,8,25 August 2019,"While I had found myself unsatisfied with the conclusion to the series being ""The Final Destination"", this movie is the perfect high note to end a marathon screening of the series. In contrast to the other movies, we find ourselves with an cast of adults; which I found to be a breathe of fresh air from the other teen focused settings. Along with that, the pacing in this movie is phenomenal. I would only call 2 or 3 scenes slow, besides that the rest of the film had me invested. The biggest downside to this movie is the character building, which has never been the highlight of these movies. Most of our main cast get no real development before they die, however our main 3 characters are interesting enough to carry the film. While the characters may not be great, the kills make up for it. Wonderful suspense, as you sit on the edge of your seat trying to guess how they'll die. Overall, a thrilling and suspenseful movie, held back by some minor pacing problems and characters. Improved by it's own horror and effects.",Final Destination 5
200,mrsedwards-66110,Awesome movie,10,8 July 2020,"Final destination back on form after the final destination (FD4) which I found disappointing.

201,rjamesnj,This is one very fun ride,9,12 August 2011,This will make you love all the FD films all over again. I saw this movie opening night and I am so very glad I did. They have stepped up the quality of the film and the creativity of the deaths. Not since FD2 have I enjoyed one of these films. If you read bad reviews do not trust them go see it for yourself and you will believe. The acting was much better then number 4 not as good as number 2. Just when you thought you knew what was going to happen you are hit with a surprise and I was left saying wow. I saw the 2D version of the movie not really of big fan of 3D. The movie to me had good balance did not move to slow and the deaths were extremely creative and at times shocking.,Final Destination 5
202,kozaktor,"It's Final Destination, what can I say?",6,14 August 2011,"Quite a bit actually. Rumor has it that the producers wanted to make sure this installment would be darker, similar to the first Final Destination, in contrast to the ***t-fest that was The Final Destination (4). And... that's exactly what we got. That's not to say I wasn't laughing at a lot of things during this movie (not bothering the 2 other people in the theater). So let's dive into the fourth sequel.First of all, the credits are just a 3-D gimmick, with things that have previously killed (or will end up killing) victims of the movies breaking through glass as they fly at us. They are far too long and I was only getting through it by naming what movie it killed someone in.If the story is a surprise to you, go get your IQ checked.The acting in this is much better than 3 and 4. I was actually surprised at the emotional turmoil some characters had coping with the deaths of their co-workers and loved ones. Yet for most of the characters it doesn't seem to last long. Only Peter seems to care the whole time, but that seems to be to the point of insanity. I'm going to guess that was part of the writing, so acting gets a 5/10.There's a stupid sub-plot of what happens with the relationship between our protagonist Sam and his girlfriend Molly. In the opening scene, they break up. We later find out it's because Sam is a chef and wants to take an apprenticeship in Paris. Why is this important to the plot? You'll see. But that sub-plot shouldn't exist, its importance could have been set up in just a bit of dialogue. But then our movie would be too short.Earlier I said I was laughing at many things in this movie. It wasn't bad dialogue... okay yes it was. Well it wasn't the deaths... that's a lie too. Everything was just dumb. A character named Isaac is this fast talking insensitive selfish nerd who has an awkward scene at a massage therapy parlor that seems more out of a comedy than Final Destination. The boss, Dennis, isn't a character. He just says stuff and people are scared of him. Peter is an emo dude, Candice is his gymnast girlfriend, and they also have their Token Black Guy, Nathan. To top it all off, the groupie slut, Olivia. She only takes her shirt off once though. I feel like I've digressed a bit too much, so I'll just move on.The deaths are boring. And that's good. The most graphic we get is in the premonition, when Candice is impaled on a (get this) sailboat mast. We see intestines and... that's really the best we get. She later dies of... lots of broken bones. She falls off a gymnastic bar thing and somehow manages to break every bone in her body, most likely including her neck. This death is ridiculous and impossible for many reasons I will not get in to. Isaac gets his head crushed by a Buddha statue, Olivia falls out a window, Dennis gets a wrench to the face, Peter gets stabbed. Boring. But now let us move on to the script, which I must give the movie credit for.The script consists of the regular Final Destination formula: Character Exposition; Premonotion; Deaths. But this time, there's a twist. The creepy morgue guy, Bludworth, tells four of the remaining survivors (Molly never died in the premonition) that if they killed somebody who had nothing to do with the bridge, they would regain their life. Neat, huh? Except for one thing... IT NEVER WORKS!! Nathan kills this guy named Roy he doesn't like, but gets killed anyway because that guy was already going to die a different way according to Death's plan. This means that Nathan should have died before Dennis, because in the order of the premonition, he was next. But nope, he dies last. Can you say Plot-hole? Also, Peter kills a federal agent, and is then killed by Sam. OOPS! Now here's the real kicker that is both good and bad: This movie is not in the present time. In fact, it's a prequel. This takes place... BEFORE THE FIRST MOVIE! Surprised the hell out of me. Yet this is simply a case of making ***t up as they go along, because if that's the case, why was the ""kill or be killed"" rule never re-introduced? Anyway, we know this is a prequel because Sam and Molly get on the plane to Paris, the same plane Alex from the original was on. You know what that means, Sam and Molly die in that plane crash. OOPS! I guess Death just felt like breaking the rules himself. Then the worst part of the movie comes... the plane lands on Nathan. Yep, it lands on him while he's at a memorial service for the guy he killed. Nobody lives. So, writers? You listening? If you're going to add that little twist... HAVE IT AMOUNT TO SOMETHING!!! In spite of the small praise I've given it, this movie has its issues. I'd just like to stress that I did not hate this like I did 3 and 4. 5/10.",Final Destination 5

When I heard about there being a fifth film I knew I would go and see it but I had my doubts whether they have gone too far making a fifth film especially as the previous film had been title THE Final Destination. To be honest I think my doubts were right I feel that have took the franchies too far and it may have just been continued for financial gain, unlike the original which brought something new to horror films. Yes they do come up with different story lines but it all seems too familiar and boring. When watching this film teamed with a sense of deja vu was a feeling of what could have been. I believe when they chose to make a fifth film they could have created something so much better than what I saw. To me they have joined other franchises which I believe have gone too far and I wouldn't be surprised if they continue to make at least yet another film.

205,metin_buddhabar,Fresh movie after the Final Destination 4 catastrophe,9,21 September 2011,"There is no need to say any word,but it's almost the same with the old series.They tried to break the records with this one at the box office,and I think so,they pulled themselves together by returning to the old series after the FD4 catastrophe.Especially opening scene was perfect ,ıt was very realistic.But they should make FD6 on the cruise ship including the old survivors of FD2 and (If they are alive) FD3.And the opening scene should be like this(Our protagonist he/she starts to see the cruise ship disaster in his/her mind(when the ship 200-300 meters away from the harbor something cause gas leak in the kitchen of the ship and that cause a big explosion or the malfunction of the engines in the engine room may cause explosion etc... thus many people start to die in terrific way,so our protagonist should behave quickly and can save at least 15-20 out of 100-150 people by warning them disembark from the ship,or not to get on the ship(while at the harbor)but the beginning of FD6 should pass on the ship and later they should attach the beginning to land and in the middle of the film(old survivors bump into each other in an interesting way and try to save the victims of cruise ship)I believe this will be amazing and perfect thus fd6 will be attached and (maybe) pre-quelled to both (FD2 and FD3).As for death scenes of FD6, they should find logical deaths not illogical death scenes as it was in the fourth movie.And FD7 should be pass on the mountain close to the ski resort hotels or FD7 should pass in the huge twin towers or a big hotel etc...I hope they will release fd6 till the end of 2012 or the beginning of 2013(first 3 months) and FD7(end of 2013 or beginning of2014) thats all for now.NOTE: (Can someone forward my message to Bloodworth ?)

206,zebrassave,Interesting up to a certain point.....,6,2 March 2012,"Interesting movie, great premise with a perfect cast, however the deaths were much too unrealistic and unfortunately dull after an hour or so of the movie. I knew this movie was bad when the mass amounts of blood weren't even enough to keep me awake/ focusing on the film. A combination of bad humor and pathetic acting were most definitely a downfall. However, I am much a fan of the series and believe this was another great addition. The deaths are certainly predictable, but that's what the younger audience is asking for and they did deliver. ""Cheesy"" is a strong word, however it is the best one to describe some scenes of this so called ""horror flick"".",Final Destination 5
207,martinemcmahon,"I'm a fan of Final Destination, but it needs to retire.",4,2 January 2012,"I'm a certified EMT-B and trained as a Medic with the United States Army. I don't say that to try and ""impress"" some anonymous face on the internet, I say that because I think my training may have ruined this movie for me.*SPOILER* The first death (after the initial catastrophe) is a girl, about 100-120 lbs, falling no more than 6-7 feet onto a padded floor, and ending up with a compound fracture of her everything. Seriously? Even being generous, the most she'd get is a c-spine injury resulting in a less-than spectacular death caused by her spinal cord being severed. I get that's not a very glamorous death scene, and that the audience needs a lot of gore to be ""impressed"", but the way her body was contorted and pulverized left me sitting in my seat resisting the urge to shout ""THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN!"" and pissing off the other movie goers. */SPOILER*I'll spare everyone any further spoilers since, well, there's just too much to count. I can still say, though, that the rest of the death's, including the original catastrophe, were mostly just like the one I described in respect to unrealistic body mechanics. It's as if everyone in the universe of Final Destination is naturally born more fragile than those from our own Universe, and to be honest that ruined the sense of immersion I got from earlier movies.It's still a very intriguing concept, and the ending really threw me off and made an impression that I liked. However, the previous movie, named ""The Final Destination"", I thought named that way to indicate that it's the final movie in the franchise, completely prepared me for the end of that franchise. The fact that they're still making movies, and hinting that there will be more, mixed with the poor body mechanics, saddens me. They might as well be milking it for all it's worth when it should have, and, in my mind, as an initial fan, WAS ended.",Final Destination 5
208,DeathsDesign,A Love Letter to Fans.,10,19 August 2011,"Final Destination 5 is not the best instalment of the franchise. And if your looking to me to say that is is, then I'm afraid I won't. Because it wasn't. It is however a solid entry into the franchise, and ideally what I see as a love letter to the most hardcore of fans we've all come to know over the last 10 years. Steve Quale has done a wonderful job injecting a fresh and detailed in look into the FD universe, which of late has become lazily assembled and uninspired (don't have to tell you what I'm talking about there). Weirdly, it didn't feel like an FD movie. Interestingly I thought FD5 ventured towards a far broader mix of genres, that being the likes of thrillers and action movies-though explored in the past FD's, but this was much more present here this time. And it needed it. Eric Heissier did an overall nice job of crafting charismatic and unique characters, on-par with the trilogy. There were some fantastic moments of wittiness and comedy-nonetheless due to the likes of P.J Bryne and David Koechner who brought a long a more improvised approach to the performances-something not seen in such a light in any of the past FD's. Performances range from good, to acceptable, to bad. I was mildly disappointed with Nicholas and Emma, mostly because I've just seen so much better from them. They are not bad actors, but their roles in FD5 just didn't bring out the best of them. I have to hand it Miles-Peter without doubt has to be the most erratic, challenging and dramatic character the series has ever seen. He presents this well, though several moments falls weak. Despite this, Miles ranks amongst the best, aligning with Jacqueline, P.J, Koachner and Tony-without a doubt the real stand outs. What I really strangely liken is the risk they took casting a set of performers no stranger to the comedy genre. I'd even say this helped create even more depth to the protagonists, assembling a true human nature to them. (The funeral scene is a perfect example of this. Arlen, Jackie and P.J's banter struck me as oddly touching-a fine example of how comedy and discretion can be mastered appropriately when set against the backdrop of darker themes; something TFD failed to master.) And that brings me to Tony. It was a real treat to see him back to his old self yet again, and back on the screen which Bludworth has been missing from for so long. He seemed to have a ball playing his character-though I couldn't help thinking he was sadly underused throughout. I think this itself is one of the primary mistakes the producers have made consistently for the last ten years. That being that answers, mythology and subplots are handled with little confidence and attention, due to their mortal fear of straying too far from the all important ""formula"" the franchise possesses. Ironically, the development of the films in all were so in tune with the audience perception that they became reluctant to introduce truly new and refreshing contexts, at the risk of alienating the pivotal target audience. Though I would say that Bludworth's return brought back that darkened ambiance so prevalent in the trilogy-again, a pleasure to see. Brian Tyler delivers an epic, dark, beautiful score both innovative and nostalgic-respecting the masterful tension Shirley brought to the trilogy whilst going full steam ahead with a new found sense of direction. From the chillingly grand opening titles (which were ingenious; fantastic throw back to old school 80's slashers and the FD series overall) to the subtle rise of tension seen in the good majority of death scenes. I would go without saying Tylers work here is on par with Walkers FD1 score.In all, deaths were fantastically orchestrated bringing back the creativity and surprise from the past with a punch. They were a pleasure to watch with the audience; endless WOOO's and AHHH's returning. Something I haven't witnessed in such a scale since FD3. Candice's death scene was by far the best, and in my eyes now stands in line with some of the most disturbing deaths the franchise has spawned over the last ten years. Masterful tension, red herrings and cringing galore. The premonition scene was immensely thrilling, introducing a scale never seen before. It did what it needed to do, and is a wonder to behold on the big screen. The 3D is some of the best I've seen so far, adding a layer of depth to certain scenes and conducted with experience, expertise and intensity. But did FD5 need it? No. Which is unfortunate due to some deaths spewing out patronising comin-atcha! gore and a comical layer akin to a certain movie. But unlike TFD, FD5 didn't need 3D. I'm relived to say it has re-play value and stands alone as a solid, normal film, and not a novelty made bearable only by cardboard specs. The ending twist makes FD5 stand rightly side by side with FD1, FD2 and FD3, and was executed in a way which made me both shocked and moved. It's the perfect ending we could ever wish for, put together in the most respectful and solid way possible. And that is why I do not want a Final Destination 6. FD5 has brought full circle both the best and worst attributes of the franchise, similarly to FD3, but with a far wide and personal scope. Most franchises would never dream of seeing such a perfect conclusion-but FD5 defies that-and brings us fans the film we have always wanted. The FD team have apologised, and I accept it with open arms. Which is why I want this to be the end. Final Destination has defined a new generation of horror fans and made its well earned mark upon the horror genre. Everything has been brought full circle, and I believe it time to bid farewell to the franchise which re-invented death, and the slasher genre overall.",Final Destination 5

This time though the death scenes were kind of funny so it reminded me of Wes Craven's ""Scream"" series. The big picture was the same so no shocking new ideas and the boy who sees it all, did not have visions about the later deaths. Taking a life and gaining a life concept was the worst part of the movie. There were problems about it. I don't seek character depth in these kind of movies so although the characters were so unrealistic, it did not bother me.

I admit the fourth one was a complete joke but this one had me sold since the trailer. I sensed the darkness of it that the first installment brought to us back in 2000. Eric Heisserer brought a new twist to this used plot. Sure yes the plot has been used over and over again but yet it brings us back into the theater. The kills are very creative and the suspense leading up to it nearly sends you out of your chair. It is indeed the most brutal and goriest of them all. Steven Quale didn't used the 3D as a gimmick but to add depth to this awesome feature. The ending was amazing making your jaw drop in such awe that you didn't think it was possible. 10/10 I rate this movie and if there is a 6th Final Destination in our future I'll be one of the first few in line to watch it!

Now that the movie has started most of us watching are already expecting a failure guess what we were pleased to know it did fail beyond expectations. There is a scene in the movie involving a Plane crash which is the same crash from the earlier Final Destination movie. So how is Final Destination 5 set at a later time when there is a Plane Crash from one of the earlier movies? Same kids fighting on the plane to get off of it is on the plane in Final Destination 5 how is this possible? Did they add time travel in Final Destination 5 that i some how missed ? 3D does not make a horrible movie better lets get that out there for all of the fake reviews we see saying ""OMG MUST SEE IN 3D IT'S AMAZING"" wrong If you polish a turd it's still a turd. my advice to anyone planning to watch this if you have a friend that has it or a local redbox borrow it or rent it. NOT worth a purchase it's barely worth viewing.",Final Destination 5
215,Nrgravois,What's wrong with the REST of Hollywood these days?,9,20 August 2011,"A scantily clad college coed walks into a dark room, nervously looking around. Suddenly a shadowy figure appears and murders her...but hey, who saw that coming? I'll tell you who saw that coming, everyone who has ever seen anything labeled ""horror""...ever, which I would assume would also be anyone who has ever been involved in the making of one, who then turned around and DID THE EXACT SAME THING. The people involved in the production of Final Destination 5, however, decided to throw up the middle finger to the genre by taking every horror movie cliché ever and murder it by having it get acupuncture therapy, lighting the room that it's in on fire and proceeding to crush it with a freaking Budha statue (seriously, that happened). You see, most horror movies begin with a simple fear, such as the fear of nightmares (Nightmare on Elm Street), the woods (Friday the 13th), or dolls (Child's Play); however, from the days of the first Final Destination, the writers took a different approach, namely: ""what if we get a bunch of people to get killed to death in ridiculous by everyday things? And what if we don't kill the black guy first? In fact, let's just kill everyone!"" To which the production company was probably too busy laughing to actually say no, and thus, a franchise was born. Now, as with every horror franchise, after the first, the follow-ups began to start falling short. Final Destination 5 not only managed to barely hang on to the collapsing bridge, but rebuild it and dance around as the broken remains of terrible reboots, belated sequels and prequels splattered around them. Hats off to Eric Heisserer for writing such a fantastic and devilishly hilarious script, as well as the entire production team for creating this rare gem in a genre full of dirt. The acting, while not spectacular, was Oscar winning compared to other horror movies. As I mentioned earlier, this film flips quite a large bird towards others in it's genre, deciding to almost spoof it. There are no naked women being stupid and getting killed, in fact, aside from one brief scene with a woman in a bra, there's nothing even close to nudity, which I must say is surprisingly refreshing. The stereotypical black guy dying first also fails to show up, with the movie deciding to kill him last, because screw you stereotypes. The level of fun that is to be had with this movie is also incredible. In fact, afterwards, you will likely feel a little twisted for laughing at some of the indescribably creative deaths. Also bringing the franchise around full circle was a cool little twist. So in closing, this is the best horror movie, if you could call it that, to hit the screen in a long long time. No, it's not perfect, but you'll be too busy trying to think of how the next victim is going to meet their fate to notice.",Final Destination 5

217,yoli_1011,The Best Final Destination Movie Yet!,7,5 May 2013,"(Spoiler Alert ! ) I saw this movie yesterday on movie2k(excellent website with the movies for free!)I have seen all of the Final Destination movies from the 3rd and beyond even though I have not seen the first two I know all the deaths and all of the things that happen. I believe this is one of the most underrated modern horror movies of this generation even though I believe 5 final destination movies is enough after watching this it left me wanting more! I hope they make an 6th Final Destination movie and they make it good. The death scenes here are strong and gory as they all should be! the characters are okay I guess but the way the protagonist's best friend dies didn't satisfy me enough it left me a little disappointed the ''kill or be killed'' rule was an strange addition to the saga, even though the protagonist kills his best friend I knew he would die anyways(with his girlfriend of course) the ending makes it an conclusion that there is NEVER a way to cheat death no matter what you do. The ending made me wanna watch the first movie it may just leave you that way too if you want to keep up with the storyline either watch the 1st final destination or the newest addition first. Overall grading the movie in F- To A+ I give it an B even though it is not much of an horror movie at all :/ the gore and suspense steals the show! So that's all for my review people hope you have read and found it helpful! (:",Final Destination 5
218,Batman5273,A Fun Roller Coaster Gore-fest! Must see in 3D!,8,12 August 2011,"""No matter where you run, no matter where you hide you can't cheat  death. Or can you?"" Final Destination 5 brings the franchise to an end  with an over the top, roller coaster ride of an experience. Did they  save the best for last or should the franchise have died a long time  ago?  STORY  On a clear sunny morning, Sam and a group of his co-workers from a  paper plant assemble to attend a corporate retreat. They jump on a  chartered bus and head off for the weekend. While stopped in traffic on  a bridge, something goes horribly wrong. The suspension bridge that is  under construction starts to crumble and collapse. What comes next are  some of the most violent death sequences imaginable.  But wait was it a dream? Sam wakes up on the bus and notices that  things he just imagined are starting to really happen. He yells at  everyone to get off the bus and run like hell. Just then the bridge  cables snap and the concrete shatters. Sam's vision is coming true.  Thankfully he was able to save the majority of his friends or the  ""Lucky 8″ as the local news calls them.  But the peril is not over for Sam and his friends. One by one the  ""Lucky 8″ start dying in horrific accidents. At every incident, a dark  ominous figure lurks in the shadows. When questioned, the man tells the  survivors that they were suppose to die on the bridge and that Death is  coming for them to balance the equation. However if they can be  replaced by the death of another, then Death will spare them and they  will take on the that person's lifespan. A few of the survivors heed  the words of the stranger and decide that in order to live they have to  kill someone to take their place.  OVERVIEW  Let's face it if you have seen any of the Final Destination movies, you  already know what this movie is about and what happens. Lets face it,  the plot is pretty thin. The movie really is just a series of  grotesque, bloody, crazy, far fetched death scenes. The acting is  pretty shallow and the dialog is corny. With that being said, it is a  fun ass movie! I never went Oh and Ah so many times in a theater.  Imagine watching a train hit a semi truck full of cows. That is what  Final Destination 5 is all about. Every one in the audience roared,  cheered, and even laughed at how fantastical people were killed. When  you see this movie your jaw will drop and you will squirm in your seat.  The cast is headed by Nicholas D'Agosto as Sam the guy who sees the  vision. Emma Bell plays Sam's girlfriend, Molly. And Miles Fisher as  Peter, Sam's friend and boss. The rest of the ensemble cast plays the  stereotypical horror film roles: The cute athletic girl, the goth  slutty chick, the horny Jewish guy, the token black guy, and the  asshole corporate boss. The biggest star of the show was a cameo by  ""Candyman"" himself, Tony Todd. Todd plays the bearer of bad news to the  survivors.  The film was directed by Steven Quale which marks his feature film  debut. He has worked visual effects with James Cameron on Terminator 2,  The Abyss, Titanic and Avatar. His expertise with those movies is what  make Final Destination 5 so insanely crazy to watch. What I really  liked was the magic trick he played with the audience. He would  distract you with what you thought was going to kill the characters and  before you knew it, something else jumps in and throws off your  instincts. He kept the audience guessing.  I am not a big proponent of 3D. Most audiences today hate the higher  ticket prices just to watch a darker, less colorful version. Very few  movies does the technology work. Final Destination 5 is one of those  movies you absolutely, positively have to see in 3D to truly appreciate  the full effect. The movie starts off with 5 minutes of in your face  visuals during the opening credits. Objects involved in the deaths of  previous characters is thrown at you in slow motion while they shatter  glass. The opening credits set the pace for the film with the over the  top visuals that you can only appreciate in 3D.  Final Destination 5 is not going to win an Oscar, maybe an MTV Movie  Award though. It is filled with so much carnage that the weak of heart  better stay home. But that's what we want in a horror/thriller flick.  We want to jump in our seats and cringe at the gore. We want to hold  onto our significant other's arm and look away at the scary parts. We  want to watch in disbelief just as we would a brutal car crash. I am  telling you that I had so much fun watching Final Destination 5 that I  want you to experience it for yourself. And please see it in 3D. You  will not be disappointed.  P.S. Pay very close attention in the last scene, especially to what one  of the characters is holding in his hand. You'll totally understand  what I am talking about when you see it.",Final Destination 5
219,Filmathon,The most important element is back: Fear.,7,27 August 2011,"Wow, this film was such a blast. It's definitely the best one yet, bringing back the fear and dread of the first, a speckle of humour here and there, some new twists and turns to keep it exciting and ultimately some pretty gruesome and bloody deaths.This franchise is certainly on its last legs and in my opinion should have finished at the second. But this was so much fun, I had such a great time. Basically, 1, 2 and 5 fit together as a perfect trilogy in my opinion, and the ending will have you screaming for them to leave it in peace and let 'death' take it. It's a perfect ending to a gruesome franchise which as excited millions.My advice? See this film, cringe at the deaths, laugh at the reactions of your friends and ultimately have a blast. It's all you can do with a film as fun as this one, thats as fresh as the first but darker and more exciting than the last.7 out of 10.",Final Destination 5
220,JSUnderdown,A Breath of Fresh Air,8,15 October 2011,"Firstly of all i should just say that I love the FD franchise and when I heard the news of a fifth film I just couldn't wait. For months and months I waited for news, pictures and trailers so when some came i just knew this would be the best of the lot. I was right.When the film was finally release here in the UK I went to see it with my friends, and we all loved it. It is easily the best in the franchise and probably the best horror film this year! The characters are the best. They have such diversity which none of the other films had. They are interesting and there's development so you care when someone dies horribly. I love Olivia (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) I think she is the best Final Destination has ever seen, and I see great things for Jacqueline in the future.The deaths are suspenseful and gory but gory in the right way, unlike FD4/TFD which were funny gory. As I said before you don't want a character to die because of the development.Steven Quale has don't an amazing job with the directing and the 3D is really good (again unlike FD4 appalling 3D). the 3D in the opening credits is THE best use I've ever seen in any movie.Every horror or FD fan should see this film because you'll not be disappointed!!!9/10",Final Destination 5
221,nicoleelkins42,Death With A Surprisingly Good Twist,9,28 May 2012,"Final Destination 5. I bought this movie at Wal-Mart with extremely LOW expectations but since it had been bunked down to a five dollar movie I figured checking it out wouldn't hurt.The movie starts with the showing of the things can cause the deaths in the movie, just simple, everyday things. Well, some of them, anyway. Sam Lawton was an average American contemplating taking an internship in Paris, and his girlfriend wanting to break up with him over it because 'it's just not working'. But when the members of his company, Presage Paper go on a business trip, his life takes an interesting turn when he has a vision of the bridge collapsing and everyone, save on lucky person, dies.When he comes back too, he immediately gets his ex-girlfriend off the bus, and they are followed by his best friend and the best friend's girlfriend, a boy who's a boss but who's workers treat him like crap, the ACTUAL boss, a woman with eye problems, and some sleazy dude who can only think with his you-know-what. One by one after they escape the bridge collapse they start to die. First the gymnast girl suffers a tragic death practicing her routine, and it slowly leads up to her now demented boyfriend trying to kill his BEST FRIENDS girlfriend in order to take the years she would live since she wouldn't have died on the bridge, but instead he kills a cop.Lets face it guys, Death hates being cheated.While the movie was much better than I expected, I was very surprised at the end, when Sam and his girlfriend were leaving for Paris. Yes, that is an emphasis on Paris. The way the end of this ties in the the very first definition was astounding! I didn't expect to see Molly and Sam see Alex Browning and the others get kicked off the plane, but it just shows that Death is all around and you never truly escape its grasp. I wonder if the other Final Destinations will tie in with the other movies...I give FD5 a 9.",Final Destination 5
222,katherine-stephens27,Cool series,9,24 January 2012,"(Only 9, as even though I love the series, the last two were so intense I couldn't enjoy the full experience in the cinema and had to watch the 4th and 5th movies half and almost full respectively in blurred normal vision. Also, because I don't know the sites' meaning of a spoiler, I'm going to say yes because anything I say could be indicative of one.) OK, so on with the review. The actual series from beginning to thus far is a brilliant concept that makes the viewer think carefully. The first three movies are quite ""tame"" compared to the next two, and at times they only hint on what is to come and what is happening, and the viewer does not get to see the full impact of the experience. Also the people involved now are more adults than school/college kids, so I believe the people making the movie series feel they can do more, making the situations more intense and... well... gory. The 3D effect just makes it a little too real for my liking. I do like the montage of the deaths in the end credits, that was cool. I think the 5th movie has a bit of a paradox included in the ""kill someone to steal their time left"" idea. A good concept, but a couple of things: 1: This is a prequel to the first movie, so wouldn't that concept carry over and actually be introduced in the first movie? and 2: If you kill someone to take the time they have left, then wouldn't you die instantly and simultaneously? You are ending their life there and then, so their existence in the physical world ends, thus making any ""time left"" null and void. The very instant they die, you die. If it was the other way around, i.e. taking the time they ""have"" lived, then yes, that will work in the scheme of things, thus adding the time on to your current age. The other way doesn't work.Anyway, brilliant series and am looking forward to the next installments. Perhaps the next one could be at an ice-skating rink? Think of the possibilities...",Final Destination 5
223,cHordi9000,"Everything eventually gets better with time, even Final Destination",7,14 August 2011,"Let's face it, since the 2nd installment of this series, Final Destination's 3 & 4 have pulled this blood-filled franchise down the drain. But even after ""The Final Destination,"" death is back, yet once again, to claim the lives of those who were saved by a premonition which then excludes them from dying during a suspension bridge collapse. Now I went into Final Destination 5 expecting what the previous 2 Final Destinations delivered. A horribly acted, horribly CGI'd, horribly story lined... OK well, needless to say, I thought this show would suck.After I sat down and began this 90 minute 3D train ride, I found myself going from the passenger seat on the doubt caboose, all the way to up to sitting next to the damn engineer of Adrenaline-ville. When the lights turned on in the theater, I realized something. I was wrong... And I HATE being wrong. The characters were actually CHARACTERIZED. Crazy, right? (Don't kid yourself, the dialog and acting makes you laugh and shake your head - even at the most serious of times). Miles Fisher's acting was easily the highlight of the film. Honorable mentions include Champ Kind from Anchorman, I mean David Koechner & funny guy, P.J. Byrne. The deaths were surprisingly realistic. At least realistic enough to still be entertaining. There was a point where I actually sympathized with certain character's deaths because...wait a second, how have I gone this far into a Final Destination review without mentioning the gore? You guessed it, there's lots of it. There were twists, turns, and scenes that made your stomach churn. Hell, even the minor amounts humor were 'deadly' & the plot was believable and well constructed; Dark and ominous, the style this franchise first thrived off of. Essentially the only thing riding against this flick is that it's a decent movie that came out at the wrong time in an already washed up series. I'd really hate myself if I said Final Destination 5 was a 10/10 movie, or even an 8 or 9 out of 10, because it definitely doesn't deserve to be put on the same pedestal as past horror movie alumni. But realistically, you think these movies are made for their production value? They're made to entertain, and that's exactly what FD5 does.",Final Destination 5

Twists are now added to the storyline to make it not as repetitive and predictable. Although there are some parts that are predictable I can tell you this. Things aren't always as they seem in this movie. FD5 will have you cringe, scream, and jump just as you did with the first two.

The story is about some people from one company who are going to go on a business trip,they get on a bus,and one of them starts feeling that something's wrong.The bridge they're on is about to collapse,and one by one,they die.The fake animated blood was really enjoyable. There was one scene, where a girl's eyes are being burned with the laser correction laser,and since i wear glasses myself and was thinking about lasers myself,this was a bit scary for me. But the thing that made me applause in the movie theater is the ending. Goddamn,was it good!It has a great twist,returning us to all the previous movies.By the way,i liked all of them except the third one(that one sucked). P.S.

234,josebpenalva,Better then I thought it be,8,27 December 2011,"Final Destination 5 was better than 3 and 4 but as good as the first 2 It didn't rush all the deaths at once like the fourth one had. It took its time, gave the viewer what each character was like. For example Sam, it showed he liked cooking, was in love with his ex, cared for his co-workers, and over-all a really nice guy. As for in The Final Destination all I really got from him was that he lived with his girlfriend he hangs out with 2 other people besides his girlfriend. Not really an interesting character. The cast was good, I really had hoped that some would live. But how they would all die is smart. Candice's death seemed so typical that you wouldn't expect it, Isaac's death gave me kind of a jigsaw trap feel pulling the needle out, Olivia's death scared me and I never want to get laser eye surgery, Dennis' death just happened it was just thrown in there, and Peter's death was the one I hated the most he was scared and you could tell it he didn't want to die but he did. The ending was pure genius I figured it would lead to flight 180 as soon as I heard Paris. When you see Sam looking at Alex I was happy what a great way to kill Sam, Molly, and even Nathan by the debris. I really enjoyed the idea of this being a prequel to the first film instead of another film in the franchise. Overall I really enjoyed this film and would definitely recommend this to anybody who likes the franchise or the death scenes.",Final Destination 5

The acting was awful and and the story ... are you kidding me; its got no story or at least a plot which can't be predicted. They have managed to keep the same old pattern of making you wonder for a while how will they die. They keep a variety of options open so that you can think for a while. I you have seen the previous editions you know how it starts and how its gonna end. You know the main characters are going to stay till the end no matter what. Even the loads of hot girls like in the previous editions are missing this edition.

I was expecting a really dumb Final Destination film full of dumb and rushed deaths, but I was extremely surprised at how this movie took it's time to develop almost all the characters before killing them in shocking and sometimes unexpected ways. This movie also manages to be darker than the previous films by throwing in a neat little twist than what the other films offered. And OMG!!! I most certainly did not see that twist coming in the end, it was a far better ending than the previous films.

237,Premillenium,Final Destination 5 : The Best of Them All?,10,12 July 2011,"Warning, spoilers MIGHT be ahead. The ""Final Destination"" franchise began going downhill rapidly from the third movie. But, will the fifth movie help the franchise go back up or will it continue going downhill fast? I saw this movie about a month ago, and I must say that, in my opinion, this is the most brutal, the most gruesome, and the most clever movie of the entire franchise. It has many well-thought out death scenes, and one death scene in the movie made me cringe and look away, and trust me, I watched A LOT of slasher/gornography films. One of the most famous scene is the lasik surgery which I thought was pretty good. I'm not going to spoil it for you. First off, this movie has a very interesting plot line. As you heard from the trailer, you know the new death rule, and I think it is pretty clever. But, why didn't Bludworth tell it to the others? Hmmm...? Second of all, the characters are very very relatable. You can actually tell if one hates the other, and one is friends with the other for a long time. Plus, you will also feel bad if one character dies. You will actually say ""Oh, why did he/she die? NOOO!"" Not just a typical ""Oh, he/she died. Who's next?"". The acting is very impressive, hence the professional and experienced actors. I think this is one of the reasons why this movie made it to my highest rank of the ""Final Destination"" franchise. Third, what is this franchise famous of? Exactly, the unique death scenes that happens from the materials/places we see/go to everyday. There are some death scenes here that are very gruesome that if I picture it, I either cringe or smile on how good the death scenes are. One death scene made it to my top 15 most brutal death scenes I have ever seen. Some of you might know it, some of you might not. One thing for sure is, you will know it when you see the movie in August. Lastly, the ending of the whole movie. The ending that made me gasp and left my jaw dropped open for the rest of the movie. It is a pity that many people know it already and spoiled it for everyone, because thy will not be as surprised as everybody on the screening when we reached the ending of the movie. All I gotta tell you is re-watch the whole franchise and soak in every scene you see.. :) So, this review might not be as long as you want it, or as detailed as you hoped for. But, all I have to say is watch the movie. It is way worth your money and your time.",Final Destination 5

This movie brought back my love for the series and made me watch the whole thing. I love how the action is really a ""thriller"" like it says. This movie had me shaking a lot.

The next deaths were great as well and i loved how the ending was! The ending was that peter took the officers life to extend his, however peter is killed when his best friend protects his girl friend. However, Sam and his girl friend get on a plane for Paris. OH NO! GASP! A PLANE? In the FINAL DESTINATION SERIES? Yes! Thats right. They get on the plane and witness a BIG slap in the face, Alex and carter fighting and some teens getting throne off a plane. Woops. then after the plane takes off, its too late. Sadly Sam heres a lady say that the kid had a vision. Then the plane side breaks off and his girlfriend falls out and gets cut in 2 and Sam gets baked like a cheese doodle! This movie is the BEST movie I've seen and i take that from my heart. Please new line! Make more!",Final Destination 5
239,OneLostRonin,Final Destination 5 meaning it isn't Final but Milked,1,20 August 2011,"Final Destination 5 is the same movie you may have seen four times prior and of course if you have not then don't bother (with the exception of the very first film).FD5 brings one new minor plot device to the series, kill or be killed, but this isn't nearly enough to distract the viewer from the fact every other sequence of events unfolds exactly as they have in the previous films. The acting here isn't anything special at all and the film is so predictable the only thing you're watching it for is how people die. If you're a gore-hound I could see you having some enjoyment from this film but otherwise skip it.Final Destination has not been reinvigorated with new life, it has no promising future, and at this point it is simply being created because it can be ""milked"" for a decent profit.",Final Destination 5
240,doshea-144-375668,Disappointing,1,27 August 2011,"Well what can I say, I've sat and watched all FD's and I think the FD5 is the WORST one going, there wasn't enough visions, no-one tried to cheat death, I just wanted to fall asleep!I would not recommend this film if you like the previous 4 then this one will disappoint you also, the story line, wasn't as full as the other, it seem to have more people that should have died but these were missed out.This film like the 4th only ran for 1hr 20mins this is also disappointing, I would think they could put more imagination into it!Maybe Lion Gate, can create the 6th!",Final Destination 5
241,irhuma-ly79,Good to see in 3D,8,11 October 2011,"I've watched this final episode of FD5 on Cape Town / Water Front Cinema in 3D and that was an amazing experience. The movie was not as expected but at least it was far from Epi3 & 4.I liked the idea being in circle with the Epi.1, but the only problem is that it seems a classical SAW-Fasion, meaning everything was expected and very predictable.It is by the end a nice movie to see if you need to have-a-go, and I hope they'll come with a newer version when they might do some revolution like that of Lord of the Kings, The God father or even better.",Final Destination 5
242,saugan-123,Product of a Single Creative Mind (Similar to previous four),9,27 November 2011,"""Final Destination 5"" (2011) by Steven Quale is one of those rare movies where the title itself is a spoiler. Yes, everyone in the movie dies, except for Coroner Bludworth. But you knew that because of the previous four films. Since Quale's single mind is directing this movie, it is very similar to the previous four films. The increasingly challenging task for the filmmakers is to devise ever more horrible and gruesome methods for them to be slaughtered. After watching all four parts, you can already tell the style, technique and philosophy of the film. In other words, you can predict the next scene. Death has a new twist in the Fifth installment of the Final Destination series. Each new movie in the series has a different way it works through the order or a different twist on how to escape it, with the overall theme that escape is always merely temporary. In this installment, thing start off the same - the main character has a premonition of his death in a large scale tragic accident that kills dozens of people, but because he has the premonition, he is able to save a few people. But like the other movies, surviving the tragedy is only the beginning as the main plot of the movie is for them to attempt to escape death as it stalks them. The undertaker from previous films makes another appearance in this installment and gives some insight into the new twist. This time for the survivors to escape death, they must trade places with somebody else, allowing death to take somebody else in their place and allowing the survivor to supposedly become the recipient of what would have been the newly departed's remaining years. But now that it's kill or be killed, the survivors have to go to whole other level from the previous four movies if they want to escape death's iron grip upon them. If you enjoyed the previous four films of the franchise, you will most likely enjoy this one as well. For those of you who have not seen the previous four films in the franchise, the plot and the characters are mutually exclusive, so you don't necessarily have to worry about watching all of the films in order. You aren't going to be lost if you decide to jump into the franchise with the fifth film first. Overall, this movie was predictable. While I was watching this, I was telling my friend who is going to die next and what not. It's always that same order that they die in main character's vision. All the incidents are very creative but not realistic and the deaths portrayed are extremely graphic. For being able to watch this movie in 3D makes it incredible. If you're a big fan of Final Destination then I recommend you to watch this if you haven't yet.",Final Destination 5
243,melissabarnes60,Great movie. (Spoiler),9,23 October 2018,"I'm a huge fan of the FD franchise. This was one of my favs. I will say though, one thing that bugged me at the end was when they (Sam & Molly) were on the plane (Flight 180), they showed Alex getting taken off the plane, right after that the plane took off. Now in the original FD the plane blew up on take off, close enough to blow the windows out at the airport. In this one they were well in the air far enough that a wheel came off & crushed a man.",Final Destination 5
244,kamtigulili,A good team of actors. Good effort to make a good movie. But somebody would have to notice that not all the viewers exclude the brain and common sense while watching movie.,1,9 May 2013,"A good team of actors. Good effort to make a good movie. But somebody  would have to notice that not all the viewers exclude the brain and  common sense while watching movie. I watched the movie thirty-six  minutes. When the screw with oval head fell from a height of over 100  feet with minimal bouncing left standing upright. I said to myself,  ""what kind of moron was making this movie?"" But when the girl fell from  the hanging bar from a height of about 10 feet, and when she fell her  body was cut in half ...??? Lower leg snapped in half even though the  foot was not even touching the floor ????? Than I said: ""I am not that  level idiot who will keep watching this BS.",Final Destination 5
245,varshinikumavath,If you like suspense you can watch this,7,19 August 2014,"Final destination was directed by Steven Quale in which Nicholas D'Agosto was casted as lead role Sam Laton.The Visual effects in this movie were splendid, especially in the sequence where the lead character in his precognitive dream manages to see his future in which he along with his friends were killed by collapse of the enormous bridge on which they were traveling.The movie was successful in transporting the audience as participants in the movie.Every single shot was clearly shot with utmost care so that the continuity is maintained.The movie was a taut, sharp and intelligent piece of horror. Indeed the films horror was based on a good use of suspense rather than out-and-out gore.The way in which the deaths were directed were really horrendous.The overall conclusion we can draw by watching the movie was death is not an accident but is planned so that when your time comes, you can absolutely do nothing about it. You can only cheat death temporarily. It'll get you in the end, by any means necessary no matter what plans you have made to avoid it. Morbid to be honest, but entirely true. Overall the moving rating is 3.5/5.",Final Destination 5
246,batuhan_cavlak,Excellent,4,29 February 2020,I gave this movie 4 instead of 3 or 2 because there no more FD movies ahead.,Final Destination 5
247,shuvonabil,Watchable,5,9 December 2011,"OK so now that I have finally watched FD5, I thought that I might write a quick review while its still fresh. Now the final destination movies are actually B movies. I would like to call it a quick money maker for New line cinemalike the elm street series back in the 80's. Now for whatever reason I was caught back with the final destination series from the very first one. I think it was OK for a low budget b movie. But the new line executives had to stretch it to part 5. The results are the bad sequels, one after another and part 5 is no exceptions. They did try to link it to FD1, which makes it a prequel. Interesting thought but didn't quite work out, thanks to whoever wrote the script. The only good thing about this movie is the effects and the use of fusion camera system (which I saw from the credit). My personal rating 5 out of 10 and I'm kinda stretching it",Final Destination 5
