0,Leofwine_draca,You'd be better off watching Pineapple Express or Bourne...not this mix of the two,3,7 December 2017,"American Ultra is one of those films that can be summed up in a single sentence: PINEAPPLE EXPRESS meets BOURNE. Yes, it's a stoner comedy with all of the idiocy that premise brings to light, mixed with a gritty action thriller in the JASON BOURNE mould. I suppose it's only good for showing that any actor - even someone like Jesse Eisenberg - can be turned into a skilled martial artist with camera trickery and snappy editing. Sadly, although this film is gruesomely violent, the fights are disappointing and the plot is so silly as to be not worth mentioning. Add in the presence of Kristen Stewart - a detraction in any film in which she appears - and you have a film with simply isn't worth your time.",American Ultra
1,SnoopyStyle,interesting idea,6,20 December 2016,"Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) is stuck in the small town of Liman, West Virginia. His girlfriend Phoebe Larson (Kristen Stewart) is the only good thing in his life. He's a convenience store clerk and has panic attacks whenever he tries to leave town. CIA Agent Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) is told that her Ultra program and Mike is to be eliminated by her CIA rival Adrian Yates (Topher Grace). Victoria goes to activate Mike turning him into a skilled action hero.The basic premise has good potential and Eisenberg could be fun as an action lead. The CIA stuff is distracting and Topher Grace is barely functional in his role. The movie would improve by cutting out half of that part. The potential is never fully realized. There are fun moments that could have been much better. I can't pinpoint the exact problem but much of the blame has to be laid at the feet of sophomore director Nima Nourizadeh who made the indie party movie Project X. There are numerous little problems that add up to be a bit of a disappointment.",American Ultra
2,Horst_In_Translation,Pointless fun,6,26 December 2015,"And ""pointless"" is actually a positive aspect in this context as it really would have hurt the movie if it had taken itself seriously on any occasions. ""American Ultra"" is not a very long film, only runs for slightly over 90 minutes and that already includes 5+ minutes of closing credits. For director Nima Nourizadeh, it is only the 2nd turn behind the camera and for that, it is a pretty solid outcome. The writer is Max Landis. I have seen some of his short films that include basically nothing but self-indulgent rambling from him and it's occasionally very painful to watch, but he did a sold job with this movie here. Admittedly, the cast helps a lot in carrying this film. Eisenberg is certainly not the best choice for an action here, but he was okay here. Stewart is pretty good as usual too.Topher Grace, Connie Britton, Tony Hale and Walton Goggins play the major supporting players. Goggins (""Justified"") is delightful to watch as usual and also has the best moment in terms of acting in his final revelation scene. Hale was a bit wasted, he can do a lot more than what he showed here, the other 2 I mentioned were okay overall. Occasionally this film reminded me of a more-action, less-fantasy version of Kick-Ass or Scott Pilgrim. ""American Ultra"" is a decent watch for (not too) young audiences and there were a couple pretty funny moments, such as whose car it is, intercourse with apes, the puppy references etc. These are easy to appreciate. Do not watch this one if you expect a serious gritty action drama, this is not it, even if Stewart totally nails all her dramatic moments and this film is another piece of evidence how she is doing so great right now. But it is still an enjoyable watch overall and I recommend it. Thumbs up.",American Ultra
3,claudio_carvalho,Another Failed Attempt to Turn the Annoying Jesse Eisenberg into an Action Actor,3,3 July 2016,"In Liman, the pothead Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) is hunted down by the CIA under the command of agent Adrian Yates (Topher Grace). However Mike is a skilled assassin trained by CIA and his mentor Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) activates him. Soon he learns that Yates wants to shutdown the program and kills him. Now Mike and his girlfriend Phoebe Larson (Kristen Stewart) need to escape from a CIA team of assassins.""American Ultra"" is an overrated imbecile film with a stupid story lost between action and comedy about a Nikita-like CIA program of assassins that is shutdown. This is another failed attempt of the studios to turn the annoying Jesse Eisenberg into an action actor. However the film never works; the jokes are not funny and the story is absurd and ridiculous. My vote is three. Title (Brazil): ""American Ultra: Armados e Alucinados"" (""American Ultra: Armed and Alucinated"")",American Ultra
4,nogodnomasters,"HE WAS ARMED WITH A SPOON, SIR.",10,4 May 2018,"Mike (Jesse Eisenberg) is a stoner who lives with Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) in Liman, West Virginia. He works at a convenience store and invests his disposable income into mind altering substances. Like TRUMAN, he has issues when he attempts to leave town, such as panic attacks. He likes to draw and create wild stoner stories. At 25 minutes or so into the film (midpoint plot spoiler) Mike becomes ""activated"" as he is part of a CIA project called Wiseman. Yates (Topher Grace) wants to destroy Mike, while Victoria (Connie Britton) is out to save him.The film becomes a fight of Mike vs the CIA using psychotic killers. Mike must come up with ways to kill people and defend himself that would make Bourne envious.This was a fun film. I enjoyed the characters and the fact it could lead to a series.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",American Ultra
5,kosmasp,Weird but in a good way,7,11 September 2016,"Before he ruined Lex Luthor (popular way of thinking), see him in this. Although you probably have seen Jesse Eisenberg in a couple of other things too I reckon, this is where he does shine with his ""special powers"". Some may argue if he has more than one thing going for him (acting/power wise), but that would be kind of unfair to him and the movies he did so far.If you like movies with a weird touch, that have a strange story to tell and are not too squeamish about it, you could do worse. You could also do a bit better of course, but let's not focus on the negative things, but rather on the positives. This is entertaining enough to enjoy for what it is. I don't think it was successful enough to turn it into a series, but it works for what it is",American Ultra
6,classicsoncall,"""Hey, I just killed two people.""",6,24 September 2021,"Does anyone else get the impression that recent movies have an undisclosed mission to be even bloodier than the ones that came before it? I'm thinking here of 2021's ""Kate"" and ""Gunpowder Milkshake"". This one came out a few years earlier but it's in the same mold as the latter two. The hero here, if you want to call him that, is the perpetually stoned Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg), who's unaware of his past as a trained assassin in a project that has since been discarded by the CIA. There had to be some sort of unspoken protocol against Phoebe Larson (Kristen Stewart) becoming his girlfriend for the past five years; in any other organization she would have been eliminated early. I guess it doesn't make any difference in stories like this, as the mindless, over the top action takes precedence, keeping the make-up folks on their toes for ever more clever ways of making it look like blood is a disposable commodity. There are moments of black comedy in the story but you have to search for them; it was with a degree of satisfaction that Adrian Yates (Topher Grace) got his due for carrying out an assassination campaign without authorization. Bill Pullman gets credit at least, for appearing younger than he did in the 'Sinner' series.",American Ultra
7,jboothmillard,American Ultra,4,4 July 2020,"The Geena Davis movie The Long Kiss Goodnight was going through my mind when I read the description about this film, it is certainly similar in that the character is an every person with amnesia that used to be a superspy or assassin, but it takes a different approach to this idea. Basically, in the sleepy town of Liman, West Virginia lives Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg), a stoner and a convenience store clerk. He plans to propose to his long-time girlfriend, Phoebe Larson (Kristen Stewart), on a trip to Hawaii. But he cannot leave, as he suffers intense panic attacks anytime he tries to leave town. He questions why Phoebe puts up with him. In Langley, Virginia, CIA Agent Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) receives a coded warning that Mike, the sole survivor of her ""Wiseman"" Ultra program, is to be eliminated by her rival, Adrian Yates (Topher Grace), and his similar ""Toughguy"" agents. Lasseter travels to Liman and, feeling a duty to protect him, she ""activates"" Mike through a series of code words. Mike fails to understand their significance, and she leaves frustrated. Mike encounters two Toughguys agents and is attacked, but his training activates and kills them using a spoon. He calls Phoebe, who reaches him just as Sheriff Watts (Stuart Greer) arrives. Yates sends two Toughguy operatives, Laugher (Walton Goggins) and Crane (Monique Ganderton), to kill Mike and Phoebe at the sheriff station, but they evade Laugher and kill Crane before escaping to the home of Mike's drug dealer Rose (John Leguizamo). Mike becomes unnerved with his sudden array of military strategy and fighting skills. He also realises he has almost no memory of life before living in the town with Phoebe. Yates quarantines the city and puts Lasseter and Mike's pictures on the local news. Lasseter's former assistant, Petey Douglas (Tony Hale), air drops her a weapon, and when Yates finds out he threatens to charge him for treason. Rose's house is attacked with lethal gas, Rose and his two guards, Big Harold (Lavell Crawford) and Quinzin (Sam Malone), are killed by two Toughguy agents, but Mike and Phoebe kill the attackers. Mike is rescued from the gas by Phoebe. He questions her knowledge of the gas, and Phoebe reluctantly reveals that she is a CIA agent assigned as his handler, leaving him heartbroken. After another attempt against his life, Mike is rescued by Lasseter. She explains that he volunteered for Wiseman due to his criminal record and subsequently had his memories erased. She also tells him that Phoebe was to leave after getting him settled in Liman but chose to stay because she genuinely fell in love with him. Lasseter reveals that his panic attacks about leaving town were implanted to keep him safe. Mike and Lasseter evade another attack by Toughguy agents, prompting Yates to order a drone strike on the entire block. Petey calls off the drone strike at the last minute, and secretly reports to Yates' superior, Raymond Krueger (Bill Pullman). Mike contacts Yates and arranges to exchange himself for Phoebe at a local grocery store. He attacks the store, killing or incapacitating multiple Toughguys before fighting and defeating Laugher, whom he spares, being a mentally unbalanced man. Phoebe escapes from Yates when Lasseter attacks him, but Krueger arrives and stops her. Phoebe and Mike leave the store as multiple law enforcement officers show up with guns, and he decides to propose to her. Krueger ties up Yates and Lasseter. Yates argues what he was doing, even killing many innocent people, for good reasons. Yates is eventually executed by Krueger for his failure, while Lasseter argues that Mike taking out seventeen Toughguys is proof of the success of the Wiseman program and that he is potentially a valuable asset. Six months later, handled by Lasseter and Petey, Mike and Phoebe are happy together in Manila, and ready to complete a CIA assignment. Also starring Michael Papajohn as Otis, and Nash Edgerton as Beedle. Eisenberg is interesting as the bewildered unmotivated young man who regains his memory as a high-skilled assassin, Stewart is alright as his loyal girlfriend, and Grace enjoys himself playing the villain. It was an interesting concept, the first half of the film establishing everything works relatively well, but then it gets a little too over-the-top than it probably should have done, to the point it is almost ridiculous and not that funny, at least the eye-catching violent fights and high-speed chases are reasonable, it could have been better, but it's not a bad action comedy. Okay!",American Ultra
8,Tweekums,"Silly but entertaining, full on action",7,5 January 2020,"Mike Howell is a stoner living in a small West Virginia town with his girlfriend Phoebe Larson. He is hoping to propose to her during a holiday in Hawaii but has a panic attack at the airport... as he does every time he tries to leave town. After this incident he starts to wonder why Phoebe stays with him. We soon learn that he isn't an ordinary young man; he is part of a CIA programme known as 'Wiseman'... he doesn't know it but he is a highly trained super-soldier! Back at CIA headquarters Agent Victoria Lasseter, who headed the programme, is warned that all Wiseman agents are being eliminated by similar 'Tough Guy' agents run by rival agent Adrian Yates. She heads to West Virginia and meets Mike and gives him his activation code... he has no ideas what the words mean but shortly afterwards when he is attacked by two Tough Guys he dispatches them with a spoon! He still has no memory but he knows he must fight for his life to save himself and Phoebe as more agents come to kill him.This film is a bit silly but that doesn't matter as it is a lot of fun. There are quite a few humorous moments as well as plenty of action. It must be stated that the action is brutal to degree that might disturb some viewers. In many ways Mike is very like 'Jason Bourne'... an elite agent with memory problems; he is also very different as he doesn't know he has memory problems and Bourne didn't do drugs and draw comics. The story manages to provide some decent twists. The cast is solid; most notably Jesse Eisenberg who is a lot of fun as Mike... a character who is understandably confused when he realises he has elite combat skills. Kristen Stewart provides solid support as Phoebe. Topher Grace is good fun as villain Yates; he isn't a typical action movie villain... his character is far from tough. Overall this is a fun film that provides solid action with some good laughs.",American Ultra
9,tavm,American Ultra was a weirdly good time for me!,8,24 August 2015,"Just watched this movie with my movie theatre-working friend. He hadn't seen it before and when it was all over, he thought it was weird. Well, it may have been that but it was also quite entertaining though not as funny as I thought it would be though that was okay because I liked the drama concerning the romance of the Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart characters. Also interesting seeing Connie Britton and Topher Grace playing two agents on opposite sides. Quite riveting with all those action sequences. So on that note, I recommend American Ultra. P.S. As a resident of Louisiana, I have to note that this was shot at various places in my state (though not in my current hometown of Baton Rouge). Also that one of the players, Michael Papajohn, had arrived here in BR in 1985 when he attended LSU and played baseball for the Tigers in the College World Series in '86 and '87 for that school. It was also while there that he started in films as a stunt double for Dennis Quaid when Quaid's movie, Everybody's All-American, was shot at the school during the '87 season. From there, he'd also do stunts for Titanic and The Waterboy and other movies before eventually transitioning to acting in pictures like Spider-Man, Spider-Man 3 and, most recently, Jurassic World.",American Ultra
10,Scarecrow-88,American Ultra,7,12 December 2015,"You know there are movies that perhaps just don't seem to hit upon release that maybe, just maybe will garner a bit of a re-evaluation later. Look, there is nothing about ""American Ultra"" in its plot anyone coming away from it would consider exactly cerebral or heady, but as a popcorn (emphasis on corn) 90 minute exercise in violence and style, I think you could do a hell of a lot worse.I can't really say I'm a Kirsten Stewart fan. I don't dislike her, though, and in certain films she can be an asset in front of the camera if you want to capture beauty in specific shots where her face and hair are lit just right. As funny as this may sound, this could be my favorite Stewart role to date. I responded to her and Eisenberg (who I personally like a great deal as far as his method of speech with words, delivered in a type of rat-a-tat-tat, computer geek lingo) in this movie and liked both of them. They kind of exist in their own world (intentional, thanks to CIA brainwipe), in the middle of some nothing town in West Virginia. Eisenberg is a stoner (yeah, surprise?) who works in an unflattering supermarket that often is so empty you could hear crickets if there were any. Stewart is his live-in girlfriend. She has red coloring in her hair in this filmkind of like it, I must admit. Well she is actually his handler, and Eisenberg is actually an ""experiment"" of the CIA, a trained killer with a ""kill switch"" that ""triggers the killer"" when the head of the operation that ""built him"" (Connie Britton, who I think has aged like a fine wine) repeats key phrases to him. Britton discontinued the asset project due to the homicidal failures of the program, and now a dick played by Topher Grace (he's good with the douchebaggery) has replaced her in their CIA department. Well Grace takes the initiative (unauthorized as it might be) to send out trained assassins to eliminate Eisenberg so Britton sees that he defends himself with the skills instilled in him.The film doesn't elaborate on the specifics of how Eisenberg can do what he does, and instead he receives the words from Britton, which are enough to turn that inner killer loose. It is all about a stoner and his ways with household items, as killers with machine guns shoot at his direction (and anyone else that is in the way). Seeing the gag with the skillet and the spoon, firecrackers and whatever he can pull off a shelf in the supermarket despite the superior firepower aimed right for him is part of the ridiculous charm of this ""toss aside the reason to scrutinize and just go with it"" action flick. I think this could go on to be a cable / satellite classic in that it might show up at different parts of the night and be a diversion worth taking again. Bill Pullman has a small cameo as a CIA chief, John Leguizamo is full of energy as a stripper joint owner, and Walter Coggins plays his laughing arsonist psycho to the hilt.You know, the film's romance between Eisenberg and Stewart actually worked for me. They built their own little life together that was not substantial in financial pursuits but the love that existed seemed to be enough. The ""I am the tree, you are the car"" was actually poignant I thought as the two lovers debate about their status (life in limbo) as a couple. When I read that some thought they didn't click performance-wise, I don't agree. I think they took roles they could have easily slept walked through and gave a damn. Hard to imagine there would be much investment in characterization in between hammers to the skull, screwdrivers through the leg, and meat cleavers to the forehead. Coggins gets his front teeth knocked out and has quite the memorable smile, while Eisenberg is actually shot in the head (well, it grazes the forehead and leaves a nasty gash) and keeps going! Seeing Grace get his comeuppance and the marriage proposal as laser beams from machine gun scopes point the direction of Eisenberg as he bends to his knee for a surprised Stewart are icing on the cake.",American Ultra
11,LeonLouisRicci,Wild and Crazy...Ultra-Cool Conspiracy Movie,8,2 May 2016,"Over the Top...Down the Rabbit Hole...and Traveling through Another Dimension, this Colorful, Shining, and Outrageous Action-Comedy hits its Target Audience square in the Cerebral Cortex causing a Mind Melting Trip that is Ultra-Pleasant but not without Side-Effects.There is an Underlying Anxiety to all of the Fun and Danger because in some Alternative Universe that is Reality, this Type of Thing is too Close to the Truth to be Enjoyed without being a Cautionary Tale of Conspiracy Theories that often turn out to be True.MK-Ultra, a Government Sponsored Black Ops Embarrassment uncovered in the 1970's revealed Disturbing Mind Control Experiments performed by the CIA using Unsuspecting Citizens as Guinea Pigs. Unbelievable and too Complex to be included here, suffice to say this Movie is more True than You would Believe.Therefore, it's not a Laugh a Minute but it does Contain some Black Comedy, but relies more on Ultra-Violence and Super-Style to give the Message Meaning and be Entertaining with a Cartoon Look.Not Everything Works, but Most of it Does, and the Film feels Awkward, Odd, and while it is Slick, Sleek, and Artsy, the Anxiety felt by Jesse Eisenberg's ""MiKe"" (get it) transfers to the Audience like some kind of ""Contact High"".Overall, its Pulsating Presentation is part of the Uneasy Charm and will most likely be Enjoyed by its Target Audience, others not in on the ""Vibe"" will probably Protest its Conceits and won't have a Clue about any of it.Note...The end Credits Cartoon is a hilarious Hoot.",American Ultra
12,zardoz-13,Spies Versus Stoners,8,25 August 2015,"Imagine crisscrossing the amnesia, espionage thriller ""The Bourne Identity"" with the stoner saga ""The Pineapple Express,"" and you've got the nitty-gritty of ""Project X"" director Nima Nourizadeh's ""American Ultra,"" starring Jesse Eisenberg, Kirsten Stewart, John Leguizamo, and Bill Pullman. Although it remains far from original with its formulaic content, this violent, offbeat, 96-minute, R-rated epic delivers one startling surprise after another, not the least of which is the unusual casting of the loquacious, sissified Eisenberg as a weaponized lethal hero. At the same time, ""American Ultra"" reunites Eisenberg with his ""Adventureland"" co-star Kristen Stewart of the ""Twilight"" franchise. Just as Eisenberg plays rough and tumble with blood on his hands, Stewart isn't far behind as an action heroine, too. While Eisenberg kills in self-defense with considerable qualms, he conducts himself at times as if he were imitating Richard Dean Anderson's Angus MacGuyer, wielding everyday objects with devastating ferocity, when he isn't pondering his mysterious memory lapses like Matt Damon's Jason Bourne. Action thrillers don't make the grade unless the heroes and heroines tangle with challenging adversaries. Bad guys Topher Grace and Walton Goggins are appropriately villainous, and ""Independence Day"" actor Bill Pullman shows up briefly as their CIA superior. Director Nima Nourizadeh doesn't let the action slacken for a second. Incidentally, the Eisenberg hero doesn't discover his true identity until about halfway through his nimbly staged thriller. Eisenberg has never pulled off anything as physically assertive as ""American Ultra"" because he lacks the debonair looks of a romantic leading man. Ironically, the fact he doesn't think of himself as an action hero until he finds himself dispatching one heavily armed thug after another makes his performance happily believable. Moviegoers that prefer the indie-styled comedies Eisenberg makes may abhor ""American Ultra,"" while moviegoers who crave melodramatic massacres may loathe Eisenberg's casting.Shaggy-haired Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg of ""Zombieland"") works the cash register at a grocery store in the Podunk town of Liman, West Virginia. Mike spends more time behind the register illustrating a graphic novel about a simian in an astronaut outfit called Apollo Ape than ring up customers. Indeed, we rarely see anybody venture into his store. When Mike is neither clerking nor drawing, he gets high on marijuana cigarettes that he rolls by hand for himself and listens to vinyl albums on his turntable. He shares his house with his equally lackluster girlfriend, Phoebe Larson (Kristen Stewart of ""Twilight""), who answers the phone at a bail bonding office. Mike suffers from delusions of paranoia, and he often experiences meltdowns. For years he has struggled to leave Liman, but he finds himself unable to realize his dream without grief and anxiety assailing him. Essentially, Mike is a petty criminal who has gotten into trouble so often in his hometown that the local constabulary know him by his first name and keep an eye peeled for him. Meanwhile, he peeks at an engagement ring that he has gotten for Phoebe and wonders when he should spring the question. Mike purchases his pot from a zany drug dealer named Rose (John Leguizamo of ""John Wick"") who lives in a psychedelic house. Altogether, Mike doesn't look like he could harm a gnat.Meantime, at C.I.A headquarters, agent Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton of the ABC-TV series ""Nashville"") learns from an anonymous phone call that the top-secret Ultra program that she established to create sleeper agents is about to be liquidated. Victoria's rival at the Agency, smug-minded Adrian Yates (Topher Grace of ""Predators""), has decided that the time is ripe to eliminate anybody involved with Ultra. Actually, the Ultra program has been shut down since most of the recruits went insane and died. As it turns out, one recruit survived and surpassed everybody's expectations. Imagine poor Mike's consternation when he wanders out into the parking lot and spots two guys rigging up a bomb to his automobile. Although the two guys are much better built than Mike, our hero kills both of them before they can blink. He uses a spoon to stab one of his assailants in the neck and kill him. Mike has no idea how he has managed to perform such incredible feats. He remembers an oddball woman that entered his store earlier in the evening and spouted some gibberish that puzzled him. Victoria Lasseter was the lady and she was trying to warn poor Mike about his impending doom at the hands of CIA assassins. No sooner does the opposition try to exterminate Mike with extreme prejudice than he surprises them with his impeccable combat skills. At one point, pinned down behind a refrigerator in his kitchen by a barrage of gunfire, Mike slings a skillet above his head, pops off a round at it, and his bullet ricochets, and cuts down the trigger-happy soldier armed with an assault rifle! Jesse Eisenberg definitely seems out of place in this blood and gore, tongue-in-cheek actioneer. Nevertheless, he handles himself competently in the close-quarters combat scenes. A villain plunges a screwdriver through one of our hero's hands, but Eisenberg clobbers his foe into submission with a hammer. ""Justified"" villain Walton Goggins has a field day as a psychotic henchman that Yates dispatches to dispose of our unlikely hero. The Goggins character is named Laughter, and Laughter tangles with Eisenberg's Mike repeatedly throughout ""American Ultra."" Initially, when they confront each other, Mike smashes in Laughter's front teeth. Meantime, Kristen Stewart doesn't lose her cool as level-headed Phoebe. Occasionally, she gets to whip a villain, but she gives another of her typically icy, inexpressive performances. In her best scene, she reprimands Mike for locking up Laughter in a jail cell, but forgetting to retrieve an automatic pistol he left behind. Predictably, Laughter grabs the gun and blasts away at their fleeing backs. Aside from the splendidly orchestrated action scenes that resemble something Asian filmmaker John Woo of ""Broken Arrow"" might stage, director Nima Nourizadeh keeps surprising us with Eisenberg's audacious heroism and shocking sadism.",American Ultra
13,oscaralbert,AMER!CAN ULTRA confirms what many if not most of us have long suspected . . .,8,20 January 2016,". . . that the U.S. Government, with all of its billions of dollars, secrets, and black ops facilities, is out of control and responsible for most of the Evil in America.

14,neil-476,Very entertaining,8,11 September 2015,"Mike Howell is in a dead-end job in Liman, a dead-end town, living in happily stoned penury with his girlfriend Phoebe. What he doesn't know (because his memories have been wiped) is that he is the sole successful product of a covert CIA programme to produce kind of super-assassin. Changes in management within the CIA result in newly promoted and somewhat megalomaniac Yates deciding to terminate Mike, as a result of which Victoria Lasseter, who headed the programme which produced Mike, travels Liman to speak the code phrase which activates him. Mayhem ensues.American Ultra is not, as far as I can tell, based on a comic, but it definitely has a feel about it as if it had been. The closing (animated) title sequence uses Mike's would-be comic characters (we see him drawing comics frequently), and the vibe of the film is similar to Wanted, RED, The Losers – outrageous all-out action against a background of gallows humour. This film is very violent, and often quite funny. It's also very sweary, with much of the swearing serving no other purpose than being swearing. Use the script to serve the story, please. There is also something of a True Lies vibe to it, especially as regards the ending.The action is great, and Eisenberg deals with both the stoner and the action hero elements of his character very well. Stewart is good fun, too (after the Twiglet movies I never thought I would use ""Kristen Stewart"" and ""fun"" in the same sentence). But, for me, Topher Grace as CIA nutcase Yates was the most enjoyable character, constantly good humoured but always on the edge of a meltdown through frustration that what he sees as the obvious solution just wasn't happening.This was good fun.",American Ultra
15,anaconda-40658,American Ultra-Good.,9,9 September 2015,"American Ultra (2015): Dir: Nima Nourizadeh / Cast: Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Topher Grace, Connie Britton, John Leguizamo: Bizarre and whacked out action comedy that is graphic in its presentation of violence. Jesse Eisenberg plays Mike Howell, a convenient store clerk hoping to propose to his girlfriend. She is Phoebe Larson, played by Kristen Stewart. She is concerned with Mike's panics attacks and constant trips to the police station. Central plot regards the fact that Mike is a special agent whose memory was erased, which plays into his attacks. Connie Britton plays a CIA agent out to warn Howell that he is being targeted for death by her rival, played by Topher Grace who dispatches a group of sleeper agents to terminate Howell. Nima Nourizadeh previously made the mediocre and unfunny Project X. Here he creates just as much chaos but much more originality, particularly during a climax that involves super agents, fireworks, tasers, and a most unusual proposal. Eisenberg plays off the confusion of Mike who, in self defence kills two men using ordinary items. Stewart as Phoebe represents many things to Mike whether it be girlfriend or caretaker but ultimately she proves resourceful. Grace plays the snide and corrupt young CIA agent who authorized this faulty mission. Britton as agent Lasseter unleashes Mike's inner trauma in order to counter Grace's attack. John Leguizamo plays Rose, a tattoo covered drug dealer paranoia friend of Mike's. The violence is extreme and over the top but its theme of government and identity drive this visually innovative catastrophe to a smokey finish. Score: 9 / 10",American Ultra
16,FlashCallahan,Mr and Mrs Smith get the munchies......,4,6 September 2015,"Small-town stoner Mike spends most of his time getting high, and writing about a monkey. A superhero monkey. What Mike doesn't know is that he was trained by the CIA to be a lethal killing machine, and when the agency targets him for termination, his former handler activates his latent skills, turning the mild-mannered slacker into a deadly weapon. Now, the utterly surprised Mike must use his newfound abilities to save himself and his girlfriend from government agents trying to stub them out......American Ultra, or the one where Max Landis threw his toys out of the pram is an oddity, and it's clear after about ten minutes why it's failed so dramatically at the Box Office.It's nothing to do with the casting, Eisenberg is always watchable, as is Stewart, and they have wonderful chemistry during their screen time. It's just that the film doesn't know what it wants to be. It's like someone has put every genre going, put them in a bag, and got someone to pull one out and then say 'for the next ten minutes we will be doing an action film'.There are times when the film forgot it was a comedy and just went full on action, which is never a bad thing, but then the following humour feels too incoherent, and characters who were supposed to be funny, turn quite sinister for no good reason.So all in all, it's an interesting concept for sure, but it's a mess, and for a film that's just over ninety minutes, it drags at times.Still, it's quite psychedelic in places, Leguizamo is the best thing in it (even though he's playing a stereotype), and the end credits are great.I was expecting a movie where Floyd from True Romance was part of Treadstone, but alas that would be too good to be true.Max, you will never be your dad dude......",American Ultra
17,deloudelouvain,Not as good as I expected,6,7 December 2015,If I have to be honest I was slightly disappointed by this movie. After reading some reviews I expected a lot more from American Ultra. It's not that it is a bad movie but it for sure is not a movie I will remember. There are too much questions unanswered and too many things that are not very credible. Okay sometimes it doesn't have to be but in this movie I thought it should have and it just wasn't. Apart from Topher Grace all the other actors were good or okay in their roles.

18,siderite,This is NOT a stoner movie,7,12 November 2015,"The funny thing is that if I hadn't seen Max Landis on Movie Fights I would have thought this film was cool. However, now I have to say that I am slightly disappointed because surely he could have written this a lot better. Another thing going against me while watching the movie is that American Ultra was in a list of ""X best stoner movies""... and the film was marginally about drugs and they had no actual bearing on the plot.On the other hand, the character Mike was really awesome. Imagine a kind and sensitive guy with a super assassin training who just loves the heck out of his girlfriend.From the trailer I thought the film was going in a completely different direction. Unfortunately, after the original start, it went into the typical evil maniacal incompetent killers and the knight in shining armour saving his girl. It even ended in a similar fashion to The Equalizer, an equally failed film.Bottom line: even if I don't mean to punish Landis for my own expectations, I couldn't really enjoy the film because of overused tropes that ended up tarnishing an original and fun idea.",American Ultra
19,namashi_1,"Fun, but in parts!",6,16 November 2015,"'American Ultra' rides on a roaring idea, but the film is only fun in parts. While the action is gruesomely cartooned, the Writing doesn't hold after a while. 'American Ultra' Synopsis: A stoner - who is in fact a government agent - is marked as a liability and targeted for extermination. But he's too well-trained and too high for them to handle.'American Ultra' is consistently high on energy & gore. The protagonist's unreal physical strength amuses you, but later-on, it doesn't. I enjoyed some parts, particularly the initial madness. But, the last half fails. The predictability isn't the problem, its just that the idea gets exhausted after a point. Max Landis's Screenplay scores high in the first-hour & the idea alone, is damn fresh. But, The Writing sags in the latter half. Nima Nourizadeh's Direction is hazy. Cinematograpphy is fine. Editing is crisp. Action-Sequences are brilliantly executed.Performance-Wise: Jesse Eisenberg is a joy to watch, yet again. The supremely talented Oscar-nominated actor doesn't miss a beat & comes up with a stupendous performance. Kristen Stewart shows a marked improvement over her previous works. She's more natural this time around. Topher Grace is an unconvincing baddie. Connie Britton is feisty. Walton Goggins hams. John Leguizamo & Bill Pullman are solid in brief roles.On the whole, 'American Ultra' can easily be watched once, despite its minuses.",American Ultra
20,StevePulaski,"Unpleasant, raucous, and convoluted to the point of breeding indifference",3,22 August 2015,"""American Ultra"" is a thoroughly unpleasant film, cruelly loud, unbearably obnoxious, and convoluted to the point where it breeds indifference amongst its audience. It's marketed as the romantic ""Pineapple Express"" of sorts, boasting the amiable and easily relatable chemistry of Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, but cacophonous action sequences and a downright stupid plot prevent any kind of humor or remnants of wit to seep through such a lackluster story. For once, a stoner film, and potentially its actors and crew, have gotten so taken by their chemical reinforcement that they forgot to say, create, or do anything funny or insightful.We follow Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg), a chronic stoner living with his unbelievably patient girlfriend Phoebe Larson (Kristen Stewart). Mike smokes to get away from his sober self, where he falls prey to persistent panic attacks whenever he comes close to leaving his town, home, or general comfort zone. The two live together and share incredible romance whilst Mike works at a local convenient store.Meanwhile, we focus on a nearby CIA office where Agent Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) learns that her workplace rival, Adrian Yates (Topher Grace), has taken over the ""Ultra Program,"" a secret project she once helmed to create agents that operated like normal people but were really just pawns of the CIA. When the project ostensibly flopped, she ordered the death of all the assets, including Mike Howell. Lasseter, however, discovers Mike is well, and winds up activating his senses, turning him into an unstoppable killing machine whenever he is in danger.The first instance comes in the parking lot of the convenient store where he works. Two guys are attempting to break into Mike's car, and as a result, Mike snaps and turns into a slick fighter with quickness that Bruce Lee would envy. From there on out, Mike is essentially not his own man anymore, but a robot of the CIA. When Yates orders Mike to be taken out, upon realizing his abilities, he kidnaps Phoebe, resulting in Mike truly showing everyone what he is made of as a human and a CIA-controlled puppet of sorts.""American Ultra"" features some incredibly brutal scenes of violence and, as somebody who can admire slickly directed and choreographed violence, the violence here is an assault on the senses. Punches and thuds land with headache-inducing noise, the brutality here is on the verge of being artless and for the sake of being brutal, and little about any of these scenes is particularly compelling. Somewhat like a superhero film, you feel no real danger for Mike being that he's already programmed to be quicker than any of his opponents.With all this emphasis on the brutal, writer Max Landis forgets to make any of this funny, despite a premise ripe for jokes. Perhaps this is a blessing, for Landis could've easily taken this film in the direction of bogus stoner jokes, but the lack of humor despite proved comedic talent such as Eisenberg and Grace seems almost criminal. However, to his credit, Landis does emphasize the relationship between Mike and Phoebe here, one built off mutual understanding of one another and unadulterated love. Scenes between the two are quite touching and romantic, and provide a pleasant, if momentary, relief and pause between all of the violent nonsense. It's also worth noting that Topher Grace takes on the villain role for once. Grace, an actor I've long-defended for his ability to be goofy, serious, smug, believable, and charismatic, sometimes all in one film, does some strong, over-the-top comedy here, and, despite two solid leads, outshines everyone around him.But at the end of it all, ""American Ultra"" suffers from the stoner mentality of ""who cares, let's do it,"" resulting in a convoluted film that probably would've been better suited for an ""intellectual"" conversation with friends and some help than a ninety-six minute film. While this and ""Project X"" prove director Nima Nourizadeh can function in controlled chaos and romantic tendencies can indeed be strong amidst the senseless and inane, ""American Ultra"" can't rise above its own reckless and terribly asinine ideas and wallows haplessly in its own bong exhaust.",American Ultra
21,disdressed12,a hot mess,6,6 September 2016,"enjoyed this movie,to a point.it's got a action galore and it it has some funny moments.however,there is basically no character development and the plot(if you can call it that)is all over the map.the acting is god enough all around,given what the actors had to work with.Jesse Eisenberg is the male lead,and is decent enough.but I have to single out Kristen Stewart(as the female lead) who steals the show,in my opinion.she gets a of hate for some reason but i also saw her in Still Alice,where she was also very good.anyway back to American Ultra.as I mentioned before,there are some funny moments,many of them courtesy of John Leguizamo.Connie Briton and Topher Grace also star.ll in all,not a bad effort.as I said I enjoyed it but as soon as it was over,it started to fade from memory.for me American Ultra is a 5.6/10",American Ultra
22,KineticSeoul,It is what it is,5,26 December 2015,"Okay so this is a movie that most people probably didn't know enough about to check out. I will just say, if you have seen the trailer it does give you an idea and it is what it is. I think the director knew they didn't have the resources to make a super action movie. So I guess they tried to just have fun along the ride, with some recycled ideas and lazy writing. But again, they weren't trying to make a great action movie here, just something you can pop in, make some popcorn and have a decent time with. At least when it comes to the entertainment value. Even the acting in this is very comic book like, and a bit over the top and ridiculous. I guess that is because the actors knew they were in a non-realistic and ridiculous movie kinda like the movies ""RED"" and it's sequel to give you an idea. Except with a way lower budget. Watching this movie was like watching a forgettable graphic novel on screen, so it does have it's perks although it's very low. When it comes to the premise, it has been done before but better except this goes in a more silly direction. Where the protagonist is this skilled person in his or her craft but doesn't know about it because of some plot device and regains these skills through experience. Now the lead Mike Howell starts off as these weak and super clumsy guy, clumsy to the point where his character actually got a bit annoying. Few parts I was like ""gosh why would you do that?"". Anyways so he is this pothead that works at a convenient store and draws comics about a monkey killing people. And he likes this one chick that he lives together with and they are on the run when people start trying to kill him. And thus the journey begins where he is on the run with that chick while trying to regain his memories and killing off people that are trying to kill him and his girl. Yeah, just by reading the premise will give you a direct idea on what road this movie will be heading. It's actually quite a predictable movie. Overall, this is a flick that is alright if there is nothing else that you really want to watch and is just something to pass the time. Not awful, but it's still a forgettable low budget popcorn flick.5.9/10",American Ultra
23,Hellmant,I had high hopes!,8,28 August 2015,"'AMERICAN ULTRA': Four Stars (Out of Five)Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart reunite (after formerly pairing in 2009's 'ADVENTURELAND') for this stoner-comedy action flick! The film tells the story of a slacker clerk, who's actually a secret government assassin (unbeknownst to him), that's been marked for execution; by his unknown employers. The movie also stars Topher Grace, Connie Britton, Walton Goggins, John Leguizamo, Tony Hale and Bill Pullman. It was directed by Nima Nourizadeh (who also directed the teen party flick 'PROJECT X') and written by Max Landis (who also co-wrote the indie sci-fi hit 'CHRONICLE'). The movie is funny, and action-packed, although not quite as good as it's trailers promise. Mike Howell (Eisenberg) is a clerk at a convenience store, that's in love with his girlfriend Phoebe Larson (Stewart). He wants to move away with her, and propose, but he can't; due to extreme panic attacks. He also dreams of publishing a graphic novel, about a superhero monkey; and he spends a lot of his time getting stoned and writing it. His life suddenly changes, for the worse, when he finds out he's a CIA assassin, that hasn't been activated yet, and his secret employers want him dead. The movie has a lot of cool action scenes, likable characters, some humorous marijuana jokes, and an amusing love story. It does all of these things well, but not that well. It's an entertaining movie, for sure, but it's not as good as the previews make it out to be; and I expected more from Landis. Still I can't say I was that disappointed either; and I do like Nourizadeh's direction style. I also really like Eisenberg, and I can always relate to his characters; especially here, with all of his insecurities and panic attacks. I do think that he and Stewart have great chemistry together too (I love 'ADVENTURELAND'). I had high hopes, which this film doesn't quite match, but it's still a pretty good movie.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/2GU4GdpLvIk",American Ultra

It starts a little slow, but once the leading schlub discovers he's a superweapon, well, things get pretty entertaining, with lots of intense, crazy action involving guns, spoons, and frying pans.This is very much a movie that doesn't want to give you time to stop and think about the story. If you do stop you'll definitely see some issues; for example, the reason given to shut down the original program should still be a problem, but it's just ... not. That's so lazy.But as mindless fun goes, this is a really good example of it. It's also amusing with a surprisingly sweet romance at the heart of it.

28,tabuno,A Couragous Blend of Dramatic Action and Comedy,9,13 January 2019,"28 August 2015. There are black comedies (The Whole Nine Yards, 2000; The Matador, 2005, You Kill Me, 2007; Red, 2010) and then there are black comedies (Pulp Fiction, 1994; Daisy & Violet, 2011; and Miss Meadows, 2014). American Ultra is one of the few that directly dare to put insidious murder and light hearted comedy together. Jesse Eisenberg and Kirsten Stewart are given the arduous task of displaying witty humor in the most serious of dramatic obliterations of people. What some audience members might believe to be distasteful making light of the sinister cold-blooded destruction and mayhem on the screen, others might consider to be a bold and risky effort on film to find comedy in the most dire of situations. Taking the movie title (American Ultra) to task which isn't the most marketable of movie titles and which may have been a poor effort to refer to some mysterious, secret American program such as the top secret British Ultra Program during World War II that sought to decode cyphers during the war. Some might debate whether or not some of the fighting scenes might have been better choreographed around Bourne Identity (2002) action, yet for others the more obscure, less precise fighting scenes might also reflect a more real life experience instead. But the end result of American Ultra hopefully for some is a movie that courageously takes a sinister, psychotic but oddly enough narcissistic buffoon villain along with a serious dramatic action plot and laid over the light-hearted romantic yearnings of a small town couple, the male character who is living unbeknownst to him with a very draconian but amazing unique secret. New director Nima Nourizadeh is able to hold the dark drama together with the comedy in creating a most difficult but exhilarating move experience.",American Ultra

There's no story, just based on one evening event that stretches as far as another day by adding brief oral flashbacks to match with the rest of the storyline. But the fact is it was a comedy version of 'Hitman'.The red band trailer I saw revealed many stuffs, but the movie still offered lots of variety from the different angles of the same stuffs. Jesse Eisenberg, I never expected him to play a character like this, he was good. But it was only a partial display, if there is a sequel, I expect that would be an uncompromised when it comes to the stunts and heroic adventure. Although I enjoyed the end credit animation.Kristen Stewart was just hanging around, though her character had potential to be a game changer, so let's hope the sequel strengthens that part. Yeah, I'm kind of certain about the follow-up after seeing this film's ending, if they don't consider to make one, that would be theirs great loss.

31,Floated2,Very bizarre and not comedic,3,30 April 2017,"American Ultra was a released and advertised as a type of stoner action-comedy, however it was not as comedic as lead to believe, but more so dramatic with plenty of violent action. Starring Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, playing a couple whom we are to believe everything is fine between them, turns out for the worst while watching this film. Topher Grace plays the lead antagonist and he wasn't as believable and, acted as if he was still on a sitcom. He was miscast and not intimidating as the character was intended to be.American Ultra is quite a bizarre and weirdly film, where not much is explained and what is occurring happen very quickly,and all at once. There are brief twists along the way but for the most part, the film isn't entertaining or interesting enough. The trailers lead it believe this was another stoner comedy like Pineapple Express, but it is far from it. It is more like Hesher (starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt) but not as good, or even slightly similar to the Bourne films (in terms of plot wise) but also not as good. This film tries being more dramatic and emotional than needed and with the writing not being as great, we don't sympathize for the characters as we probably are supposed to. It takes itself too serious and that is a flaw. Sure there are action sets including shootouts, and fights, and some of which are quite bloody and disturbing but it isn't very good.Overall, American Ultra is not what it seemed to be as advertised, and it is lacking in general entertainment. The plot line is quite clever but the execution isn't great, and with better ideas, this movie could have been better and possibly a cult classic. Perhaps this film went through many edits and changes which is why the genres were somewhat all over the place.",American Ultra
32,eddie_baggins,A terrible mishmash of slacker comedy and action thriller,2,23 May 2016,"American Ultra badly wants you to like it, it badly wants to be cool and hip and in general it badly fails at being either a black comedy, a sufficient action film or in general a good feature length movie and by the time Nima Nourizadeh's (the mastermind behind Project X) film ends, you'll badly be wishing that you could've got your time back.Some strange hybrid of Pineapple Express slacker vibes and Jason Bourne action ticks, American Ultra certainly harbors the possibility of being a decent film but it's mishmash of genres never takes hold and for a film of this ilk, it's worryingly bereft of laughs and wit and its almost as though Nourizadeh knows it and tries to make up for it with a stunningly incompetent array of gore filled action scenes that feel neither warranted nor feature anything we haven't seen before, bar a spoon being used to de-throat a certain bad guy.Front and centre to this ill-conceived and in many ways nasty event is Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart who not only share a terrible on screen chemistry (which is strange considering their success in Adventureland) that's akin to pairing a plank of wood with a slab of concreate but share in portraying two unlikeable and seen before characters that do little to encourage audience investment.Eisenberg in particular needed his role as Lex Luther in Batman vs Superman to succeed more than ever as his recent diminishing returns have become quite worrying after great feats in both the Social Network and Zombieland and despite the recent The Double offering him a good crack at something interesting, a huge portion of his works of late have been anything but memorable. Meanwhile the frustration with Kristin ""lip biting"" Stewart continues and while she pops up in some fine productions her history of weak performances grows by the year, American Ultra's included.There will be some that find American Ultra's uneasy mix of social commentary, slacker vibes and gore filled violence appealing but for the majority, this will be a hard to tolerate experience that is neither as smart, funny or interesting as it thinks it is. A potential cult classic has therefore been lost in an abundance of missed opportunities and miscued ideas.1 spoon out of 5",American Ultra
33,leonblackwood,Decent concept but could have been much better! 4/10,4,10 January 2016,"Review: This movie had a decent concept but I personally think that the director picked the wrong actors to play the major roles. I've always thought that Jesse Eisenberg is one toned and he hasn't really got much screen charisma, so to pick him to play a super human, was a weird choice. As I didn't know anything about this film, I couldn't really see were it was going at the beginning but once it gets going I was surprised with the outcome. The movie is about a loving couple, Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) and Phoebe Larson (Kristen Stewart), who live in a small town in West Virginia. Whilst getting on with his day to day job in a convenience store, Mike is being watched by CIA Agent, Victoria (Connie Britton) as her rival, Adrian Yates (Topher Grace) plans to eliminate him because he is the sole survivor of her Ultra program. As Adrian's Tough Guy project was a success, Victoria gets demoted in her job and she goes out of her way to make sure that Mike is safe. She travels to West Virginia and she activates Mike by using a series of key words and while he's on his break, he sights 2 men planting something on his car so he uses his, unknown, skills to kill Adrian's henchmen. He then calls Phoebe in a panic because he has killed two individuals and when she arrives at the scene, they get arrested and taken to the local police station. Whilst locked up, Adrian sends out more henchmen to kill them but they manage to escape and they go to there friends house, Rose (John Leguizamo), who puts them in quarantine when he sees that they are wanted on TV. More of Adrian henchmen are sent to Roses house and they take out Rose and his friends and pump lethal gas into the quarantine room. When Phoebe saves Mike from the lethal gas, Mike starts to question her about her knowledge of the gas and she finally admits that she is a CIA agent, which leaves him heartbroken. When Adrian's henchmen ambush the couple, they capture Phoebe and leave Mike for dead but he is saved by Victoria and brought back to his house. Victoria tells him that he volunteered for the Ultra program, due to his criminal record and that he had his memory erased. Phoebe was only supposed to help him settle in West Virginia but she genuinely fell in love with him, so Mike goes on a mission to save her. After taking out most of Adrian's henchmen with fireworks, he finally gets to rescue his woman and he proposes to her on the spot. Victoria convinces her superiors to save Mike's life because he has shown that he is an valuable asset but Adrian is killed, due to his disobedience. Six months later, Mike and Phoebe are working together in the Philippines on an assignment and there love couldn't be any stronger. There are many different elements to the storyline but it just lacked wit and style. John Leguizamo was quite funny and Topher Grace played an convincing villain but the other characters were straight laced and they never brought originality to the project. The chemistry between Stewart and Eisenberg was believable and if it was an ordinary love story, they would have been the perfect choice but for an action movie, they just didn't fit the bill. Apart from that, it's a watchable film with some decent action scenes but it could have been much better. Average!Round-Up: Judging by the lose that this movie made at the box office, I doubt that were going to see a sequel anytime soon, which is a shame because the concept wasn't bad. Jesse Eisenberg, 32, has also been chosen to play Lex Luther in the latest Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice movie, which is also a weird choice and a bit out of his comfort zone, so I can't wait to see what they do with that. I'm looking forward to seeing Now You See Me 2 because I enjoyed the first movie, mainly because of the top class cast, so Jesse can put this movie down to a bad day at the office. This movie was directed by Nima Nourizadeh, 38, who also brought you Project X in 2012. It was written by Max Landis, 30, who also wrote Chronicle and Victor Frankenstein with Daniel Radcliffe and James McCavoy so he also can put this film firmly behind him. If they were thinking of making a sequel, they should think about using the budget to get some big names in the major roles because I personally think that, that was what let this movie down.Budget: $28million Worldwide Gross: $15.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/comedies starring Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Topher Grace, John Leguizamo and Bill Pullman. 4/10",American Ultra

The design is extremely stylish and even nobly unique, but underneath those flairs of fun is one of the most identity-confused films ever, a true mess of genres and tones that never quite finds its footing. The cool premise and individual moments of fun can't overcome how poorly executed the final product is. Ultimately, AU is proof that a mash-up of good scenes without a cohesive center does not a good movie make. Eisenberg and Stewart play a pot-loving couple who learn that their lives may be more than they seem as they run into trouble with the CIA. It's Pineapple Express meets Bourne, but can't decide which one it more wants to emulate. At both times absurdly funny and oddly sincere, all the performers seem to be in different movies. On the villain side, we've got Goggins giving a Joker-like performance as a darkly hilarious, mentally disturbed madman, while Grace seems to think he's still on a sitcom, delivering lines with off-putting snark. On the other end, Stewart and Eisenberg fumble between broad comedy and indie drama with little clarity or success blending the two. Not that it's devoid of laughs; it manages some humor when it focuses on the identity crisis of a slacker-turned-trained-killer. Unfortunately, our hero wasn't the only one trying to awkwardly discover himself; so was the movie.

Be warned though, the action is pretty violent and bloody, so don't get the idea that since it is comedic, you can take the kids to it because it is rated R. Jesse plays a stoner-he smokes lots of marijuana-that works in an all night grocery mart. He also likes to work on his hand made comic book, featuring his hero, Apollo Ape. Kristen is his live-in girlfriend that also likes to indulge in the herbal smoking on the side. Connie is a C.I.A. agent that had a secret operation involving Jesse as a highly trained sleeper agent, which of course Jesse had no idea about because the C.I.A. had brainwashed Jesse when they thought the program had failed, and then planted false memories into him. Topher is a new C.I.A. operative that wants to clean house and get rid of any old programs, including Jesse, and so he sends in agents to take Jesse out. That is when Jesse goes all Jason Bourne on everybody, using all kinds of skills that he did not even know he had. As the end credits start, there is an animated short involving Jesse's Apollo Ape character in action. It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence, language, drug use and sexual content- no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes.

Kristen Stewart plays his girlfriend phoebe and this is the best thing I've seen her do, maybe comedy is her fit and her chemistry with eisenberg is great. Topher grace is the bad guy in this film and he delivers a fun performance even though he is a bit cliché he definitely works for this film. John leguizamo was fun in this film and even though he is a little over the top he was fun to watch. Connie britton plays the person in charge of eisenberg and she does a decent job in this film. The story has a good love story and a great twist involving the two main characters. It is also fun to see eisenberg react to his situation. But there is some messiness in this film and you never really see eisenberg as a full on action star. The script has some great really funny dialogue that definitely made me laugh. But also the drama works and you buy there relationship together. The style has some good action scenes, especially one in a supermarket. But there isn't much that stands out opposed to films like pineapple express. Overall I really enjoyed this film and definitely think its worth a watch.",American Ultra
40,estebangonzalez10,Jason Bourne on drugs,6,10 December 2015,"""I think I'm that tree. And I think you're the car and I think I'm stopping you.""American Ultra is what you get when you combine any classic stoner comedy with The Bourne Identity. It is a hybrid of both genres which results in a fast paced action comedy. It is almost cartoonish at times despite trying to remain serious. There are scenes in this movie that reminded me of Pineapple Express because the action scenes are extremely violent at times, although the comedy is much more toned down here. The film never ceased to entertain me throughout its entire runtime, but at the same time I felt like the characters lacked a bit of personality and the story didn't offer much. The cast is extremely talented, but the fast paced action scenes don't give us time to center on the characters. I wouldn't rewatch this film, but I still enjoyed it. American Ultra is Nima Nourizadeh's follow up to his directorial debut, Project X. The main reason I wanted to catch up with this film however, was because it was reuniting Kristen Stewart with Jesse Eisenberg after their wonderful collaboration together in Adventureland. I loved the two together and I was looking forward to seeing them play love interests once again. Perhaps I ended up enjoying this movie more than others because I like the two leads, but I wasn't even close to hating this. It does have several flaws, especially the decision to cast Topher Grace as the main villain because he is completely one dimensional. This isn't a film for everyone, especially if you're expecting a full blown out comedy because it is more of an action film that feels like a graphic novel adaptation at times. The plot revolves around a stoner, Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg), who doesn't seem to be going anywhere in life. He is waiting for the perfect moment to propose to his girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) who is the only person he cares for in the world. Mike isn't the brightest kid, but he has a good heart. It doesn't take long for us to realize that Mike has a special ability that he doesn't even know about. He has been part of a CIA experiment that has trained him to become an assassin. Now the people that made him want him dead. Adrian Yates (Topher Grace) orders his agents to terminate Mike after their experimentation with the Ultra program has been abandoned. His former trainee, Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton), decides to activate Mike so he can defend himself against the onslaught of agents that are coming after him. Now Mike inadvertently discovers his new set of found skills and uses them to protect himself and Phoebe from the people that want him gone. Walton Goggins, John Leguizamo, Bill Pullman, and Tony Hale have small roles in this film, but are always a delight to see. Neither of them stand out, but they each deliver in the few scenes they are given. Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg both play characters we've seen in the past and that we know they can play in their sleep so there isn't really anything new they bring to this film. If you're not a fan of these actors then skip this film, but if like me you enjoy them, then you won't be disappointed despite them not doing anything unique. Eisenberg has proved in the past that he can deliver stronger material (The Social Network) as well as Stewart (Clouds of Sil Maria), but here they seem to be in more comfortable territory and therefor don't bring anything unique. American Ultra benefits from an interesting story even though it doesn't live up to the initial setup. It starts off pretty strong, but ends up lacking a stronger finale. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",American Ultra
41,jimbo-53-186511,The Manchurian stoner....,5,25 April 2017,"Stoner and slacker Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) spends his days getting high and writing comic books, but what he doesn't realise is that he is actually a sleeper agent who was part of an experiment by the CIA. When Howell is targeted for elimination by the CIA, his handler Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) decides to 'activate' him much to the annoyance of her colleague Adrian Yates (Topher Grace). With the CIA and their top agents hunting him down, Howell must use all of his skills to the best of his ability in order to survive...American Ultra is a mishmash of films with elements of The Manchurian Candidate, The Bourne films and practically every stoner comedy in existence. With the right handling this could have been great, but it's all rather ho-hum to be honest...I'm not generally a huge fan of stoner type comedies because often they are rather lazy and repetitive (there are some exceptions such as Harold and Kumar), and in this respect American Ultra is fairly weak as well. The stoner dialogue between Eisenberg and Stewart is lazy and uninspired and pretty dull - there's only so many times that you can hear words 'Dude' and 'Man' in the same sentence before it starts to become irritating. I presume the stoner aspect of Howell's life is the 'comedy' aspect of the film, but to me none of it was funny and as I mentioned it was more annoying than anything.Even taking out all of the lame stoner dialogue and focus on the story itself then the film still isn't that great; for a start I found that a lot of things here weren't very well explained or didn't make much sense. For example Howell is a sleeper agent and the CIA have targeted him for elimination and this seems to be based on the fact that Howell wants to leave the area?? Now presumably the reason for this is that the CIA may be worried about losing him or perhaps they want to keep an eye on him in case he somehow regains his memory (this is all speculation as nothing is really explained). I just didn't understand why he needed to be killed? Even if he moved out of the area, what difference would it make to the CIA as Howell didn't know he was part of an experiment nor did he know anything about his past life. Alternatively, if they wanted Howell to remain in the area why not put a directive or program in place to suppress his desire to leave? I know I'm throwing up a lot of scenarios and problems, but when a narrative is as vague as this one it feels as though you have to work everything out for yourself...Still it isn't all bad Eisenberg and Stewart make a likable enough couple (even though the former is annoying and is basically the same as he is in every film). Stewart on the other hand is much better; her performance is more natural and believable and she does give the picture a slight lift - also to her credit she didn't annoy me anywhere near as much as Eisenberg. The supporting cast are all OK, but I can't imagine that this film will really be the high point of anyone's career. That said though, some of the action sequences are pretty good and the film has just about enough energy to make it watchable, but when the chips are down there aren't enough funny moments for the 'comedy' aspect of the film to work and the narrative is a little vague and isn't interesting enough to make it a particularly involving experience. It passes the time, but that's about it.",American Ultra
42,kirbylee70-599-526179,Surprise Performance,5,29 April 2016,"I have to say up front that I'm not a huge fan of Jesse Eisenberg. While I've enjoyed him in a few movies I find that most of the time I feel as if I'm watching the same character transposed from one film to another. There are several actors who have fallen prey to this problem and Eisenberg is just another to fall in with this group. But on rare occasion he acts differently and it is this that shows there is hope for him down the line. This movie falls into the mid-area between those two styles of performing.Eisenberg stars here as Mike Howell, a stoner employee at a local quickie mart with dreams of writing a comic book about a heroic monkey but little hope of a prosperous future. That all changes one evening when Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) shows up and says a few sentences to him. This has no apparent effect on him and Lasseter leaves.While on a break and stepping outside for a quick smoke, Mike sees two men tampering with his car. When he calls out for them to stop them pull guns and try to kill him. Suddenly slacker Mike knows how to not just defend himself but to take out the two would be assassins as well.Freaked out and with no clue what it happening Mike calls his girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) and tries to tell her what happened. She shows up and is just as startled as he is. As more people show up to take Mike out the pair are on the run with bits and pieces of Mike's mind coming back to him.It turns out Mike was one of the deadliest assassins ever, employed and created by a secret government agency. When he was deemed unstable a drug induced memory wipe was employed with trigger words to return those memories should the need arise. Now the agency has determined that he knows too much and is far too dangerous to leave be which explains the attempt on his life.As Mike and Phoebe make their way through the night, more attempts on his life are set in motion. Behind most of these is a paranoid head agent with his own issues as played by Topher Grace. It turns out Lasseter was an agent with a conscience who felt Mike didn't deserve this treatment. As his only ally the odds are stacked against them but then this is a movie so those odds aren't near as bad as you would think.Eisenberg actually does a decent job here, not relying on the whip snap style of dialogue that he employs in almost every role he has. While that works in some cases it doesn't always. Fortunately the director of the film didn't rely on that and brought something more out of him for the role of Mike. As with another Eisenberg film, THE END OF THE TOUR, when he doesn't rely on this he does a better job. It would be nice to see him not depend on it in the future.Stewart does exactly what I've come to expect of her in roles these days. Once again I've never found her style of acting to be believable and she doesn't disappoint here. The movie suffers from a lack of connection between the two lovebirds. She doesn't have to fall in love with all of her co-stars to make it seem that way but at least make those of us watching believe it.The movie does entertain of a certain level but at the same time should have been much better than the end result. The schizophrenic genre bending doesn't help at all. Is it a thriller? Is it a spy film? Is it a comedy? Is it social commentary? By the end of the film I still wasn't sure. It wasn't enough of any of these genres to qualify as one or another and at the same time didn't have enough of a singular identity of its own.I have no doubt that some will find a lot of humor in portions in the film to make them laugh while others will find enough action to satisfy those needs. That it was marketed as a comedy means anyone depending on that will be disappointed. Then again how does one market a movie that doesn't fall into any neat category? While it isn't a terrible movie it does lack in many ways. Perhaps it's good enough for an evening's viewing and for fans of both leads but it's not one that I'd add to my collection for keeps.",American Ultra
43,cekadah,Action packed chic-flic !,8,14 September 2015,"Here's the reason for my title. The main theme of this action story is - - - all Mike wants to do is to create the perfect moment to give an engagement ring to Phoebe, his girlfriend, and ask her to marry him! That's his sole ambition outside of drawing his monkey action cartoon book and hitting the weed.Unfortunately for him, his past life has been wiped from his memory by the CIA. He was trained to be the ultra fighting machine that can take down an entire swat team with a spoon, spatula, and frying pan! And he proves his worth by doing it to guard and save his girlfriend Phoebe when an incompetent CIA boss decides Mike needs to be eliminated and she becomes endangered to.This is a fun twist on the action genre of movie. There are no end of these super fighter nice guy movies, consider the Mission Impossible series, Furious series, Danny Trejo movies, etc. And now Jesse Eisenberg jumps onto the list and does a fairly good performance for this type of flick. It's fun and simple entertainment and one scene near the end will have you smiling and saying aaawwwwwwwwwwww! Check it out!",American Ultra
44,TdSmth5,Lazy filmmaking,5,22 November 2015,"The lovely Kristen Stewart with her awesome hair (Phoebe) is paired with the awful Eisenberg (Mike) who plays a junkie convenience store clerk with panic attacks. As they are about to leave for a vacation in Hawaii he gets anxious and won't leave.Meanwhile at the CIA the Ultra program is canceled and they decide to eliminate the assets. A secretive phone call forces the lovely Connie Britton (Victoria) to take action. She visits Mike and starts reciting some code. He doesn't understand any of it. Outside 2 guys are tinkering with his car. When they threaten him with guns, he snaps and butchers them.With Phoebe, who doesn't understand what is going on, they hide in his drug dealer's (Leguizamo in a funny role) home. The CIA meanwhile leaks a story to the press about a highly contagious disease being on the loose. And they send all sort of operatives to take out Mike. None of them succeed but the CIA captures Phoebe at some point. Meanwhile Victoria meets up with Mike again and comes clean about him being the result of a CIA experiment and he was the only successful specimen. With Phoebe the CIA decides to lure Mike.American Ultra wants to be an action comedy but it succeeds neither at being a comedy nor an action movie. It rarely is funny and while a few action scenes are neat, there are too few of those. At least there is one twist in the otherwise unremarkable story that ""borrows"" so much from the Bourne movies that it's downright uncomfortable and not funny at all. They could have done so much much more with the concept and the budget, instead botched it with lazy writing and execution and a lousy casting choice for the lead.",American Ultra
45,I_Ailurophile,What a mess,5,8 May 2021,"It tries too hard, and then it tries too little. It wants to be an action-comedy, but is so unbalanced that at any given time it is actually only one or the other. The production is slick - but maybe too much so for its own good. 'American Ultra' is an ultra big mess.There's quite the cast assembled here, all of whom have certainly proven their skills elsewhere. Jessie Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Topher Grace, Tony Hale, Bill Pullman, and even John Leguizamo are all here for the party, as well as a long list of supporting cast members who even in their small roles show their talents.The music is okay. Makeup is actually pretty outstanding, especially toward the end as the characters are bloodied and beaten. The picture mostly looks fine, from a technical standpoint. Effects are sufficient. Even at their most ridiculous, the action sequences are pretty exciting and done well. But the writing - oh, the writing.The lack of balance in the narrative is exemplified in each and every character, every setting, nearly every scene. Leguizamo overacts as Rose, a paranoid drug dealer who has his ear to the ground around town. The basement of his home contains a massive party room under black lights, and I think we're supposed to laugh at the bizarre appearance of Mike (Eisenberg) and Phoebe (Stewart) under those lights, but instead I can only respond with tired cynicism. We're supposed to accept that Topher Grace, in his eternally youthful and innocent appearance, is a ruthless, amoral CIA operative who will stop at nothing to kill Mike, but he can't sell it. He was miscast.Every code word and bit of spy babble a character utters is seemingly intended as parody, but it is so overwrought that it's boring. Even those supporting characters whose actors seem quite adept in their portrayals - unfortunately, those characters are so one-dimensional, given a single personality trait, that they become tiresome very quickly instead of interesting. And Mike, a super anxious stoner layabout - whether it's the fault of the director, the writer, or Eisenberg himself, his personality isn't funny, or sympathetic - only annoying.And one more time, to emphasize: 'American Ultra' just isn't funny. The comedy falls flat by itself. It falls flat during action scenes. That the action scenes are fun ultimately strikes me as a little unfortunate, just because this is the movie they somehow got inserted into. I'd like to see the climax play out in a different, better film.The one good thing I can say about this feature is that despite the generally dissatisfying writing, Eisenberg and Stewart are such good actors that they manage to make Mike and Phoebe's relationship the sole engaging aspect of the picture, especially after the exposition at the beginning. The turn in their relationship about halfway through, their resolve and loyalty as the climax approaches - hey, I like it! And the only scene in the entirety of 'American Ultra' that made me laugh comes in the form of a moment shared by Mike and Phoebe as the climax concludes.But if intermittent action and romance is all that this 98-minute action-comedy has going for it, something is very wrong.Even still - somehow all this makes sense when you stop and consider that this film was written by Max Landis. Had I known of his involvement before I started watching, I don't think I would have in the first place. But here we are.Sure, I've seen far worse movies, but all the same, I don't think I can recommend this one, truth be told. What it comes down to is that what 'American Ultra' incredulously manages to do well, we can find it in other movies. I'm frustrated and disappointed, because it's unfortunate that the hard work of those involved went to such waste. At least we can find the cast and crew in other movies, too.",American Ultra
46,questl-18592,American Plus Ultra!,6,1 March 2020,"This kinda caught me by surprise. Outside of The Social Network, I generally really don't like Eisenberg. Stewart I'd only really scene in Snow White and the Huntsman and she was blah in that and then obviously there's Twilight hanging over her head but people swear she's good. Oh, then there's Max Landis and how much I hate his hole thing as a stereotypical artist that thinks all of his ideas are better than anything else and people that don't appreciate them are just stupid. That and I don't generally love stoner movies.Despite ALL THAT! This was actually quite a bit of fun. It's definitely not perfect. There are some problems here. Plot conveniences, holes, logical nonsense. Eisenberg is downplaying his jittery, manic... Eisenberg-ness.Also, despite Landis's hissy fit about original content, this is basically the stones movie version of the TV show Chuck. But there's a reason Chuck was a success, it's a lot of fun. This is definitely worth a watch if there's the opportunity. Even if you're not a big fan of the parts and pieces, the whole is a lot of fun.",American Ultra
47,Amari-Sali,"American Ultra may appear like a simple Stoner Action/ Comedy film, but it does progressive get complex as time wears on.",8,20 August 2015,"This movie honestly was surprisingly good. To the point that most of the hate I usually have for Eisenberg, since he seems so pompous in 90% of his roles, has temporarily disappeared. For, like Stewart, we get showed that we cannot fully judge their talents by past characters, and their off-camera persona. But what really drove me to firmly place this in the ""Worth Seeing"" batch is that it hits all the things needed in a film. It is funny, without trying too hard; can get you emotionally invested, because it has lovable characters you want to root for; has a twist or two, which some may or may not guess; and it has a satisfying ending which leaves everything in a nice, neat little bow. Making it so that Adrian, as a character, might be the only true negative about the film since he sucks as a villain.",American Ultra
48,Seraphion,Interesting but went out cold enough,6,17 September 2015,"Mike Howell is a stoner in Lyman, Virginia, who often has panic attacks. He also can't really remember his past before he met his girlfriend Phoebe. Meanwhile in the CIA office Victoria Lasseter gets annoyed that her old program's asset is going to be terminated by her colleague Yates. After wrecking their plans to go abroad, Mike plans to propose to Phoebe using fireworks he buys from his drug dealer Rose. When he goes to work in the store, Lasseter visits Mike and utters the code word, activating Mike. But it seems that nothing happens to Mike so she leaves him regretful. Soon while making soup Mike sees two men messing around with his car. He goes to stop them but they come to him with knives. But Mike's instinctive training kicks in and he easily kills them with a spoon and taking their guns. Mike calls Phoebe horrified about it but the sheriff comes and arrests them.Yates gets news of his men's death and knows that Lasseter had activated Mike. He sends two of his best assets Laugher and Crane after Mike in prison. They wreck the place apart, killing the sheriff and his men. But Mike incapacitates both of them. Mike and Phoebe goes to Rose to hide, who has his paranoia kicks in with all the town being locked down. They see the TV news about Mike and Lasseter being searched by the government for a monkey virus outbreak. Rose doesn't want to turn Mike in but he believes the news and tells Mike to hide in another room. Yates finds Mike's location and sends more assets using gas. Mike was able to kill them but the gas kicks in on him. Phoebe struggles to keep him awake to prevent him dying. Mike pulls through but notices there's something wrong with Phoebe. She then admits she's CIA but tries to assure him her love is real. But Laugher comes back and crashes the car they're in. He then sets it on fire with Mike in it and brings Phoebe to Yates.After finding out about Yates' Tough Guy assets, Lasseter saves Mike and reveals to him about the Ultra project. Mike feels disappointed and goes back to his house. Lasseter convinces Mike to go and save Phoebe because her love for him is real. Soon Yates' men assaults the house but Mike again Mike kills them all. He goes storming the store's parking lot which has been turned into Yates' operating base. Yates sends all his Tough Guys after Mike but he easily defeats them. Yates brings Phoebe hostage but she frees herself from handcuffs. Lasseter comes and strangles Yates, but before he's dead, their superior Krueger comes and stops her. They later argue about Yates and Lasster's mistakes but Krueger kills Yates, deciding that his mistakes are worse. Lasseter convinces Krueger that Mike is an Ultra program success so some time later they make him an agent.The story seems interesting at first, it felt intriguing to see how a lame stoner can turn out to be brainwashed, memory wiped, hardly trained assassin who can turn anything into a weapon. Having watched similar based movies like Conspiracy Theory and The Manchurian Candidate, I felt curious of how such a theme commonly used for thrillers can be adapted into a stoner movie and adding more action into the whole genre. It turns out to be pretty good for some time. The movie did find some spots where it can insert the stoner comedy into the whole thing, mainly in contrasting Mike's reactions after his training kicks in time after time. But then the charm starts to wear off when the joke only uses the same formula over and over. Furthermore, The action side takes dominance over the movie as soon as the action pours in, leaving no room for inserted jokes to crack some laughs. Also the movie gets very predictable. With only a few characters as focus, Phoebe's revelation as a CIA handler didn't really surprise anyone since it's quite curious as why the movie put Kristen Stewart as a stoner's girlfriend.Then again the action side is indeed worthy of a good say. Although the scenes are too much Hollywood in taste, being so unbelievable and kind of forced into play, they're done very well and runs smoothly. The frying pan bullet bouncing makes the movie look cool enough. Yes, there's still that nagging about the action being so border-lining between raw and clumsy. The Max Goods fight scene really shows this point. But I think it came to Jesse Eisenberg's body not being accustomed to action roles.The acting overall is quite good, although all the cast members must have seen their own respective better performances. Jesse Eisenberg maintained his goofed and clumsy awkward character very well. Although he couldn't really handle action scenes. Kristen Stewart still retains her emotions from all those more active sequences from Twilight. Yet we have to admit the irony that despite gaining fame through the Twilight movies, this movie is where she appears more realistically bloodied. Having John Leguizamo, Topher Grace and Connie Britton nicely adds depth into the story also.A mere 6 out of 10 score is from me for American Ultra (2015). A recommendation only goes as a so-so say. It's quite entertaining but I'm sure you'll find better alternatives already.",American Ultra
49,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of American Ultra,5,29 August 2015,"August has arrived and I guess that means it's Jesse Eisenberg's turn to appear in a movie (remember 30 Minutes or Less?). He's a fast-talking, brilliantly smart aleck actor and if he had a decent script, you always wonder what this dude might be capable of. Take for instance his American Ultra (my latest review). It's ultra-violent, ultra-filthy, and ultra-preposterous. There's the compulsory premise of a guy with special skills, a lot of brute force, and dialogue about the Central Intelligence Agency (and such) that seems masqueraded with f-words instead of actual insight. In truth, ""J's"" magnificent turn in The Social Network now feels like it was eons ago. I wanted to wait for ""Ultra"" to bomb at the box office so I could back up that discerned dissertation.Touted as a stoner flick but coming off as nothing of the sort (only if you count the protagonist smoking a joint or two), featuring a bad guy who dies from a bullet that ricochets off a frying pan, and heralding the spoon as a modern day murder weapon, this 2015 release focuses on Mr. Mike Howell (Eisenberg). Mike's a loser with anxiety issues. He's also a long-haired nebbish that loves to get his weed-on. Finally, he works at a convenience store in Liman, West Virginia (a fictional town) and dates a spunky vixen who's clearly out of his league (Phoebe Larson played by a wooden Kristen Stewart). Mikey doesn't know it yet but a few years ago, he was trained by the boys at Langley to be a deadly killing machine. He was part of an experiment for bloke criminals on the verge of getting their third strike. When said experiment turns pale (cut to present day), everybody in the department flies from Virginia to its neighboring state to eliminate Howell. An activation then occurs in his head (by way of computer code) and walla, senses are enlighten, fists turn into fists of fury, and trigger fingers becomes happy happy happy. The agent who helps him fight off the CIA schleps who want him dead, is Victoria Lasseter (the always sexy Connie Britton).In terms of direction, Nima Nourizadeh (he shot the hyperactive, hand- held Project X) subjugates a certain unevenness while adding nothing really new to the action/comedy genre. I found myself not investing my time in the film's intricacies. I just waited impatiently for the next, habitual action set piece (what else was I gonna do, walk out?).Now as mentioned earlier, I wouldn't quite put ""Ultra"" in the category of Cheech & Chong. However, if you were under the influence of the almighty ganga, that might be the only way you could possibly think of it as a masterpiece. This is reheated and rehashed stuff, a shoot em-up schlock that barely redeems itself. Yeah there's the impressive cameo in veteran Bill Pullman (he plays a CIA superior named Raymond Kruger), a couple of nifty action sequences where the hero gives everyone the Liam Neeson treatment, and a speedy, new wave musical soundtrack accompanying plenty of impactful kills. But despite what some critics have noted, these proceedings aren't cult following material. Heck, I've already been to the Mountain State (the film's murky setting). I don't need to go back again because that's punishment enough.Bottom line: Eisenberg in the lead, deserves better material than this. I don't know him personally but he seems to have an actor's inferiority complex. In all sincerity, American Ultra barely heightens your senses with standard bone cracks, Ecstasy-laden scenic environments, and hazy butt kicking (you can't quite make out the fight scenes because it's always dark outside). And in between all the barbarous shenanigans, you feel bored not to mention disinterested. Just call it an ultraist ultimatum. The result: 2 stars.",American Ultra
50,Weirdling_Wolf,Stewart & Eisenberg are a B-movie marijuana made in heaven!,8,11 November 2021,"On paper, the titter-worthy concept of jittery Jesse Eisenberg playing a covert, highly-trained Kung Fu Wrecking Machine is an undeniably comical one, and, happily, 'American Ultra' noisily makes the most of this garish incongruity. As an ardent 'Cheech and Chong' fan, I still maintain a healthy interest in THC-addled anti-heroes, and Jessie Eisenberg's muddle-headed misfit Mike Howell makes for an engagingly brain-frizzled, plaid-shirted, permanently baked buffoon, who slovenly disguises his seriously savage set of combat skills behind a disarmingly shaggy veneer of Eddie Vedder grunginess, witheringly lightning-swift reflexes, and a fearsome physical dexterity that includes an inventive, death-dealing ability to turn seemingly benign domestic implements into crudely effective weapons, in Mike's steely, tobacco-stained hands even a paltry teaspoon can horrifically herald an especially grisly doom for any poor wretch that uncomfortably finds themselves gorily speared upon the angry end of said outwardly innocent-looking crockery!There is a pleasingly gaudy unreality to 'American Ultra' that I found immensely satisfying, the preternaturally drab late-night convenience store Mike 'works' at has an eerily deserted, Stephen King-esque demeanour, and I get the strong impression that the only customer he has ever served is the demonstratively anxious Government agent (Connie Britton) that clumsily activates Mike's previously dormant ability to auspiciously Van Dammage all that deign to tarry unadvisedly in his volatile proximity! The set-up is simplicity itself, Mike & Phoebe Larson (Kristen Stewart) are the adorably fuzzy-wuzzy stoner couple whose Ganja-garlanded bliss is royally fubar'd by the murderous machinations of a malevolent mob of black-hatted assassins, which forms the exhilaratingly bloody catalyst for the blackly funny, graphically violent, bonged-out Bourne buffoonery! Subtlety is resolutely not American Ultra's strong point, and like any hyperbolically-inclined, bullet-blasted actioner, a generous suspension of disbelief is absolutely essential, and there is a thrillingly kinetic, brashly cartoonish quality which suited the film's hyperreal milieu, while this isn't exactly 'The Manchurian Candidate' for the 'Ghost World' generation, it is quite frequently a delightfully dumb, hugely fun, brain-fried good time! And I must say, that the bizarrely earnest scene wherein the understandably discombobulated Mike ingenuously asks his no less beleaguered girlfriend Phoebe if he was a robot genuinely cracked me up!

52,brando647,"A Fun, Flawed, Underrated Action Film with Unlikely Heroes",8,12 May 2016,"American ULTRA is not only one of the most underrated films of 2015 but one of the most unjustifiably detested as well. It was far from perfect, but was it bad enough to warrant a meager 43% score on Rotten Tomatoes? I don't think so. Some of the dialogue landed with a thud and Walton Goggins could've toned it down a bit, but otherwise American ULTRA was a pretty slick little action film. In a year full of spy films, most will forget this little tale of the CIA and experiments gone wrong. Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) is a pothead living in rural West Virginia with his longtime girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart). He enjoys a peaceful life of smoking weed and working nights at the local general store and his only concerns are the occasional harassment from the local sheriff and crippling panic attacks whenever he tries to leave town. What Mike doesn't know (or, more accurately, doesn't remember) is that he was once part of an experiment with the CIA where he was trained to be the perfect assassin. When the program started showing adverse mental effects on the subjects, the project was closed and Mike, the most successful of the test subjects, had his memory wiped and was given his new life. But now a young CIA upstart (Topher Grace) sees his chance to make a name for himself in the agency and begins a new operation using his own trained killers to eliminate the remnants of the old program.including Mike. It'd be an easy enough mission, if someone hadn't activated Mike's programming to give him a fighting chance.American ULTRA had been advertised as a stoner comedy, which was pretty deceiving. This is an action film with an equal balance of dramatic and comedic elements. There are few beats meant to get the audience chuckling but all of them are in the promotional materials, giving the impression this is more HALF BAKED than Jason Bourne. In reality, it's somewhere in the middle of that spectrum. And when you approach it from that angle, it's a pretty fun movie. It's a quick and easy 95 minutes that flies by at a sharp pace. The movie is pretty much in gear from the moment it begins, slowing down for a few brief moments to build on the relationship between Mike and Phoebe. I've seen this movie two or three times now and I haven't been bored yet. On the contrary, I dig it. Jesse Eisenberg is admittedly a strange choice of action star, but it works because Mike isn't supposed to be your average action hero. He's not supposed to be much to look at; as far as we (and he) are concerned, he's just a stoner who draws comics on the long, lonely nights sitting behind a cash register. Eisenberg works for the character because he can do neurotic incredibly well. When Mike starts slaughtering would-be killers with whatever mundane he's got handy, it's just as shocking to himself as it is to them. He has no idea what's happening; one minute he's straightening shelves, the next he's assaulted by a couple of men and he's jamming a spoon into one's neck with skills he's unaware he even has. With this disconnect and the resulting confusion, it's right in Eisenberg's wheelhouse and he rocks it. He's also got fantastic chemistry with Kristen StewartIn fact, I'll come out and share my opinion that this is probably one of Stewart's best roles. I made a point of avoiding the TWILIGHT series so I've only really seen her perform as Joan Jett in THE RUNAWAYS and Snow White in SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN, and I've never shared the contempt most people have for her. I think she's got some skill and I've never seen her as good as she is in American ULTRA. Now, there's a ""big reveal"" halfway into the film that's a little hard to swallow but, for all of her interactions with Eisenberg and Topher Grace, I loved her. While Eisenberg and Stewart are a perfect pair of heroes, our villains aren't as strong. Topher Grace does really well at portraying smarmy and conniving and his character Yates is both of these things, but he's also too immature for me to believe he would've been promoted as far as he had and been given the opportunity to institute his own crazy operation. I loved his bickering with Stewart and some of his tantrums were amusing but whenever he tried to come across as threatening, he flat-lined. Walton Goggins is the other big baddie of the film as the only CIA super soldier worthy of remembering, Laugher. I love Goggins and it's great to see him in anything, but I hate Laugher's trademark forced hyena laugh with a passion. He's much better later in the film when he brings the craziness down a few pegs and his character starts coming to his senses a bit; I loved the final moments in the last battle between Mike and Laugher, almost as much as I loved this exchange earlier in the film when Laugher is preparing to set fire to a car that Mike's trapped inside:Mike: (yells from inside car) ""I hate you!"" Laugher: (pauses in dumping gasoline on car to yell back): ""Well, I f***in' hate you too, man!""It's simple and stupid but it gets a laugh from me. There are a lot of little moments like that where humor peaks through the carnage. John Leguizamo has a small role as Mike's drug dealer that's good for some laughs and Mike's own naivety provides him with some good material. It's a perfect blend, really. I'm disappointed to see the lukewarm-to-cold response American ULTRA received. If you haven't seen it yet, I'm giving it a recommend. I think it's worth it and it might surprise you.",American Ultra

54,Screen_Blitz,Completely misleading action comedy that should have been better,5,21 November 2015,"From the brilliant director Nima Nourizadeh who brought us the wildly entertaining teen comedy 'Project X', comes a seemingly hilarious stoner action comedy set in the realm of ""Bourne Identity meets Pineapple Express"". Written by Max Landis, this brutally violent action comedy blends a less-than-tender mix of Kill Bill-style violence and dark humor; the shortage of nuance and good laughter make for comedy that has little to satisfy, though there are some clever moments at hand. While it is not hard to tell what director Nima Nourizadeh is going for here, the film feels a bit misguided in terms of execution and writing. Eisenberg plays Mike Howell, a small-town potsmoker with nothing going on life other than his job at the a local convenience store ad his girlfriend Phoebe (played by Kristen Stewart) who he hopes to marry soon. When Howell is marked by CIA agent Adrian Yates (played by Topher Grace) to be terminated, he learns that he has secret fighting abilities when he kills three CIA agents who try out to kill him outside the convenience store. Mike and Phoebe are then on the run from the CIA, with the help of Agent Victoria Lasseter (played by Connie Britton) as they fend off against ruthless, gun-totting agents that try to kill them in a violent gun-shooting mayhem.The trailer for this movie almost entirely misleads viewers into thinking this as laugh-out stoner comedy with its use of short comedic one- liners and David Guetta's pop song 'Hey Mama', when this film turns out be dark and extremely violent actioner with just occasional pinches of humor here and there. This movie is nowhere near as humorous as the trailer makes it out to be. As a straight-up no-brainer action flick, this film does an okay (if not great) deal but as an action comedy, falls somewhat flat. What this film fails to do is evenly balance its hyper kinetic action with its humor, and the result is a mean-spirited comedy with short substance. There are few hilarious lines of dialogue by Jesse Eisenberg and Topher Grace, and the romantic chemistry between Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart that works surprisingly well enough keep viewers rooting for them at every turn, even though they shared romance in Greg Mottola's 2009 film 'Adventureland'. The action scenes featuring loads of frenetic gunfights with the results of frequent blood spurting and Eisenberg's bloody and dirt-ridden face are quite entertaining to watch, even they get little brutal at times. The humor, however, is the film's biggest weakspot and could have been much better. The main problem is that the film can't seem to find a cogent balance between it's R-rated brutality and darkly humorous atmosphere as the filmmaker's use of over-the-top violence gloss heavily over the humor.American Ultra is very so-so comedy that will certainly not appeal to every comedy fans, or all those who are fans of the talented cast. While this film was far from what I expected it to be nor was it particularly funny for that matter, its passable.",American Ultra
55,Troy_Campbell,Craziest film of 2015,7,9 September 2015,"This stoner action-comedy is completely bonkers. As soon as it opens on a bloody and bruised Jesse Eisenberg, then suddenly whips us back to where it all began via a loud, rapidly edited, and in-reverse montage of the entire story, it's evident this movie is operating on its own terms. It won't be to everyone's liking, however director Nima Nourizadeh obviously doesn't care. He unleashes a gamut of over-stylised flourishes that are nothing if not interesting, giving your senses an onslaught of vivid images and rocking tunes. The action sequences are surprisingly thrilling too; the supermarket finale – boasting an excellent long take tracking shot – is a gloriously excessive blood bath that somehow walks the tight rope of being cool and taking the mickey. Speaking of balancing acts, the plot zigzags competently between juvenile humour and Bourne-esque adventure thanks to a confident Max Landis script, but there's a pervading whiff of Tarantino-mimicry throughout. Eisenberg is in fine form as weed-loving nice guy Mike who, unbeknownst to him, happens to be a dormant CIA killing machine, whilst Kristen Stewart is similarly awesome as Mike's long suffering but highly patient girlfriend Phoebe. The supporting cast is a mixed bag though: John Leguizamo's colourful drug-dealer and Walton Goggins' unrestrained assassin add flavour, but Connie Britton's righteous CIA agent and Topher Grace's douche-bag villain fall flat. From the hyper-energetic direction and twisty turny narrative to the over the top characters and stoner-philosophical dialogue, American Ultra is possibly the craziest, and oddest, film of the year.",American Ultra
56,leftbanker-1,TSTCW = Too Stupid to Continue Watching,1,28 March 2020,"Killing and murder are so fun and campy, just like a ride in an amusement park, but not a good amusement park, but one of those sad little ones that set up on the outskirts of small towns and have scary people that run them, folks who are probably on parole or have warrants out for them. That kind of funThis may have made for a decent film, but not in this moronic cartoon version. Imagine this story without the way-over-the-top violence-if you are able-and it could have been something worthy of an adult audience. It could have been cool. Instead, it was completely stupid at almost every turn.Since it has an R rating, I'm assuming that the target audience isn't 12-year-old boys, that seems to be the age of the writer. Why do I think that the writer is 12? Because he thinks that if you one bullet, that is action, so if you shoot a few hundred bullets it's more action, action-packed. He doesn't seem to realize that the objective with shooting bullets is to hit people with the bullets. In several scenes people are shooting lots and lots of bullets without really trying to shoot anyone.Once again, you get the feeling that the writer has done nothing in life except watch movies and has no experience to draw on for creativity except crap from other movies. Bourne Identity mixed with every idiotic, post Tarantino shoot'em up.",American Ultra
57,btreakle,American Ultra,8,2 May 2020,This is a pretty good movie Kristen Stewart Jesse Eisenberg. now true given the size of these two individuals for little far-fetched for them to be CIA agents. but they did an excellent job and I recommend this movie,American Ultra
58,pyrocitor,Bourne to run,7,5 September 2015,"Stop me if you've heard this one: a whimsically hipster romantic comedy about the relationship between an anxiety-riddled, stoner, plaid-wearing, aspiring comic book artist deadbeat (Jesse Eisenberg) and his spunky, hip, plaid-wearing manic pixie dream girl girlfriend (Kristen Stewart), who he spends the film doting after and attempting to live up to. If you're barely suppressing vomit after that sentence alone, fear not: not only are you in good company, but it gets better. Smug as he may be, Chronicle scribe/occasional insufferable vlogger Max Landis is too clever to cave to rote cliché. And while the ensuing romp of 'unexpected sleeper agent with extraordinary powers is Bourne and must rebel against corrupt government organization' might be mighty familiar, Landis and director Nima Nourizadeh keep things fun and character-driven enough to propel their way through, admittably in a somewhat tonally clumsy fashion. All the while, there's just enough of a bizarre, quirky streak to keep the proceedings both light on their feet and unexpected (Eisenberg's character's dumbfounded train of thought ramblings feel unexpectedly genuine, as well as always good for a laugh - ""I could name you every kind of tank. I don't know a thing about tanks, but I could name you literally 47 kinds of tanks right now. ...do you think I might be a killer robot?""). It's all a bit of fantasy wish-fulfillment for the disenfranchised slacker-nerd in all of us(nothing new there), but, taken for what it is, it's surprising fun. The bricolage-driven action sequences are gruesome and exhilarating in equal measures, but the true heart of the film lies - hear me out - in its core romance. An oddity in that, for all its trappings, it feels surprisingly tender, heartfelt, and sweet (complete with the most hilariously adorable cinematic proposal scene in recent memory), Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart share an intimately lackadaisical chemistry which is oddly arresting, plaid and all. Eisenberg, back in Zombieland mode, convinces in his bone-crunching brawling as much as his neurotic, drug-addled motormouthing, while Stewart impressively sells a character whose initial artificialities are ironed out through a decent twist, is uncharacteristically emotive and charismatic here, as well as stealing her own fair share of laughs and action beats. Irritating as they may occasionally be, the two are hard not to root for as everything dissolves into blood and explosions around them.Supporting them, Topher Grace, now firmly cementing character actor status, has a ball stomping around and petulantly screaming out colourfully degrading one-liners as a fussy bureaucrat whose motivations are scarcely explained but seldom matter. Connie Britton is both convincingly earnest and funny in her own right as a strangely maternal government agent, while it's a delight to see Arrested Development star Tony Hale bagging laughs as a perennially flustered government techie, even if John Leguizamo's swag-talking Hispanic gangsta feels a bit too stale to command many laughs (shades of - shudder - Ant-Man). The best part of the film, though: the closing credits, where Eisenberg's comic book, Apollo Ape, comes alive in a ferociously hyperviolent, surrealist, brilliantly animated, Gorrillaz-style spy caper. It's a shame the rest of the film only flirts with such demented madness, or American Ultra might have proved the breakout spy-romance-comedy-action-thriller to beat. As it is, clumsy and somewhat familiar as it is, the film is still full of fun and surprises enough to be worth checking out, if only to play 'I spy, with my little eye, Bill Pullman, who seems to think he's in a different movie'. Now that's funny. -7/10",American Ultra
59,chrichtonsworld,Maybe I missed something but wasn't this supposed to make me laugh. Even if it was just a little?,5,18 November 2015,The premise made it sound like this was going to be a comedic take on the Bourne franchise where screw up Mike Howell was going to be the sleeper agent who got activated. Naturally American Ultra was going to be full of action but where was the comedy? It was strangely absent. There were only a few actors who understood how to play their roles. John Leguizamo and Walton Goggins. Everybody else took the whole film far too seriously. I must admit that on occasions it worked but for the most part I was gasping for some fresh air and it never came. Most of the action was entertaining enough and amusing although I kept wondering why it mattered so much that Jesse Eisenberg's character was supposed to be a stoner. A big deal was made about this and I was kinda expecting something funny be done with this. I mean just look at Jesse Eisenberg. How could you ever take him seriously as an action hero? But luckily for us Kristen Stewart adds some spunk to this flick. I am not a huge fan but I really like her and it is because of her that the couple Mike and Phoebe was tolerable. Topher Grace as the villain is out of his league. It was almost embarrassing to watch him like this.I don't think this would be an entire waste of time. But if you were expecting to laugh like I did then you will be disappointed. People who love action and romance will find more to their liking.

65,bryank-04844,"'American Ultra' makes no sense, then again, it makes Perfect sense.",7,19 August 2015,"This late summer movie 'American Ultra' mixes a good stoner comedy with high octane action with a great cast and some decent laughs throughout. You can add to that a good amount of bloody violence in the second half of things. That all being said, 'American Ultra' seems to lose its steam far from the climax of the movie, and seems to just go through the motions until the end. Still, it's a fun popcorn film to end the summer on. Director Nima Nourizadeh, whose only previous film was the found footage party movie, 'Project X', leaves the hand-held camera on the table here, and delivers some decent long shots of violence and action, which is a step up in his career.Interestingly enough, 'American Ultra' is actually based on a real life program from the CIA back in the 50's, which was quite illegal, so if someone asks you if this movie is a true story, you can with good intentions say, 'Yes'. 'American Ultra' starts in rural West Virginia where Mike and Phoebe (Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart respectively) live their lives together a small house, where Mike works at a local market that only receives about two customers a week, and Phoebe works at a bail bond company. When not working, or even when they are on the job, the pair continuously smoke pot and discuss Mike's graphic novel he wants to make called 'Apollo Ape'.There tends to be some fun pot smoking jokes and references that should satisfy everyone, and we get a good glimpse at this duo's genuine and charming relationship, even though they think that smoking pot is the only real goal in life. Soon enough though, Mike is ""activated"" with a string of words and turns into a pot smoking 'James Bond', due to a high level CIA official named Yates (Topher Grace), wanting to kill and destroy all of the agents who were part of this illegal CIA program.Now the CIA is using their own agents to fight their own agents. None of it makes any sense, then again, all of it makes sense. Luckily, Mike and Phoebe have a little help from a field agent named Victoria (Connie Britton), who shows up at the right times, when all seems lost. Mike also has help from his drug dealing friend Rose (John Leguizamo), who is a very over-the-top drug dealer that hits on all of the trashy clichés. Even Walton Goggins shows up as a laughing maniacal killer who has no front teeth.The list goes on and on with these crazy characters, but it's best you just see for yourself. The best parts of 'American Ultra' lie within the charming relationship between Mike and Phoebe. Their dedication to their performances truly shines. The fight choreography is decent as well, and is very similar to the filmmaking style of the 'Kick-Ass' films. 'American Ultra' is a lot of fun, despite its flaws, but then again, this movie is all about laughing while watching a pothead use his '007' skills to take out a van full of bad guys, and that's exactly what you get here. Stay put for a fantastic animated end credit sequence.",American Ultra
66,bopdog,"Good trailer - awful movie; dim, depressing, lame",1,22 August 2015,"I sincerely think my dismal rating of this movie is more than just a mismatch in taste. The trailer looked good, actually. Kind of a whimsical ""out there"" dark comedy. Turns out the trailer was pretty much the whole movie - at least the good parts of the movie. I was up for it! I was let down, though.There was nothing funny - as far as I could tell (again, I'm being sincere), no jokes were even attempted. Seriously - those who have called it funny or a laugh riot leave me rather perplexed. I can only respond, assuming non-studio employees actually said that, with ""Really?"" The look of the movie was dim - and the settings were shabby to the point of being totally depressing.After the movie, on the drive home, I had the sense the creators of this film were probably shooting for a ""Bourne Identity"" thing. And that's OK! Lofty ambitions that turn out to be WAY out of reach are fine - laudable, in fact. We all need to dream, after all. You have to admire gumption. But there was nothing ""Bourne-ish"" about this save for a clumsy and thin attempt at some plot lines.I certainly wish the cast and crew better luck with their future projects. This, however, was awful, as my one star in the IMDb rating bar says. Not a swing and a miss, so to speak, but rather not even in the ballpark.",American Ultra
67,CANpatbuck3664,Tries to Be A Cross Between The Bourne Identity and Pineapple Express But It Falls Flat On Its Face,4,30 January 2016,"American Ultra opened against Hit-man 47 and Sinister 2 and it was there and gone just as quickly. Max Landis, the writer came out and criticized the movie going public for not watching original movies. As much as he would like that to be true, I don't think that was the reason American Ultra bombed. I think that real problem is that this move was an uneasy mix of genres combined with unlikable characters but what do I know.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* When we meet Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) he's locked in a cell. He's taken to interrogation and he's questioned about the days leading up to that day. Mike gets a quick flashback of some of the events in question and then the film rewinds to 3 days earlier. Mike works at a convenience store in Liman, West Virginia and he has a girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) who he plans to propose to. Although he loves her deeply, he's worried he's holding her back. He spends his days smoking pot, hanging with her, and working on his graphic novel about a space travelling ape. He even planned to take her on a special trip to Hawaii but he gets super anxious and had a panic attack leading them to cancel the trip.One night while working, a woman comes in and starts muttering incoherent phrases. We have learnt that her name is Victoria (Connie Britton) and she works with the CIA. She has recently had to give up her program which revolved around taking low level drug offenders and turning them into sleeper agents. The agent who took over her program Adrian (Topher Grace) belittles her and is arrogant because he believes that the modification that he has made to her plans have made them more effective. He wants to liquidate the failed assets (including Mike) which prompted Victoria to rush to Liman to try to save him. He doesn't activate though and she leaves disappointed. He then he hears a disturbance outside and snaps into action, killing the two assailants who were screwing with his car with a spoon. He freaks out then calling Phoebe to come help him.I'm surprised they went with Jesse Eisenberg as the lead. He can pass as a stoner but he wasn't believable as an action hero. He wasn't helped by the script or the dialogue but even then he wasn't all that impressive. I was surprised that Kristen Stewart was out-acting him. Her part was a little less fantastical but she does a better job selling it. She gets a bad rep because of the Twilight movies and as awful as those movies were, maybe it's time we give her another chance. When it comes to the supporting cast, I didn't like Topher Grace here. He's not a bad actor but I think he's yet to find his niche, he ends up in a lot of bad movies. Connie Britton was fine, John Leguizamo was a little off and Walton Goggins was completely wasted, he's a great character actor but he's given so little to do its sad.On the positive side, I didn't mind the action scenes, they weren't bad but they weren't anything special either. I say that because I found the rest of this movie to be pretty boring. The plot was different but it wasn't terribly interesting in the end. The movie could still have gotten past that but the other problem is that its so hard to root for Mike. He's such an idiot and even though Phoebe shares his interests, he doesn't deserve her. When he's not getting high, he's always having panic attacks or waffling under any kind of pressure. It was grating to watch and even though the movie get's a little better when he becomes activated, it was still too much to overcome.The cinematography is interesting at points and even though the plot isn't anything new, I will say that it's not completely formulaic. Despite that since the movie begins at the end and then rewinds, you do see what's going to happen and even if you didn't catch it completely, you will be able to guess the ending.This movie wants to be the new Pineapple Express really badly and it just can't match it on the comedy front. It isn't a ripoff, I'm not saying that but instead of mixing and matching movie genres I wish it had been more selective and developed the story more. I didn't even really get why Adrian and Victoria can't find common ground, they obviously have different ideas but Adrian is just a stereotypical entitled asshole whose motivation isn't really explored. Also why was it absolutely essential to kill Mike in the first place? He has no memory of the program and the only side effect was that he became anxious when he tried to leave town. He didn't even activate instantly when Victoria travelled out there. These questions are addressed but they aren't fully answered.I don't think the failures of this movie are anyone's fault specifically, it just didn't come together as it should have. I was pretty bored throughout, the action scenes while passable aren't crazy enough and the acting while decent couldn't elevate past the uninteresting characters. This movie didn't fail because it's not a superhero movie or because it's not a sequel to an already successful picture. It was just underwhelming pure and simple.",American Ultra
68,SquigglyCrunch,A Butt-Load of Fun with Some Great Characters Thrown In,9,18 May 2016,"American Ultra follows a stoner who, after being 'released' discovers that for some reason he has extensive knowledge about fighting. Meanwhile, a group from the CIA are attempting to murder him for a reason unbeknownst to him. I loved the crap out of this movie. The action was fantastic and fast-paced while still being somewhat realistic, the characters were goofy yet relatable and interesting, the humor is pretty spot-on, and it was just a blast. It's a pretty predictable movie, but it was so much fun that it's easy to ignore that. It actually didn't get in the way of how much I enjoyed the movie at all really, which I was surprised by. The actors were pretty fantastic. Jesse Eisenberg's flat face made the action just that much more fun to watch, and overall he just pulled off the character so perfectly. Kristen Stewart is great too, somewhat to my surprise. Some aspects of this movie weren't perfect, of course. Like I said, it's pretty predictable with a handful of clichés. But also, like I said it doesn't distract from the movie at all. There were a handful of issues with the consistency of the characters' abilities that were at times a bit lacking, but they were mostly fine. Not all the fights were great either, and I never felt worried for any of the characters. Despite liking them a lot the movie was predictable enough for me to know almost exactly how it'd turn out. There was one plot twist towards the end that didn't sit too well with me, but I got over it pretty quickly and it really didn't bother me by the end. Overall American Ultra is basically just a bucket overflowing with fun, but with enough heart and character to make it just that much easier to love. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",American Ultra

70,The_Light_Triton,Stoner Comedy meets Action Suspense.,9,21 August 2015,"When it comes to blending action with comedy, some films hit the mark (Lethal Weapon & Rush Hour) and others, don't (Paul Blart) but when you combine action/suspense with stoner comedy, then what leads is one of the most fun films you'll see this summer.Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) is an everyday small-town stoner, who works a bland job at a market, with the goal of marrying his girlfriend, Phoebe (Kirsten Stewart) but what he doesn't know, is that he's actually an experiment conducted by a CIA agent named Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) and that the CIA has put out a hit on him. With lots of time and money invested in Howell, Lasseter goes out to his little town and ""activates"" him, turning him into a stone-cold killer. But while he's the perfect killer, he's also a sweet guy who just wants to be with his girlfriend.First off, I want to say that this flick was funny as hell and chocked full of good action. I had a good time watching it and I was rooting for Mike all the way. But while this film is awesome, I have some complaints but i'll get to them after the pros.Jesse Eisenberg nails the role of stoner perfectly. He's a chilled out lovable guy who just wants to be with his girlfriend and a joint of marijuana. You want to climb into the screen and smoke a fat one with him. and you want to watch his back when he's surrounded by 6 assassins...not that he'd need you.Kirsten Stewart might be known best for her role in Twilight and of course we all know how much those stories mean to single women who spend a lot of time writing fanfictions inspired from a Danielle Steel paperback, but here, she's actually not that bad. She needs to do more comedy cause she works well as the ""straight man"" or woman in this case. Although she might be typecast for romance films, maybe someone like Ellen Page or Kaya Scodelario would've been a better Phoebe, but hey, it's Kirsten Stewart. can't change it now.Connie Britton fits her role well too. It's almost like watching Colonel Trautman with Rambo from First blood, assuming Mike Howell is John Rambo.OK, now the complaints. first, the obvious. The shaky camera....Hollywood, get it through your thick dumb skulls; We HATE shaky cameras during fight scenes. It doesn't make the scene more exciting or interactive, it just makes the fighting hard to see. Enough already!John Leguizamo. The guy is awesome, one of my personal favorite actors and half the reason I came to see this movie. And they gave him the persona of a wigga. Really? This guy was Benny Blanco from the Bronx and Luigi Mario...OK, maybe that wasn't his shining role as Luigi but he should've at least gotten more screen time. Overall, I totally recommend this film, but maybe you should get baked before going to see it. Or at least get baked for the ending. 9/10",American Ultra
71,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Alright, but not anything special",6,8 September 2015,"Jesse Eisenberg is the unlikely star in American Ultra, and while he and his leading lady Kristen Stewart do their best, the script isn't enough to make the film more than okay.Mike Howell is a diminutive stoner who, when not working at the local Cash and Carry, spends his time doodling and daydreaming. His girlfriend Phoebe takes care of him, but not for long because Mike is sleeper asset who is unknowingly activated when he is marked by the government for termination.The idea or goal for the fun of American Ultra is watching a stoner buddy flip a switch and go 007 on the baddies. And, there are those moments, nearly all of which are featured in the trailer for the film. The other part of the fun is the unlikeliest of actors playing a special agent, and he does a masterful job of kicking some serious ass in unique manners.A film needs a story, of course, it can't just be smoking weed and blowing stuff up, but half way through the film it shifts focus far too much to the narrative groundwork and loses the fun. In that regard, it is far inferior to the peers it hopes to emulate, like Pineapple Express. American Ultra is a bit too serious at times, a bit too covert operations, and not enough comedy.American Ultra is fine for a one time watch with your pals, especially if they bring with them some green. Regardless, it will be quickly forgotten among the myriad films released year after year.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",American Ultra

73,ericrnolan,"A short review of ""American Ultra"" (2015)",7,2 October 2015,"The Manchurian candidate is a common trope. A Manchurian candidate hidden within a neurotic, drug addled, underachieving comic book creator is actually pretty creative.That's just one of the reasons that ""American Ultra"" (2015) had the makings of a great movie. This film has more going for it too. The soft spoken Jesse Eisenberg is extremely talented, being both quite funny and bizarrely likable in the role. Kristen Stewart is also just great. (I haven't seen her in the ""Twilight"" films that made her famous/infamous, but she really impressed me as a child actress in 2002's terrific ""Panic Room."") And, like Eisenberg, Connie Britton has perfect comic timing and delivery. (I'm still smiling at her offhand ""Hey!"" to the guy in the barn.)Regrettably, maybe just past the halfway mark, this film loses its way just a bit. The humor stops being character- and dialogue- driven, and the fish-out-of-water comedy sort of segues into a generic (and not terribly well executed) action –thriller. There are some half- hearted action set pieces that aren't especially well staged, or even well conceptualized. And precisely nobody acts as though they have any sort of government or military training — either conventional or subliminally hidden. Does EVERYONE in Hollywood movies ALWAYS cluster together in a clear field of fire without seeking cover?There is another miscalculation, too, that makes ""American Ultra"" less than great. Our bad guys are cartoonish. Eisenberg's pursuers turn out to be (sigh) former mental patients who have received the same mental conditioning. One is code-named ""Laugher"" because he cackles hysterically. (That's something out of a mediocre comic book.) And, like everyone's least favorite Spiderman movie from the 2000's, Topher Grace is cast against type as a raging psychotic. (Am I the only one who thinks he was far funnier as the mild- mannered, relatable everyteen in ""That 70's Show?"")How much funnier would this movie have been overall if Eisenberg's quirky antihero (and maybe his weird friends) were the only comedic characters? What if all their antagonists were ""straight men"" characters who ironically struggled in vain to defeat them? This film could have been a classic.Oh, well. I still liked this well enough. I'd give it a 7 out of 10.",American Ultra
74,scottshak_111,"High on dope, low on substance",6,17 May 2016,"Watching American Ultra was like reading a comic book. Not a really good one though. The average sorts. It was fun whilst it lasted.As we take the reins of the joy ride, we find characters reeking of normalcy in the starting bit, if we overlook the battered protagonist in the prologue for a second. We think everything is going fine then boom comes the jackhammer, and the story takes a colossal twist. It unfurls into a bigger plot that tells you that you have been looking at it all wrong. Comical factors pop in and you at once understand, ""Oh! So it is going to pitter-patter like that."" You switch that mode on overlooking everything then, all the elements that constitute to form a good movie. Yes, it isn't a good movie.There is some humour in the movie, yes. They try to make you laugh with some extraordinary characters like John Leguizamo's Rose which was brilliant. Topher Grace is great as Adrian Yates. Laugher tries to enter the theatrical juncture only to compel you into hating him more. Jesse Eisenberg is exceptional as Mike Howell. You couldn't have found a better actor to play the confused Mike. Good job there! Comes with a pretty nonsensical clichéd concept of turning an agent with a code word, which we have seen many times in a bad Disney movie, this one started heading towards disaster right then and thereon. The music further broils it further by going into juvenile trenches with upbeats trying to rescue the flick whenever action came. Editing was, well okay, as it focused on dire elements alone, and decided not to bore you with a constant adrenaline.The chemistry Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg try to weave with this was good though. It keeps you engaged. With all the cheesy dialogues and stupid gore you still manage to rivet yourself to your seats. Max Landis doesn't go original with the writing, and it ends up like a clichéd tale which is good only for one-time watching.",American Ultra
75,Ramascreen,American ULTRA rocks my socks off!,9,19 August 2015,"In the words of ""SouthPark""s Towelie, 'You wanna get high?' Yes, I do want to get high on Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg, cinema's most awesome couple this year in American Ultra a movie that rocks my socks off. No better way to describe it than if Jason Bourne was a stoner.Scripted by Max Landis who gave us ""Chronicle"" and directed by Nima Nourizadeh who gave us ""Project X,"" basically anything that could ever happen, happens in ""American Ultra."" From explosions and firepower, mental patients trained as killing machines, a young power-hungry CIA desk jockey who thinks he knows what's best for the agency, John Leguizamo, all the way to an irresistible beautiful but bloodied love story, this movie has it all, well.. except for ghosts, demons and the usual suspects, you catch my drift. To me, ""American Ultra"" brings that same fun that flicks like ""Zombieland"" and ""Shoot 'Em Up"" gave us, where you just want to see cool things happening all the time. And the story and the characters are still there, they're not neglected at all. The action sequences are elaborate and they serve to speak about the characters rather than the other way around. And let's face it, everyone of us has that switch in us that turns on whenever we watch somebody with a set of particular skills be both hardcore and vulnerable.Jessie Eisenberg plays Mike Howell, a convenient store worker who at first seems insecure, he gets panic attacks, at times he can feel paranoid and extremely apologetic, he's in a long-time relationship with Kristen Stewart's character, Phoebe, in this small town USA, a place that's usually ignored or overlooked on the map. Meanwhile at Langley, an order has been activated by Topher Grace's character, Adrian Yates, to eliminate agent Howell, an order that's not taken well by Howell's former boss, Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) who's determined to help Howell. Basically if you've seen spy thriller movies, shows, or read spy thriller books about people trained to become intelligence assets since they were very young, you'll come to understand how this character Howell came to be. This lethal sleeper agent whose memories were erased, would have to summon back his inner skills in order to survive and save his girlfriend.Obviously, this isn't Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart's first rodeo together, you can see how effortless it is the dynamic between the two, such ease, so in sync, they can read and understand each other very well. And because of that, there's something real about their characters' relationship. The film's fast-paced and high-octane energy keep you alert and anticipating. Not a single boring moment. I also have to give credit to Topher Grace who plays the villain, he's like a little brat demanding respect who he doesn't deserve and Grace plays it perfectly. The movie is also the perfect blend of action and comedy, I personally think it's way funnier than ""Pineapple Express"" if you want to go there for comparison. So add ""American Ultra"" to your list of Saturday night popcorn movies, I guarantee you won't regret it.",American Ultra
76,solidabs,Decent,8,10 October 2020,Good solid movie. This movie is funny as hell. I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. Goggins was excellent as always. Topher nooo not for that part. But I liked it.,American Ultra
77,jmoneyjohal,"A stoner comedy with, a good of action and romance. Illogical but entertaining.",6,4 September 2015,"After watching the trailer of American Ultra it seemed like to me ""oh here comes another crazy illogical stoner comedy"", but thankfully the film turned out to be a little better then just another stoner comedy. I mean its attempts to be a poor mans Kingsman, with whole CIA story and slick action which doesn't have much impact till the well done pre climax. But where the film does succeed with flying colours is in romcom portions, the leads chemistry is very good, the whole love story is very fresh, and novel. And honestly I cant complain much because I was entertained throughout.Story wise the film is about a stoner boy named Mike and his stoner girlfriend Phoebe. Mikes life is pretty much perfect in his eyes he has the girl of his dreams, and he doesn't need much more either, other than drugs. But then suddenly his life takes a turn when the CIA want to stop an old operation that involved Mike, and Mike knows nothing about him being in the CIA because he cant remember much of his past life. Soon the CIA is sending people to kill Mike, without knowing much a CIA leader, a women who is trying to protect Mike, a women who Mike doesn't know says a few weird words to him,and he suddenly becomes a killing machine. Does Mike get away from the CIA, and why is the CIA really after mike is what the rest of the plot is about.Acting wise Jesse Eidenberg surprised me I didn't think he would be able to pull of action scenes with ease but he did, Eidenberg did a very good job in his role.Kristina Stewart was good and looked really cute. Topher Grace, was great in his annoying role.Connie Britton was aptAmerican Ultra in my opinion tried to bite on more than it could chew. The whole CIA angle though the most crucial part of the film, was a half baked story. Like why would all of the CIA be after one boy. But I mean its a stoner comedy/ action film so you cant except too much logic.Bu I must say the pre climax action scenes did impress me, I loved the gory action.Overall much logic was not excepted in this stoner comedy, and thats what you get. But with some good action, and good chemistry from the leads this film is definitely a one time watch. Its a film you just relax and watch don't use your brain too much.3.25/5* or 6.5/10",American Ultra
78,ayoreinf,A Satirical parody,8,28 May 2017,"Saw it last night on TV, and it did make me think. The plot is obviously silly and filled with huge holes and contradictions. But this is part of the territory of the sub-genre it so evidently parodies. That is the secret agent who was trained into a super human killing machine, combined with the damaged start. In a way it's a satirical version of La Femme Nikita, with hints toward Jason Bourne and The Long Kiss Goodnight.So, that's what the movie parodies, but if it didn't have any satirical aim, the whole thing would've been a waste of time money and talent, and if one misses the satire, that what one is left with. Well I find it to be a rather pointed satire of the Bureaucratic new attitude to spying, in which people are assets and life or death are simple side effects of managerial decision.The entire thing is a very tricky combination, since the plot is riddled with problems, as I already mentioned. But Jesse Eisenberg delivers a fantastic performance as the stoner who's a killing machine and doesn't know it. Topher Grace is also brilliant as a bureaucrat who got promoted into a position of power he doesn't understand, and still looks at the world as one big administrative system which bureaucracy can control and manage. The others perform their roles all right, but without Eisenberg and Grace the whole construction crumbles as a house of cards. With the two of them it's a fairly enjoyable experience.",American Ultra
79,luke-a-mcgowan,An interesting blend of concepts and genres,7,2 December 2015,"I can't believe I'm about to say this, but American Ultra wouldn't have been half as effective if they hadn't put the ""sleeper agent"" concept in a stoner setting.Jessie Eisenberg stars as Mike, a stoner who suffers from crippling panic attacks whenever he tries to leave town. Its quickly revealed that he's actually a sleeper agent who is kept in his quiet little town because he poses a security threat. Eisenberg is a solid lead who convincingly plays a stoner but is surprisingly good in action scenes too. Its very reminiscent of Zombieland. Kristen Stewart is Mike's girlfriend, and I can't believe it, but she's great. There's a well written scene early on that starts as a stoner scene where the two of them share stoner dialogue but it quickly becomes a surprisingly beautiful metaphor for their relationship. Early on we start rooting for those two crazy kids to work it out, in spite of a terrific twist regarding their relationship about halfway through.The second big plot point is a CIA rivalry between Topher Grace's Yates and Connie Britton's Lasseter. Lasseter created Mike under her program, which was shut down and replaced by Yates'. The powers that be decide that Mike needs to be terminated, and so Lasseter goes rogue to protect him while Yates goes a bit far in taking him out. I found Yates to be a little undercooked, forcing Grace to overact in order to make him a villain. Lasseter is sympathetic but time spent with her meant less spent with Eisenberg and Stewart. Walton Goggins does good work as one of Yates' men, and has a nice scene towards the end with Eisenberg.A bit of the screenplay was on the nose - sure, Yates is the villain but sometimes characters go a bit far in dealing with him. The film would've worked much better if it was another non- official body, rather than the CIA, because there were a lot of problems like the CIA ordering drone strikes on US territory that would have been alleviated, and the idea of open war between CIA officials over a difference of policy was a bit much to swallow.At the end of the day, American Ultra's quirky blend of plot points and genres is a surprising success thanks to charming performances and awesome action sequences.",American Ultra

81,Jerghal,Not Ultra Bad but not good either,6,22 November 2015,"The trailer sparked my interest: it looked like one of those super-cool hectically paced over the top flicks with loads of the old Ultra Violence. A bit like Natural Born Killers which was an incredible roller coaster ride of mayhem and destruction.Well right of the bat: it isn't. First of all casting Jesse Eisenberg as a actionhero is not a good idea. The man in unbearable in this film. He is a bit typecast as the neurotic fast talking nerdy looking guy but he is just incredibly annoying. Kristen Stewart does a better job but she and Eisenberg seem like an odd couple.The story also seem poorly written and goes nowhere and all over the place at the same time. I welcome original ideas any day but this feels like a lot of wasted potential. Even at it's short 95 mins it seemed too long with too many dead moments.So not recommended.

82,mistoppi,American Ultra has everything I could ask for a movie,10,5 March 2016,"I saw a few GIFs and screen-caps of the trailer for American Ultra when it came out. It seemed amazing, but unfortunately it wasn't shown in local theatres so I had to wait until it was published on a DVD so I could rent it.This movie takes the audience with it from the first scene. It's well shot, and it's interesting. The first scene is chronologically speaking closer to the end, and those kind of beginnings are always interesting, if they are of course written well. We know where the character or characters are going to be, but how do they get there? It's an excellent way to start a film. It's risky in it's way, but if it's written and shot well, it's 100 % effective.I love the story of this film. Of course it's stupid in it's way, come on, it's an action comedy. Usually you can't expect a lot from an action comedy. But while the story of American Ultra is absurd, filled with conspiracies and experiments and secret identities, it has some weirdly, almost sadly serious moments. And yeah, the idea of this story - a guy who thought he was normal verging on boring is actually some weird experiment - has been used over and over again, but American Ultra gives it something else. The characters are different from the typical archetypes of this kind of story. For example, Mike is a useless stoner. Not even a guy who has a regular boring job but who feels out of place, no. Mike is someone who is definitely useless and hasn't done anything. He's worse than the average hero in these stories before the hero realises what he really is.And while the characters of this story are interesting, the cast is even more interesting. Jesse Eisenberg doesn't look like an action film hero, he looks like a nerd yet he rocks this part surprisingly well. And Topher Grace (who I mostly remember from That 70's Show) as a weird CIA villain? Who thought that would work? And who else was in this, Tony Hale (Arrested Development) and Walton Goggins (The Hateful Eight) and Kristen Stewart, who I never dreamed to see in a film like this, but oh my god this genre suits her... This ensemble is unbelievable, it's like they just chose random actors and actresses from whatever movies and shows and threw them into a same project. And they all work so very well together. Weird casts are a thing that makes a film even more interesting, and had I known about the cast (other than Eisenberg and Stewart) I would've been even more interested in this film.Yesterday someone asked me to describe my aesthetic, and almost everything I mentioned was in this movie. This movie may be bloody and violent, but it is visually very good. It looks astonishing all the time, no matter how gruesome it might be. And the soundtrack, oh, it's on Spotify. It's not special, it's pretty regular, but it is enjoyable to listen to.I liked American Ultra just as much as I thought I would. It has everything I look for a movie: comedy with weird deep moments, violence and adrenaline, interesting characters, amazing cinematography and a ridiculous plot that shouldn't work but somehow they made it work. I just wish American Ultra won't be forgotten, even if its genre suggests that it might be. This film has potential to be some kind of cult classic.",American Ultra
83,torstensonjohn,Almost a Natural Born Killers ReDUX,6,1 February 2019,"The complexity of a film comes from it's pen to paper mindset. Written by Max Landis this action/comedy comes across with a similar theme as 1994's ""Natural Born Killers"". A definitive cast with Jessie Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart leading the way as the catalyst for the film. When you add Walton Goggins, Topher Grace, Tony Hale, Bill Pullman, Connie Britton and John Leguizamo it makes a recipe for a pretty decent film. Eisenberg pulls off the slow stoner role perfectly but is actually a brainwashed secret agent created by the CIA.The fil begins rather slowly but soon picks up speed and becomes action filled with some silly dialogue mixed in.

It's fairly funny, but pretty dumb too.",2,21 August 2015,"Maybe I'm just a really patriotic moviegoer, or maybe it's just a coincidence, but if ""America"" or ""American"" is in a movie's title, it's likely that I'm going to end up enjoying it. You may be the same way. Think about it: ""American Sniper"" (2014), ""American Hustle"" (2013), the ""American Pie"" movies (1999+), ""American Beauty"" (1999), ""American Graffiti"" (1973). All are movies that I would say range from ""very good"" to ""great"". And let's not forget the ""Captain America"" movies (2014 and 2011), ""In America"" (2002), ""My Fellow Americans"" (1996), ""The American President"" (1995) and ""Coming to America"" (1988)! So, does 2015's ""American Ultra"" (R, 1:35) continue the trend, or is it the exception to the rule? This movie has many funny and clever moments, but also has a premise and plot points which stretch the limits of credulity – even for a stoner comedy. The movie's title sounds like a strain of marijuana (and, believe it or not, one with that name was actually created to help market the movie), but ""American Ultra"" actually refers to Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg), a highly skilled agent that the C.I.A. created by using experimental training and mind-altering techniques. (Apparently the C.I.A. can somehow erase memories at will.) Mike's training was a success, but was deemed too damaging to the trainee's psyche and the C.I.A. shut down the program. They erased all conscious memories of his training and dropped off Mike in small-town, West Virginia where he became a marijuana-loving, cartoon-drawing convenience store clerk who lives with his girlfriend Phoebe Larson (Kristen Stewart). Due to severe panic attacks, Mike never leaves town, but he plans a Hawaii trip to propose to Phoebe. (Apparently convenience store clerks make a lot more money these days than I did when I did that job.) Adrian Yates (Topher Grace) is a hard-hearted, but sarcastically humorous rising bureaucrat in the C.I.A. who has decided to eliminate Agent Howell. (I guess agents who have no memory of being agents are somehow a threat to the agency.) Yates sends a team of assassins to kill Mike while he's at work (even though the C.I.A. is forbidden from undertaking missions on American soil). Confronted with these two armed and lethal men, this underachieving stoner instinctively uses the resources immediately at his disposal to kill his potential assassins in a matter of seconds. Mike doesn't understand what just happened (or how it happened) and he calls his girlfriend in a panic. Phoebe arrives just ahead of the police, who arrest Mike and Phoebe as they stand near the two dead bodies (which is, of course, exactly where anyone would stand when they hear sirens).Yates sends in another team (because, obviously, all mid-level C.I.A. bureaucrats have the power to send in hit men to shoot up small towns). This second team includes an agent named Laugher (Walton Goggins) who laughs loudly and randomly, like Batman's ""The Joker"" (which, I would think, would make it tough to operate in stealth mode). Meanwhile, going rogue and trying to save Mike's life is C.I.A. trainer Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton), with help from her former assistant (Tony Hale) back at Langley. As Mike finds himself in increasingly threatening situations, he has the opportunity to exercise increasingly improbable skills and to cause increasing amounts of commotion. Of course, Yates' superiors do nothing to rein him in as the situation gets out of hand. It's a ridiculous, occasionally exciting and somewhat amusing fight for lives, careers and #merica.Basically, ""American Ultra"" is ""Pineapple Express"" (or, insert the name of your favorite stoner comedy here) plus 1993's ""Point of No Return"" (which was based on 1990's ""La Femme Nikita), plus ""The Bourne"" (Saying exactly which one I'm thinking of would spoil part of this movie's plot.). The problem is that this film has no more than half the entertainment value of any of the films in that equation.Still, ""American Ultra"" left me torn. I liked some of the acting and much of the humor, but all that was overshadowed by the movie's problems, big and small. A stoner comedy is meant to be ridiculous to an extent, but when the developments in the movie are so far removed from reality, these moments either have to be seen through the eyes of someone who is on drugs (like the hilarious claymation scene in ""A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas""), or risk distracting viewers from the overall entertainment value.Besides all that, the movie is unnecessarily violent. While the plot demands some violence, the deaths are so graphic and sometimes treated so whimsically, that the contrast between the serious and humorous aspects of the movie is just too great (much like 2015's ""Kingsman: The Secret Service""). Call me unpatriotic, but I simply think ""American Ultra"" has more minuses than pluses. ""C-""",American Ultra
86,gogoschka-1,"Not a comedy - but a crazy, violent, suspenseful ride peppered with a healthy dose of black humor",7,5 November 2015,"OK, the first thing you need to know about this film is that it is NOT a stoner comedy; in fact, I wouldn't even call it a comedy. I'm glad I had already read some reviews about this film complaining that the film's marketing campaign was very misleading, so I didn't watch it with the wrong expectations. After the lukewarm reviews, I actually didn't expect anything from American Ultra and I was more or less prepared not to like it – imagine my surprise when I enjoyed it from start to finish. The main character's story-arc has been compared to Jason Bourne's, which certainly makes sense; but while American Ultra shares certain themes with the Bourne films, I found it to be much closer in tone and story to The Long Kiss Goodnight: it's a crazy, (very!) violent and suspenseful ride peppered with enough black humor and action to keep you entertained throughout; it's a film that's not even remotely realistic and it doesn't mean to be (but let me stress this again: it is NOT a comedy). In my opinion, this didn't deserve to flop; if films like Fifty Shades of Grisly Soft Porn can make hundreds of millions of dollars at the box-office, an unconventional (but very entertaining) little action-thriller like American Ultra should at least have been able to make its budget back. If you take it for what it is and you like your films R-rated and slightly twisted, I can't see why you wouldn't enjoy it. 7 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",American Ultra

I cannot emphasize enough how it feels like three separate movies you're watching that were somehow edited together.It's a shame too because our leads, Eisenberg and Stewart are fine and it was interesting to watch them together.REALLY don't mean to be condescending to our younger viewing audience, but I think this will be a 15 year old's idea of a ""really cool"" movie because of the disparate elements.Again, Eisenberg/Stewart great: Plot stupid.And OMG how many times does a movie need to use the F word? I mean do these writers or producers or whoever injects this crap into movies have NO other word available to them? I mean, look at the late 60s Bonnie & Clyde? Did they even need to use the word once?

But he's too well-trained and too high for them to handle.American Ultra is a late-summer business for a good-time-seeking young audiences. Those who saw director Nima Nourizadeh's moderately successful first feature, comedy Project X, will have an idea of the excess to expect here. It's a very mid- August sort of film, the kind that benefits from low. The first 20 minutes or so are pretty fun and provokes a few laughs by identifying multiple symptom of our generation. The script by Max Landis (Chronicle) delivers more of a big mess than anything coherent or genuinely engaging. Moreover, characters are fun. Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart are a sort of Bonnie and Clyde with a water bong. Unfortunately both of them, frequently great, are unsure footing here. They smoke, say ""like"" and the F-word a lot and eventually kick plenty of butt in a way that looks pretty good. Their relationship is revealed to have a history and dynamic that goes much deeper. However, the only aspect of Jesse Eisenberg character that feels genuine is his paranoia, which within the auspices of comedic action movie, is totally earned. Plus, some people come across as larger than life on screen but Eisenberg and Stewart really don't. There are some highly entertaining cameos. The action sequences build in size throughout the movie. There's chasing, fighting, hiding and urgent phone calls. All of what is nicely edited, big slo-motion shoots down come together in slick and engaging ways. This time around director has thankfully moderated her shaky- cam tendencies. Still, sensation is sensation, amusing discussions, witty characterisation and creative violence. Finally the most creative and witty part of the entire film may well be the animated and credits, which have a panache mostly absent from what's come before. I actually had fun with this movie though. The film doesn't aim for much but guess what? It's nor award season but the last weeks of summer.

Not only did it have a great premise, but it was marketed as a fast paced, high octane action film with comedy thrown in here and there and it had a really AWESOME looking trailer, so because of all that i was looking forward to it. But as this film has shown, a good trailer doesn't necessarily mean a good movie. The first thing this film got very wrong was the tone of the film, it was supposed to be very fun and entertaining and provide us with lots of fast paced action but instead it was just very dull and lifeless for most of the movie. Most of the time the characters and actors just looked bored, nothing against the actors, i just couldn't connect with any of them because they weren't very likable at all. The relationship between Mike (Jesse Eisenberg) and Phoebe (Kirsten Stewart) had some cool moments where i saw a connection, and it helped later on in the film but for the most part it didn't seem natural at all. They mostly interact like two written 'characters' and not like actual people and it didn't help my enjoyment of the film. The other issue was the lack of fun, entertaining action sequences. I wanted to see some crazy Jason Bourne like fighting sequences with a crazy Stoner Comedy spin on it, but there was almost none of that. What little action there was in the film was really cool and was entertaining and did allow me to have fun with the film. The sequences were well choreographed and actually very creative, but each one lasts no longer than like 5 minutes (probably exaggerated) and they were all shown in the damn trailer. A portion of every fight in the film is in the trailer and some of the coolest shots were also in the trailer, so although it was cool to see them play out in the film, the fact that i had seen them before made them lose some of that wow factor. This action i also felt was very overshadowed by the overarching plot involving the government and blah blah blah. This plot has a limited presence early in the film which was cool, but becomes more involved later on to the point where it took over the film and made it less original and enjoyable. None of the side characters involved with this plot, except for one, are interesting enough to warrant so much screen time. Just show us some goddamn explosions and awesome fights for an hour and a half, we don't need half a film of context and backstory. The film also really failed in providing any real comedic elements. The boring tone of the film meant that any attempt to spark some spontaneous laughs out of me failed. It did make me crack a little chuckle once or twice but every other time i wasn't sure if it was trying to be funny or just lazy. It's directed by.... Nima Nourizadeh...... yeh ""WHO?"" is right, he directed 'Project X' which was alright and nothing else. I thought the way he chose to film the action scenes worked really well but pretty much everything else just didn't. The tone was off, the pacing was inconsistent it just wasn't great at all. The writing was done by Max Landis, whose stuff i have really liked, whether it be his work on Chronicle or his more theoretical ideas he has expressed on the 'Schmoes Know Movie Show' he has shown that he has some very very good ideas. I'm not exactly sure how much his script was altered between when he wrote it and when the movie was done filming but it just wasn't really good. I have to make it clear; a VERY VERY great premise with lots of potential, but in the end it wasn't really good. In the end, this film was a mess, the trailer promised a burger from 'Grill'd' with the lot, but we ended up getting a 'McDonalds' double cheeseburger... (crappy analogy No.1). It was disappointing but what little entertaining action there was does allow you to get something out of it if you can get past how dull it is at times. - 4.8/10",American Ultra
91,iguth,Only in the 2010s,8,19 June 2019,"American Ultra is a good, sci-fi, Jumper esc movie. I love to see movies that feature characters dealing with mental health issues that affect their daily lives. Jesse Eisenberg does a great job portraying such a depressed chill character. Our protagonists' relationship is really sweet because it isn't outlandishly romantic but calming instead. The plot itself is creative and features some cool fights. Mike dealing with his new found abilities allows for funny moments when he turns into another person to a degree. The actions scenes are fun and the lighting gives the whole movie this gloomy but warm feel. Good movie to watch with an SO without being a rom-com.",American Ultra

It is very rewarding, but it doesn't stop this movie for having one of the most hateful, piece of garbage A- Hole characters in a movie ever. I wanted him to die so badly and when he did, I thought of holding a party at my house. The violence is lame, the acting is deadpan and wooden, the story is a bunch of BS, the writing is horrible, the effects are cheap and lazy, nothing about this movie is redeemable. NONE.

94,hoernkeem,"American Ultra (2015, Nima Nourizadeh) Good idea for a crazy stoner Kick-Ass, but should be even more outlandish with more action!",6,11 February 2021,"American Ultra (2015, Nima Nourizadeh)
Nourizadeh only has two feature film directing credits to his name and both I think can be characterized as pleasant surprises. The first is 2012's 'Project X' which I think is a very underrated high school party comedy, and second is 'American Ultra'. This is an action comedy that basically wonders what if a loser stoner was really a badass secret CIA asset. This isn't blowing the doors off anything, but it is a bit different, a bit quirky and a fun movie to watch.
The cast here is pretty good with Jesse Eisenberg starring as Mike Howell and Kristen Stewart as his longtime girlfriend Phoebe. They are both stoners not amounting to much living in nowhere, West Virginia. Mike longs to take his girlfriend to Hawaii and propose, but he has crippling anxiety which won't allow him to leave town. We also learn of some high level CIA people who are running black ops type programs. Connie Britton is Victoria Lasseter and Topher Grace is Adrian Yates and they are at odds. We learn that Mike Howell is an asset that can be ""activated"" and it was a project helmed by Lasseter but was ineffective and abandoned. Yates is resurrecting it with his own goon squad and he wants to take Mike out because he deems him a threat. Victoria gets wind of this and secretly journeys to WV and activates Mike. At first nothing, but very quickly we see Mike turn from stoner loser into stoner badass. He runs around for the balance of the movie trying to save himself and his girlfriend as well as trying to figure out what the heck is going on. There is good humor as well as some fun stylized action which really gives this simple, but entertaining movie a kick in the pants. Eisenberg and Stewart have good chemistry together. I like Eisenberg in roles that are sort of Michael Cera type roles but you don't want Michael Cera cause you are kind of sick of him. Eisenberg is a better actor with a bit more range. The supporting cast is also good including Walton Goggins, Tony Hale and John Leguizamo.
This isn't a stellar film and while open for a sequel I don't think really merits one, but also it is by no means bad. If you are looking for a fun, mild mannered comedy with some good action then this will be an entertaining find worth checking out. It is R rated and the action does splatter somewhat, but I think it is all part of its charm.

96,paul_3-960-896774,Great idea poor execution,5,23 December 2015,"Max Landis, who wrote chronicles, pens yet another interesting concept, a long-haired stoner living in the middle of nowhere turns out to be a sleeper agent for the CIA but he just doesn't know it. Staring the Twilight chick (Kristen Stewart), and the Facebook guy (Jesse Einsenberg), American Ultra was directed by Project X director Nima Nourizadeh.I put it on knowing that it wasn't high art so I put my skepticism aside and tried to enjoy the movie. I just didn't. American Ultra doesn't take itself seriously and that's one of the redeeming thing about the film. The film got too weird too quickly for me but then again I'm no stoner, I'm probably not in the target demo. I lost interest after the first 30 minutes. The only thing that kept me watching was the acting, Jesse Eisenberg's quirky blend of acting was on point, he's convincing as a stoner and scary good in the action scenes. Kristen Stewart is also very good in the film and did not mailed in like we've seen her do it in the pass (""You nicknamed my daughter after the Lochness monster!"" LMAO).So American Ultra is a Pineapple Express type of film but less fun, good action, and a lot more awkward. to me it's a case of: Great idea poor execution.@garcwrites",American Ultra
97,JPfanatic93,Mind control's no fun here,5,10 October 2015,"You'd think the shady but historically true Project MK-Ultra would make for a smashing political thriller, with its detestable CIA experiments of mind control via drugs and careful conditioning on the unsuspecting American population. Instead, Hollywood loosely appropriated it for a stoner comedy. And sadly, not the funniest imaginable. American Ultra fires more bullets than jokes.At least the lead casting is a shot in the right direction. Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart have worked together before and it shows, as they have the right amount of chemistry to make a likable couple of losers. From Eisenberg, we've come to expect a certain level of quality, especially when it concerns this type of character. Stewart's performance thus leaves more of an impression, since we still needed some convincing of her talents as a true actress. With her much praised serious role in Camp X-Ray recently behind her, we can safely say 2015 is the year she finally came into her own and left her Twilight stigma behind her. Still, it takes more than two good leads to make for a solid movie. A decent plot and the right balance between action and comedy, for instance. American Ultra doesn't have either.Where the fun is concerned, the movie starts at least promising, and a few good laughs are to be had in the first act. However, the film increasingly opts for action over comedy, which makes for a rather dull and unfunny finale, where both the jokes and the necessary emotional investment in the main characters is lost in all the gun fights, knife fights, and fist fights. There's simply too much fighting as the movie progresses and most of it is excessively violent, but not in any ironic or tongue-in-cheek manner. It's just a bloody mess, as is the story, which also involves rival CIA agents fighting it out in a manner totally devoid of the intelligence the I in their agency is supposed to stand for. There's also room made for a few stereotype drug dealers and deranged super assassins, but none of it works on the levels the writers probably intended. Director Nima Nourizadeh, fresh off the allegedly culturally notable teen flick Project X, shows a little too clearly he has more affinity with destroying things and blowing stuff up than in making us care about it all.Fortunately we still have RED to show us how a fun time can be had with CIA assassins being hunted by their own employer. However, a definitive movie about Project MK-Ultra is still very much lacking. If Hollywood does tackle the touchy subject again, I hope they make a more serious movie out of it. Mind control simply isn't funny, as American Ultra shows.",American Ultra

Some of the things seem a little far fetched but if you ever seen a Bond movie you should realize it is entertainment and some Bond movies are further from reality than this movie(and just as enjoyable).The casting was great on this one and the chemistry between Jesse and Kristen just worked excellent here. Honestly it was the first Kristen film I liked and I found her role very refreshing and I think she really wanted to get rid of her twilight character staring with puppy eyes into the distance(well done Kristen!)Jesse made the action scenes sublime keeping up the idea that he has these skills but he keeps that surprise look like he really can't explain what he just did.I even thought Topher was better in this one than in the last spider-man and it is commendable he keeps playing roles that are miles away from his ""that 70s show""performance which I think put a stigmata on him.The action can be quite brutal and is sometimes in contrast with the more goofy situations which makes you giggle sometimes but more in absurdity than actual jokes which I think would have killed this movie.The movie keeps the pace going until the end and I thought the climax really delivered, especially the scene where he let's his final opponent live and the scene where they gonna kiss and than get shot with an electrical gun and fall to the ground shaking.I liked it,hope you do to.Enjoy this sleeper hit.One of the better movies released in 2015.",American Ultra

Make no mistake, this is a violent film, and I'm not always much in favor of ultra-violence, but by the same token, I do enjoy a good action flick and this is one. Not usually much of a fan of Kristen Stewart, but she was very good in this picture as Phoebe, Mike girlfriend and as we discover, much more. Connie Britton was wonderful as Victoria and I really did like Tony Hale – I will always think Arrested Development first and foremost regarding this guy – was great as Petey. Lots of action, a twist, blood and blasts galore. I don't know why I liked it so much, but I did. I think I'll end up watching it again when it comes out in DVD.

102,vistheindian,A Stoned Bourne,7,2 September 2015,"Quickie Review:Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) is a stoner living in a middle-of-no- where small town, that's all he knows. What he doesn't know is that in fact he is a government agent who is now a liability to the CIA. With skilled agents tasked to hunt down Mike, he must remember his training and survive the night. Pineapple Express meets Bourne, that is literally the best way to describe American Ultra. Don't be afraid to put logic and expectation of deep story aside. Just enjoy the violent non-stop action with fair bit of hilarity. A nice little action flick to gorge down ungodly amounts of popcorn and soda.Full Review:The film is written by Max Landis. He is known for taking tired out concepts and turning it on its head to do something fresh. Yes American Ultra has a very simplistic story, but the plot device of a stoner turned agent is just unique enough to provide an entertaining premise.The fact that the film is simple works in its favour. We are given just the right amount of exposition for us to understand the context of his skill and why the CIA is after him. From that point forward we jump right into the action. The fight scenes and shoot outs in American Ultra were excellent, especially the climax that was shot in one- take. I don't know what it says about me but I love it when action movies are not ashamed or scared of going gory violent. This movie fully embraces the violence, which comes with some gruesome kills that will make you cringe and go ""OOOO! SSSSSS! That has gotta hurt!"" Also because of some of the absurdity involved, there are funny moments that kept the lighter tone of the movie. Something I did not expect was also a competently told love story subplot. Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg were an excellent couple taking on the threats together.There will be no disagreement in terms of what didn't work: Topher Grace. Oh dear lord, his character was irritating! It was like watching a 5 year old on the floor of a store crying because his parents won't buy him a toy. Every single one of his scenes is him overacting and trying to be dominant. It just comes off pathetic. That was partly intentional I admit that, but still doesn't change the fact that he was unbearable to watch.Aside from Topher Grace, everything in the movie clicked. It was a concise action ride, with a little bit of heart and comedy thrown in for good measure. Sit back, relax (in a legal way of course), and enjoy some fun mayhem.",American Ultra

104,writenamehere,Satire?,2,24 June 2021,"The only way to reconcile the attention required to view this film is to think of it as a politically motivated cultural satire of both North American attitudes and Hollywood trends. When you see the trailer, you expect some sort of comic book genre, which should've turned out fine. Unfortunately they really overdid the shooting and violence, to the cost of including an interesting plot or effective comedy. If they wanted to create the next version of Inherent Vice, they certainly could have with the resources they had. Something failed big time here. They just took a swing at the everythings we all know about, and lingered a little too long on the you know what. It isn't entertaining, it's frustrating, seeing experienced talented actors go full monke because they decided they aren't happy about it all. Check out the films these actors have been in, here on IMDB. Holy Moley look at that pedigree! John Leguizamo was Benny Blanco in Carlito's Way! Carlito's Way! Kristen Stewart keeps turning out fine work and goes all out to fulfil her role in this too; and Connie Britton is like some sort of ultimate artist from the planet Supreme!

105,urthpainter,what happens when everyone gives up on a film production?,1,8 December 2015,"At times actors sell out to a project. The same is probably true about production staff as well. But really, how many times do you watch a movie when the director has given up? This movie really is a complete disgrace, waist of resources, and I think I might have gotten dumber for having watched it.Lets begin with the opening scene - CG smoke? You can't actually have the actors smoking? Perhaps it is a metaphor for the disposable nature of this movie. From the opening this movie basically says, ""I am poorly conceived, and lack vision from any perspective of entertainment."" American Ultra is a clinic on bad film making.Then characters - not believable, not stylized, not good! For example, there is an attempt to add depth to a character by displaying their drawing and story telling skills. First your like, yea, those drawings kinda suck, but then they tell a juvenile story relying on violence, and your like - wow, this character is not only shallow, but also a moron.Camera - While generally white bread, eye level, stationary, and uninvolved in leading the drama, it is during the action scenes (combined with choppy editing) that the DP really falls flat on their face.Music. What 4th tier TV show composer got outsourced to do this soundtrack? There is better music in an average episode of Walker Texas Ranger than the noise pasted into this timeline. I do not envy the editor of this movie. To spend 100's of hours with this material? Yikes.Undoubtedly, you get the point...Unfortunately, it gets worse. The acting? Have these people really been in some good movies? Obviously Jesse has been in some great stuff, and there is a glimmer of the professionalism, but this makes his shallow character somehow more pathetic. Kristen and Topher are predictably wooden. Their terrible acting could be correctly cast into certain roles, like Topher's role in Interstellar. However, his acting in American Ultra makes Kutcher's acting in Butterfly Effect look brilliant. While some of the actors in this movie at least look interesting, Topher's look, style, and presence makes a piece of drywall look unique. Topher Grace is the worst part of this movie, and this is an amazing achievement in futility.This writing? Who read this script and said, yea! I'll produce this! I'll give my money to fund the production of these words! There are some people who can be forgiven for taking money and working, but not in this case. Yes, the producers are at the biggest fault, and should be arrested on waist of recourses charges, but everyone who took the paycheck, knew this film was DOA, and still went forward? They too share the blame.Perhaps this movie isn't perfectly terrible, like true classics Plan 9 From Outer Space, Toxic Avenger, and Hawk the Slayer... and this leaves this movie completely without merit.

106,kdavies-69347,Marijuana Required.,5,27 November 2015,"Following the lines of stoner films like Pineapple Express, American Ultra delivers an action film with some big names. However, you'll need to get stoned to enjoy this film.It's got a simple enough plot line. Gas store employee/stoner and all around skinny guy Mike Howell (Eisenburg), with his similar looking and just as mannish girlfriend Phoebe (Stewart), discover that he is a secret CIA super soldier. Hilarity ensues... kind of.Actually it was the lack of humor in this film that I found to be the biggest let down. There were very few actual jokes or funny moments, despite being classified as an action-comedy. It starts off very dramatically, when we meet the main character Mike in prison, and being interviewed by some CIA bigwig. The classic ""in the middle of things"" beginning flashes back to it's slowly progressing action plot line. I enjoyed the action bits, and they tried to keep it pumped up with lots of bullets and blood (spoon kill!), but there were very few funny moments at all.As an action guy, Eisenburg's lackluster fighting style emphasizes the fact that it looks like he has never completed a push-up in his life. The characters had pretty terrible banter between each other. It seemed that they were trying to out do each other with sarcastic wit, including the CIA operatives. Topher Grace, who played the major antagonist, came off as some sort of nervous-hipster-yuppie-douchebag despite being the head of a major CIA operation.Anyway, if you enjoy getting high and watching movies while eating a whole pizza and tub of ice cream, then this is right up your alley!

Casting Jesse as a stoner sleeper agent seemed to be a opportunity for him to play against his usual type. But they never really do anything with it. He smokes pot, he does some fighting but not much. Most of the movie just plods along with a tremendous amount of exposition with other characters. Connie Britton is essentially a plot device and Topher Grace is the scrappy CIA guy trying to climb the ladder. He calls her a lot of names.This movie is quite violent which would be fine if they were going for dark comedy. But the tone comes across as just a straight up action movie. It never goes goofy enough to be a comedy or any over the top action to make it fun.Boring leads and a mostly boring plot.

110,michael-3204,Slight but fun,6,6 August 2016,"A lightweight and entertaining action comedy that doesn't have much more on its mind than delivering on its amusing premise about a highly trained, highly lethal CIA covert asset brainwashed into thinking he's a small-town stoner going nowhere.The downsides to this film include thin characterizations that not even the excellent cast can make terribly distinctive or interesting. Jessie Eisenberg, in the lead role, and Connie Brixton, as a CIA agent trying to protect him, come off best while John Leguizamo as a tedious stereotype comes off worst. Everyone else does what they can, with Kristen Stewart and a sometimes overacting Topher Grace getting some good moments. Another problem is the generic nature of the location (ostensibly West Virginia, though it wasn't filmed there), while seemingly intentional, makes this blandly non-specific in a way that robs the film of a lot of flavor it might otherwise have had.But that aside, it has a strong set-up and delights in paying that off. The fun here is watching Eisenberg's character gradually regain his skills and kick lots of ass, while the bumbling, in-fighting CIA tries to contain the situation. It's more of an homage to the Bourne films than a satire or spoof of those or any other films. The action sequences are skillfully and often hilariously executed, while the considerable violence is taken seriously and not given over to cartoonish excess. That, at least, gives the film some weight and keeps it from floating away in a misty cloud. While it is nowhere near as good, people who liked the superb ""True Lies"" could very well enjoy this as much as I did.",American Ultra
111,keithlovesmovies,American Ultra Review,7,23 September 2015,"Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) is a simple, stoner who spends most of his time getting high and writing a comic about a monkey astronaut. What he doesn't know is that he has received secret training by the CIA to become a lethal killing machine. When the CIA decides to target him for termination, his former handler (Connie Britton) decides to reactivate him thus turning him into a weapon. Now, he must try to use his new abilities to save himself and his girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) from getting killed.If there is one thing to take away from this film is that it's fun. This film is also many things. It is an action movie, a drama, a comedy, and others but I won't spoil that. I thought it did all of those very well. This is all thanks to the script. Despite all the things it tried to be, it was never a mess. It also gave us developed, likable characters that we can't help but not root for. I thought the story flowed nicely up until near the end and the pacing was okay. More about that later. I thought the action scenes were well done here. What made them exciting was the camera work where it was able to slow down and speed up at the right times, the fighting choreography which felt well-rehearsed, the creativity used which I won't spoil either, and the violence which I liked and definitely earned the film it's 18A/R rating. There are some dramatic moments as well as Mike and Phoebe, who have been together for a long time, are trying to take their relationship to the next level just to name one. I thought the film was very funny as well without trying too hard. I thought it was also well-timed as well. It along with the dramatic elements broke up all of the action sequences giving us a good balance of each. What really sold me were Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart's performances. I thought they had great chemistry and really played well off of each other. You can tell that they've worked together before in Adventureland. I really saw him as the oblivious, lovable, well-intentioned stoner and she is there as the ""straight-woman"" type to balance him out. I felt bad for Topher Grace here. I don't think he was well used here as the ""bad guy"", Adrian Yates. This is because his character was not well written and he just did not look write in the part. His quips and one-liners are hit-or-miss with most of them being misses. All of this could maybe have fared better if the character were played by someone else. I wish the film was a little more like the beginning where he was initially unaware of what was happening to him because that was when it was the funniest but that is just a minor complaint. If you just want to turn your mind off and be entertained for an hour and a half, this is not the worst way to do it.Score: 7.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com",American Ultra

113,russellingreviews,What were they on when they made this film?,3,1 September 2015,"Something very weird is happening to me: I keep killing people! There's a chance I may be... a robot! - Mike HowellWalking into the cinema... Think of regular marijuana smokers being secret government agents. It is either an incredibly original concept or a potential debacle. Overall Rating: 2 stars Cinematic rating: 1.5 stars Bigger questions rating: 2 starsLiman, West Virginia. If the CIA wanted to hide someone in one of the most non- decrepit towns in America, there are few that are more obscure. This is where Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) lives a mediocre existence as a teller at the local convenience store. His time is spent drawing his latest graphic novel ideas and smoking weed with his girlfriend, Pheobe (Kristen Stewart). Their days are a blur of neurosis, drugs and confronting their boredom in Liman. Meanwhile, a few kilometres away in Langley, Virginia at the CIA headquarters, a battle of the super agents is brewing. Former lead agent, Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton), comes to the realisation that her main rival, Adrian Yates (Topher Grace), is about to eliminate one of her top-secret operatives. An agent who has had his memory wiped clean and is living with his handler in Liman, West Virginia. Unaware of the agency tension or that he is the remaining agent from a failed project called American Ultra, Mike goes on with his uninspiring stoner lifestyle of drawing monkeys and living with Phoebe. Then Victoria arrives in Liman to save his life and intentionally triggers a series of events that bring his quiet existence under fire. From one simple quotation from Victoria, this obscure town in West Virginia becomes the battleground for an internal war between CIA agents, a crew of psychotic killers and the recently re-activated Mike Howell. The plan to eliminate Mike and Phoebe becomes a disturbingly, funny misadventure of self awareness and misguided CIA infighting.If Liman, West Virginia can be the battlefield for a CIA war, it is not too far of a stretch to consider Jesse Eisenberg (The Social Network) as a trained killing machine. His journey to awareness was reminiscent of Jason Bourne trying to find his identity, but without the masculinity and gravitas of Matt Damon. Eisenberg and Stewart are convincing as stoners, but believing they are CIA lethal weapons is not an easy pill to swallow. They manage to portray the humorous component of this concept, but never managed to be convincing as their assassin alter egos. The story does have promise with the inclusion of their support cast members, but the strong supporting cast members cannot save the fate of this misguided adventure. Interestingly, the only cast member that adds to the film is Topher Grace (Spiderman 3). He seems wiling to go outside his comfort zone he plays in previous films and is convincing as the smarmy CIA leader. Yet, even with a convincing villain, this story never achieves the goals of entertainment. After a relatively slow start, the film does quickly kick into fifth gear with Mike's awareness of his abilities. Director Nima Nourizadeh (Project X) attempts to make up for the slow start by introducing a multitude of characters, but this strategy rapidly causes him to lose the plot. This bevy of characters make for a muddled mess. After awhile, trying to keep track of all of the different story components resembles the experiences of the lead characters as they partake of the available hallucinogens. In the right hands, American Ultra could have led to hyper-violent hilarity on the level of a Quentin Tarantino film, but the key to that statement is 'in the right hands.' Nourizadeh struggles to find his own identity as a director. He is given original and creative characters with unique plot twists that divert from the traditional secret agent theme, but he wastes the opportunity. Understandably, directors borrow from others for inspiration, but the better film makers add their own signature and this never materialises with in this drug influenced journey. Nourizadah seems to travel between Christopher Nolan's Momento and Tarantino's Kill Bill to he even giving a nod to Total Recall, but he never manages to make the film his own. For all of its possibilities, American Ultra is reminiscent of those who chose to smoke marijuana, it is a waste of braincells that leads to nothing but regret and maybe an excuse for popcorn munchies. It had promise, but never reaches potential. Leaving the cinema... The talent and the story were wasted, literally and figuratively. The film had potential, but it was a waste of time.

115,shadow_blade-89459,Surprisinlgy Entertaining,7,9 February 2018,"""American Ultra"" (2015) is a hilarious action comedy that plays on the ""what ifs"" of someone with a creative imagination. The film is about stoner, Mike Howell, played by Jesse Eisenberg, as he struggles to understand his newly activated abilities as a sleeper agent as the CIA tries to kill him. Nothing he knows seems to make sense anymore including the love of his life, his girlfriend, Phoebe Larson played by Kirsten Stewart. This film made me relive the crazy undercover agent thoughts I had as a child because it has very silly, childlike storyline that proves to be entertaining.Though this film has an enjoyable story, I couldn't help but notice the visual effects were a little hit and miss. For example, all the explosions and blood on the actors appeared realistic, but some of the impact splatters looked amateur. It seems almost as if all the effects budget was spent on the explosions, but not enough was put toward the digital effects. If the audience can get past those minor miscues, this film is worth viewing.",American Ultra

Then the mediocre critic reviews came but I still had my hopes that this movie could be good. Sadly I'm now amongst the people holding my thumbs down.Sure, there were some cool action scenes. But by the time that we got to them I had witnessed so much dullness and boring nonsense that frankly I no longer cared about this film at all. The plot was your typical Hollywood clichés that only sucked the life out of the movie.I'm actually feeling sad for this film because I really liked the characters of Mike and Phoebe and I think both actors did a great job with them. I just wish they had a better story for them.The villain was simply laughable. It would be okay if he was only a minor villain, lackey to the more formidable opponent but that was not the case.

With that in mind, I gave this film a 9/10.The best way to describe this movie is Bourne meets CHUCK (the TV Series). It is a Dramedy at it finest - it isn't straight up drama and it isn't a comedy, but it has a nice mix of both, leaning a bit more toward the comedy side of things. I couldn't stop smiling throughout the movie; it was well paced, the character development was good (don't expect anything too deep), the comedy was well timed, and the action was exciting. For a lighthearted film, there were a few moments that definitely pulled on the heartstrings. If you're looking for a fun movie to watch, and especially if you're a fan of CHUCK (think of this as an R rated CHUCK), then I highly recommend this move.",American Ultra

I do like thrillers that keep you guessing what is going to happen next, but not when the question keeps hanging until the very last minute, which means you don't really understand the reasons behind all the commotion, and in this case the question isn't really answered at the end.

I wasn't too sure of how this is gonna be, but oh boy was I surprised ! Kristen Stewart was amazing (probably her best performance in her career), Jessie Eisenberg was awesome as always (big fan of him), the direction was great, the action was fantastic (my second biggest surprise), the story is nice and original, the script was also impressive and a pretty fit romantic story. I gotta talk about Kristen Stewart. She was absolutely excellent. In my opinion this is the best performance of her entire career. She had so much emotion and had really good background. The romance part was also handled really nice. I'm really shocked of how good she was. I never thought she's awful, but never got to see her full potential. This film really shows she can act and act excellently. Now let's talk about Jesse. As I said previously, big fan of him. The Social Network in my opinion is his best performance yet. This movie shows why I like him- HE CAN ACT SO FANTASTIC. He was really great in this movie, had excellent action scenes and was really impressed by his combat skills.

Previews almost always look great but this really was the action comedy you didn't know you were looking for.

127,mmendez-22089,Not too bad. Definitely up to date on shyt,6,5 September 2015,"So, I just got back from seeing this insane stoner/action (believe it or not) flick with Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart. Everyone knows I am not that big of a fan of Stewart, but she does okay for herself in this project. (Side Note: When I watch her acting it is hard to lose myself in it; I always think their is someone who can play the part better). I found myself laughing consistently throughout, mostly because of Eisenberg's over-the-top realism as a stoner, which I found out was inspired by his cousin Andrew Eisenberg. Yeah, the actor had said in an interview that he stayed with his for a couple weeks so he can learn to walk, talk and (actually) act like a genuine pot-head.What I enjoyed most from this piece was the romanticism between the two leads (Eisenberg and Stewart), they kept a certain pulse throughout the film. It was as if their characters where working off of each other; quite lovely, in fact.Now, let me see, what can I say without giving away too many of the spoilers......The film starts out showing Mike (Eisenberg) in a police holding-room where he is all beat up and handcuffed to the table and chair. Through the one way mirror, watching upon him, is Bill Pullman which was sort of a surprise. I did not even expect him to be in a film like this at all. Anyway, time rewinds itself by three days prior to the brutality, where Mika and his lovely girlfriend, Phoebe (Stewart) are living together (you can tell they been at it for a while now) in a small home in West Virginia. They have dreams of taking FLIGHT TO get out of the town that has been so cruel to them. Especially Mike who has dealt with police arrests and misdemeanors fro basically his whole adult life, hence (maybe) the hair.I got to be honest, the movie itself is a little nonsensical but it definitely fits. This is one of those films that can get away with it since they already have a couple things out of the supernatural, such as brainwash and ""the old frying-pan and bullet trick"".I gave this movie a 3.5/5 just because I want to keep a certain style going with criticism and this is a film I find myself not entirely an expert at, which is comedy. If you're someone who like GORE and awkward guy (Cera, Eisenberg, etc.) comedy, with bong hit to it, then I would say that this one is for you. As for me, not my cup of tea that I can have everyday, but it is definitely something I can go for once in a while. :)",American Ultra
128,ReelBrew,"After a government program coined Ultra is terminated, the last remaining experiment must fight for his life if he ever wants to get high again.",6,24 November 2015,"When a government program coined Ultra, created by disparaged official Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) is set to be terminated by unqualified young hot-shot Adrian Yates (Topher Grace), the life of its sole survivor is about to be turned upside down. Living in a remote town of West Virginia with his long term girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart), anxiety riddled stoner Mike (Jesse Eisenberg) costs by on space-ape doodles and nerve-settling joints, hoping to propose once the right time presents itself. With a government force swarming the small town of Liman in order to extract a supposed threat, Mike unknowingly becomes activated, flipping a strangely touching and endearing story into an overblown and frenetic action spoof. Jesse Eisenberg falls prey to the neurotic and fidgety character, bringing his blend of stammering and uncertainty that has befallen him too many times. It's a character he knows how to handle, offering an assured ethos that oddly stumbles into our empathetic hands. Mike handles his drug of choice not as a crutch for a wasted life or for the passing of banality within a backcountry town, but as a means of coping with a crippling anxiety; it's more medicinal than recreational. When hot-headed government official Adrian Yates decides to erase the Ultra program's portfolio and use an unnecessary amount of force doing so, American Ultra turns into a gun-powder loaded fire-drum, more than hinting at the excessive war on drugs the American government has been waging for years. Kristen Stewart plays adequately as a double agent; one part devoted girlfriend, one part AWOL agent. The story of requited love pumps life into a card-board cutout of an action piece, however it's intermittent and with a trivial amount force that can be offered from two characters who only bubble to the surface in between hails of gunfire. Writer Max Landis (Chronicle) and Director Nima Nourizadeh (Project X) have pieced together a movie that's at once sweet in its nature yet heavy handed in its commentary, running back and forth between spoof and honesty that hinders American Ultra from ever catching its breath.",American Ultra

130,bardia-moose,"Original, not Memorable",6,16 September 2015,"American ULTRA is an action-packed comedy that doesn't deserve the bad rep it's been getting. The writing was really strong; Max Landis injected clever and quirky dialogue into a pretty simple story, giving it its own definitive personality. There's a ton of pot smoking, there's a whole lot of killing, and Jesse Eisenberg plays a badass action hero. Yea. If you're not down with any of that, don't watch this movie. The chemistry between Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, who've worked together before, is one of the best things American ULTRA has going for it. You completely believe them as this young couple; the 'tree and car' metaphor in the film, despite being top-tier pot talk, was quite touching. I can't really say the same thing about Topher Grace though; almost everything he said was outright cringe-worthy and over-the-top. It's strange though because, on paper, his character is a perfect match for the kind of tone this film was going for. Unfortunately, he just ended up feeling out of place. Many people are describing this movie as a cross between Pineapple Express and Bourne Identity, and it's difficult to argue against that. I know what you're thinking; it's a bizarre marriage indeed. But when you watch this, the amalgamation actually works. The jokes don't always hit, but the action hits hard. And while it's engaging and well choreographed, the film never takes itself too seriously; the balance between stoner comedy and crazy, bloody violent action is handled well, not as seamless as one would hope though. And through all the insanity that transpires, American ULTRA still manages to maintain a heart. I can positively say that I enjoyed watching American ULTRA. Is it a great movie? Hell no! I wouldn't even call it good, but it's funny when it needs to be, the violence, while excessive at times, always fit the story, and it's original. If you're someone who wants Hollywood to simmer down with all the reboots and sequels, then go see American ULTRA in theatres.

But the pacing and stoned-faced (ha!) disinterested acting kill this movie as quickly as a can-of-soup to the head.The idea that a stoner could secretly be a ""sleeper"" agent is funny, but Eisenberg decided he'd go for a sulky, baffled, and stupid portrayal of the character instead. The main character, who hasn't been ""activated"", for years can apparently beat navy seals and agents who are active and aware of their abilities. Also the villains are caricatures of bad guys, when Jesse drives a Hummer shooting a roman candle (for real!) at them, they all fall down and start yelling! That's some special training they've got!Kristin Stewart plays the girlfriend/handler and I struggled to watch her as she just seems so dirty. I swear, you can almost smell her through the screen. That girl needs a good shower. She also decided to play the character as flat and disinterested, and somehow, despite being terrible as the movie opens, gets worse as it progresses. The writing is just straight up lazy. Plot holes abound i.e. - Kristin Stewart knows that the Jesse character can't leave town (she's his handler), but gets upset when he can't take her on a trip to Hawaii! I feel the writers came up with the premise (Hey - this stoner is actually a Jason Bourne type killer!) and then just piled cliché upon cliché to flesh out the script. The Topher Grace character is a carbon copy of his Spiderman 3 effort, and was included just so audiences would cheer when he gets killed (nearly everyone I ask has a REAL dislike of Topher Grace - he seems like a genuinely unpleasant guy).On top of all this crud the music is completely incongruous and slows down the action scenes and takes away tension - whoops.

The evil government agency, the CIA in this case, sealing a town off for some nefarious purpose is also one of the motifs, ala the ""Crazies"". recycled. Stoner slacker guy, Mike Howell, with no middle class ambitions is a good all around comic relief character, played by Jesse Eisenberg with his devoted girl friend played by Kristen Stewart is a good pair. He works at a convenience store by himself ala ""Clerks"" and draws some silly comic about a super ape he hopes to get published. That duo made the movie, because neither of them are action hero types, quite the opposite for Jesse Eisenberg. He is a good character actor for the nerdy neurotic picked-on type, and a like-able sort of guy. Kristen Stewart is OK too, but she got a swelled head from all those vampire werewolf movies she starred in and got her rich. Then there is John Leguizmo who played his usual latino punk hustler role that was unimpressive. Topher Grace was good as the bad CIA agent who wanted to kill poor conditioned to not know who he really is Jesse, aka Mike Howell. Then they even had Walter Goggins replay his psycho killer role as a fellow American Ultra agent suitably named Laugher, he is a laughing psychopath. who was a psycho before he was put in the Ultra program. The over the top, impossible violent action scenes are no more excessive than the norm these days. To be honest, we can use less of that. But that is what brings in the crowds. The movie was nothing awesome but what made it good was that it had a soul thanks to the lead couple. It wasn't as good as ""Super"", which broker every movie conclusion convention, so it really doesn't rate camp-cult status. The ape cartoon interludes are interesting but sort of lame as well. But it is a pretty interesting and watchable flick and is much better than the comic book Marvel DC run of the mill product that this crosses genres with.",American Ultra
142,calypsokidd,A fun film!,6,23 January 2016,"If you like to watch movies that give you an opportunity to think I would recommend The Imitation Game and Ex-Machina; if you go to the movies strictly to be entertained might I suggest American Ultra. This is a highly entertaining film with plenty of action (albeit most of it is very violent) and a fair amount of humor. Topher Grace and Jesse Eisenberg are both fun to watch throughout the story and even Kristen Stewart gives a decent performance. I have to add that this is only the second film that I have ever seen her in that her acting was not well below par, the other being The Runaways when she did an admirable job of playing Joan Jett. Bottom line: it's not the best film that you will see in 2015 but it is fun!",American Ultra

145,peterfaure,Stylish and offbeat comedy,9,16 January 2016,"I have to say I strongly disagree with some of the negative reviews for this movie, and maintain that most people simply didn't get it.The story is silly and as unrealistic as movies can ever be, but it's meant to be an offbeat, and dark, stoner fantasy comedy and as such it works just fine.It's also beautifully, stylishly filmed and it reminds me of some of Edgar Wright's best work, as in movies like Hot fuzz, Shaun of the dead and Scott Pilgrim. People who love dark humor will find plenty of laughs in this one, and the actors are mostly pretty believable, despite the overall silliness of the story.Some people criticized it for mixing various genres, but I think it's actually one of its strength as the odd mishmash of inspirations and over the top characters gives it a very original vibe and makes it a lot more fun and unpredictable than other recent movies. (and on that topic, it's worth noting it's a lot more fun, original and stylish than any of the recent and much more famous movies in the James Bond franchise.... I find it ridiculous that while many people will waste money on that garbage just because the name 'Bond' is in the title little gems like American Ultra, a million times more creative and funnier while just as silly, get little respect)It's also, IMO, a much better movie than the spectacular but ultimately cold and meaningless Mad Max, whose story is just as dumb but gets a much more serious treatment.One negative note on American Ultra, and why I gave it a 9 instead of a 10, is that Topher Grace's performance, while acceptable at times, is a bit grating and somehow doesn't quite mesh with the rest of the movie.Still, this is a very funny stoner movie stylishly filmed, and for lovers of offbeat humor possibly one of the best of last year (admittedly a very poor year for cinema, filled with forgettable movies with no originality....).",American Ultra

I was quite surprised to find myself laughing, feeling and getting excited from the very beginning. I guess you could say that this movie was ""ultra"" fine ;). The action was great with enough blood for someone who likes movies along the lines of Kick-ass and similar. The comedy was funny enough to punch through the serious moments of the movie to give you a quick laugh before it throws you back into the quite depressing storyline. The twists (while i expected them a mile away unfortunately) had you feeling heavily for the protagonist. My final thoughts about this movie are that Kristin Stewart really can give a great performance. Do not judge her just on twilight.

I think anyone who is still doubting Kristen Stewart's acting ability should watch this film. The romance between Eisenberg and Stewart is very realistic and sweet in its own odd way. There is a good amount of character development and you find yourself rooting for these two stoners before you are even sure what they'll be up against. This is definitely a comedy, albeit a black comedy at times. The movie is a good mix of comedy and action. There is a little bit of gore, but reviewers seem to think it's (pardon the pun) overkill. I think it's pretty on par with the violence in Zombieland. Some gruesome shots and blood, but it is rated R.... The movie gets a little creepy and intense at times but it's nothing I was really shocked or offended by. I spent the entire movie trying to figure out where I recognized the voice of the villain from, only to realize it was Topher Grace when the credits rolled! (Not a spoiler, this is made apparent from the very beginning). He does an amazing job and I hope to see more of him - I think he deserves a comeback after this performance. Overall I loved this movie. I would recommend giving it a shot. The only reason I'm not giving it a ten is because I really disliked the drug dealer character and his role in the movie seemed pretty nonessential.",American Ultra
153,Mamabadger56,Unusual and fun,7,18 October 2015,"Movie viewers who have seen the trailer for American Ultra may have found themselves surprised by the actual film. To begin with, it is (in my opinion) not really a stoner comedy, as implied in the promotional material, which involved references to pot smoking and the catchphrase, ""He's a stoned cold killer,"" not to mention the title itself, which is meant to resemble the name of a variety of marijuana. Drugs are involved, but are not an essential part of the plot. What we really have is a spoof of the ""human killing machine"" class of espionage film, in which a man is turned into a super-agent through some form of specialized training. The comedy derives partly from the unlikely nature of the sleeper agent, a sweet, neurotic underachiever named Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) who lives with his long-suffering girlfriend, Phoebe (Kristen Stewart), in a small town in West Virginia. Mike's life revolves around work as a night clerk at the local convenience store, smoking dope, and inventing new adventures for his unpublished comic book hero, Apollo Ape. As the story begins, his immediate goal is to propose to Phoebe; the two work well throughout the movie as an eccentric and aimless but mutually devoted young couple. Their simple life is about to change, however. Unknown to himself, Mike is actually a sleeper agent whose memory of his experimental training has been wiped - until a threat arises and his abilities are unexpectedly activated. The contrast between the normally meek and ineffectual Mike and his sleep-trained alter ego is comical. The inevitable, unnaturally quick and skillful combat with makeshift weapons is startling and gruesomely violent, but without completely losing touch with the absurdity of Mike as super-assassin. The spy aspect soon turns the film into more of a drama, the CIA is involved, and Mike and Phoebe become fugitives as more of Mike's (and Phoebe's) past is gradually revealed. Topher Grace, who tends to play more likable characters in general, is despicable but amusing as an obnoxious, psychotically driven CIA agent trying to hunt down and kill Mike.The hand to hand battle scenes may continue a little longer than necessary, but several plot twists keep things interesting as Mike and Phoebe elude and hold off their would-be killers, leading to a surprise happy ending. The two lead characters, their shabby appeal and their mutual affection, are the heart of the movie, and what make it work even when the plot becomes a little thin. It's an unusual take on a well known film genre, and overall an enjoyable movie.",American Ultra
154,melaniealison2,American Psycho - Donnie Darko meets Pulp Fiction.,9,27 August 2015,"It's not a comedy, but a satire of NSA-plagued America. The only thing that was comical was the disgruntled audience afterwards, because, based on the title, they had hoped for a really dumb-ass action movie. Which they didn't get.Instead it was violent and clever. The mickey taking out of the action film genre was subtle and easy to miss - like when the protagonist kills his opponent with a spoon, but can't make the physics of it to add up. This should have been a film house movie for the alternative circuit, but the satire in the title seems to have fooled everybody. Even me, before I stumbled upon it. O well, it'll hit the film houses in 20 years time (like Bladerunner) and suddenly everybody will have realized it was a masterpiece all along. It is.And of course you know he's going to propose, but when and how is still a brilliant satire of the Hollywood genre.Theme: a dis-personal and disconnected world for which caring against all odds and orders is the remedy.

I should have known better, and there were clear warning signs, but I thought if it has Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, it can't be all bad. I was so wrong. The two stars were great together in 'Adventureland'- which was also unlikely, but turned out to be a smart, sweet dose of nostalgia. They are talented actors who choose good films ('Twilight' being the clear exception). Stewart is mesmerising and gorgeous on screen, and that was the only reason this film deserves even one star. Maybe I'm missing the point, maybe it is meant to be contrived and flimsy, but the violence is so over the top and seemingly without a trace of comedy or even irony.

From the trailers i saw to the finished product was just straight up Big Hollywood False Advertisement and utter disregard for the movie goer. I was utterly disappointed with this movie which was not funny at all, i **** you not i didn't laugh even once, not once and i love comedies even the C level ones. Jesse Eisenberg Plays Jesse Eisenberg ripping off the style of Michael Cera, i am honestly getting tired of this guy he plays the same loser type he does in Zombieland/Adventureland/and everything else hes in. And Topher Grace just go away, Please im begging you, you're one of the worst actors in history especially considering the rolls you some how get without my understanding to who would hire you. This movie is listed as a Comedy/Action but plays out more like a Romantic/Spy Thriller, I mean the writing is pretty good but just in the wrong place at the wrong time, i truly didn't care about anything that was happening or about any of the characters. I even thought the directing and production on this movie were pretty good. If this movie has one saving grace its that Kristen Stewart is amazing in it, showing she really has some serious acting chops. i also liked John Leguizamo, Bill Pullman and Walton Goggins in their smaller but good rolls. in conclusion i say don't pay to watch this, wait till its online like i did or its in the 5 dollar bargain bin because its genuinely not a good movie. This Film should in no way be looked at as a comedy, i promise you that it wont make you laugh. they had a good idea and just failed to execute they should have followed the same formula that Pineapple Express did and it probably would have had better results as a buddy stoner action/adventure comedy. 4.75 / 10 also none of the smoke is real it's all cgi and it looks really stupid also why does everyone portray stones as if their stupid and its always the same 1970 stereotypes its 2015 get over it.",American Ultra

It could have been better with a bigger budget for production design and more takes, but within the limits of its resources, it does what it sets out to do, including making jokes that work in the middle of the film's most terrifying moments.

And it shows. It is competently directed. The cast is great.The weakest part of this movie is the story its self. People like to say that this movie is a cross between The Bourne identity and Pineapple express.Its not. Its all Bourne identity. That was the whole point of The Bourne identity. That a brainwashed government agent could be anybody and they can be activated.The initial engagement of the movie for the audience is that Jessie Eisenbergs character is a loser stuck in a no name town. And passes the time drawing doodles, smoking pot and hanging out with his ""mery-sue"" girlfriend.Naturally, the audience will feel sympathy for the character. But similarly like a plot in a comic book, the character gets thrust into an adventure where he comically murders other super agents. The set up is unrealistic. And it also shows how cheap the movie is, since its all shot at night, in some nowhere, no name town. Jessie Eisenbergs ""30 minutes or less"" is a real stoner comedy. If compared to this movie.

But it was done with a light humor side, giving a comic book effect, without going too much into the absurd. You don't roll on the floor laughing, it just brings a smile on your face from time to time and that is perfect.At some point, the violence is very graphic, but I thought it was well done.It reminded me of TRUE LIES (1994) a little bit, but a little bit darker violence-wise.

Their heavy-handed (and patently improbable) tactics are met with ingenious improvisation by the protagonist, who, after all, just wants to be left in peace so he can propose to his sweetheart, Phoebe (Kirsten Stuart), in the perfect, most romantic way. There's nothing more determined than a pot-head in love.Obviously realism was not the goal here. But I never poke holes in films just because they're unrealistic. This is clearly not trying to be documentary. So if it has charisma in place of believability, certain factual mistakes, plot holes and one or two massively implausible scenarios, it's still put together so well that it entertains and the overall result is a great film.Director Nima Nourizadeh smashes it from every angle with this one. It's his second movie (following Project X, in 2012), and his attention to detail and sheer passion for film are abundantly evident. Pretty much every shot is on-point; the composition and lighting are particularly effective, bringing out the mood and theme of each scene.Meanwhile, Max Landis shows writers how it's done with fast-paced, clever storytelling that brings together interesting characters who have great chemistry - enhanced by some truly top-notch acting given the context. The action doesn't let up long enough for you to look away and type 'how the CIA really do things' into your search engine, and that's probably for the best.

I used inverted commas there because it only fails if it intended to succeed at being any of those genres.Before you can settle into any mood the film switches gears and not just between genres but within them too. Light hearted comedy is offset by dark humour, touching moments are offset by callous ones, slapstick action offset by gruesome violence and characters move between silly and placid to conniving and vicious. There is little gradient from one end of a spectrum to the other but an almost binary sequence of variance. This makes the tone of the film uneven and for many people I suspect this wont be enjoyable.While most everyone won't enjoy a meal that varies from warm to cool and frozen to charred simultaneously and erratically, there are those of us who may not mind a film ""baked"" in this method.I have to be honest, I haven't Seen much of Kristen Stewart but what I have, I haven't enjoyed. Similarly, with the exception of The Double, I'm not the biggest fan of Eisenberg either. So it was no small surprise when they both exceeded my expectations of their abilities in such a silly oddity of a film. John Leguizamo is a tried and true eccentric and he brought what he could to his role as did Walton Goggins.Personally I absolutely loved this mixed bag of a scatterbrained film and its cute/ grim, compassionate/ nihilistic, unpredictable/ by the numbers schizophrenia. If you've seen the trailer you already know the bulk of the story and themes. It doesn't have the fun of Pineapple express, the shock value of Kick Ass or the bizarre chic of Kingsman but its counter-productive tone and anti-genre blend antics make it an oddity worth checking out.

I understand that director wants to build up a messed up character, but the way that Jesse Eisenberg talks just make me want to throw up. Unlike the trailer, the movie was badly paced, tons of awkward moments. I think sometimes, even those actors don't know what they are supposed to do in some scenes. Those action scenes are not impressive, since Jason Bourne trilogy has shown us enough of that. The only reason I bought the ticket is that I think this movie can be hilarious. Editing trailers might be a better job for this director.",American Ultra
179,al_wilson2,Better than I expected,7,5 September 2015,"Movie was a little slow to start, without really adding much to the storyline. I'm not much of an Eisenberg fan. He seems to be a one trick pony, that can only play one type of character. I didn't expect much from this movie, but caught it as a double feature at the drive-in. With that said, I enjoyed the movie for what it was worth. Regardless of the slow start, it did eventually build a decent storyline. The movie was not funny, but there were some humorous parts such as would be expected from an action movie. I think that was what I liked. I didn't expect an action movie, but it was a decent action movie in a comic book sort of way. If you enjoyed RED, with Bruce Willis, you could enjoy this movie also. The acting was very good, including the normally sub-par Eisenberg. Walton Goggins was great as usual, even with a small part. I can't wait to see him in The Hateful Eight. Topher Grace showed some acting chops as well.",American Ultra
180,akirat-16506,Not Really a Movie,4,25 January 2016,"The MK-Ultra program is ripe for an action, drama, or comedy movie. American Ultra tries to all of them at once and fails at them all. Trailer and marketing for the film portray this as a pot/stoner comedy but from the very beginning of the film it is clear not. The film dances around drama and action most of the time, mostly drama. Parts that could have been funny are over shadowed by over the top gore & violence or the overall too seriousness of the situation and dialog. The soundtrack/score would find a home the Bourne series.There is no secret to what is happening to the main character. There is no build up to anything. If it didn't have Jesse Eisenberg & Kristen Stewart this would have been direct to home theater or buried in deep cable.",American Ultra
181,joy_marie-42188,Fun action movie,8,4 March 2021,"I just watched it for the 3rd time over the last 6yrs and was still entertained. It's not a perfect movie, but it's fun and if you're just looking for pure entertainment, it's worth the watch: funny moments, full of action and some solid actors (along with a couple so-so ones). Laugher was great and even brought some emotion to his last scene.
Flaws: Stewart in the female lead wasn't a great choice and it wasn't Toffer's best acting, the drug dealer was cartoonish and it could've benefited from some additional character development and more details about the back story.
I'm giving it 8 stars, because despite all its flaws, it's genuinely an enjoyable watch and you won't be bored. I don't regret watching it... again.",American Ultra

It has a very Jason Bourne craziness to it. I mean like the main guy can kill someone with a spoon?! Whatttt??? It also had some funny parts to it as well. Parts that made me laugh out loud and then go seriously? But overall I would recommend this movie and totally watch this again!!! Jesse Eisenberg & Kristen Stewart do a fantastic job at these crazy roles they play. I'm glad to see that Kristen Stewart hasn't let the bull of Twilight keep her down. That movie had potential for her and sadly it didn't give her the praise she deserves. And Jesse Eisenberg is a treasure as always!,American Ultra
185,elrmelon-826-240325,A terrible movie,1,3 December 2017,This may be the most boring movie ever. The acting is non existent. Eisenberg is not able to carry a movie and Toper Grace will never be funny as he was in the 70's show. We shut it off 45 minutes in. The trailer had us excited and instead left us sad. Just wasn't sure what they were trying to accomplish. The comedy fell very flat while the action was not believable.,American Ultra
186,nickweninger,American Ultra just failed to meet the ideal goal of what it was reaching for,4,20 August 2015,"American Ultra doesn't offer a whole lot other than the occasional laugh and interesting action sequence. Jesse Eisenberg plays this stoner that lives a normal life smoking pot, working a basic job and living with his girlfriend Kristen Stewart. Their lives suddenly turn upside down when men are sent to kill Jesses character Mike Howell. Turns out that he is a highly trained ex government experiment that they feel no longer needs to be of service to them . Having laid out the basic plot for you, nothing stands out in this film and nothing is really noteworthy about this film. You will watch this movie and think ""oh, that was an OK film. Interesting action scenes and stoner talk"" and that's about it. This film really does nothing for you and soon it will be a passing thought for summer movie category. There were a few laughs here and there because they are stoners and seem to have no idea what they are doing. Other than the laughs and the action, the acting is mediocre, the dialogue does nothing to stand out, the antagonist Topher Grace is overdone and laughable, and much more. I was hoping this movie would be a lot better than it actually was. This film had a lot of potential but it just failed to reach it. Average Man Score: 4/10",American Ultra
187,thecinematicaddicts,American Ultra (SPOILER FREE),6,10 September 2015,"American Ultra is directed by Nima Nourizadeh and stars Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Topher Grace, Connie Britton, Tony Hale and Bill Pullman. This is a fun self aware action movie centered around a pothead. Although the plot sounds strange, even border-line crazy, this movie uses this as an asset creates a unique movie that stands out in whitewashed action movies.Mike Howell (Eisenberg) is a pothead that suffers from anxiety attacks and works at the local gas station. He is trying to find a way to propose to his girlfriend, Phoebe Larson (Stewart), but it turns out Mike is actually a government agent. The government sends in their best operatives to eliminate Mike, but his training kicks in and goes on the run from the government.This film pays tribute to the Bourne Trilogy, but takes the story and makes it a whole lot crazier. The entire movie takes place in a single small town, (except for a couple of flashes to the CIA's Headquarters in Langley), and it gives the movie a local feel and that is inviting to the audience.Jesse Eisenberg expertly portrays the main character in this film. There was a general sense of doubt surrounding Eisenberg's ability to play a convincing action star. He manages to convince the audience that he is the panicky stoner, but in action scenes Eisenberg looks stiff and kind of awkward. The editing tried to hide this, but there were times where it leaked through. Eisenberg's awkward and gawky self was perfect for all of this movie except for action sequences.Phoebe Larson (Stewart) didn't add much to the plot, but she was very believable as Mike's (Eisenberg) girlfriend. There was never a moment when the audience didn't believe they were dating. Although Kristen Stewart still hasn't proved she can act extremely well, her representation of Phoebe sets her a part from her earlier work (mainly the Twilight Movies). The villain in American Ultra is Adrian Yates played by Topher Grace. Yates is in charge of the CIA team trying to take out Mike Howell (Eisenberg), unfortunately the writing for this character made him utterly incompetent. His dialogue was supposed to be funny, but mostly just came across as annoying and stupid. It was hard for audiences to take the movie seriously when the villain was a total screw up. Maybe if the Yates (Grace) had been written in a more threatening or capable way, the danger of Mike's (Eisenberg) situation would have been felt by the audience.The action in this movie was disappointing. Because of Jesse Eisenberg's inexperience in action movies, the action scenes for the most part were filmed in a series of quick cuts that tried to hide the stunt double. The action was fun and enjoyable, even if it was hard to understand what was happening during the sequences. Other than that the action was brilliant. There were many scenes which got the audience very excited and even surprised them at times. Something that really added to the film, was the venerability of the main heroes. Unlike movies like Die Hard or Terminator, the main hero didn't leave his fights unscathed. Audiences connect with humanity and the director did an excellent job of showing this in Mike (Eisenberg).The weaknesses of this film can be found in side characters. Although the two main characters were well developed and had great chemistry, the supporting cast was a disappointment. Not only did the supporting actors not have any chemistry, but they were poorly written. Connie Britton's character was very inconsistent through the whole movie and the script couldn't seem to decide what her role was. Another useless character was Tony Hale's Pete, who was a CIA agent in the film. He was suppose to be comic relief in the movie, but he (like Topher Grace) just came across as annoying. He didn't add to the movie at all and if he hadn't been included, the movie would have been better off. The most useless and underwhelming character in this movie was Bill Pullman. His character just showed up at the end of the movie to wrap things up. He had no explanation for his appearance and just left audience members mostly confused.Although the plot seemed generally uneven with useless and annoying characters, American Ultra was a fun loose action film that was enjoyable to everyone. The craziness of this movie just added to the chaos and it was enjoyable for audiences even if the action was visually confusing. American Ultra gets a 6.0/10 stars.",American Ultra
188,dandaman-51600,"This is a fun movie, and I would say it has the soul of a romcom, in an action movie body.",7,15 November 2015,"Some upfront information, the main character of this movie gets stoned, repeatedly. If someone smoking in a movie ruins it for you then you won't like this motion picture. However him being a stoner (while mentioned and a minor plot point) isn't the all consuming central theme of the movie, this isn't Pineapple Express: Spy Who Smoked Me.I found the acting to be above average, and more importantly the characters are well written and believable. I liked the story, and by the end of the movie I was wholeheartedly rooting for the romance as well as several supporting characters to succeed. The only gripe I have with the movie is the near terminator like aspect of the main character, this is however during the ""third act"" and is perhaps unavoidable.The film does an amazing job at trying to disorient you when it wants to, in spite of laying out a road map in the opening sequence.Huge congratulations are due to the animator for the credits. The style, and play of them where a fantastic end to the movie and really had me leaving with a smile on my face.I thought it was a good movie, certainly better then other films that came out this year.

I still had to give it a 10 for originality, creativity, and Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart and Connie Britton contribute great performances, Walton Goggins and John Leguizamo fill in the rest as supporting.
Sam Rockwell, Tom Hardy or Matt Dillon playing Yates would have made this film 10X better, one lame actor (like Topher Grace) can ruin a Great movie...",American Ultra
192,tktansey,"Not ""Ultra"" Good",4,26 November 2015,"""American Ultra"" tries very hard to be a good movie. But since it can't decide what kind of movie it wants to be, it misses the mark on all fronts.For instance, this could have been a good comedy. Jesse Eisenberg plays Mike Howell, a neurotic stoner who spends his days puffing away on an endless supply of joints, drawing cool underground comics, and working as a convenience store clerk. All while trying to work up the nerve to propose to his equally stoned girlfriend (played by Kristen Stewart). It's what he knows and he's happy enough doing it. What he doesn't know is that he's actually a brainwashed, highly trained, phenomenally deadly CIA asset. One day he gets 'activated' and all hell breaks loose.The government is out to get him, assassins come out of nowhere, bullets fly, and things explode. Many people die in many inventive ways, most at the hands of poor, confused Jesse Eisenberg. You know how your stoner friend can make a bong out of anything? Eisenberg can use anything to kill a person. If it's handy, it's lethal. Add a supporting cast that includes Topher Grace, John Leguizamo, and Tony Hale and the jokes should write themselves. But director Nima Nourizadeh has his actors take this far-fetched plot far too seriously and what humor there is falls flat.""American Ultra"" could also have been a good action movie. Early on there's a thrilling shoot out that puts you in mind of the famous police station massacre in the original ""Terminator"". There's another scene later in the movie that reminds you of the department store shoot out in ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"". In between, people chase each other, beat each other up, and there's even a drone strike. So there's plenty of action going on. But there's no real momentum to the story. There are good guys and bad guys, but we're never quite sure who is what and therefore the stakes never get as high as they need to be for this to work as an action movie.Conversely, ""American Ultra"" could have been a good drama. Eisenberg and Stewart make a very believable couple, as anyone who's seen ""Adventureland"" can tell you. What's more, their characters here really seem to care about one another. There's a heartfelt scene between the two as they sit observing the clean up after a random car accident. It's honest and poignant and the characters reveal themselves beautifully. Then the movie separates the two for most of the middle section and that connection is lost. So what we end up with is a mish-mash of styles and stories. Maybe it has something to do with there being too many chefs in the kitchen. Watch the end credits and you'll see that there are 18 different people listed as 'producer'. You'll also notice that four or five different production companies were involved. They say a camel is a horse made by a committee. Maybe that's what happened here.Still, there are things to like about ""American Ultra"". Just not enough to make it a good movie of any kind.",American Ultra

197,jklovelessccgs,"This Movie is the Car, the Neg Reviews are the Tree",8,14 April 2020,"The story is frankly unbelievable. Fact of the matter is, stuff happens the way it happens because it leads to cool or interesting things. The antagonists motives make zero sense right from the beginning. A lot of things just don't seem realistic in many ways and sometimes motives even feel contradictory. Dialogue is often unnatural.But if you can let go of all the stuff that doesn't make sense and just watch it for what it is, a bizarrely fun action packed film, it makes for a good time.I found myself on the edge of my seat. It had this suspenseful feeling to it, and it had a nice subdued humor alongside it. The action was over the top but fun and exciting, even when
it didn't make sense. There were some genuinely interesting emotional moments as well, such as the talk with the car and the tree. It is one of those silly stoner logic moments, but as a metaphor it made sense.I hope this movie gets a sequel, because I think it deserves one, but it probably won't.This isn't my favorite movie ever, but it was enjoyable and I don't regret watching it at all.

Unfortunately the fact that he's a CIA trained killing machine in sleeper mode (I feel like I know this from somewhere) is not well enough executed (meaning the plot is way to shallow and transparent) to make this movie good.The movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Is it a stoner comedy, or is it kind of a Bourne Identity mock-up that didn't have to guts to be really funny? Well, It's certainly not funny enough to be a comedy but it's too funny to be a drama. And, as mentioned before, its story is a little too transparent to be really gripping. The action is, apart from a few fighting choreographies and bloody effects, really lame and despite having played a stoner before, Jesse Eisenberg doesn't pull it off this time. He just didn't manage to make me care enough for his character.Kristen Stewart on the other hand did a fine job. Although the mood of her character is really not far from any other character she's played before, she manages to be at least twice as convincing as Eisenberg.1 Star for Kristen Stewart, 1 for the idea, 1 Star for the look.-1 for Topher Grace -1 for the unrealistic behavior of the military -1 for for the execution of the idea -1 for not deciding to make this movie either really funny or really serious (the in between doesn't work) -1 for John Leguizamo -1 for Walton Goggins -1 for Jesse Eisenbergs Performance (He was so much better in Adventureland or in Zombieland",American Ultra

219,acfritzke-87645,Succeeds in it's own genre,9,5 December 2015,"This is the Bourne film that's essentially written by Seth Rogan. The characters have a simple comedic feel, like those of The Pineapple Express (2008). Instead of a cold-and-edgy corrupt government bureaucracy, it's satirically incompetent. Instead of a cunning Matt Damon, there's Jessie Eisenberg who at a point in the film just wants to go home and smoke weed. And then instead of fighting other cunning assassins, Eisenberg combats thugs such as Laughter, a sociopath without front teeth. The film naturally draws comparison to Zombieland (2009), a film also starring Eisenberg. In both films there is a motif of a lame kid accomplishing great things. Both films also capitalize on morbid humor. And both films have a warm happy ending. The warm happy ending of American Ultra includes Eisenberg forsaking the life of a stoner for that of a government agent. So now the only stoner is the director, Nima Nourizadeh, whose dgaf approach to film making includes the avoidance of stereotype film genres.

224,cobeal,Absolutely Love American Ultra (Bizarrely Cool ),10,28 November 2015,"First, I must say that this movie is not for everyone.If you feel that serious should be serious and can not break out of that mold then likely this movie is not for you.Coolly bizarre and satirical at times, I highly recommend American Ultra to anyone prepared to enjoy this type of creativity.If you think that the hippy-ish ""Peace, Love, Dope"" portrayal of some character does not belong in movies or should be banned from the screen then this movie is not for you.I believe American Ultra is a brilliant and clever work of art by everyone involved. Well written and well produced. The cast selection is perfection and the acting was flawlessly executed. Bizarre could be one description but in a good way. Cool another. So I find this to be a bizarrely cool movie that I intend to watch over and over again for the rest of my life.Makes me wish I was hanging out with the people who can come up with this sort of product. My kind of people for sure.Perhaps you have to be a child of the late '60's California in order to enjoy a flick like this as much as I do. I can not even imagine what type the people are or where they came from that wrote some of these negative sounding reviews. Even some of the mostly positive reviews seem to have captured a different slant. I love this flick. I believe I will watch it again to see if I can think like the other reviewers and get into their mindsets for a while.I just watched it (again) with some old friends last night and we all had a blast. 100% sober with zero additives from start to finish but felt curiously relaxed and satisfied after watching together.Tremendously entertaining! That is what movies are supposed to do, Right? Contrary to some reviews, I strongly doubt anyone has to be stoned to enjoy this movie although you might feel stoned after watching from start to finish including the entire credits. Even the credits are fun! Was it funny? Incredibly! If you have a sharp mind and pay attention to detail and a sort of comic book or Road Runner cartoon state of mind and like that you are that type of person. If you feel that serious should be serious and life is serious and can not break out of that mental mold then likely this movie is not for you.My kind of people know when to be serious. We just don't feel it necessary to get stuck in that rigid mindset lest it become boring and tiresome.I count myself among those who do not believe that movies should be exact mirrors of reality or sanitized reality. You are going to see stuff in this flick that likely will never happen ...ever. It is not meant to be serious by any stretch. Cinema is an expression of many things and this is by no means a movie you should watch in a serious frame of mind unless you have the capability to relax and enjoy life and feel like you need some catalyst to knock you out of a too serious mindset. Coolly bizarre and satirical at times, I highly recommend American Ultra to anyone prepared to enjoy this type of creativity.",American Ultra

Go seek for your favorite James Bond. Care for some laugh and blood ? Why not Welcome to Zombieland. But if you mix all together, that is not necessarily a good deed, than can even be bad, or tasteless... American Ultra reminded me of all of them, made me kind of ... miss them. Nothing to say about the actors even if it was really hard for me to see Jesse Eisenberg as a stoner with long hairs, well to be honest, neither as a killing machine. My guess is that the situations are not enough credible to be taken seriously and too serious to be laugh about. I hope the next opus will be a better cooking.

226,harry200407,"Good to kill some boring time, but not recommended for a serious movie goers.",6,26 August 2015,"Number of comic reliefs were mixed with fast pace actions which I thought delivered quite well by the lead male actor. Not much of a story line to think of though. It is pretty much a straight forward and obvious outcome of the story. If you are a serious action movie fan with many twists and turns, this is not the right movie. For actors, other than the male lead in the movie, nobody else was really impressive or memorable. The whole movie was like a bit of uncomfortable mismatch of characters. The female lead was definitely not the right cast for this movie unfortunately. It felt like she was somewhere else during the whole movie as if she was forcing herself to shoot the movie just to get over it. Villain of the story was definitely not strong enough to carry the weight, either. Maybe because his role as a stoned teenager in 'That 70's show' still holds a shadow over him. Still, I could sit through the whole movie without walking out in the middle. 3/4 from the start actually kept me curious wondering what kind of outcome would be there. Well, it did not surprise me by any means. If I may be bluntly honest, I disliked how it was wrapped up. It was a good idea to put a hint of the lead guy's career as an active agent, but I cannot understand why it was made as a stupid cartoon. Once again, the ending made me wonder why I sat through to the end. If setting up for a sequel was the purpose of the final cuts, I think the production should have gone with much more serious action with full range of spy activity for a good taste of what is to come next. In conclusion, this movie is good to kill some boring time on a Tuesday if you had nothing else planned, but not worth traveling for fighting through rush hour traffics or sacrificing sunny weekends in a park or at the beaches. Only if you have nothing else to do at all, then I may suggest this movie since it is far from the worst I have seen.",American Ultra

234,kunal30983,"Ultra Gory, Ultra Boring",4,19 August 2015,"So I'll start off by saying that when you watch this trailer, you don't expect much apart from a kick-ass ride. Sadly American Ultra doesn't really take you for one. Small-town stoner Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) spends his time high and writing a graphic novel about a superhero monkey, while running a rink dink store in the middle of nowhere small town. (I see you're expecting some foreshadowing with the superhero monkey bit. Well don't hold your breath.) What Mike doesn't know is that he is actually a CIA trained lab rat killing machine, and because of an apparent ""failure"" in the experiment the time has come to exterminate him. And so begins a very long goose chase. The CIA sends enhanced humanoids to kill Mike, but not before he is re-triggered by the mother of the experiment he was part of. So now Mike, unknowingly, can kick some serious butt, and this is where you think some slick action choreography would come in right? Errrr! Wrong. In fact all you get is a shaky camera, a whole lot of gore, and uninteresting action scenes. If you're squeamish, beware the amount of blood that is drawn in this short one and a half hour movie – I had my eyes covered through most of the action scenes. When you have a film like American Ultra, you don't go in expecting a solid plot, but you do go in with an expectation of a unique treatment, and that's why this movie falls short. The action is uninspiring as is the cinematography. While Jesse Eisenberg is phenomenal and the only thing that doesn't want to make u walk away, Kristen Stewart proves yet again that the only role she'll be able to pull off convincingly is that off a constipated apathetic half human-half robot. (Producers and writers; please don't get any ideas). She has now been a part of a teen flick like Twilight, a serious role in Still Alice, and now a hand at comedy with American Ultra. Fail. Fail. Fail. She is so unconvincing as Phoebe Larson that she brings down Jesse's performance. I would have actually loved to see Ellen Page in this role – she would have pulled of some amazing eccentric chemistry with Eisenberg. Connie Britton and Victoria Lasseter wasn't bad, but nothing great either and while Topher Grace gives it his all as Adrian Yates, it's hard to see him as anything but Eric Forman from That 70's Show. Now the movie isn't all that bad. It has its light moments and Eisenberg's comic timing is superb. Everything from his body language to his facial twitches are perfectly in sync with his character. Some scenes will definitely give you the giggles if not get you into fits of laughter, but it's not something that sustains, and that's pretty essential for an Action Dramedy like this. P.S. Maybe I missed it, but I just do not get the relevance of the movie's title. The Ultra part I get, but why the American? If you got it, please do let me know.",American Ultra

I totally had forgotten that Kristen Stewart was a quality actress, until watching this movie. The whole twilight fiasco made me not a fan as I thought it did more damage to her career than good. But she is absolutely spectacular in this movie. She brings all the right enthusiasm and realism that makes her role just so relatable and fun to watch. I also think the studio really screwed itself over, by releasing such a misleading trailer. I opted out of paying money to see it in the theater because the trailer made it seem like it was just some cheesy comedy. But it was far from that as it has aspects of comedy, crime, romance, thriller and drama. So is it a movie you should go all out of your way to see? No!

239,fatjesusomg,Best action comedy since Kick-ass,9,7 September 2015,"If you are expecting a casual stoner film, this films is not what you are looking for. But it is defiantly worth watching. The film starts with Mike (Jesse Eisenberg) in handcuffs and tapping his leg. This scene is a set up for a flashback, A directing choice i am not a fan of; if they didn't have this then the end of the film would be much better as you would not know he would survive. This is one of few flaws in the film, others include terrible smoke effects, some poor blood effects and (although a small flaw) they didn't include a bong SFX when Phoebe uses a bong. Despite this the film has many good features such as; -Great plot. -Good Plot twist (although it seemed a bit too early). -Everytime Mike has a panic attack / feels anxious, he taps his leg on the ground repeatedly, I noticed this and it was a nice touch. -Excellent Choreographed fight scenes.Jesse Eisenberg's acting is exceptional and he brings the character to life. Kristen Stewart's acting was nothing special. And how did Topher Grace do? Well he has certainly improved since 'That 70's Show'. He plays the bad guy and does a good job, he makes you hate the character. Overall i would give American Ultra a 8.5/10",American Ultra

241,matthewpublic,Two Thumbs Up from an MKULTRA Monarch in recovery,9,19 September 2015,"Everyone should go out and see ""American ULTRA"" before it leaves the theatres. Sure the portrayal of the super soldier is not accurate by the standards of today's super soldiers, but the MKULTRA aspect is close to the mark. I identified strongly with the main character, even though I am a recovering garden variety MKULTRA Monarch, not MKULTRA super soldier. Even my partner identified with the protagonist MKULTRA-super soldier's girlfriend as she faces the same issues supporting me.Some examples of its realism: - He has induced phobias, and behaviours that he does not know how he got them - He is forgetful and absent minded just as MKs are in real-life. Some of us lock ourselves out of our own cars on a regular basis for example. He starts a fire in his kitchen when forgetting an omelet on the stove - He is a decent, kind, intelligent person who has been horribly manipulated - There is a part of him that when unlocked by a post-hypnotic trigger can be dangerous - He has almost photographic memory that gets turned on when triggered or dissociated - He uses Cannabis (Pot) to relax and put his mind at rest - They try to kill him once he goes rogueIts clear to me the directors and editors were dancing a fine line between being accurate in the portrayal of a real-life MKULTRA super soldier, and watering it down enough to get it past the government. There are plenty of scenes in the two main trailers for the film that did not make the final cut, likely because they'd never get it released other wise.My hat goes off to the producer, director, scriptwriters, and actors. This is as close to the truth of what is really going on, or at least as much as the general public will ever know.

I saw a man get murdered with a spoon, now that's something you don't see everyday. For a stoner, action comedy, it actually had a pretty good story development. I knew most of the actors form previous films they've done, and they did a great job portraying the character for this film. Another thing I really enjoyed were the songs used for the soundtrack.

So far so good, I expected a decent no-brainer which is not very profound but funny. And yeah, the movie isn't boring at all but on the other side there is nothing interesting element in it. The characters are average, the storyline is average, the action is average and to be honest, the comedy parts are not very extraordinary, too. I had to laugh one time, when Jesse Eisenberg tipped his noodle soup in the face of his enemy. I liked the fact that the main character could use every-day items (like the soup, or a pan for example) for beating up his enemies. That was a fresh idea and give the movie an own identity.

245,tmenke,American Ultra: A movie with an identity crisis,4,7 December 2015,"Is this a stoner movie? An action movie? A thriller? Love story? Comedy?The answer is...No one knowsI really wanted to like American Ultra, and the preview got me excited. I was expecting a comedic stoner take on Jason Bourne, but what I got was a half-hearted attempt at ""something"". The trailer is VERY misleading.This movie is touted as a comedic stoner action movie, but the problem is it's not. The protagonist smokes joints throughout, but he could have just as easily not smoked at all and the movie wouldn't have skipped a beat. He could just have easily smoked regular cigarettes, drank alcohol, taken pills, or just been a neurotic Jesse Eisenberg character with anxiety. The smoking marijuana portion of the movie serves no real purpose. It comes off as more ""sad/depressing"" than ""comedic/stoner"". It's like the directors just threw those parts in so they could market AU as a stoner comedy. The tone is very dark, and there is very little comedy to speak of that would let this movie breathe. I wouldn't necessarily mind the darker tone if it would fully commit. American Ultra seems like it is going in a certain direction but then gets cold feet anytime it starts to get close to any particular genre or idea.There is no real direction to speak of in this movie.I actually liked Eisenberg and Stewart's acting and felt they did the best with what they were given. They were not given much however, and if there was any direction this could have been amazing as the premise is something we really haven't seen before. American Ultra has a few little moments that if expanded upon could make this one heck of a movie. Eisenberg and Stewart's car vs. tree dialogue is beautifully written and some of the action scenes are brilliant. These moments are few and far in between though and don't transition well between them.The frying pan action scene is one such creative example, but that's only one of the few times Eisenberg's character isn't just grabbing something and hitting a bad guy over the head with something. It's fun to watch, but quickly grows stale because there aren't enough distinguishing creative moments that separate themselves from the others. More rinse and repeat..and then the movie ends.This movie could have been great if put together correctly and a more thought out theme, but that isn't the case. This is a movie that doesn't know whether to take itself too seriously or not seriously enough and that stops the audience from ever truly getting invested into it. It's a shame.",American Ultra

Topher Grace got into his character to the point where I might actually punch him in the face. He is an excellent actor that definitely has a future (a future that I would like to see) in the movie industry. Kristen definitely wrecked her part in the film. She seemed at home with the character and was excellent! If Kristen plans on playing more roles like this I will definitely watch them no doubt! Jesse, of course, is one of my favorites; and he still amazes me with his hesitant, but courageous attitude towards his roles. Jesse holds nothing back when it comes to his characters and this is what sets him apart. Every role that he plays matches his personality so well that I am convinced that he is that fictional character.

American Ultra is at most a dramedy, though its drama far outweighs its comedy percentage. The mood is somber, the actors are technically good enough, the premise is good, only – I found the execution lacking.The more I watched this movie, the less excited I was about it. At times, it tried to be far too dramatic and touching, failing at both, and at other points, it did so unintentionally. I liked the idea of the sleeper agent who is an ambitionless pothead, but the explanation to his condition was lackluster and not well thought- out. Let's not even talk about the villain; he was comically one- dimensional and flat.Jesse Eisenberg, to be honest, bored me. At no point did I find myself feeling for him. I am not sure if it is due to the casting or poor writing, but I found the main character wholly uninteresting. However, I was interested in finding out more about him in the past, and was sorely disappointed when that was left to the wind. As for Kristen Stewart – meh. I will admit to liking her (mostly outside of her acting career) but at critical points, even I will admit, it was like listening to her reading straight from the script. I did like her physical dedication to the role, because she looked like shite, but that cannot save the role.As a whole – I was very disappointed by this film.

248,karlgiles,Not so ultra,3,7 January 2016,"This film has all the makings of a really good action/comedy movie. It has the suspense and the shoot-outs with the completely daft plot that works somehow. The majority of the cast play their roles brilliantly, with Walter Goggins as Laugher easily being the cream of the crop. But for starters it just takes itself way too seriously, when their is meant to be a joke its delivered with way too much emphasis its just not funny. The whole killing people with spoons and dustpans should be a bit of a laugh out loud moment in the middle of a great gunfight, but its just too serious to really make you want to laugh. But the worst part of this film has got to be Jesse Eisenberg, he couldn't seem to work out if he was meant to be an action hero, a dramatic actor or a comedian and the resulting mess just ends up being very blah. I ended up hoping him, the hero, got killed about halfway through the film because, otherwise you spend a hour of your life shouting at him to stop being a douche. Now I get he's a stoner and all that, but come on if the only joke your going to invest in is the whole stoner/super- spy one you can't expect to make a good movie.

American Ultra is a greatly entertaining and fun ACTION MOVIE. It isn't really a stoner comedy. Just because a movie has pot in it, doesn't mean that the whole movie revolves around it(or the cheap comedy attached to it). I feel everyone who went to see this movie was expecting some stupid-funny movie a la Pineapple Express, with action thrown in. That is why I think it flopped, because they marketed the movie to the wrong audience. In reality, American Ultra is a ridiculously violent action movie with some dark comedy, about a CIA sleeper agent (Mike, played by Eisenberg) who gets activated by a project lead trying to save him from being eliminated by her superior. To me it was unique and charming, and a much needed break from all of the bland, unremarkable superhero movies coming out every other month. Lastly, I would like to recommend that if you are easily offended, you should NOT watch this movie. Why someone like that would even bother seeing a rated R movie is beyond me. I just thought a warning was required since evidently there are people who were offended by the excessive use of the word f*ck.

This film there is action for those who crave it, a good love story, twists one never sees coming and the most random things ever used as weapons.The least likely badasses (Kristen & Jesse) ever depicted on film just became epic action stars. The juxtaposition to this is the least likely bad guy (Toby) truly makes you hate him when once believed only able to portray lovable characters.If you passed on this film because of any preconceived notions about the actors or bad reviews, I strongly recommend watching for 20 minutes to become riveted as well.",American Ultra

252,oliviaastickel,Could have been something special,3,20 July 2021,"This movie is the definition of borderline. The comedy/satire is even with the action, but neither lands well because there wasn't enough commitment. As a comedy, this could've been peak as Jesse Eisenburg is a natural comedian and Kristen Stewart had major potential in this time to explore comedy roles. They also play into the ""making a movie without having the government act like real government"" well and in a comedic sense. As an action/drama this could've been rewatch central, as the plot and sequence opportunities were prime! They also never explore back into his past life AT ALL. To me this film was uncommitted with an indie view, had potential but squashed it. The acting holds up but is still confusing as neither lead know how to focus themselves.",American Ultra

254,harrylal,All good,8,5 November 2017,"Watched this film on Film 4 in the UK (actually still watching it - there's an ad break) and it's hugely entertaining. The thing is, I'd never heard of it, so had no preconceptions. Jesse whossisname killing two CIA operatives with a spoon and a Pot Noodle hooked me. This film is all good!",American Ultra

256,antonissampanis,"Disappointing and not funny enough, but very entertaining",6,26 October 2019,"Another reviewer said that this movie is a gross between ''The Bourne Identity'' and ''Pineapple Express'', honestly there isn't a more accurate way to describe itSo basically the plot involves around the only survivor of a terminated experiment to create superspies, who lives now in a small town with his girlfriend and his memory erased, and suddenly is targeted for death by the agency that created him. Then of course hell breaks loose...I can't deny that i enjoyed watching this movie very much. It has a lot of problems though. For a movie that is marketed as a ''Action-Comedy'', there is definitely not enough comedy, there are some funny lines, but that's it. The action scenes are decent, just that. The premise of the movie is awesome and kind of fresh, the execution is average to OKEven though he isn't bad, i didn't like J.Eisenberg in this movie and he is definitely miscasted. Yeah he is convincing as an ordinary guy in the beginning, but afterwards he is totaly unbelievable as a awaken superspy, which ruins the immersion. In terms of acting the ladies steal the show here, both K.Stewart and C.Britton are and look great (which i find really surprising for Stewart, because i didn't like her in ''The Twillight Saga'' and especially in the otherwise masterfull ''Snowhite and the Huntsman''). T.Grace and W.Goggins (despite his character being annoyingly absurd) provide also great support and they seem to be having a lot of fun. B.Pullman shows up for something more than a cameo and he is cool as always. The script and the dialogue could have been incredibly better if they had try a little more. J.Leguizamo unfortunately is completely underused. The climax is not as satisfying as it shouldOveral, as i said before, ''American Ultra'' has some issues, but if you want to be entertained for an hour and a half, i recommend you watching itRating: 5.9-6.0/10",American Ultra
