0,TheLittleSongbird,Some very impressive things but bland,6,2 August 2016,"At his best Steven Spielberg is a genius film-maker and director, and Roald Dahl was and still is one of my childhood favourite authors, of which 'The BFG' is a favourite.Spielberg's 'The BFG' sees him nowhere near at his best (being at his peak in the 70s and 80s), but at the same time this reviewer does think there is enough to stop it from being one of the low-points. It is not an awful film, far from it, but it does lack of the Spielberg and Dahl magic overall. Although it isn't perfect, the 1989 animated version captured the spirit of the story much more.It was disadvantaged by pretty bad advertising, that the title and story is not familiar to a lot of non-UK viewers (and many seemed very put off by some of the book's plot-line and themes) and that despite being a great story the original book doesn't lend itself well particularly to a 2 hour film.There are many things to like about 'The BFG'. It does look great (one of two improvements over the 1989 animated version), the production and set design are exquisite on the eye and it is beautifully shot and immaculately edited. John Williams' music score is rich in orchestration, lively, whimsical and emotion-searing, more fitting and cinematic sounding than the charming, atmospheric but somewhat very 80s soundtrack of the animated version.Best thing about 'The BFG' is the BFG himself. He is a wholly likable character and brilliantly motion-captured. This is matched in every way by the performance of Mark Rylance, which has a twinkle, warm humour and heartfelt subtle nuance, bringing surprising complexity and expertly soul to a motion-capture character that could have not had any of those qualities in lesser hands as well as a rare ability of bringing meaning and nuance to a line of dialogue when many struggle to bring the same amount of believability to a page.Ruby Barnhill to me was engaging as Sophie, and she has a promising future ahead of her. Really enjoyed the warm and touching chemistry between her and the BFG. While generally a better job could have been done with the rest of the giants, the acting for them is very effective particularly from a deliciously repellent Jermaine Clement as the Fleshlumpeater. Bill Hader also does well as the Bloodbottler, very different to other performances of his. Penelope Wilton is suitably sincere as the Queen, Rebecca Hall sparkles as Mary and Rafe Spall delights as Mr Tibbs.While there are changes, a good deal of the details are here and there are some effective scenes. Especially the rivetingly exciting opening kidnapping scene, the visually stunning and enchanting Land of Dreams sequence and the affecting blowing-of-the-dream-to-the-little-boy scene. Spielberg shows real technical brilliance throughout.However, 'The BFG' does suffer from pacing issues. It starts off great, but becomes inconsistent once in the Land of Giants. The first half is at times quite sluggish, conversely the climax feels rushed and at the same time lacking in urgency. A couple of scenes fall flat too, one does miss the heart-skipping-several-seconds impact of the Bloodbottler's first entrance here, which is nowhere near as frightening here, and although the Frobscottle is in the book it's overdone to overkill effect here with the otherwise visually entrancing and interesting breakfast scene for example, amongst others, marred by misplaced lowbrow humour (like the farting corgis, and for being too long).It has been said in this review that many of the details, though with also some changes, are here, but the spirit is lost. There is charm here, but it does feel so restrained emotionally it comes over as remote, while it lacks the darkness of the book and the magic of Spielberg's best work, instead often feeling too safe. Despite the acting, the giants not only do not have the wondrous attention to detail that the BFG does (with the CGI looking like over-sized cheapness in comparison) but are not terrifying enough and most are not very interesting or much different from one another. For example the Fleshlumpeater should be the most fearsome of the lot, but feels too much like an ordinary ""menacing"" giant.Overall, 'The BFG' has a number of impressive things but feels rather bland and too safe. 6/10 Bethany Cox",The BFG
1,Leofwine_draca,"Better than expected Dahl adaptation, courtesy of Spielberg",6,8 April 2017,"THE BFG is the second adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's book, following the 1989 animated version that featured the voice of David Jason. This one's a big-bucks Hollywood attempt at the tale, directed by none other than Steven Spielberg. After he made such a mess of his aimless and interminable TINTIN adaptation I wasn't expecting much, although I'm pleased to report that THE BFG is a rather pleasant surprise.This film is no masterpiece but it is quite watchable and it does seem to remain true to the book throughout; Spielberg's penchant for random CGI action scenes is limited to only one particular moment (the car skating scene). Otherwise, this has a pleasant, HARRY POTTER-style atmosphere, and it utilises some great CGI work to bring the BFG to life. I'm no big fan of Mark Rylance, but his voice is rather good here and fits the character very well. Ruby Barnhill is less assured as the slightly annoying child lead, but Penelope Wilton is great choice to play the queen late on in the story. THE BFG is rather overlong but at least it's never boring, and even the low brow humour works quite effectively.",The BFG
2,SnoopyStyle,not Spielberg's best,6,18 February 2017,"Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is a 10 year old English orphan. At the witching hour, Sophie spots the Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance) who takes her to the Giant world to avoid her alerting the public of their presence. The BFG is actually a vegetarian and the runt of the group. The other giants are bigger, bullies the BFG, and eat human beings. The BFG collects dreams and Sophie comes up with an idea to warn The Queen by manufacturing a nightmare about the human-eating giants.The Giant world is intriguing both visually and in substance. There may be some holes but it still works. Little Sophie has the required cuteness mixed with a pluckiness. Rylance is great. The adventure could be a lot more adventurous. There is turn before the third act which takes the magic of the story and plants it squarely into the modern world at a specific time. There is one fun joke but mostly, the story loses its magic. There is a way for the movie to fully satisfy its dark fable core but it seems to lose that thread. The movie is still fine but it's missing a truly heartfelt drama. The major difficulty is any comparison to Spielberg's earlier classics. The feeling is different and this will not be one of his celebrated best.",The BFG
3,Prismark10,Not as captivating,5,5 January 2019,"Roald Dahl's The BFG is brought to CGI life by Steven Spielberg.Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is a lonely 10 year old girl living in an orphanage. One night she spots outside her window the Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance) wandering around the streets of London. He takes her to giant country, his world of giants.The BFG cannot take the risk that Sophie will tell the world about him. However in his world, the BFG is not that much of a giant. He is friendly, he can read, he collects dreams and he is a vegetarian.The others giants are much bigger, crueller and eat humans. The BFG needs to protect Sophie from the other giants who might smell her.Sophie has a plan to forge a nightmare of giants eating British children and give it to Queen Elizabeth II. This would prompt her to send the army to battle these flesh eating giants.The special effects and the performance capture is very good. The story less so. The film is too long, sluggishly paced, I felt bored and once it gets to Buckingham Palace the film lost something when it entered the human world. There was no whimsy.",The BFG
4,claudio_carvalho,Pleasant Family Entertainment,6,30 October 2016,"In London, the insomniac orphan Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is awake late night at 3:00 AM afraid of the witching hour. Out of the blue, she sees a giant from the window of her orphanage and she hides in her bed. However the giant snatches Sophie and takes her to the distant Giant Country. He tells Sophie that she must stay with him for the rest of her life since she saw him. He explains that he works catching dreams and calls him Big Friend Giant or BFG (Mark Rylance). He also reads a book to Sophie and she sleeps; than he uses a nightmare to be afraid of escaping being eaten by an evil giant. Soon the giant breaks in BFG's cave and feels the smell of Sophie. She hides and soon she learns that there are giants that devours humans. BFG takes Sophie to the Dream country to catch dreams. The BFG goes to London to leave Sophie back in the orphanage, but she forces him to take her back to the Giant Country. However the other giants are hunting her down in BFG's home. What will they do?""The BFG"" is a pleasant family entertainment with a story of friendship for children. Adults will also enjoy the cinematography, special effects and soundtrack that are amazing and the girl Ruby Barnhill steals the show. The scenes with the green-colored drink Frobscottle, where the bubbles go down instead of up, are hilarious. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Bom Gigante Amigo"" (""The Good Giant Friend"")",The BFG
5,kosmasp,Be feeling great,7,2 March 2017,"The big friendly Giant by Steven Spielberg. What can go wrong right? Well apparently, if you believe in Box Office numbers a lot. Also the movie does have a section, that kind of puts the movie into a full stop. And while that ""dinner"" scene is kind of funny, it really stops everything. It feels like a set piece, conceived for laughs and to pander to the little ones.You be the judge if that worked. Because apart from that, the fantasy aspect of the movie is really good and it works. There is the kid who discovers a whole new world with someone who can be his friend. Although as you can imagine it's not that easy. It never is and the boy may feel a bit annoying at certain points. But he's also charming and the movie wouldn't have worked without him",The BFG
6,classicsoncall,"""Dreams is actually very mysterious things.""",8,20 March 2017,"I'm surprised at the low score and quite a few negative comments about the movie from the reviewers at IMDb. Personally, I go for the whimsical, so stories like ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Big Fish"" hold a kind of fascination for me, whether it be the written word or in a picture like this. The inventive language used is quite clever, odd enough to sound weird, but close enough to the English words that are represented to make it sound credible from the mouth of a twenty four foot giant. One of the surprises in the story (since I haven't read the source book), had to do with the fact that 'Runt', the BFG, was actually small by comparison to the other denizens of the Giant Country.Watching the movie with my eight year old granddaughter, I've never seen her laugh so hard or so long as when the three canine pets of The Queen (Penelope Wilton) did their double take upon drinking the frobscottle, sending them into a tizzy of whizzpoppers. It made me stop and reflect on a common element seen in almost every kids movie these days, a reference to passing gas that seems like a prerequisite of the script. Most of the time it feels like a juvenile attempt at a cheap joke, but here it was actually comical to see and I had a good chuckle myself.For my part, I got the biggest kick out of The Queen calling Nancy and Ronnie to inform them of the latest turn of events. So it made sense when I looked up some information on the actual novel, written in 1982, just a couple of years into the Reagan administration. I thought that was a clever tribute to the President and his wife in the picture. I'll have to check out the Roald Dahl book to see if it's mentioned there.The one drawback to the movie to my mind has to do with the unfortunate choice of title. When trailers for the film first came out I couldn't help but wince at the unintended connotation the name suggests. I don't have a particularly dirty mind, but it's hard to miss. I only mentioned it once to somebody and they immediately knew what I was talking about. So I think if they used ""The Big Friendly Giant"" as the title of the movie, it would have worked a whole lot better.Well, be that as it may, I had some fun with this picture, watching it a second time to pick up once again on the nuance of Runt's colloquialisms, stuff like 'bozzwinkles' and 'phizzwizard', all of which adds a charm and colorful character to the story. The young actress Ruby Barnhill seemed just right for the part of Sophie, developing a warm and special relationship with her new giant friend. When she states at one point ""It's just all rather hard to believe"", it becomes an invitation to the viewer to continue on a magical journey made special for the kid in all of us.",The BFG
7,jboothmillard,The BFG,5,4 August 2016,"There had already been a TV made animated movie with the voice of Sir David Jason, based on the children's book by the great Roald Dahl, the trailer for this live action adaptation certainly looked like it could be good, from director Steven Spielberg, returning to his family movie roots, like E.T., Hook and Jurassic Park. Basically orphaned ten-year-old girl Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) lives in a London orphanage, she suffers insomnia, one night she sees a giant lurking the dark streets outside, the giant captures her and takes her to Giant Country. The giant (Mark Rylance) explains that he is not like other giants, he does not eat human beings, he is the ""Big Friendly Giant"", or ""BFG"" as Sophie comes to call him, he only eats disgusting Snozzcumber, and drinks fizzy Frobscottle, which causes the drinker flatulation, or ""whizzpopping"" as the BFG says. The BFG explains that Sophie must stay with him the rest of her life, so she cannot tell anyone about the existence of giants, he mentions that his job is to give people dreams, she does not believe him, he manages to help her sleep with a story, and deliberately gives her a nightmare, about failing to escape Giant Country and being eaten by another giant. Sophie wakes up and is forced to hide, the fearsome leader the Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) enters the BFG's home and smells a human, the BFG encourages him to eat the Snozzcumber, which Sophie is hiding inside, but remembering he does not like eating vegetables, or drinking water, he leaves. Sophie's clothes are ruined by the juices of the Snozzcumber, the BFG provides her with new clothes, he has a strange reaction to a red jacket she finds to wear, the BFG plans to leave Sophie in a tree house while he goes out to capture dreams, but she convinces him to take her to Dream Country. On the way the man-eating giants are woken up, they throw the BFG around and humiliate him, the giants stop when a thunderstorm starts, giants hate getting wet, Sophie comes out from her hiding place tells the BFG that he should not allow the other giants to bully him, meanwhile the Fleshlumpeater and the Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) find Sophie's blanket, they realise there is human in Giant Country. The BFG and Sophie arrive in Dream Country and catch dreams together, including a good dream about Sophie and a nightmare, or a ""Trogglehumper"", the two then head to London for the BFG to use his trumpet and blow dreams into the bedrooms of sleeping children. Sophie realises she has lost her blanket, and the BFG knows that the man-eating giants know about her, being put to sleep Sophie wakes up outside the orphanage, the BFG explains that the last human child he took and raised was discovered and eaten by the other giants, but she convinces her to take her back to Giant Country with him. When they return to the BFG's home, the other giants, including Maidmasher (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson), Manhugger (Adam Godley), Butcher Boy (Michael David Adamthwaite), Bonecruncher (Daniel Bacon), Childchewer (Jonathan Holmes), Gizzardgulper (Chris Gibbs) and Meatdripper (Paul Moniz de Sa) trash the place searching for Sophie, destroying much of the BFG's hard work, Sophie evades them, while the BFG finally stands up to them and drives them away with a hot fire iron. While hiding, Sophie finds the home of the last human to live with the BFG, a young boy, among his belongings is a picture of Queen Victoria, she comes up with an idea to create a nightmare for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II (Penelope Wilton), about giants eating children, the army fighting them, and Sophie meeting her. Waking from her nightmare, the Queen meets Sophie and the BFG, they tell her and her servants Mary (Rebecca Hall) and Mr. Tibbs (Rafe Spall) the child- eating giants from her dream are real and must be stopped, after enjoying a large breakfast the Queen arranges for soldiers to follow the BFG to Giant Country. The BFG plans to give all the man-eating giants a nightmare that cause them guilt about eating children, all but the Fleshlumpeater are consumed by the bad dream, he tries to attack Sophie, but the army helicopter stops him and captures him, the giants are all taken to an isolated uncharted island, and much to their fury they will only be eating Snozzcumbers from now on. In the end, Sophie begins a new life in Buckingham Palace, Mary has adopted her, while the BFG has returned to Giant Country, and inspired by his time in England has started growing a wide variety of vegetables, he continues delivering dreams, and whenever Sophie feels lonely, which is less often than before, she knows that she can talk to the BFG, and he will hear her. Rylance with his twinkly- eyed kind nature and speaking his ""gobblefunk"" language is a very likable character, I agree newcomer Barnhill is perhaps a little dull as the young girl, and Wilton is a good choice to be the Queen, probably the best thing about this adaptation is the special effects, to make Rylance a big-eared vegetarian giant is all the magical colourful places and creatures is brilliant. This was the second time that of Dahl's books had been made again, following from Willy Wonka (1971) and Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), I would argue that the cartoon version is the one I prefer, as this feels emotionally remote and slow in places, even predictable, but you get the right amount of humour, including corgis farting, and children will certainly be entertained, it's an average but fun enough fantasy adventure. Worth watching!",The BFG
8,Quinoa1984,this is enchanting,8,4 July 2016,"I should be surprised that The BFG didn't do better this opening weekend, but I'm not (Pixar when they have something audiences want do so well that no one can come close), and with Secret Life of Pets out on Friday it doesn't stand much of chance of being a financial success. But as an artistic success it is a minor gem in Spielberg's filmography. It says a lot that a man who has been working over 45 years in movies can still make things so delightful, seemingly effortlessly, like the flick of a wrist in visual grandiosity and wonder, with his band of collaborators (Kaminski, Williams, Kahn, and here in a grand finale Mathison as writer, and Rylance who is now like Tarantino/Waltz, I can't wait to see more work from them).He, from Dahl's book, keeps on giving us things to look at and marvel. But it's a little tricky in a way; it doesn't move at a very fast-frenetic pace. Things move in a pace where nothing is too rushed, and Sophie discovers things in a way that moves more in a, do I say 'old fashioned' way? Ironically the film uses motion capture technology, and yet it's more advanced by now than from a decade ago with Polar Express. So what I would say to any parents worried their kids might be, well, 'bored', a) have a little more faith in your kids' attention spans, and b) this may be something that will bring children over and over for years to come. If it's not a success immediately it will be in the long run with audiences.I may be slightly biased since I loved the book as a kid (I remembered enough, some things were 'oh yeah' moments), but movies get screwed with all the time in adaptation, for better or worse. What works so well is the combination of a strong emotional core between Rylance as BFG and newcomer Ruby Barnhill as Sophie (she could, under the wrong direction, be cloying, but she is given just enough to show the wonder and discovery and also the intelligence that Sophie should have) with the whole world created that the giants live in, the BFG's cave. What's impressive too is that it's not sapping for sentimentality, the emotion's genuine between the actors, so that when characters separate at a key point (due to a past instance with a little boy and the 'human bean' eating giants), it resonates and makes an impact. Oh, and then at one point there's a Mel Brooks level fart joke. The BFG is a movie with a great sense of humor and often if it's not worth a laugh a smile will do.It surprises me the most to see many critics (not all, but more than I'd expect) say this is a lessor film from him, like he made another 1941 or Hook or War Horse. If I find someone make a defense of War Horse but spit on this movie, I don't know what to do for you. It has conflicts (the monstrous giants), it has surrealism (this is basically in essence Inception for kids), and it has a heart that means to be beating in the face of cynical a-holes. It's such a good movie I almost forgive England for leaving the EU! Will it be one of my favorites of the year, or on par with the last time Spielberg and Mathison brought together two lonely souls in a fantastical narrative? No, but few films are. It's a fitting follow-up though and seeing it on a big screen is one of the events of this summer for me.",The BFG

10,CinemaSerf,Speilberg does Dahl - and he does it well.,7,16 August 2020,"This is one of those stories that, like ""James and the Giant Peach"" reminds me fondly of being very, very young! It's a gentle tale of a young orphan ""Sophie"" (Ruby Barnhill) who espies a giant (Mark Rylance) from her bedroom window. He abducts her, takes her to his home and tells her she must remain there for ever because he has seen her! Initially frightened, she realises he is actually quite a kindly old soul who is bullied by the even bigger giants - the ones who kidnap other children and eat them all up. She and the BFG enlist the help of the Queen (Penelope Wilton) to put a stop to their mischief. This is a fun, charming adaptation with good animation to support the performances from Rylance and Barnhill. As with Dahl's original story, there is some humour in the dialogue and the characterisations are thoroughly engaging.",The BFG
11,oscaralbert,"Oddly, American families are resisting Disney cramming a message down their throats . . .",8,7 July 2016,". . . that child-killing cannibals deserve to spend their ""Golden Years"" feasting on an island paradise. This, of course, summarizes the climax of THE BFG. If you don't count THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN, most experts now consider BFG the Biggest Flop of director Steven Spielberg's career. For some strange reason, the U.S. public sees a difference between teens watching bikini girls being chomped by Killer Great Whites in JAWS, and toddlers being exposed to the suggestion of their peers getting gobbled alive in BFG. Probably many U.S. parents have checked out the source of such questionable material on Wikipedia, which says BFG author Roald Dahl was one of England's Disinformation spooks during WWII, thought that there was something about Jews in general that gave Hitler ""a reason"" for trying to exterminate them, and hated that plucky American ally Israel with a vengeance to his dying day. Dahl was merely one of that huge sector of snobby ""holier-than-thou"" self-styled ""British Elite"" which certainly includes Vanessa Redgrave and Eternal Queen Elizabeth II's uncle King Edward, all of whom have injected their anti-Semitic venom into the World's Culture since King David's time, and enabled Al Quaeda, ISIS, Hamas, the PLO, Hezbollah, ISIL, Boko Haram, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Republican Party to flourish into these so-called ""Modern Times.""

12,neil-476,Superb,10,23 May 2018,"Insomniac orphan Sophie sees something she shouldn't in the small hours, and finds herself whisked away to Giant Country in the company of an oddly-spoken giant who collects and dispenses dreams. But he is the smallest giant, and the others are bullies with a taste for human beans... After a cel-animated British TV version in 1989 (where the Big Friendly Giant was voiced by David Jason), Spielberg directs a big-budget cinema take on Roald Dahl's novel. And it is terrific. Dahl is a wonderful author for children (his adult work is less well-known, but also excellent) because, as well as having great stories, he never talks down to his audience, and never sugar-coats things. The BFG is fun despite, and perhaps also because of, its dark areas. The mix of CGI and real-life is done so well that you can never see the join. Real-life Ruby Barnhill as Sophie plays much of the film, which is largely a two-hander, with Mark Rylance's CGI BFG, and it is to their joint credit that the relationship between them is so genuine and affecting - despite their being on set together, the greenscreen and artificiality must have made it difficult to bond.The look of the fantasy throughout the film is flawless, and effortlessly pulls you in. The other giants are genuinely threatening, but just cartoonish enough to be funny, which takes the edge off the menace. Dahl's source material, augmented here and there, is clearly visible in the late Melissa Mathison's screenplay, especially the BFG's unique, hilarious and gloriumptious take on language. The story is simple but fun.For me, despite the eye-dazzling look of the movie (don't bother with the 3D, by the way, a distinct disappointment after Tintin), the chief joy here was the relationship between the two main characters. Ruby Barnhill is excellent as Sophie, but Rylance as the BFG is simply sublime, the touching subtlety of his performance crystal clear through performance capture applied to a character map based closely on his face. After a long and successful theatrical career, his screen work (big and small screens) over the last couple of years has been breath-taking and here, fittingly, it is magical.This film will be an all-time classic. In case it's not clear, I loved it.",The BFG
13,FlashCallahan,A Giant disappointment,2,21 July 2016,"Spielberg is one of the worlds most talented directors, and has always entertained and brought something special to his films. They have their own style, and there is always that 'Spielberg feel' to them.He invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws, reinvented it with Raiders Of The Ark, reinvented it again with Jurassic Park, and had some major summer hits with Tom Cruise in the noughites.So to hear that he was adapting one of the most beloved books of all time to the big screen, with one of the most reputable film studios in the world, was a dream come true.Sophie is in for a surprise when she meets the Big Friendly Giant. Scared at first, the young girl soon realises that the 24-foot colossus is actually gentle and charming.As their friendship grows, Sophie's presence attracts the unwanted attention of Bloodbottler, Fleshlumpeater and other giants.After travelling to London, Sophie and the BFG must convince Queen Elizabeth to help them get rid of all the bad giants once and for all.But the reality is an absolute nightmare.Although the film is pretty faithful to the book, and the initial sighting Sophie has of the titular character is breathtaking, it all goes downhill once Sophie enters the land of the giants.Gone is all that magic and love that Spielberg once had, the film is nothing more than an expensive special effects bonanza featuring a plethora of dead eyed giants, and one that resembles Mark Rylance.Whereas films like E.T, and even A.I had a wonderfully parental chemistry between the subject matter and their cinematic partners that gave the film that Spielberg sheen, this has nothing of the sort, and the relationship between Sophie and The B.F.G is virtually non existent.Even Temple Of Doom had a convincing paternal element in the relationship between Indy and Shortround.When we are in the land of the giants, I'm sure I could have gone into the projection booth, spliced a few scenes from warcraft into it, and no one would have been none the wiser.There's no urgency to the film, the effects, while impressive, just take up the majority of the second act, and most importantly, Spielberg just doesn't seem to have added any of his love, magic, or soul to this project.It's as almost if he thought it would be a licence to print money.A real disappointment.",The BFG
14,siderite,"A fairy tale, nothing too fancy",8,13 February 2017,"A little orphan girl befriends a mysterious giant that lives in Giant Country. There is little else in this two hour movie. The villains are just big bullies and the story itself is simplistic. Just revel in the amazingly kind facial expressions of Mark Rylance and the wide-eyed girlish charm of Ruby Barnhill and you will enjoy the film.I've seen there are many disappointed people, people that watched the movie expecting a return to form for Spielberg or imagining some rehash of the classic tearjerker story of a child befriending some scary but misunderstood monster. This is neither, as the story is based on a children's book by Roald Dahl dedicated to his daughter that died at the age of 7. Paradoxically, it's all about the dreams of little girls of living a full life and very little sadness.",The BFG
15,JamesHitchcock,A Gamble Which Deserves to Come Off,7,12 August 2016,"Sophie, a young girl from a London orphanage, meets and befriends a BFG. ""BFG"" is an acronym for ""Big Friendly Giant"", although this is something of a misnomer. Admittedly, the giant is friendly enough, but at only 24 feet high he is not particularly big by giant standards; most other giants are at least twice his size. Moreover, these other giants are also far from friendly. The main plot line concerns the attempts of Sophie and the BFG, assisted by the Queen and the British Army, to prevent an invasion of Britain by Big Unfriendly Child-Eating Giants.Filming of ""The BFG"" actually took place in Canada, but the director and co-producer Steven Spielberg keeps Roald Dahl's ostensible British setting, although this is perhaps a Britain which few Brits would recognise. The action seems to take place some time during the late 20th century, but Spielberg's vision of London nevertheless looks strangely Dickensian. This is a world in which the Queen can order the armed forces into action without consulting the Prime Minister or Parliament, although she does obtain the co-operation of the American and Russian leaders. There is a curious anomaly here. The American President is named Ron and has a wife called Nancy, a clear reference to the Reagans. His Russian counterpart is named Boris. The only recent Soviet or Russian leader with this name was Boris Yeltsin, who did not come to power until 1991, two years after Ronald Reagan had left office. Given that the story so obviously takes place in a fantasy world, however, I will not claim this as a goof.The special effects are excellent, as they need to be, as children (at least the older children for whom Dahl was writing) tend to be more picky about such things than adults. A fear that the state of the art in the eighties was not really advanced enough to cope may be part of the reason why we have had to wait so long for a live-action version of the tale. (There was, of course, a cartoon version in 1989). When the possibility of a live-action version was first mooted in the late nineties, the late Robin Williams was slated to take the title role, but he seems to have disappointed the producers who felt that his style of comedy did not fit with the BFG's personality. Congratulations are therefore due to Mark Rylance who takes the part here; to have succeeded in a role which defeated Williams, one of the greatest comic actors of recent years, is no mean feat. The BFG needs to be scary when he first appears, then benevolent but eccentric, and his idiosyncratic use of language needs to sound natural rather than contrived; Rylance succeeds on all these points. Congratulations are also due to Ruby Barnhill, who makes Sophie and adorable young heroine.Dahl's story is not particularly well-known internationally, so it was a brave move on Spielberg's part to turn it into a Hollywood movie, especially one with no major Hollywood stars. (In recent years he seems to have enjoyed taking risks of this sort. Neither ""Tintin"", based on a series of Belgian comic books little known in the States, nor ""War Horse"", a First World War story featuring important British, German and French characters, but not a single American one, struck me as being designed to appeal to the American market). In this case the risk does not seem to have paid off, as box-office takings in North America have reportedly been disappointing.It will be a pity if Spielberg's gamble does not come off. Some of Dahl's earlier children's stories, such as ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" or ""James and the Giant Peach"", were very much part of my own childhood, but ""The BFG"" did not come out until 1982, by which time I was at university, so I cannot claim to have treasured childhood memories of it. Nevertheless, it is clearly a well-loved children's classic, at least here in Britain, and this attempt to film it is a very decent one. 7/10",The BFG

17,Hellmant,"Classic Spielberg, but not quite.",8,20 July 2016,"'THE BFG': Four Stars (Out of Five)Director Steven Spielberg's new fantasy adventure flick, based on the classic 1982 children's book (of the same name) by Roald Dahl. It tells the story of a young orphan girl, that befriends a 'big friendly giant'. The two team up, on an adventure in 'Giant Country', to stop other giants from eating human children. The film reteams Spielberg with actor Mark Rylance (who won an Oscar for Spielberg's last film, 'BRIDGE OF SPIES'), and screenwriter Melissa Mathison (who also wrote 'E.T.', and a segment of 'TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE'; which Spielberg also directed). Rylance plays the title character; and the movie also costars Ruby Barnhill, Jemaine Clement, Penelope Wilton, Rebecca Hall, Rafe Spall and Bill Hader. The film was a bomb at the Box Office, but it got decent reviews from critics. I enjoyed it as well.Sophie (Barnhill) is a ten-year-old girl, that lives (unhappily) in a London orphanage. One night she witnesses a 24-foot elderly giant (Rylance) outside her window. The giant notices the girl has seen him, and he snatches her up (kidnapping her). He then takes Sophie to 'Giant Country', where the gentle giant is an outcast among other (meaner) giants. The two later start a friendship, and an adventure together. The movie is almost classic Spielberg, but not quite. It's definitely not in the same league as 'E.T.' (or 'TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE'). I did enjoy the film though, and it does feel like the type of movie I would have really liked as a kid. If I remember correctly, it also does decent justice to the classic source material; and it's somewhat nostalgic seeing that story depicted on screen again. The visuals are also stunningly beautiful to watch. I definitely wouldn't say it's a disappointment.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoRwrYi1UcY",The BFG
18,cherold,"Magical first half, but doesn't quite sustain itself",8,1 March 2017,"Recently I realized I hadn't see a Steven Spielberg movie for awhile, so I came to IMDb to see what he's been up to. There I saw something called The BFG, which I'd never even heard of - the first time I've ever not even heard of a Spielberg film.Turns out this was his biggest flop in North America - yes, this movie did worse than the execrable Always - and that's a shame, because it spite of its flaws, this is a lovely, magical film.The movie follows the adventures of Sophie, an spunky orphan living in a version of London seemingly unstuck in time and reality, who is kidnapped by a genial giant.The giant is wonderful. Computer animated via motion capture and as brilliantly played by Mark Rylance as his Oscar-winning performance as a Russian agent in Bridge of Spies, the giant is funny, charming, and incredibly real.The animation of the giant is lovely from the first scene of him sneaking his way across London, loping along then quickly and amusingly fading into the shadows. The interplay between feisty Sophie and befuddled BFG is engaging and real. Dream catching is wonderfully magic.Then, around halfway through, the movie goes back to London and something goes wrong.It's not that the movie becomes awful so much as it just becomes ordinary. If the first half of the movie has the magic of something like Cuaron's A Little Princess, the second half feels like some Disney movie from the '60s. In part, I'll admit that this is my reaction to the unlikely premise, but it's a kid movie and it's all unlikely so I can live with that. But somehow it all feels pedestrian from that point on.I don't know why this movie did so poorly. While it could have been better, I think my kid-self would have really liked this movie, and I wouldn't be surprised if this movie builds a reputation over time. If only the second half matched the first.",The BFG

It is great looking movie, but only because of a very good special effects. Acting by Mark Rylance was also pretty good and... that is basically all the best i can say about ""The BFG"". Story which is based on a book I've never read and and will never do is OK - i do believe that story whatever it is can be done into a good / great film - it is not about story, it is about everything else and the most important - script. In case of ""The BFG"" script isn't good. At all. I kinda lost my interest in this movie since like after first ~20 min. There wasn't anything really interesting, and ye, by saying nothing interesting when you see giants... Directing wasn't good as well i think because movie dragged like hell - it finished it in like ~3,4 days. Acting by Ruby Barnhill was more annoying then anything resembling to a natural performance. And i know i do sound like a hater here but trust me - this is one of the rare cases when you see all money spent on special effects, but there isn't anything good to see.Overall, ""The BFG"" is a huge disappointment for me.

22,Reno-Rangan,Little Sophie's giant adventure.,6,24 November 2016,"I did not dislike it, but I thought it was not creative enough. I had seen the British animation and this one retained the same story. Of course, which was originally from the book, but nothing new other than a decent computer graphics. I liked the performance of the little girl who had played the Sophie. She was the only live character until the final stage where more joins her. So she was wonderful along with Mark Rylance's CGI role.Straight to the point, the adventure begins right away. Sophie, the ten year old orphan girl was snatched by a giant named BFG after she witnessed him wandering on the street through her dorm room window on one midnight. Fearing she might expose the giant's existence, so he had to take her with him to his country. Then there they become very close, but a new threat arises when the other giants suspect of a human's existence in their enclosure. So fighting them, followed by a permanent solution to menace caused by them is what narrated in the rest.It was like Peter Jackson's 'The Lovely Bones' for Steven Spielberg, I mean the films that did not work for them. I anticipated a major surge in this by the family film specialist Spielber. Because I usually love his film, tell me who won't. From children to adults, his films targets all ages. But if you had seen the old version, then you will lose half the interest. That's definitely won't be the same for the kids, they will love it. There's no harm for watching it once, so go for it.6/10",The BFG

The visuals were simply incredible, especially once they entered Dream world, which featured some of the most spectacular images I've seen on screen. The production design and cinematography were awesome!I did find the little girl way too confident considering her circumstances and that was unfortunately not very believable, although her ultimate friendship with the BFG was sweet and rather special. The entire feel of the movie plummeted to a bit of silliness once they went to see the Queen, and it felt it was aimed at a young demographic. It had turned funny (in a non-humorist way) instead of fun. Despite this, I couldn't help but marvel at the visuals. In the giant world, I also found the giants to be too kiddie-ish. I understand Spielberg wanted to make a family film, but it lacked credibility.

24,tomgillespie2002,"Not a total failure, but a rambling, timid effort to bring a difficult book to the screen",5,11 February 2017,"It's been a whopping 25 years since Steve Spielberg's last real children's film, when he disappointed children and adults alike with his Peter Pan re-imagining Hook. After a long period of going back and forth between monochromatic, Oscar-wary history lessons and crowd-pleasing blockbuster fare, Hollywood's most famous director is back trying to win the hearts of both children and parents as he did with one of his most celebrated movies, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), with a passion project he's been considering for some time. He also reunites with E.T. screenwriter Melissa Mathison (who sadly died last year) to bring the notoriously tricky world of Roald Dahl to the big screen.Insomniac orphan Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) spends her nights either beneath her blanket pouring over books or roaming the halls of the orphanage looking for anything that may spark her interest. While up late one night, she shushes some drunks staggering home from the pub, only to glimpse the shadow of what looks like a giant hooded man. The figure gets closer and closer, until a giant hand reaches in through her window and whisks her and blanket both across the country. The mysterious monstrosity turns out to be a giant indeed, but a big, friendly one, played in motion capture by a wonderful Mark Rylance. The BFG is the runt of his litter in Giant Country, and is routinely bullied by the much bigger fellow giants that lurk on the land outside of his cave. The two outcasts will form a bond that will see their two worlds unite.Brian Cosgrove's beloved animated film from 1989 was incredibly close to the book, and was said to be a personal favourite of Dahl's. Yet a faithful page-to-screen adaptation of a terrific piece of literature doesn't necessarily result in a good movie, and having watched the cartoon relatively recently, I didn't find it very entertaining. Spielberg's update also stays quite close to Dahl's text, and it suffers from the same saggy narrative as the much shorter movie that came before did. Anyone hoping to keep their children entertained for a couple of hours may find them getting restless, as Spielberg is happy to take his time exploring this strange land. It's a decision I applaud, but it doesn't excuse an incredibly slow middle-section, as the BFG introduces the world of dream-catching, snozzcumbers and the joys of farting to the precocious Sophie, complete with rambling monologues and existential pondering.There's also a noticeable reluctance to explore the darker areas of the book, with the giants (played like Cockney bouncers by the likes of Jemaine Clement and Bill Hader) failing to live up their names (Fleslumpeater, Bloodbottler, Bonecruncher). They instead come across as bullying buffoons and not the child-munching monsters they are meant to be. If there is one thing the film gets totally right, it is with the casting of Rylance, fresh off his Oscar win for Bridge of Spies (2015). The wonderful effects by Weta perfectly capture the warmth and innocence of his performance, and his line delivery is pitch- perfect. Spielberg also goes all-out with Dahl's bizarre finale, which sees Sophie recruit the Queen herself (Penelope Wilton) and her trusted butler Mr. Tibbs (Rafe Spall) in her fight against the evil giants of Giant Country. It's a truly weird climax, but it's the only consistently funny part of the movie. Not a total failure by any stretch of the imagination, but a somewhat rambling, timid effort to bring a difficult book to the screen.",The BFG
25,eddie_baggins,"A ""Giant"" disappointment from Spielberg",4,4 July 2016,"Steven Spielberg doesn't make ""bad"" films; even his oft ridiculed 1941 isn't actually ""that bad"" and lets just forget about The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull but the Great Beared One's The BFG is certainly below middle of the road leaning towards downright average Spielbergian fare, which is a great big shame when you consider the seemingly perfectly suited combination of the famed director and author extraordinaire Roald Dahl.A beloved novel (and one I certainly enjoyed as a child) and an enjoyable animated feature, The BFG is an appealing tale that features wonder, intrigue and more than its fair share of potty humour (which makes up one of the films major set ups) and we all know Spielberg can handle himself when it comes to family entertainment but there's something strikingly off about The BFG, that whilst hard to pinpoint to an exact element, is enough to hamper the film for its entirety of its runtime even though there are glimpses of a much better film frequently appearing throughout.The film looks and sounds delightful, as you'd expect with the finely crafted CGI, the score from John Williams and the lens work from frequent Spielberg DOP Janusz Kaminski and after unearthing the underused and largely unknown Mark Rylance (now an Oscar winner) in Bridge of Spies last year, Spielberg and the British theatre staple produce an impressive BFG incarnation with Rylance's animated facial expressions and colourful portrayal of the runt of the giant litter a stand out in a film that finds trouble making us care for the characters that inhabit it and the narrative that drives it.Newcomer Ruby Barnhill gets the tricky job of making human lead Sophie work and while the young performer clearly has the attitude to become Sophie, it's not a memorable turn by any stretch of the imagination and Sophie often comes across as annoying rather than endearing and her friendship with the BFG doesn't ever get the warm and fuzzies going.The other (forgive me please) giant problem with The BFG is the actual source material and E.T screenwriter Melissa Mathison's adaptation of it. The film never really feels like it has anything on the line, never actually seems to be going anywhere fast and with a downright lacking finale the whole show feels like a non-event. It's strange for a Spielberg film to feel so as even his average films are still good fun whereas The BFG finds the esteemed filmmaker struggling to wring emotion, fun or excitement (even dream catching seems boring) out of a tale that on the basis of this effort seems far better suited to text rather than screen.A hugely disappointing experience and one that will likely get lost in the abundance of high and low class family films getting produced on a mass level in today's climate, The BFG marks what could be a career low point for Spielberg and one of 2016's biggest missed opportunities and even for the biggest Spielberg fans out there, this is a film you can safely miss seeing on the big screen and perhaps altogether. Not something you'd often say regarding the newest Spielberg blockbuster.2 bubbly beverages out of 5",The BFG
26,leplatypus,SFX (rental),7,20 August 2017,"So for me, it's Spielberg more enjoyable movie since Indy IV as it's shorter and more concise than his 140 historical movies. For sure, the pairing with Hook is inevitable (british fantasy) but i felt more to be in the Potterverse. The 2 lead actors, the BFG and the orphan girl are really impressive and one more time, Spielberg shows that he has a special gift with childhood. I found the London by night and Queen palace really beautiful and the dreams hill totally fantastic. The way Spielberg moves this giant BFG and grasps a whole dynamic moment is truly a signature from a master (it's not the head-achy bombing of frames done by most directors today !) However i don't know if it's still a movie : for me, a movie means reality and that's on it that comes emotion. Here i really wonder what's left untouched by computers ? Were the sets the usual green emptiness ? So it's more like an animation (a bit like his so-so Tintin) and that's why at the end, Hook is still better because nothing can't beat the real thing !",The BFG
27,leonblackwood,Looks amazing but the girl was annoying! 5/10,5,30 November 2016,"Review: Although I was really impressed with the look and mannerisms of the BFG (Mark Rylance), I must admit the little girl, Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) really got on my nerves. The magical story and amazing Giant country was great and I liked the different giants, who also looked brilliant but I was expecting more from Spielberg, in terms of the structure and casting of the film. The CGI was spot on, and the attention to detail was remarkable but from an entertainment point of view, I did struggle to put up with Sophie, who didn't seem that fussed about the whole unusual, out of this world situation. Anyway, whilst looking for food in the normal world, Sophie sees the BFG whilst reading her book late at night, in her orphanage, so the BFG kidnaps her, to make sure that she doesn't tell anyone about the giant people. Whilst staying in the BFG's house in the giant country, she soon works out that he is actually a friendly giant who doesn't mean her any harm but the other giants have a complete different outlook of life. They see humans as food, so the BFG has to protect Sophie from the outside world, even though she isn't scared of anything. There are other magical elements about the film, like the BFG's job as a dreamcatcher and the Queen helping them to fight against the baddie giants but you have go watch the film for it to make any sense. Personally, the main problem that I found with this movie was the annoying girl, who seemed like a little know-it-all but apart from that, it's definitely a CGI spectacular that truly looks amazing. Watchable!Round-Up: It's not very often that a Spielberg movie doesn't double or triple it's budget but he seems to be, just about breaking even lately. Bridge of Spies didn't even make the $100million mark but Lincoln made a healthy profit, like most of Daniel Day Lewis movies do. The Adventures of Tin Tin also made a healthy profit but it seemed to go in and out of people's mind very quickly. As for War Horse, although it made a profit, I don't think many people was impressed with the movie, which also goes for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skill, which was a big disappointment in my eyes. War of the Worlds, Munich, the Terminal, Minority Report and Catch Me if You Can were decent movies for that time but he will always be remembered for his earlier work, like E.T., Jaws, Close Encounters, Color Purple, the original Indiana movies and Jurassic Park. Because of people's high expectations, when it comes to a Spielberg film, it is still surprising when his projects turn out to be just OK, and not AMAZING! With that aside, he did do the Roald Dahl classic, justice and I can't think of a better director, to direct such a much loved book.Budget: $140million Worldwide Gross: $178millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/family/fantasy movies, starring and voiced by Mark Rylance, Ruby Barnhill, Penelope Wilton, Jemaine Clement, Rebecca Hall, Rafe Spall, Bill Hader, Adam Godley and Olafur Darri Olafsson. 5/10",The BFG

Based on Roald Dahl's original work, I was most certainly going into this with low expectations (not being a fan of the original film)...but was pleasantly surprised! This is actually really imaginative and one of those rare films where I was in awe of the magic and wonder. Mark Rylance was great as the giant, you feel connected to him throughout the film and his voicing talents were brilliant (especially since he comes from a Shakespeare background). The rest of the cast did fine, but there isn't actually that much dialogue. The majority of the story is actually told through the visuals and my goodness there is some impressive work here, truly outstanding effects. I did take me some time to get used to the live action and the effects blending together, but this was only a short time. Spielberg has done well yet again, but the problem is that the film is just too safe. It feels like it was made for the 1980's and does not add anything new to the genre. Also there are times when you feel like the story isn't going anywhere, 117 minutes might be quite long for the younger viewers.

The BFG is about a 10 year old girl called Sophie who lives in an orphanage in England. One night she sees a mysterious shadow figure and the mysterious fellow kidnaps Sophie and brings her to his home. Turns out this mysterious fellow is no other than the BFG(voiced by Mark Rylance)a dream catching giant who finds dreams both good and bad from people and he of course befriends Sophie. But some not so very nice giants are after the BFG and Sophie and the BFG tries to protect Sophie from getting caught. So will Sophie get a family in the end or will she stay with the BFG?Bottom line this is a very well made film. It did however take me a while to get into it all but the visuals and the cinematography blew me away. I liked the design of the BFG(Big Friendly Giant the BFG stands for btw)as it felt so real looking(the same animation they used for Jim Carrey in Disney's A Christmas Carol back in 2009)which used photo realistic imagery. The cast was very good I liked the girl that played Sophie(this was Ruby's first movie debut)and I thought the film overall was very good.My only downfall with this film is that there is some scary moments that involve these big mean giants and this may frighten younger children so beware of letting 5 or less than 5 year olds to see this film. If the child is 9 over then there should be no problems with you bringing your kids along. 7/10",The BFG

It seemed kind of weird for a movie directed by the great Steven Spielberg, especially a magical adventure for kids of all ages like this one.Based on a children's book by the same guy who wrote the book Willy Wonka was adapted from, comes the story of a ten year old girl who goes on a fantastic adventure after she befriends a big friendly giant.As far as the children fantasy goes it's a great story about two of the most unlikely people becoming best friends forever. The BFG has the perfect tone to put you into a child-like mood while you're watching the picture. The visual effects were great, absolutely well done when it comes to creating the world of the giants and making the BFG himself someone that can be related too rather than just a bland CGI character.But it's no ET. As far as Spielberg movies go, I've seen him do better in the subject of children's fantasy. The adventure does not flow as gracefully as it should, which causes it to feel really long at times. Maybe trying to be fateful to the book cause the dull pace in parts.But The little girl who they got to play the main character was cute and charming, and the semi-CGI BFG has more personality than most on screen digital images. It was very humorous with a humor appropriate for all ages and quite a lovely story. Overall, it's a winner.",The BFG
32,freemantle_uk,A weak offering from a usually great director,5,2 December 2017,"The live-action adaptation of The BFG sees Steven Spielberg return to making family films, a special-effects heavy film that is geared towards younger children despite it undertones involving cannibalism.Sophie (Ruth Barnhill) is an orphan in London who ends up being taken by a giant (Mark Rylance) after seeing him at 3 in the morning. In the land of giants Sophie discovers that the giant known as the Big Friendly Giant captures dreams so he can give them to people in the UK and is bullied by the other giants. With the giants posing a threat to the children of Britain Sophie and the BFG goes to the Queen of England (Penelope Wilton) to warn her.The BFG is a slapstick-heavy film, having nut-shots, smiley vegetables and show pleasure with green gassy farts. It's a film where even the Queen farts. It is a kid-friendly comedy especially for children who enjoy that try of humour but there isn't so much for adults.Spielberg does add a level of whimsy and wonder particularly when The BFG enter into a world where he captures dreams and then gives a family happy dreams. This is done through the colours and John Williams' score and there is a great amount of detail like in the BFG's home. Some great moments are when the camera follows Sophie around a location when she is avoiding being seen by the other giants. Yet some of the CGI for the giants falls into the uncanny valley territory.The BFG has a great cast and Barnhill is a revelation as Sophie, being forceful when needed and performed well considering she would have been working mostly with a green screen. Rylance worked well with Spielberg in Bridge of Spies and he offers a gentleness as the BFG. Jermaine Clement was unrecognisable as the leader of the giants and Wilton is perfectly regal as The Queen. The film even has Rebecca Hall as the Queen's assistant and has connection with Sophie.The BFG is a film that children will easily enjoy but as their get older will not look back at it as fondly.",The BFG

It is based on a 1982 children's book by Roald Dahl. There was an earlier 1989 animated British movie but it was made for video & TV so this is the first live action adaptation-with lots of CGI. I have not read the book so that may explain some of my confusion. The movie looks great but some of the storyline was hard to understand. Mark is a 24 foot tall giant-his brothers are all taller, at 39-50 feet tall-that spends his nights capturing dreams and giving them to people while they sleep. Ruby is an orphan that sees Mark performing his nightly duties, so he kidnaps her and takes her to giant land-he doesn't want her telling anyone about him. Mark has to hide her from his brothers because they are people eaters-they usually kidnap children during the night to use as snacks-unlike himself, a vegetarian. Bill is one of the taller brothers that likes to pick on Mark because he is shorter than they are. It's not long until Mark & Ruby are best friends, in fact Ruby starts calling him BFG, or Big Friendly Giant. They develop a plan to get rid of the mean brothers by going to the Queen, played by Penelope, and getting her help. Some of the hard to understand parts-at least to me- included where Mark got the dreams, in the first place-a tree under water. Then there is the green bubbly liquid Mark drinks-the bubbles travel downwards so instead of burping after you drink it, well..... let's just say, the gas comes out the other end of a body. The language Mark uses is a weird mixed up version of English-using words like Rumpledumpus & squigglybum. I'm sure that it is for comical effect but I guess I'm not in on it enough-you know, too old. I'm not sure if younger children will enjoy the movie-We had a 7 year old girl with us and she was bored. It's rated ""PG"" for action/peril, scary moments and rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. It would be alright, as a rental.",The BFG
34,drqshadow-reviews,"A Flimsy, Effect-Reliant Effort Which Lacks the Magic of Dahl's Book and Spielberg's Preceding Films",5,5 July 2016,"Steven Spielberg's doggedly loyal adaptation of a Roald Dahl classic, sadly, doesn't have much oomph. It's the narrow tale of an orphaned girl, abducted and (eventually) befriended by a steep, thin, heart-of-gold giant, who goes on to discover they have an awful lot in common. Originally a short story that was later expanded into a full novel, I can't remember the book feeling nearly as thin and stretched as the film does. It's got a nice message, some vague warm-fuzzies, a fair piece of physical acting (unsurprisingly, given the cast's stage credentials), but the central relationship is missing some intangibles and the looming threat never actually seems all that important. Spielberg and company took the sugar-coated route, skipping much of the menace that might have earned the film a stiffer rating, and along the way they slashed out its teeth. The dreamy, surreal CG is problematic, too. Often the fairy tale renderings seem more sharp and textured than the live actors, as if they're occupying two different realities in the same space, and that took me out of the scenery on several occasions. Mildly entertaining, but too effects-reliant for its own good. The journey is about so much more than the shape and color of the paths we've walked.",The BFG
35,alindsay-al,An above average family friendly film,6,10 August 2016,"I am a big fan of Steven Spielberg and of some of roal Dahl's books so I did want to watch the bfg and this is an alright film. The premise of the film sees a young girl taken to giant country by the bfg where they attempt to understand each other. Mark rylance coming off of his Oscar win for his role in bridge of spies plays the bfg in this film and he is fantastic in this film. He comes across as the lovable giant that he is supposed to be and you do grow to really like him in this character and he is definitely the best thing in this film. Ruby barnhill plays Sophie and She gives a good child performance in this film. She has good chemistry with rylance and he is quite a cute young girl who you believe in this film. Unfortunately everybody else in this film is incredibly dull an you won't care about any of them whether human or giant. The story has a nice story about this relationship between this girl and the bfg as they understand each other and grow to become friends. But apart from that there isn't a threat to them that you take at all seriously and the film just doesn't have enough going on it for you to care as an adult. The script has some fun dialogue involving the bfg's dialogue. There is however, allot of child humour that comes across as lazy. Also there really isn't any drama in this film at all. The style has some marvelous CGI especially for the bfg. This film though is quite slowly paced and many families will find it a bit long to watch. Overall this is a decent family film but it isn't one of Spielberg's best so if that's why your seeing this film then I may skip this one.",The BFG
36,iquine,Giant Yawn,5,2 June 2017,"(Flash Review)The movie is rather plot less and more of an adventure with a kind giant and stereotypical yet non-charming British girl. The message of its OK to be different is sort of obscured within the story for a movie that felt to be aimed at 13 year olds. The Giant steals this girl out of an unfriendly orphanage which never ended up being a problem point for the story. Hard to describe this movie, which is a bad thing. Basically, the two become good friends as other bigger giants pester them both. The friendly giant is a dreamcatcher and can give anyone good or bad dreams. So he plants some dreams within the British royalty to help hatch a plan to get rid of the bad giants. I dunno.unique and arguably poor graphics with a few poster-quality images but it needed a better plot or writing or more intrigue. The pacing was off or some scenes should have been trimmed.

40,peterp-450-298716,"A magical fairy-tale. It'll surely entertain little kids (especially when the ""frobscottle"" appears)",7,18 November 2016,"""Where am I? Giant country!"" Steven Spielberg knows how to bring the magical world of Roald Dahl to life on a screen in a masterly way. Occasionally I need to watch a not too complicated or weighty film. Such a film that takes you to an enchanting, carefree world and to forget about everyday worries for a while. This time it's a lovable little girl, Sophie (Ruby Barnhill), who after seeing the big friendly giant wandering through the dark streets of London is kidnapped by him and taken to Giant Country. Just like Mowgli in ""The Jungle Book"", Sophie is surrounded by computer-generated animations. But not completely. The face of the BFG looked quite familiar. Afterwards I discovered that Mark Rylance, who recently starred as Rudolf Abel in ""Bridge of Spies"" (also directed by Spielberg and he received an Academy Award for it), was the one whose face was used to shape the friendly, vegetarian giant.Again, it's admirable how a little puny girl must act in a void, because I think the whole country inhabited by the giant giants is just a room filled with blue screens. Especially the majestic scene where she goes hunting for dreams along with the gentle giant, is a prime example of technological magic. When the less peaceful giants start looking for Sophie, those images made me think of ""Jack the Giant Slayer"". And the made-up language used by the friendly giant, proves where J.K. Rowling took inspiration from so she could design the quirky lingo her characters spoke in the Potter series. But it's particularly the shaping and impressive design that you're gazing at with open mouth. The landscapes in Giant Country and the home of BFG is detailed and sharply imaged. But especially old London looks fantastic. Nocturnal London where the big friendly giant wanders around so he can blow his dream into the children's bedrooms and where he ingeniously (and sometimes hilariously) manages to hide for wandering night owls.Most importantly is to let yourself be carried away in this wonderful world, otherwise it all looks rather childish. The film isn't particularly terrifying. This makes it suitable for little kids. And they'll amuse themselves when the gentle giant pulls out his home-brewed ""frobscottle"". Drinking this greenish substance results in a fairly serious form of flatulence. Normally you'll see comical situations with lots of farting or belching in a vulgar comedy. But here it produces some hilarious moments (even in the presence of the Queen).There's actually nothing negative to say about this movie. Besides the fact that it was never really exciting or impressive. Maybe I'm not so easily impressed by something and are we already accustomed to these fabulous gadgets used in the world of movies. But I didn't experience that wow feeling when watching ""The BFG"". It wasn't like the first ""Harry Potter"" movie. Or the first part of ""The Lord of the Rings"". There wasn't that magical atmosphere that makes it seem like you were teleported to another imaginary world. And that's what I missed in this, especially charming, fairy tale. In a way it's also a touching story. The not so big giant, eating slimy cucumber-like vegetables instead of human flesh and thereby being bullied. And then there's that vulnerable little girl jumping into the breach for him. An engaging and simultaneously amusing story that younger children can enjoy. In other words, a suitable family film.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",The BFG
41,jadepietro,Good but Smogswallowed by Its Own Heavy-Handedness,8,9 July 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Spielberg in childhood mode misses the magic but still entertains.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: An orphan accidentally sees a giant and sets off series of events.JIM'S REVIEW: When I taught third grade, two of the most popular books during read-aloud time, by far, were by Roald Dahl. James and the Giant Peach and The BFG, the latter receiving the most joyous response from my students, were prime examples of the author's macabre humor and imaginative plotting. I don't know if it was the book itself, or just hearing the teacher read gibberish vocabulary and dealing with fart jokes which were aplenty in his story of a little orphan and a big friendly giant. The same effect can be found in this fine movie adaptation by Steven Spielberg, but not the same outcome. ￼Technically, the film has lovely moments, largely due to Janusz Kaminski's rousing photography. However, unlike the original source, this version has no real heart or emotional bond. Whereas the short novel had Dahl's droll humor and humongous tons of charm, the film adaptation has a lot of filler that edges on a more serious tone. The additional plotting just pads the story into a full length motion picture experience. Spielberg's film relies more on adventurous chases and needless backstories which neither enhance or explain anything. ￼ The BFG stars Mark Rylance as the title character and newcomer Ruby Barnhill as his pal, Sophie. Abducted by the giant late one night, Sophie is transplanted into a world of giants, not as kind as her soft-spoken Big Friendly Giant a.k.a. BFG. This giant is the more sensitive kind, who catches dreams to share with sleeping youngsters later on his evening sojourns to London. But there are much larger and evil giants in the world that pose a danger to little Sophie, like the Fleshlumpeater, the biggest and baddest bully and leader of the whole lot. They would like to eat our heroine, a human ""bean"", or any other tasty children for that matter. So Sophie and the BFG team up to stop them and enlist the aid of the Queen of England.The film successfully visualizes many scenes from the book. The opening sequence of Sophie's capture, her visit to the Land of Dreams, and a delightful scene of the BFG having a lavish breakfast with the Queen are spot-on. Mr. Spielberg also keeps Mr. Dahl's wondrous invented vocabulary front and center which immediately establishes the sweet nature of the BFG...words like strawbunkles (strawberries), trogglehumper (nightmare), snozzcumber (a foul-tasting vegetable), frobscottle (a fizzy drink that causes whizpopping (farting). When delivered by the talented Mr. Rylance, the dialog sound like comic poetry.￼But the film itself remains inconsistent in tone, logic, and visual look. At times, the scale of tiny Sophie and other surrounding objects, including the BFG, tends to fluctuate. The time frame of this tale varies as well. The production design of the orphanage and London streets seems like Victorian England, yet there is Queen Elizabeth, and not Victoria, on the throne. Later on, a clear mention of the Reagans being in office dates the film to the eighties. A real time warp.Mr. Rylance does some wonderful subtle acting with his CGI portrayal, but I personally found some of the special effects too artificially produced, especially whenever the side views of the giant came into play. (The head and elongated neck seemed too unconvincing, but the large ears did help complete the character well and matched Quentin Blake's classic illustrations. Frontally and in close-up, the BFG imagery worked very well.) Ms. Barnhill does a good job as Sophie and Jermaine Clement as the Fleshlumpeater provides enough menace. Penelope Wilton as The Queen brings that upper English class to her role.￼The late Melissa Mathison's screenplay has many of the components of the book. It just doesn't have the magic that I expected from all the talent involved. The film can be as effervescent as a ""frobscottle"" but it also go flat, spinning its own wheels. Just as the BFG himself, the film has trouble making up its mind. Still quite entertaining, this film version of The BFG ultimately becomes ""smogswallowed"" by its own heavy-handed plot devicesANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",The BFG

Yes, it does have its slow spots and could certainly use better editing, but it can be quite wondrous, humorous, and has some important messages to relay as well.I thought the scenes with the Queen (Penelope Wilton) were highly imaginative, funny, and warm-hearted. Both Mark Rylance and young Ruby Barnhill were excellent in their lead roles.As others have noted, this is not the best Spielberg film ever, but perhaps over time it will gain more favor. The late Melissa Mathis wrote the screenplay, as she did for Spielberg's classic ""E.T."". It's based, of course, on the great Roald Dahl book.All in all, I agree with those that don't think this movie deserves the pummeling it's getting, and I feel there's lots to like here, for those that want to give it a chance.",The BFG

45,bkrauser-81-311064,Closer to Hook than E.T.,7,2 July 2016,"In the highly adored Spielberg classic E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), the protagonist Elliot lures the titular E.T. into his home using M&Ms. E.T. fumbles about the boy's room; they exchange glances, they mimic each other's movements, they greet each other. The BFG is an attempt to sustain the same sense of wonder Elliot feels when first meeting E.T. only this time replace Elliot with a precocious little girl named Sophie (Barnhill). It's a sense of wonder that courses through the film like the lucid flickers of a waking dream; it's majestic, it's magical and its unabashedly sentimental. Unfortunately, like waking up from a dream, a sudden stumble can really ruin the experience. A tossing turn can end a dream with an unceremonious thud which regretfully happens in The BFG.The film takes no time in introducing its audience to Sophie and BFG (Big Friendly Giant) played by Mark Rylance in all his motion capture glory. Sophie is whisked away from the orphanage she tolerates to Giant Country where BFG is but the small and abused runt of a litter of giants with names like Bloodbottler (Hader) and Bonecruncher (Bacon). The largest and meanest of them all is Fleshlumpeater (Clement) who is partial to eating children. After avoiding the keen noses of the nine cannibalistic giants, Sophie follows BFG to dream country where the lonely giant bottles dreams and shares them with the sleeping children of the world.The BFG is based on a children's book of the same name written by Roald Dahl. The film remains highly faithful to the book almost to a fault. It takes a while to really get into the world of The BFG partially because of a near constant injection of whimsy. Thus for the first half-hour we must be guided by a sea of linguistic context clues and Sophie's stubborn pluck. Seriously, these giants sound like Eliza Doolittle had a run-in with Alex and his droogs.Yet eventually like a seedling, the film grows on you. It replaces its moments of caprice and forced mawkishness with real sentiment. It's coaxed largely by the growing relationship between the child and the giant, one of which has surprising cleverness while the other has a folksy simplicity about him. It is moments like the ones in dream country that are not only a feast for the eyes but provide the very best narrative charge to elevate the art of film itself.The beauty of The BFG and director Steven Spielberg's entire oeuvre is his ability to world-build. Spielberg doesn't just give you the tour, he envelopes you into a fiction you can almost touch. It certainly helps that he lets his actors interact as much as possible with the intricate details and adorning accouterments. A lesser director would have cut corners, making and updated version of The Devil-Doll (1936) but not Spielberg. Every hoist of the giant's hand, every impish step and every jump into a snozzcumber gives a tactility. A tactility that legitimizes the giant's home, dream country et al. as more than just a studio set.The film then once again devolves into a cluster of technically impressive but hollow set pieces, syrupy ""stand up for yourself"" clichés and a third act that gives the phrase deus ex machina a queenly quality. The sustained wonder dissipates under the weight of some unnecessary world mixing. I realize most large events in the film are also in the book but surely we could have gotten the giant eating tiny pieces of toast through some other means. Also by this point, a long percolating joke slides to its punchline just long enough to make the kiddos laugh and grandma get the vapors.Though it's all for the sake of the children and while I've been a long proponent for improving the state of children's films, The BFG is ultimately far from rubbish. It's certainly no E.T. but the tactile and seamless world-building brings to mind Hook (1991) which wasn't perfect but does still leave a nostalgic residue. The BFG will undoubtedly leave a similar impression of young children who watch it and with a message of hope, acceptance and friendship it's certainly more tolerable than The Care Bears Movie (1985).",The BFG

Mark Rylance is great as the titular BFG and Ruby Barnhill is convincing as the little Sophie. The relationship built between the characters is heart warming. The story is fine, but not particularly memorable. It has a good deal of heart, and the visuals are enticing. The plot, however, is slow in the first half and quite underwhelming, and by the time it reaches the climax, it's already predictable and a bit of a letdown.
On the whole, the film is beautiful to look at as the visuals effects of the Giants are stunning.

49,Troy_Campbell,Endearing and admirable.,8,5 July 2016,"With sensibilities aligning, Steven Spielberg and Roald Dahl are a match made in cinematic heaven. In fact, they're such a snug fit that it's unfathomable this is the first time the genius filmmaker has tackled the legendary author's work. But tackled it he has, and the result is a beguiling, sweet, and old-fashioned tall tale that wears its heart on its sleeve and veers away from the modern-day mould of action-packed and joke-filled family flicks. Despite grappling with serious themes such as bullying, lost friendship and growing up in foster care, the film is balanced with light-hearted moments that even extend to downright silliness, keeping the mood from becoming too sombre. Spielberg is as Spielberg does though, hence his trademark sentimentality is in full swing here with long stretches of slow and contemplative scenes that, although meticulously and gorgeously crafted, will test the patience of younger audience members. The handful of set pieces may be spread out few and far between, but when they arrive they're nothing short of inventive, exhilarating and superbly executed; assisted by the beautiful and flawless computer effects. Employing motion-capture technology to breathe life into the giants works a treat too, in particular for the eponymous over-sized creature who is gifted a wonderfully heartfelt performance by Oscar-winner Mark Rylance. Acting opposite Rylance is the altogether less-experienced, 11 year-old newcomer Ruby Barnhill, who is highly impressive as orphan Sophie, the precocious and brave young girl who inspires the BFG to take a stand against his bullies. Its languishing pace and ponderous tone might not be to everyone's liking, especially those seeking some simple holiday fun, but The BFG is an admirable and endearing motion picture that'll likely stand the test of time.",The BFG
50,pyrocitor,"Bland, Fart-heavy, (but still) Glowing with Spielberg magic",7,15 July 2016,"Speaking of bottled dreams, try this one: it's 1992. Steven Spielberg's Hook, his Peter Pan passion project, is a smash hit. His follow-up box office darling: an adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved children's classic The BFG, reuniting him with Hook champion Robin Williams (as the titular giant), and perfectly geared towards the first generation of children to grow up reading the book. The project was a dream. So, naturally, it didn't come true. Fast-forward 14 years, and Spielberg's BFG hits cinemas with a new star (RIP Robin), and a lacklustre audience of kids now likely less versed in Dahl than their iPad. Talk about nightmares And yet, Spielberg's first kid's film since Hook is so warm, earnest, and nostalgic, it's oddly fitting to play as anachronistic. Like its titular behemoth, The BFG is visually awe-inspiring, but clumsy, lumbering, and prone to spouting well-meaning gibberish. Yet, as a vessel for heart - pure, old fashioned, un-cynical, complete with note of lamenting urgency -The BFG is Spielberg to a tee, and it's absolutely worth being swept away to giant country with him. Compared to past cinematic cracks at Dahl, Spielberg is remarkably faithful, with passages and images transposed verbatim from the text. In many cases - the garbmarbled, gobblefunking talklarking of Dahl's giant-speak, for one - the delightful lilt of the novel translates perfectly. However, unfettered whimsy can come at a cost, and the film's pacing and emotional arc suffer heavily for paralleling, rather than adapting, Dahl's novel. The introduction - protagonist Sophie's abduction to giant country from her Dickensian orphanage - is vintage Spielberg: mysterious and magical, ominous and fiendishly exciting. However, after ascertaining that Sophie's captor, BFG, does not intend to gobble her up, the film's middle section lags tremendously, with the wonders of the BFG's workshop scarcely masking the gossamer-thin plot. Like Bridge of Spies, The BFG shows excellent Spielberg work become plodding and snoozy through overindulgent editing, risking losing kids (or adults) to their own dreams, no matter how many pretty lights and scary giants on screen. Even more distressing: seeing the (debatably) greatest living film director taking the wrong notes from Peter Jackson's despicable Hobbit trilogy. Behold: a surplus of silent side characters (the giants, apart from Jemaine Clement's Fleshlumpeater, suffer from indiscernible dwarf syndrome), eschewing character development in favour of overly convoluted, physics-flouting chase sequences. Here, the under-cooked BFG-bullying subplot is boiled down to a vaguely cringe-worthy scene of the 'mean giants' playing chicken, rolling BFG down a mountain towards a giant rollerskating on cars. For, um, some reason. As the film's only real conflict necessitates Sophie inciting BFG to rise up against their murderous cruelty, it would help if Spielberg hadn't drained the majority of their nastiness away on screen - let's not forget that Dahl's novel begins with the BFG pontificating about the tastiest humans, before countering that humans constantly ""squishing"" each other in war is less justifiable than the giants eating to live. Grim. So, is the film worth it? Unfrozziloutly, yes. Naturally, it's visually sumptuous, with tactful CGI and impressively credible performance capture work. Similarly, a pre-climax visit with the Queen, who unquestioningly lends military support to the giant conflict (ahh, dreams) is so deliciously demented, you can imagine Dahl himself cackling along with an auditorium of children at the dopey farting corgi slapstick. Still, it takes visiting the dreamworld for Spielberg to really remind us all why he's here. The underwater, gravity-inverting dream tree, ensconced in flickering, multicoloured sprites, is mesmerizingly gorgeous, striking up the film's primary motivation of dreams and escapism making the troubles of the world amount to a hill of (human) beans. In one sequence, the BFG's bottled dream is broadcast on the wall - a shadow puppet play through a movie projector. It's as brazen a horn-toot to the value of cinema without a winking Spielberg stepping out from behind a camera, like Martin Scorsese in Hugo. It's an intentionally quaint idea - can't things just be pleasant, full stop? - and you can practically taste the desperation in Spielberg trying to sell it so full throttle here. But in its quieter, simpler, gentler moments, The BFG truly does remind us of what dreams are made of. Newcomer Ruby Barnhill brings a spunky yet vulnerable edge to Sophie, making her inhabitation of the 'precocious orphan girl' archetype particularly endearing. Still, there's no question that it's Mark Rylance's eerily perfect BFG who's the highlight. Infusing his adorable bumbling with a breezy, gruff silliness (his cackling at the rocket-propelled farting-er-'whizzpopping' is what sells the otherwise stale gag) and puppy dog sadness, Rylance is arguably the most fully realized and lovable motion captured character since Gollum. Jemaine Clement brings a perfect cocktail of threat and goofiness to ringleader giant Fleshlumpeater, managing to squeeze every ounce of menace out of ""I has a boo-boo,"" while Penelope Wilton remains delightfully regal amidst the silliest of scenarios as the chummy Queen we'd all love to pretend really heads the Monarchy. Rebecca Hall and Rafe Spall are fun, but largely wasted as the Queen's attendees. Keep your eyes peeled for stellar background work from a cabal of Vancouver actors (shout out to Paul Moniz de Sá as the superbly comically windmilling, top-heavy giant Meatdripper and ""Lout #3,"" and William Samples, master of the affronted double-take, as an incredulous royal footman). Breezy Feel Good; Banal Fluffy Galvani (I *barely* resisted the temptation to write this review entirely in acronyms), Spielberg's penchant for ""Only good dreams"" may make his BFG somewhat flimsier and more forgettable than anticipated. But that's the thing about giants - there's so much of them to love, and as BFG quips, ""I is not right all the time; quite often I is left"". So, for a film that encapsulates pleasantness and charm in every sense of the words, Spielberg's BFG is, yes, a dream come true. -7/10",The BFG

They were all written by the late Roald Dahl. This children's author specialized in finding magic within a modern world. He understood that children could be just as adult while the adults can be just as childish given the situation. He also understood that the world, no matter how pretty it is, can be a mean place and figured that children can take a lot of scary imagery. Stories like these have made reading fun for kids that wanted to feel like they were just as important as their parents were. Today's movie The BFG is another Roald Dahl adaptation that I'm surprised hasn't been made yet. I remember it being made as an animated movie (that I still recall that we never finished due to a parent complaint of the scary images despite being rated G). If this was going to be given a live action treatment, then I'm glad Steven Spielberg is in charge, as I've wanted him to give family films another try. E.T. and Hook showed that he understood children, so let's see if the magic still there in The BFG. Within a London orphanage, a young girl Sophie (played by Ruby Barnhill). She can't sleep, so she keeps herself busy by reading an occasionally looking out into the night. During one look behind the curtain, she spots a giant. The giant takes her, out of the city, into the countryside, before they end up in another realm called ""Giant Country"". She's taken inside a cottage where Sophie begs not to be eaten. The giant (played by Mark Rylance) reveals he's a giant that refuses to eat people and in fact introduces himself as the BFG (Big Friendly Giant). Sophie finds that the BFG is responsible for catching dreams in Dream country in order to spread to various people. She also sees the other giants, which make the BFG a runt compared to their fifty-foot height. These other giants are responsible for recent disappearances of other children that have gone missing (and are hinted to have been eaten as well). Sophie decides that the only person that can help is the Queen, so the BFG mixes up elements to hopefully make into a dream that will convince the Queen to help stop the other giants.It's nice to see Spielberg return to making family movies. Is The BFG the right movie for him? I'm a bit mixed on this as he has plenty of things done well and other parts not as well. I'll say that the casting on both the BFG and Sophie are really good. Spielberg has a talent for using children actors well and Ruby Barnhill is just as good as Elliot from E.T. or Christian Bale in Empire of the Sun. Thanks to the magic of motion capture, Mark Rylance brings a lot of life to this giant. Like Gollum in Lord of the Rings, the effects on the giant are really good and will probably last well after future effects overtake it.It's a good thing that both characters are interesting, because this family movie is surprisingly dialogue heavy. Not that it's a bad thing, though I think most kids going in with their parents were expecting something more action orientated. Much of the big action doesn't happen until the last thirty minutes, but the rest is full of the whimsy you'd expect out of a Spielberg family movie. What's lacking is a flowing story, which is one of the few times when a book's context needed more expansion within it's transition to the big screen. Had we gotten more of an insight on the land of the giants and how they get around on the Earth, I'd probably like this more.I'll give this six snozzcumbers out of ten. This is one of Spielberg's weaker movies, though it still remains a good story for kids. I'd say that this is for older children, like at least eight and above. Those under will probably see The BFG as slow and boring. This Roald Dahl story does enough that families will be entertained by this, though whether it has rewatch value will be up to the viewer. I'd say give it a watch and see if this film is a giant in your mind.",The BFG
55,cultfilmfan,Roald Dahl's The Big Friendly Giant,10,1 July 2016,"As a child, whenever I read one of Roald Dahl's novels, or short stories was an absolute joy for me in every way possible. I remember one birthday in particular where I was probably 9, or 10 years old and I received the book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and I remember each night coming home from school and even during school such as on lunch breaks, or at recess reading this book along with various other Dahl favourites (I don't think there were ever any I didn't like) and just completely falling in love with the books and the author's writing style itself. I credit Roald Dahl as an author who inspired me to read at a young age and now 20 years later, I may be reading different material, or sometimes more mature fare, but it was because of Dahl and his wonderful imagination, witty sense of writing and sometimes delightfully dark and yet humorous stories that made me continue to want to read and added some escapism and pleasure to a childhood that was mostly good, but especially helped out in the more turbulent times because I could escape into one of his books and put away my childhood worries and cares for a time. I eventually sought out many of the film adaptations that were made of his books such as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, The Witches, Matilda, James and the Giant Peach, Fantastic Mr. Fox and now The BFG and because Dahl was so expressive with his writing and could completely transport us into other worlds, manners of speech and over the top yet fascinating characters, all of the above mentioned films were complete successes and I would like to add that Steven Spielberg's new version of his classic The BFG fits along with those classic titles and should become a hit with both adults and children and belongs with the very best of the genre. Spielberg here teams up with his E.T. The Extra Terrestrial screenwriter, Melissa Mathison who as any kid who grew up in the 80's, or 90's can tell you that E.T. was a staple in their childhoods and I remember myself that whenever I had a pick of a film at the local video store at that age, that E.T. would most likely be the first film I would pick up and bring home, even having seen it for the umpteenth time. I also know people who watched their VHS copies so much that the tapes themselves wore out from so much use. The sign of a much loved item. Here again over 30 years later, Mathison and Spielberg are still able to create magic and a long lasting classic that will both appeal to adults and the youngest of children. It has been close to 20 years since I last read The BFG, but watching the film, everything came back to me and it was like I was discovering one of my childhood treasures all over again. Mathison's screenplay which is full of wonder and amazement and also takes us into a new world with wonderfully rich characters, Dahl's wonderful mangling of the English language (I mean that in the best way possible) and also wonderful lessons for children such as about friendship, bullying and believing in yourself. The film also most importantly is a lot of fun and I was in an audience that was laughing when the film was funny and even close to tears in the beautiful and sentimental moments that didn't feel false, but felt beautifully captured and enriching all the same. The special effects are kept to a minimum and what we do have visual wise is so beautiful and truly spectacular to look at that it is one of the most visually pleasing and stunning films that I have seen on the big screen in quite some time. The acting by Mark Rylance, Ruby Barnhill among others is terrifically expressive and yet they seem to have a great time in this film and we are along every step of the way with them and when they are having fun, so are we, when they are scared, so are we and we connect with them and love being with these characters and watching them. Truly a beautiful film that is a wonderful and fun time for children, but beneath the surface also teaches valuable life lessons and truths and encouragement that every child needs. One of the best films of this year and one of the best family films of this year, or really any other. Highly recommended.",The BFG

57,eminkl,The journey is about so much more than the shape and color of the paths we've walked.,5,18 April 2020,"Steven Spielberg's doggedly loyal adaptation of a Roald Dahl classic, sadly, doesn't have much oomph. It's the narrow tale of an orphaned girl, abducted and (eventually) befriended by a steep, thin, heart-of-gold giant, who goes on to discover they have an awful lot in common. Originally a short story that was later expanded into a full novel, I can't remember the book feeling nearly as thin and stretched as the film does. It's got a nice message, some vague warm-fuzzies, a fair piece of physical acting (unsurprisingly, given the cast's stage credentials), but the central relationship is missing some intangibles and the looming threat never actually seems all that important. Spielberg and company took the sugar-coated route, skipping much of the menace that might have earned the film a stiffer rating, and along the way they slashed out its teeth. The dreamy, surreal CG is problematic, too. Often the fairy tale renderings seem more sharp and textured than the live actors, as if they're occupying two different realities in the same space, and that took me out of the scenery on several occasions. Mildly entertaining, but too effects-reliant for its own good. The journey is about so much more than the shape and color of the paths we've walked.",The BFG
58,dave-mcclain,"""The BFG"" is a delightful and imaginative family film which is a worthy successor to director Steven Spielberg's ""E.T."".",7,1 July 2016,"Sometimes the talent that comes together for a certain movie is simply incredible. Take the family fantasy adventure ""The BFG"" (PG, 1:57) for example. The film co-stars 2015 Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner Mark Rylance (in the title role) and Ruby Barnhill who, much like Neel Sethi in 2016's ""The Jungle Book"", as a child, had to carry much of the film – and is perfect for the role. Co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, ""The BFG"" has Spielberg directing his first film for Disney. And one of America's greatest directors has involved much of his dream team of filmmakers in this project. That list, according to IMDb.com, includes ""two-time Oscar-winning cinematographer / director of photography (DOP) Janusz Kaminski; two-time Oscar-winning production designer Rick Carter; three time Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn, ACE; Oscar-nominated costume designer Joanna Johnston, and legendary five-time Oscar winning composer John Williams"", as well as the late screenwriter Melissa Mathison, who had previously written Spielberg's classic family film ""E.T. the Extra-terrestrial"". With ""The BFG"", Mathison (who died of cancer towards the end of production) was adapting the book of the same title by British novelist Roald Dahl, who also wrote ""James and the Giant Peach"", ""Matilda"", ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" – and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""! Mind. Blown. A cinematic pedigree like that begs the question of whether the first live-action adaptation of ""The BFG"" is worthy of all the talent that went into bringing it to the big screen. The answer, in a word, is yes.Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is a 10-year-old living in a London orphanage. One night, she hears something outside her window and takes a look outside. She sees something that she wasn't supposed to see – a real-life giant (Mark Rylance in a motion-capture performance). Not wanting his existence revealed, the giant grabs Sophie and spirits her away to his house in Giant Country far to the north. This spunky and resourceful little girl tries to get away, but the giant doesn't let her – for his safety and for hers. The irony is that, in Giant Country, this giant is actually a runt, and is referred to as such by his fellow giants. He's 24-feet-tall, but there are nine of THEM living nearby who are at least twice his size and who use their height and strength advantage to harass him and take from him anything he has that they want.At this point, what the other giants want is Sophie. Most giants, including these nine, do eat children (according to the reputation of giants), but not the one who refers to himself as ""The Big Friendly Giant"", and whom Sophie takes to simply calling ""BFG"". As BFG hides and protects Sophie from the others and as he and Sophie bond over their mutual feelings of being put-upon out-casts, Sophie and the BFG become BFFs. The BFG even involves Sophie in his work, which involves capturing, bottling and even mixing and manipulating dreams. He uses his talents for good, trying to bring joy to the lives of children around England (which is what he was doing when Sophie first spotted him), but he can also use his expertise to disseminate bad dreams and manipulate people (ala Leo and company in ""Inception"").Sophie comes up with an idea to end the threats posed by the other giants – the threat to the BFG, as well as the threat to herself and to all the other children whom these oversized meat-eaters pursue. Sophie wants to go back into London and take the problem to the queen herself (Penelope Wilton from ""Downton Abbey""). For Sophie's plan to work, the BFG is going to have to use all of his abilities and literally step out of the shadows. Even if all that works out, this unlikely pair is going to have to convince the queen and her aide (Rebecca Hall) and an overly cautious head of security (Rafe Spall) that all this is for real – then come up with a way to neutralize nine huge giants. All that amounts to a very tall order.""The BFG"" is a delightful and imaginative family film which is a worthy successor to Spielberg's ""E.T."". Featuring a friendship as unlikely as that boy named Elliot and a certain short, wrinkly alien with a heart of gold, this film is similarly touching, but not quite as emotionally engaging. What it may lack in emotional resonance, however, it makes up for in charm and terrific visuals. Some of the scenes are simply beautiful and are enhanced by 3D glasses, but the best reason to watch this film in 3D is the realism it lends to its settings and its CG characters. The script feels a bit contrived and disjointed in parts, but overall, it's well worth getting to know ""The BFG"". ""B+""",The BFG
59,markthomassintek,Steven Spielberg has done it again!,8,17 August 2017,"The BFG review Steven Spielberg has done it again! A story about bullying and social acceptance that was wonderful as a book, even better as an animated cartoon but the film is a glorious spectacle of acting, scenery, effects but most of all an underlying message which will be enjoyed by young and old, especially the scene where the queen is having breakfast with the BFG and Sophie (watch the Corgies!

60,bob-the-movie-man,Spielberg in his lower quartile.,5,28 July 2016,"As a big fan of Spielberg I was rather disappointed by ""The BFG"". In the SFR (Spielberg Film Ranking) it is more at the ""1941"" and ""Crystal Skull"" end than at the ""ET"" and ""JAWS"" end. This is a film squarely aimed at the kids market (and there's nothing wrong with that) but even for kids films there is no excuse for poor execution.The BFG, as virtually every parent is aware, tells the story of little 'insomniacal' orphan Sophie (newcomer Ruby Barnhill) - espying and being carried off by the titular Big Friendly Giant (a CGI'd Mark Rylance) in the middle of the night. The BFG's job is to catch dreams and blow them into the heads of sleeping people. He's friendly but his bullying colleagues in the Land of the Giants are not, liking very much the taste of 'human beans'. The rebellious Sophie determines to jolt the BFG out of his servile state to take on his repressors; something that will require the help of people in high places.On the positive side, the look of the film is glorious from the opening 'Mary Poppinised' views of London to the BFGs home and the 'land of dreams'. Spielberg regulars Janusz Kaminsky drives the beautiful cinematography and Michael Kahn the crisp editing. Also worthy of note is the Production Design and set decoration on which the credibility of a film like this relies.Mark Rylance also injects great charisma into his facial expressions which, at the moments where the film turns (overly in my view) soppy and sentimental, do move you. And there are some (OK, about two) really laugh out loud moments with flatulent Corgis being a high-point.However there seems to be minimal chemistry developed between Sophie and the BFG, and it constantly feels that they are filming this in different places (which they very possibly were). While I hate to be critical of a young person, this seems to be down to the performance of Barnhill. Spielberg is normally the master of pulling out epic performances from his kid actors (think of Cary Guffrey in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" or Drew Barrymore in ""ET"") yet - whilst young Ruby is perfectly sweet and pleasant - there doesn't seem to be that depth or range in the actress to make you believe she is particularly scared at the beginning (wouldn't you need a blanket wash?) or having the gumption to drive the giant to such actions.I feel even worse about my next criticism - screenwriter Melissa Mathison (""ET"") - since this was her last screenplay before dying in November last year at the early age of 65 (and the film is dedicated to her). ""Dreams is so quick on the outside but long on the inside"" says the BFG, and at times some of the dialogue feels far too 'long on the inside'. A problem here is that Roald Dahl's story is rather slight, but the screenplay seriously struggles in padding it out to the 2 hour running time. Given the attention span of youngsters, Spielberg would have done well to make this a 90 minute movie. While the film very occasionally kicks into gear, significant chunks are, unfortunately, just plain dull.The script also seems to lack an anchor for its time and place. The Queen (the excellent Penelope Wilton) is familiar as our monarch, but a comedic reference to ""Prime Minister Boris"" is immediately punctured by a confusing US reference to Nancy and Ronald! Why not Barack and Michelle? Bizarre! The soundtrack is by the great John Willams, but this is not one of his best. I remember an interview with the Maestro where Alfred Hitchcock advised the young composer on the set of ""Family Plot"" to stop the music at one point to signify the emptiness of a room. There are times in this film where you wish he still held to that advice, since at times the music is jarringly obtrusive and irritating, mimicking in percussion every little dream that zips across the screen.For balance, in this summer of repeated terrorist horror and distress, this is a dose of escapism that should be welcomed. (It would be nice to think that all these troubles could be solved by helicoptering all the bad guys in the world to a remote island with nothing to eat but snozzcumbers!) And I'm sure that many a 6 or 7 year old will simply delight in the film. But I can't help thinking it should have been much better, and perhaps might have been better enlivened as a musical, with Tim Minchin lyrics to add a bit of parental zip.As a final serious note to parents, there is a point at which Sophie jumps out of a high window expecting the BFG to catch her: in the same way that the old ""Batman"" TV series had an Adam West/Burt Ward led pre-clip telling kids not to copy their antics, I would suggest that any susceptible young children need a stern talking to that all of this is ""just pretend"".(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man to see the graphical version of this review.

The way they present dishes is so cute and funny. But what I don't understand is why the Queen is so kind to adopt Sophie and let her stay in the palace like a princess. Yes, I know that she helped to defeat the other giants, but is it enough to praise her and let her be a princess? Then why don't they do the same to BFG?

62,bryank-04844,'The BFG' is so sweet.,7,23 January 2017,"I'm just thankful that Steven Spielberg is not doing awful period pieces like his last films, including 'Lincoln', 'War Horse', and 'Bridge of Spies'. Yes, those films won Oscars, but I'm willing to bet you've only seen the once and will never see them again. I'm thankful and excited that Spielberg has returned, at least for a few films into his magical world of sci-fi, which he excels at. This time around, Spielberg is tackling the children's story of 'The BFG' or 'Big Friendly Giant', by the great author Roald Dahl ('Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', 'Matilda', 'James and the Giant Peach', and 'The Witches').There are quite a few similarities to Spielberg's opus 'E.T.', in which a creature befriends a small kid and they go on adventures and connect with one another. Even the late Melissa Mathison, who wrote 'E.T.', wrote the screenplay to 'The BFG'. If you're looking for some of those 80's Spielberg moments, then you'll definitely find them here. That being said, iI don't think it all holds as much weight or charm as his early films did. In fact, I think this film plays more to the younger crowd than it does to the adults.Sure, there are things for everyone, but I imagine that farting corgis will only go so far for laughs. If you're unfamiliar with the story, 'The BFG' follows a young orphan girl named Sophie (the brilliant Ruby Barnhill), who is quick on her feet and a food natured soul. There are talks about giants who eat humans in town, and one night, a giant grabs little Sophie. Fortunately for her, this giant (Mark Rylance) is a friendly giant who catches dreams and nightmares from a dream tree and delivers the good ones to humans while they sleep.Sophie and the BFG form a friendship with his hilarious and charming dialect and language, and she teaches him some proper etiquette. Just outside his house, away from the real world, lives a group of mean old giants, who look more like barbarians, and who eat humans and especially little kids. Jermaine Clement from 'Flight of the Conchords' and Bill Hader provide some of the voices for the mean giants here and are quite funny. This world that Spielberg has created is magnificent. The vast views of the sea and green pastures, as well as the BFG's home is so much fun and full of little fun details, that it would take multiple viewings to catch everything. Everything just seems so magical about it.Soon enough, Sophie and The BFG go to the actual Queen of England and enlist her help to take care of the bad giants. The scene where the BFG is in the Queen's castle is truly funny and will be a big hit with the kids. Ruby Barnhill is amazing as Sophie and just emulates a strong presence and confidence in her role at all times. She is charming and fun to watch on screen. I hope she sticks around for a while, because she has good acting chops.Mark Rylance as the BFG is excellent as well, and even though it is all on motion capture, his voice work and movements are simply amazing and life-like. I just don't think there is enough emotional weight or charm that would make this film one of Spielberg's best. Still, this is a great movie and one that I would certainly watch again. And of course, when you get Spielberg, you get composer John Williams, who again, brings another great and memorable score.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",The BFG

64,virek213,Spielberg In Giant Country,9,5 July 2016,"In terms of writing children's books, Roald Dahl has to be among the most unconventional. Instead of necessarily being safe-and-sane reading material for the younger set, his books such as ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"", ""Charlie And The Great Glass Elevator"", and ""James And The Giant Peach"" frequently evince a wicked sense of humor. And yet they have found their way into being essential reading material in libraries and for kids, subsequently becoming big-screen adventures, much like Tolkien's ""Lord Of The Rings"" series and J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" books. This also turned out to be the case for his 1982 book The BFG (standing for Big Friendly Giant), although it would take extreme advances in animation into the digital age over a three and a half decade span to get there. Fortunately, it got made, and it ended up in the hands of Steven Spielberg.In this film, Ruby Barnhill portrays Sophie, a young girl with a vivid imagination but left in a London orphanage who one night is whisked away to ""Giant Country"" by the Big Friendly Giant of the title, voiced by Mark Rylance (who had won a Best Supporting Oscar in 2015 for his role as KGB spy Rudolf Abel in Spielberg's Cold War drama BRIDGE OF SPIES). Barnhill is openly frightened of Rylance's slightly uncouth and menacing behavior, but she soon comes to see that Rylance himself is at the mercy of the other giants in Giant Country (voiced by Bill Hader, Jemaine Clement, and others) who are not only very mean and menacing, but who are also on the scent for any human intervention, and consider Rylance a disgrace to their kind. Rylance, talking with a vaguely Cockney accent and with a penchant for some off-color humor, sees a great deal of goodness in himself because of Barnhill's presence in his world. In the end, knowing that the evil giants plan to do Rylance extreme bodily harm, Barnhill conjures up a dream with Rylance's help to get the help of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria (Penelope Wilton) and the whole of the British military to exile the giants. Of course, the 24 foot-tall Rylance's initial appearance in the Real World, as opposed to Giant Country, is jarring to Wilton and her royal military.Spielberg, at least up until SCHINDLER""S LIST, and with a few stories beyond that 1993 Holocaust epic, was known for, among other things, placing children in extraordinary situations. The best example of that was, of course, with his 1982 sci-fi masterpiece E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, which, like THE BFG, was also scripted by Melissa Mathison, and which also featured a plethora of special effects. In terms of THE BFG, it was a story that had pretty much fascinated him from the time of the book's 1982 publication; but his interest in it accelerated when he became a father in the late 1980s. All the same, however, it took another twenty-five years for his vision of what THE BFG could be to become a reality, because he had become more involved in works that were either darker in tone or dealt with serious historical material (MUNICH; LINCOLN; BRIDGE OF SPIES). And the most ironic thing, given how the films he directed with children in prominent roles earned him comparisons with Walt Disney, is that he managed to make THE BFG for the Disney studio itself. But he also needed to make the mix between live-action and digital animation, something that he had only tried a handful of times before, work convincingly and seamlessly.Fortunately, he had found this in allowing Rylance to essay the role of BFG; and though a fairly obvious mix of the two styles, the mix of animation and live action works with another solid performance from Rylance. Barnhill also gives one of the best performances by a child actor in Spielberg's canon, right up there with Henry Thomas' in E.T., Haley Joel Osment in A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, and Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards in JURASSIC PARK.The film, which is dedicated to Mathison (who passed away in 2015), also features the return of John Williams to the Spielberg film-scoring fold after turning over the reins to Thomas Newman on BRIDGE OF SPIES. Though some of the ""humor"" in THE BFG is not necessarily for all kids, this doesn't mean it's a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it is a really solid film by every stretch of the imagination.",The BFG

66,griffolyon12,Spielberg Conjures Another Masterpiece,9,1 July 2016,"Director Steven Spielberg has created yet another masterpiece, with this one being a gentle adaptation of Roald Dahl's kid lit book, The BFG. The BFG is nothing short of brilliant, with imagination on display at every turn. The movie follows the titular Big Friendly Giant (or BFG as he comes to be known), as he befriends a human girl named Sophie and whisks her away to giant country, where the BFG is the runt of a litter of larger, more violent giants. Throughout the course of the movie you really get to know Sophie and the BFG, with the two of them forging a friendship due to their shared circumstances. Both are lonely souls who others think less of, and in the eyes of each other, they discover what it means to be a better human ""bean,"" as the BFG would put it.Newcomer Ruby Barnhill plays Sophie with wide-eyed wonder and sass, immediately making Sophie an adorable heroine you want to root for. Then there is recent Oscar winner, and current Spielberg muse, Mark Rylance, stealing each scene he's in as the BFG. Rylance has this uncanny ability to convey deep wells of emotion with nothing other than his eyes. He truly is a marvel to watch on screen, and when you go from his work in Bridge of Spies to his work as the BFG, you see a completely different actor. The BFG is a warm and gentle soul lacking in bravery, who only wants to help deliver the dreams he catches up in dream country to sleeping people. Perhaps the greatest marvel of this movie though, is the fact that the special effects manage to make us believe that Ruby Barnhill is interacting with a twenty-four foot tall Mark Rylance.Through the use of CGI and motion capture work, the special effects crew manage to capture every element of Mark Rylance's performance and make it writ large. I have seen many movies that try to show us giants interacting with humans, but there is often an odd feeling to the difference in scale. I never had that feeling with The BFG. I truly believed that Sophie and the BFG were there together in every scene, and that allows the magic spell of this movie to be cast.When you get right down to it, The BFG is not an in your face adventure movie, it's a rather simple bedtime story. There's not a lot of violence, nor are there any real scares (except for when the BFG is bullied by his fellow giants), and the crudest thing the movie has within it is the greatest farting scene I've ever seen in a movie. The BFG is easily Spielberg's most child appropriate movie he's ever made. It is sweet, funny, and will have your imagination in overdrive the entire time. Couple the gorgeous images from longtime Spielberg cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, with the beautiful musical score by John Williams, and the great script by the late E.T. scribe, Melissa Mathison, and you've got another Spielberg classic. Will it be remembered as fondly as E.T. or Raiders of the Lost Ark? Probably not, but it could very well be on the same plain as Spielberg movies like Hook and War Horse, which is not bad company to share.I give The BFG a 9 out of 10!",The BFG

It's more for the interaction between the girl and the giant, and in that department the movie delivers. Sure there were some childish jokes, but there were plenty of other moments that made me laugh out loud without involving body functions.I don't get why so many people hated on this movie.

I like Roald Dahl's stories (I used to read them to my classes and the children loved them), but I never got around to The BFG. The movie is well set and beautifully filmed as one would expect from Spielberg but I don't think the story is strong enough for a big movie the like of which this is supposed to be. It has had some good reviews, mainly praising Mark Rylance's portrayal of the giant but I am afraid I do not rate him as an actor at all. I have only seen him on the small screen and really could not accept him as a good performer. Many people are raving about his stage work so maybe that is where it is at. To be fair I have only watched about 30 minutes of the film so far but it has failed to grab me at all. In fact I am about to switch it off through boredom. Spielberg's work has always impressed me previously with the emotion,story telling and the visuals but this has missed the mark big time.",The BFG

Well, I'll tell you...Two hours of randomly assembled scenes of shiny inanity suffused with terrific computer generated artistry. But the artistry was wasted as every other aspect of the film failed to match it.An extremely annoying child with a horrible northern (English) accent meets a puny, self-loathing giant elf. They become chums and decide to ask the Queen of England for help in their quest to stop the really big giants eating all the children. The helicopters swoop in and save the day!At first, I thought this was simply another instance of the arrogance of Hollywood inflicting their sadistic will on humanity. But the more I think about it, the more I think that, actually, Hollywood is deliberately churning out this disgraceful bilge-water so kids will start reading books again! There's no other explanation that I can think of as to how this travesty of celluloid ever got past the 'ideas on the back of a napkin' stage!Even the rubbish TV cartoon version made in 1989 outwits this crap-fest on every level - apart from the aforementioned visual effects!The movie is very slow... not helped by the extremely simple story. The plot seems to have been padded out with lengthy scenes of shiny, bright lights just to meet the minimum required running time that a movie has to have. All the humor is misguided, misplaced and unfunny... ALL of it... although I did enjoy the two farting dogs!Not one of the characters has any appeal... apart from the brilliant farting dogs! You just want to punch the stupid girl in the face and shoot the miserable giant elf in the temple... The entire Buckingham House scene should have been cut out. It was just embarrassing to sit through.Oh, and if your kids do see this - you'd better tell them that if they jump out of tall buildings there won't be anyone there to catch them! Yeah... incredibly, this actually happened!Is Spielberg working like a food critic these days? You know... someone eats at the restaurant, writes the review and the big name foodie gets the credit?

With its mispronunciations (human beans), nonsense words (swollomp), preoccupation with flatulence and weird plot elements (but WHERE IS Giant Country?) it 195 pages can seem much, much longer. Getting back to Giant Country for a moment, the book takes place in 1983 and presumably, giants have been freely moving between realms for hundreds of years. Only now Queen Victoria thinks to send in the helicopters to end the reign of terror? It doesn't even take that many of them to do it. Anyway, Spielberg's direction holds firm to Dahl's vision bringing his giants to life in a way that seems to conform exactly to how every child pictured them. Except for the uncanny valley problem. Spielberg's digital renderings are near enough to human to make the giants appear like dead-eyed automatons innervated for the amusement of popcorn-munching audiences and waiting for the sweet, sweet release of oblivion after their Spielbergian master tires of them. The scenes between Sophie and the Queen come as some relief. In short, a fully realized adaptation of the source material and all that entails.

I was wondering how good it's going to be since it's been a while since Spielberg directed a family movie. This movie has a lot going on for it. The acting is great. Mark Rylance is doing a phenomenal job as the giant. He really gave the character a unique special feel. The CGI is also great! Really really excellent!The only minor problem I had with this movie is that half way through you realize it's more for children. Maybe shouldn't be a surprise considering the book it is based on is a children book but once they introduced the character of the queen it became very apparent. Not Spielberg's fault. It's the story itself. I personally thought that if the characters stayed in the magical land of giants it would have been better. What I mean is, keep the story in the magic world and not try and bring it back to ours but for that Spielberg had to change the story which I understand can a problem. All in all it's a good film.

The movie itself is magnificent staying true to its origin the message that this movie has is a graceful one, it teaches you to stand up to bullies, I noticed the message quite soon in the movie and that's without having read the book, the message is executed perfectly and I couldn't have expected something this extraordinary. A major part i have to comment on is the visual effects they used in this, it was actually mind blowing how incredible it all looked, usually i feel in this day and age CGI is overly used but in the movies case it was amazing. I also felt that Ruby Barnhill (Sophie) done an amazing job as well as the man himself Mark Rylance (BFG) a truly beautiful peformance.I highly recommend this to everyone but especially anyone facing a hard time being bullied as this movie shows that message perfectly, enough to cheer you up in the darkest of times, enjoy the movie and good luck in life!",The BFG

That being said I entered the cinema hopeful.Overall: This is not Spielberg's finest moment and this review may get rated down but I just think this movie is not worth your time.Good: The visuals and motion capture are magical and sensational. This movie really demonstrated Spielberg's gift to inspire awe and wonder in his audience but that doesn't save the movie sadly.Bad: Personally, not one single joke made me laugh or even crack a smile. That might be me just watching plenty of great comedies recently or just having high hopes from the book but who knows. I imagine it would be good for youngsters as I could see some laughing around me, however I soulfully believe the best family movies bring something to the table everyone can enjoy thoroughly but this just seems to cater for children. Secondly, the movie grinds to a rusty halt during act two and failed to capture my attention besides some pretty colours and flashy lights. It picks up in Act Three but by then I was just bored. Thirdly, this may be controversial but I feel like they could have toned down Sophies smart alek attitude which was in the books. That is a minor gripe but still though it could have been done better. Sophies acting was well above average was a child but I still didn't feel invested with her character despite loving the book. There are multiple more I could list but this would probably be too long and it's dragging already.Best Part: The first viewing of the dream tree was stunning and truly expresses Spielberg's gift.4/10 Sorry Steve",The BFG
77,James_De_Bello,4/10,4,20 August 2016,"Sophie (Ruby Barnhill), an orphan girl, encounters the Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance) one night in London. He takes her to his home in Giant Land and, despite his intimidating appearance, turns out to be a kind-hearted soul who is considered an outcast by the other giants because, unlike them, he refuses to eat children.Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest filmmakers there is no doubt about that. Ever since ""The Terminal"" though I have found it hard to fully enjoy a picture of his, ""Bridge of Spies"" being definitely the best one, yet still leaving me slightly cold. Here however, I was presented with an absolute disaster of a film, which proved to be so hurtful knowing from where it was coming from, there was no heads nor tails to be made out of the mess I experienced.I mean the only merits I can really attribute the film is that its not nasty or mean in any way, its heart is in a good place even if that is not really a saving element when there is no morality to your story. Visiually the film is remarkable too, the combination of practical and CGI is really seamless, much more so than Spielberg's past efforts. Moreover, as always we get a distinct visual world and there are many shots in the film that are as complicated and brilliant as they are technically advanced. Yet, even that, in the eyes of this mess of a story, proved to be quite a useless feature.Were to start to point out what isn't working in a film where story-wise nothing is working? I mean right from the opening sequence of the film I had no idea what was going on. The while first act was cut into the first 90 seconds. We aren't shown who Sophie is, we don't get to know her and we are already experiencing her adventure, but there is absolutely no conflict whatsoever. The BFG moreover proves to be the most adorable giant ever right from the moment we see him, once again proving there is absolutely no conflict.We are then presented to an extravaganza of story disaster when about three different plots are weaved together into a senseless mess. First we're into this whole dream story-line, then we are fighting giants and then finally we go where? To the Queen? I could not believe my eyes. But that's not even the worst part. We are served a full quarter of an hour sequence were Sophie and the BFG are served breakfast. I am not joking. We spend a full quarter of hour in this totally ridiculous scene with zero character beats. I was almost starting to get offended.There is no correlation to what is going on on-screen. It is just random events happening one after the other, which are supposed to feel sweat and fairy-tale-like solely because we have John Williams playful score playing in the background. I mean there is no moral, no thematic undertaking the film does, no character goes on a journey of change especially because we aren't shown these people in a situation that's different from where the conflict is supposed to be. What we end up with is visual noise that can be as pretty and advanced as you want, but when we are in the hands of a headache-inducing mess of story I just checked out.""The BFG"" is right up there with one of Spielberg's worst films for me and unfortunately, one of the worst of the year. I strongly recommend to stay away from this pretentious and honestly offensive family film which was void of any kind of substance.",The BFG
78,scottshak_111,Alluring!,7,31 August 2016,"If there is someone who can come close to doing The BFG justice, it is none other than Steven Spielberg himself. He nails it and creates this enchanting image of the giant that we had always marveled about as kids. Spielberg brings him to life with his astounding powerful direction well supported constantly by the flick's beautiful CGI.MARK RYLANCE: THE PERFECT BIG FRIENDLY GIANT Mark Rylance is absolutely outstanding as the Big Friendly Giant, wearing his benevolence on his sleeves for us to notice him. He has such a beautiful soul that you cannot imagine anyone else wearing the character so perfectly. He fits into the persona like a glove. You can't help feel sorry for him when he struggles with the words. Yet in his occasional balderlash, he manages to say things that generate effortless musings.""I hears your lonely heart, in all the secret whisperings of the world."" If you pay close attention to his demeanour and follow him up with a childish gaze, it would be hard not to fall in love with his goodwill. Spielberg's CGI manages to capture his every expression making every moment melting.OTHER NOTEWORTHY ASPECTS IN THE BFG Screenplay is brimming up with Roald Dahl genius, and well moulded by Melissa Mathison for Cinema. Beautiful words from the book still lurk there, and they manage to rivet you with the kind of pace Steven Spielberg and all of us love.""It was the Witching Hour, when the Boogeyman comes out when people go missing. The girls say the Witching Hour arrives at midnight. I think it comes at three in the morning, when I'm the only one awake. Like always. Like now.""Ruby Barnhill was a great choice for Sophie too. Her cuteness level is endearing to watch. Her conversations with the BFG is what helps in putting things into perspective.The score of BFG is equally enchanting; setting the right mien to let you experience the wonder. The artistry on dreams was stunning as well. The whole concept of catching a dream, creating it, blowing it, is so well thought of that you cannot clap enough for Dahl's creativity.Watch the Giant storm past the trees swiftly and you will see how gorgeously his movements have been captured. The time when Sophie is picked up from her bed, as she beholds the dodgy pathway through her blankets, will tell you how Steven Spielberg never fails to give painstaking attention to his frames. He lets us in on Sophie's vision to show what she sees. There is poetry lurking in his direction which makes the whole cinematography affair even more winsome.THE FINAL VERDICT Apart from changing little facts from the Roald Dahl's creation, Spielberg brings back the lost charm of his ingenuity to the front page. He makes it happening via the tranquility in his frames something only his finesse could ace.Whilst those who haven't come across the children's book before, they might find the story a bit fantastical, but to be really candid, you need to turn back time for this. Witness the movie through the eyes of a little girl who comes across Giants for the first time in her life and goes on a whimsical little adventure to the Giant Country.Read full review here: http://straightfromamovie.com/",The BFG
79,coreyjdenford,A giant experience.,6,22 July 2016,"This is my review of the BFG (spoiler free) ***(3/5) Cast: Mark Rylance, Ruby Barnhill, Penelope Wilton, Jermaine Clement, Rebecca Hall, Rafe Spall Plot: A girl named Sophie (Barnhill) encounters the Big Friendly Giant (Rylance) who, despite his intimidating appearance, turns out to be a kindhearted soul who is considered an outcast by the other giants because, unlike them, he refuses to eat children.Adapting Roald Dahl has become easier since 1990 – the year the author died. When he was alive he was famously opinionated, raging filmmakers for altering plot details or casting actors that he didn't approve of, the publicly campaigning against the films if his demands weren't met. Some films escaped his wrath though, including the faithful-to-the-book 1989 animated version of The BFG. He'd be pleased of this too especially from Steven Spielberg's E.T: The Extra terrestrial with screenwriter, the late Melissa Mathison who also joined in writing this. The story opens promisingly as you'd expect with John Williams' score being as good as ever although sounds somewhat familiar, it does sound exactly like Harry Potter but that isn't an issue. Barnhill is a terrific young actor and her down-to-earth, bespectacled character is a far cry from Disney's archetypal heroine. Once we're in his land, the full glory of the BFG unfolds: he's a big-eared, wispy, white-haired CG wonder with the kind eyes of actor Mark Rylance, who was filmed using motion-capture cameras. Like Andy Serkis when he played Gollum it's the same way. Rylance – who won an Oscar for Spielberg's Bridge of Spies – is the perfect choice for this gentle, humble creature, and brings Dahl's quirky dialogue to life in a soft West Country accent. You maybe confused at first his muddled speech but as the film goes on you start to fall in love with the character. After we get to his land and the amazing story goes on something strange happens: nothing for a long time, which is slightly off putting, it takes a long time for the story to get good again.It spends a long time getting into each scene even with the 8 other giants voiced brilliantly by comedy superstar Bill Hader and also Jamaine Clement, they are fun and intimidating enough but underdeveloped. When the BFG gets bullied by the bigger boys it has sort of an underdog appeal to it. When it gets to that bit it is too long and feels like it is in a repetitive loop. Sophie shares the love for the fizzy drink Frobscottle, which leads to loud farts which will have kids squealing with delight. When the dialogue wears a little thin it spends scene after scene outstaying its welcome. Those who haven't read the book will you shifting in your seat because of the 2 hour long run time; you'll be wondering where it's all going. The BFG's habit to collect human dreams is also underused in fact barely used at all moments that are in one scene when we see a boy having a dream when he gets called by the US President, moments like that are rare by which only used once. The scene when Sophie gets shown the tree of dreams sounds like a name in Avatar it's very gorgeous with bright colours and a wonderful but, it's flat and spends ages in that scene, and the score is very enlightening when it gets to this point, it's very well done but could have been done better.I bet you're wondering does the final act get better? Yes it does, and in the nick of time. In a scene which will look familiar to those who have seen the animated version, when the BFG and Sophie go to Buckingham Palace to convince The Queen, played wonderfully by Penelope Wilton that giants exist and they are stealing and eating children. This scene is marvelous because there is much to love in this scene whether it's the charming Rebecca Hall's Mary or even the nervous Rafe Spall's Mr. Tibbs who is also wonderful. This scene is probably the most thrilling and also the funniest because unlike the rest of the movie this bit isn't overlong or doesn't spend ages through it, it's wonderful. The part when the BFG is in the dining hall being delivered a lavish breakfast by many footmen proves that Spielberg can do comedy because again it's very funny. Not only does it recall the likes of Gulliver's Travels but better, it reminds us what fantastical fun can come of a large cast as well as a large character. So the end makes the whole experience worth it.VERDICT: Giant expectations may lead to tiny disappointments in this two-hander that's slow in parts. But it still offers magic and visual pride, and the final act is a treat.6/10 An enjoyable and fun experience.",The BFG
80,Ramascreen,Wonderful,8,26 June 2016,"THE BFG may not be ""E.T.,"" or ""Hook,"" or ""Jurassic Park,"" but it has signature marks of a wonderfully exciting Steven Spielberg family adventure film. Yes the great director Spielberg is back after making his rounds through a few tense dramas (""Lincoln,"" ""Bridge Of Spies"") to bring us this lovable visual effects-filled story about a courageous little girl and the big friendly and somewhat shy giant.Based on the book by the late great author Roald Dahl whose imagination has made the world a little bit better with such works as ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" THE BFG tells us that when it comes to being brave, size doesn't matter.Starring Spielberg's latest go-to actor, Oscar winner, Mark Rylance as the title character and a resident of Giant country. Standing 24-feet tall, Rylance's character has enormous ears, great sense of smell, he talks funny and he fancies his job as a dreamcatcher. When he's spotted by a little orphan girl named Sophie, played by newcomer Ruby Barnhill, he takes Sophie with him to Giant Country where there Sophie finds that other giants in the area are not as friendly, giants like Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) and Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) are twice as big and they bully the BFG and they also eat children. The BFG however is somewhat of a vegetarian, he consumes these disgustingly lookin' Snozzcumber and Frobscottle. But things start to get unsafe for Sophie to remain there, so the BFG decides to return Sophie to the orphanage. But Sophie insists that they should stand up for themselves and stand up to those bullies. So they acquire the help of none other than the Queen of England.This little actress, Ruby Barnhill, is quite a treat, she really plays her age really well, meaning she's so curious and full of questions, that's what kids her age do, she's idealistic and optimistic, and Barnhill has all of that and a bag of chips. Rylance is perfect in his role, because there's that sense of child-like wonder also on Rylance's expressions that are of course magnified by CG, Rylance's gentleness and charm shine through naturally.I can see why Steven Spielberg and Disney really wanted to bring this story to the big screen, not only has the technology caught up to it, but also because it has those feel-good inspiring themes; it's a story about two lonely misunderstood characters that become friends; it's about tackling giant problems by using solutions that may seem giant to some; and it's about being brave even when the world doesn't give you a reason to be. From time to time, Spielberg loves going back to wildly imaginative stories like The BFG that's just all around wonderful.-- Rama's Screen --",The BFG

It's sad that Disney chose to not advertise for this movie and it suffered greatly as a result, because this movie is amazing! It's Steven Speilberg directing a movie based on a book written by Roald Dahl with a screenplay by the late Melissa Mathison. It's a win win win situation. The CGI is some of the best (if not the best) CGI I've ever seen. The attention to detail is astounding! The little liver spots, arm hairs, and pores on the BFG are so detailed and beautiful. The film is a fun, innocent little fairy tale romp that is perfect for kids. The story isn't very fluid, (to be honest I don't think I could tell you the linear plot. If you asked me what it was about I'd say it's about a girl and her giant friend who have various adventures), but that's the beauty of it. It's such a simple plot that really has nothing going on, but it's so fun and whimsical you love every minute of it. It's a great way to kill some time if you have it. Pop it in, turn off your brain, and enjoy the wonder that is this film.

88,FelipeCarrillo,"""The BFG"" Is A Colossal Adaptation Worthy of Disney",9,15 August 2016,"""The BFG"" brings back to film industry to Steven Spielberg with a genuine work aimed at adults and infants that covets to has the same impact than the previous classics of the director, nevertheless, his film does not capture such pleasures.The central axis of the film is Sophie (newcomer Ruby Barnhill), an orphan of 11 years old suffers child insomnia, her disorder makes she believes in ""the witching hour"", moment in which children of all the world are kidnapped by unidentified creatures. Sophie is kidnapped by the BFG (Rylance), who takes her to his home, which is beyond of Great Britain, beyond of mountain chains, more beyond of cloudscape. The apparent giant lives there, in a rustic house under a crag, however, he coexists with nine giants more, which belong to different alimentary prototypes, but, they concur with one special ideal: humiliate tremendously to the oldest and smallest of their countrymen. The BFG is the most diminutive (based on height) of his kind, nevertheless, has the heart more sensitive than others of his class; eating rotten and nasty vegetables and preparing his sleepy potions the giant spends his days, even so, Sophie has different plans in mind.The film is full of significant elements cared for thoroughly, it is in charge of each small visual and aural detail, it is in charge of each small sentimental detail. Friendship, nostalgia, pragmatism, temperance, dreaming and fighting are aspirations transmitted from beginning to end, thanks to the detailed atmosphere engendered by Spielberg and his crew.The first collaboration between Walt Disney Pictures and Amblin Entertainment (Spielberg's company) guarantees comfortable and suggestive expectations. Based on the British literature of Roald Dahl, ""The BFG"" is an adventure reflectively intimate and fascinating. Melissa Mathison (""ET"") adapted wonderfully the pages of Dahl creating a trip completely familiar and faithful. Mark Rylance (2016 Oscar Winner for Actor in a Supporting Role for ""Bridge of Spies"") portrays a marginalized giant who lives with encapsulated dreams and rotten vegetables in a country where equality is under the ground. His signing up was imminent after he won gold at the Oscars Awards, and although, this was a dissimilar character to the of his statuette, the veteran actor interprets it with great lucidity and professionalism that a nomination would not be coincidental the next year. Rylance sustains the film, his unique vocabulary and his aspects captured with CGI costumes adorn and venerate the complexity of the original storytelling, creating an eminent interpretation. Barnhill is beginner in the profession, she did not get the impact of Jacob Tremblay in ""Room"" film, since she was not the typical girl that asks for everything and conveyed femininity, she is a leader, an orphan who knows distinguish between reality and unreality, nevertheless, she is left to hypnotize by the imaginary fantasies of the tale Dahl.Whatever is the project that Spielberg takes to the big screen will have colossal greediness, Why?. As one of the best directors of the century, Steven Allan Spielberg captivated us with works worthy of carry his name, stories that are changed in classic instant and that have helped to forge the childhood of hundreds of people, who has not seen at least one of his films; this man is a cinematic god , a perpetual director, screenwriter, editor, producer and designer that guarantees monumental successes until the end of his days. For these and thousands of reasons do not leave of surprise us his last invention, which not manages to get that gleaming shine of his golden years, Yes, it is an excellent movie in all the parameters, but with Spielberg the word ""excellent"" not is impassable.Assiduously, the film takes advantage of his majesty and inventive, Spielberg knows how to handle to the perfection his elements, the dreams tree or the escape of London leverage the splendor visual impregnated by colors, reflections, and lights. The ambitions were excessive and although ""The BFG"" tried to be ""E.T."" for the new generations would be Utopian; we are in an age where children are more mature and developed than any adult mind, there are not already girls who believed in fairies or children who wished to have an alien friend, those times have already passed and BFG receives a hard blow with reality. Spielberg demonstrates that still has strength and imagination in his films; ""The BFG"" survives by its own merits and is not necessary to compare it with a classic, an independent and well developed product that transforms the darkness of the original story for children into an adventure full of dreams, colors and expectations that preserve the hard-work of Rylance and Spielberg, and of course, the debut of Ruby Barnhill.",The BFG

91,ccorral419,Creativity in The BFG,8,28 July 2016,"Youth oriented movie guru specialist Steven Spielberg steps back into the fantasy film realm with this enjoyable pic based on Roald Dahl's 1982 children's book. With no previous knowledge of the book, this CGI special effects film is an all around enjoyable experience for all ages. Academy Award Winner Mark Rylance (Bridge of Spies - 2015), adorable little Ruby Barnhill, the cast of mean giants, and one of my new favorite actresses Penelope Wilton (Downton Abbey) all do outstanding jobs as they (under Spielberg's guidance) creatively bridge the visual line between humans and CGI enhanced characters. Unfortunately, for a children's movie, the storyline at times slugged along, making me wonder if a child's attention span would sustain through such a movie. While Spielberg calls upon musical score guru himself John Williams (Star Wars) for his score, the continual sweeping musical interludes come off predictable and unnecessary. While some will want to compare this film to anyone of Spielberg's other successful such endeavors, The BFG is a quality fantasy family film that stands on its own.",The BFG
92,havoke-74121,When the giants awake the kids will play.,6,1 July 2016,"Director Steven Spielberg once again proves that he can take a child actor/actress and pull a very good performance out of them, as we seen with E.t., Hook and artificial intelligence. Although this film does not contain the emotional punch that it may be trying to deliver nor contain a very dramatic, and dark scene like the films I listed previously, this is still a very sweet, funny, charismatic, and wickedly clever film. The motion capture performance by Mark Rylance is visually stunning and very heartfelt as well is Ruby Barnhill's character Sophie. This film will make a deep impact in the young minds of children, it's very harmless and sometimes a little to silly towards the final climax of our two protagonist's journey, but if you love the original children's novel by Raul Dahl, you will surely appreciate this film. I had a very fun time with this movie, it could very much fit in with being one of the best children book to movie adaptations we seen in a while. The cast are very vibrant, and cheerful as is the overall story, the more we explore the wonders of this world and the deeper meaning behind it's story, the more I can imagine children around the world pulling up the original novel and also being swept away to magical worlds beyond our reach. This is a good intentioned, well acted adventure. It's not one of Spielberg's greatest but it's a great family adventure that's sure enough to receive critical acclaim and grown popularity by the end of the year.",The BFG
93,abouhelier-r,When Spielberg Meets Disney,9,27 July 2016,"A girl named Sophie encounters the Big Friendly Giant who, despite his intimidating appearance, turns out to be a kindhearted soul who is considered an outcast by the other giants because, unlike them, he refuses to eat children. When Steven Spielberg has to direct a film, no matter what the subject is, I'll be there. Because I know, with Spielberg at the helm and E.T screenwriter Melissa Mathison (though she died last November) at the typewriter, I'm in for the awe of watching the art of a true legend of filmmaking - and to me probably the best storyteller of all time. Steven Spielberg directed 29 feature films in his career, but he has never before made one with the powerhouse that is Walt Disney Studios. This film is the first to be put under the Disney Studios fairy-tale castle logo. The BFG comes from a director who knows how to make films on that note and on that scale. It arches back to Spielberg early days when he was making movies about friendship and magic like E.T. And I'd dare to say that this film could serve as Spielberg's E.T for an all-new generation. In fact, for a certain generation, E.T will always stand as the ultimate children's movie. No matter how fantastical the tale, this splendid Steven Spielberg-directed adaptation makes it possible for audiences of all ages to wrap their minds around one of the unlikeliest friendships in cinema history. This London-set adaptation of the Roald Dahl story reunites Mark Rylance and his Bridges of Spies director. Mark Rylance is awesome! he brings the BFG alive. It is a thing of wonder to see his trademark nuances, generally so studied and small, magnified to this colossal scale. With no offense intended to pioneer Andy Serkis, it's exciting to see someone else driving one of these virtual performances. Without him, the film would certainly lack the charm and sweetness it now displays. he plays the BFG like an abused child, grown to and alienated old age, taking refuge in a world of his own. Spielberg manages to make you feel like magic is real, it's out there, in our world, it's incredible - like he did in Jurassic Park for instance. This feeling is intensified by the fact that you are watching a story through the eye of a young girl. Who can be more imaginative than a child? Ruby Barnhill is fantastic as well, she's brilliant in comedy as well as with the dramatic aspect. Indeed the motion capture work and CGI are very strong and John Williams score is as beautiful as ever. Finally, this film relies on the simple notion that magic only works so long as children believe, and here we see this principle put into practice. Overall, The BFG feels like something magical between an Amblin Entertainment movie and a classic Disney Studios fairytale.",The BFG
94,SpoilerAlertReviews,Certainly for BFG fans,7,7 August 2016,"First Spielberg film directed for Disney and Disney's Second Roald Dahl adaption after 96's James and The Giant Peach; finding out DreamWorks Pictures (not the Dreamworks Animation) signed a 30 picture deal with Disney back in 2009, with BFG being the first collaboration film since Dragonslayer with Paramount in '81. Based entirely on Dahl's personal favourite of his children's novels, with the screenplay written by Harrison Ford's ex-wife and Spielberg's good friend Melissa Mathison, who was also the brain-child behind E.T. She sadly passed away last November due to cancer, who this film is dedicated to. A young Ruby Barnhill plays the kidnappee Sophie very well but a little annoying; I'm blaming the character more than her acting. But it has to be Mark Rylance who's the big star of the film and rightly so. His diction is incredible and if there was only one thing good to come out of Spielberg's Bridge of Spies, it would be where the two met leading to Rylance being casted for BFG. (I actually like Bridge of Spies, especially for Rylance.) his facial expressions says so much. Some might think it's all CGI but Disney/DreamWorks did something not done before, well, Weta digital did; and that was actually using a hybrid blend of performance and live action on real sets. Unfortunately, whilst looking impressive in parts, it does look weak and cheap in others but not so bad you dislike the film. Maybe it looks so real it doesn't. Spielberg regular John Williams, does the score but isn't wholly noticeable, but Williams has spoilt us with iconic film themes spanning the decades, especially Spielberg's and Lucas' masterpieces. It's not a score that grabbed me, enchanted me or be one I would purchase, but, that doesn't mean it bad, because it's not, it suits the film. I'm not a great fan of Dahl, though not a disliker of his works or the film adaptations, just never enjoyed them as much as most kids at school. I don't actually remember owing any of his books and I think our literature classes skipped him altogether so unfortunately I wasn't as hyped and I mildly entertained by the film if not disappointed with Spielberg final cut; didn't even feel like a Spielberg movie, but I believe fans and children will love it. Running Time: 7 The Cast: 8 Performance: 9 Direction: 7 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 6 Job Description: 6 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 purely for Mark Rylance's expressive performance. 72% 7/10",The BFG

Yet why is this Steven Spielberg film so lifeless, it looks great, and the giant has real charm but the whole film feels very very flat indeed, i do not think i managed a laugh through the whole picture, even worse i was constantly looking at my watch as time dragged. When Spielberg was really good, seem's like a long time ago now, he seemed a brilliant film maker but along the way, he has lost his vital spark i fear, this film reminded me of ""Indiana Jones And The Crystal Skull"" in that what once gleamed now seemed old tired and worn out. The BFG, is not a bad film, Spielberg is far to gifted to every make a really bad film but this film is simply bland and so forgettable and such a wasted opportunity. The popularity of Dalh, will give the movie a long shelf after life on wet afternoon's i am sure but this is a classic case of a film that adult's think children will like, but the edge that cheeky slightly wicked edge, that children love is in a land far far away.",The BFG
96,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,7,16 July 2016,"Only one of The Autistic Reviewers will be reviewing this movie, and that will be Jay! I grew up reading almost all of Roald Dahl's books. He always knew how to capture our power of being a child. He had a really unique way of telling a story. I also loved the cartoon version of ""The BFG."" Steven Spielberg steps into the spotlight...yet again and displays his true talent as a director and captured the magic just as the book did! The acting was really good. Mark Rylance as the BFG couldn't be better. I had a bit of a problem with Ruby Barnhill as Sophie. I didn't really think she was realistic and thought she was over acting and very fake. Every time she was in front of the BFG or other giants her reactions didn't seem to play well with the current situations. I know she's just a kid, and for that I will forgive her...i hope her acting does get better, though.The CGI did its part quite well. The dream scenes were probably the best parts of the movie. There were some scenes that didn't fit very well...such as the BFG just giggling for no reason what so ever. There were times when the movie did lose its cool. This was about half way through. But by the third act, when the BFG meets the Queen it provides us with nonstop laughs and excellent fear of the humans not knowing what the BFG might do! All in all...it is worth seeing. Spielberg did capture the magic and there is no doubt if you grew up reading Roald Dahl's books this might bring back some childhood memories. It's not the best thing to come alive from a story book, but it's so from bad. I'm giving this 7/10. 3/5 stars.",The BFG
97,WatchedAllMovies,A magical movie that isn't,6,6 December 2016,"I'm willing to suspend disbelief while watching magical movies. But this movie doesn't feel very magical. And when the queen gets involved, it's just too unbelievable.The story is kind of boring and overly simplistic. Basically a group of giants like to eat human children. Because of this they are villainized. Bears would eat people too, but not only do we not villainize them, we teddy them. How's that fair to the giants?A lot of time is spent showing how the little girl hides or runs from the child eating giants. You think a little girl would find lots of small spaces to hide from giants, but somehow she keeps running into open space.The movie is made more boring by the main character's acting, or lack of. Don't know how they cast this role. When she's supposed to be afraid, she doesn't look very afraid. It would be far better if they use a CGI girl.In short, this movie plot is too thin, and the main actress isn't very good.",The BFG

About the movie... It was a very nice movie. A lot of fun to watch. I loved the animation in many of the scenes. I especially loved the way the giants were portrayed in this film. The young girl who played Sophie was perfect for this role. They couldn't have picked a better actress. My all time favorite character was the BFG. I thought he was so sweet! I honestly believe this is a wonderful movie for the entire family. No profanity. Yes. A very nice movie for the entire family. I wonder if I managed to fulfill the 1000-word requirement?",The BFG
99,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 98,10,14 July 2016,"As a fan of Roald Dahl as a child, The BFG has always been one of the books I've most wanted to see adapted for the big screen.Based on the children's novel of the same name, The BFG is about a giant (Big Friendly Giant) who takes a girl from her orphanage and brings her above the clouds to Giant Country, out of fear that she will tell people about him. Although he's ""friendly,"" his larger contemporaries aren't. They bully him and feast on human beings.There are some points in the film where you aren't quite sure how the story is progressing. It meanders a bit during the 2nd act and the pacing can get pretty slow, but it's not so much of a bother since there is so much to enjoy visually and the scenes are so dense.While not quite as dark as the book, the imagery still translates well. The CGI isn't just there. Rather, it's as much a part of the film as the story itself. If the visuals were less impressive, the movie just wouldn't have worked as well.Part of what makes the film so enjoyable is the charisma of its two leads. Mark Rylance plays the title character, and newcomer, Ruby Barnhill, reminiscent of Drew Barrymore in E.T., plays the little girl, Sophie.The BFG's job in life is to collect dreams and give them to people. The events in this film feel like a dream from a child's perspective. Having nobody in life and turning to a seemingly-imaginary character for friendship.Luckily, the last third of the film elevates in a wondrous way. Things begin to happen and the story becomes full and complete. Director, Steven Spielberg, has a way of wrapping things up like no other. While the brief hiccup halfway through the film--though not really his fault--is uncharacteristic of his films, the ending reminds us why he's the best.The vision of The BFG is magical. There's no other way to put it. It doesn't just offer some fairytale story masking, for children, the harsh realities of the world. Instead, it shows them that there's hope--no matter how impossible it may seem.Twizard Rating: 98",The BFG

102,The_Swedish_Reviewer,Are kidnapping giants nice? Well I don't think so.,1,3 October 2020,"This is one of the many giant plot holes that this movie has. BFG knew that the giant country is a very dangerous place for humans because the boy he kidnapped before Sophie was eaten by the other giants. For the same reason, it made no sense Sophie wanted to return to the giant country. BFG also blamed the abduction for not wanting to reveal the giants' existence but had no problem showing up at the palace and mingling with the queen. There are simply too many of these illogical plot holes I could not stand. It deserves one star for the CGI though.",The BFG
103,mwcrunner,Pretty good adaption of Roald Dahl's classic,7,4 April 2017,"This is a pretty good adaption of Roald Dahl's novel. Steven Spielberg did a fine job of directing this. The little girl who played Sophie in it was also pretty good at it. One thing I didn't expect though in this film were these so called wizzpoppers. In the novel when the BFG drinks the frobscottle, he gets this tingly feeling inside of him and then jumps up and down giggling and so does Sophie when she drinks it. Then this is when I realized that when I watched the documentary about this film is that a wizzpopper is also a fart. lol. Although I did not expect the wizzpopper to be a fart. I expected it to be something else. Oh well it's pretty funny, but also a bit crude. Also the guy who played the BFG did a good job too. Also another thing I didn't expect in this film was that the BFG had another human friend before Sophie and that was sadly eaten by the man eating giants or was he? Also the man eating giants were sent to this island with all snozzcumbers instead of being put into a big hole like in the book. Also the dreams in the book are invisible except the trogglehumpers aka bad dreams. The dream scenes in this were pretty good too. I also like the ending to this too and the BFG was writing about his adventure with Sophie and that was also part of the book. The visual effects in this are pretty stunning and the music by legendary John Williams was very good too. This film is a very good adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel and is cherished by quite a few.",The BFG

105,seige-hound,A beautiful and sincere adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic book,7,30 June 2016,"The most impressive thing about Steven Spielberg's adaptation of The BFG is the art direction and animation. It's hard to picture Quentin Blake's original illustrations being this crisp and realistic without some form of compromise to the original designs, but somehow they pulled it off.It's been a while since I read the book, but from what I remember, this adaptation is very accurate to the book, and the sequence of events hold true. However, in my opinion, this compromises on pacing a little bit. The second act especially drags out a bit, and there are some tonal inconsistencies throughout.The trailers for the film also imply a more serious sense of whimsy than what the film delivers. Sure, there is a lot of amazing and awe-inspiring scenes in this film, but overall, the tone is a lot more silly than what may be expected. This is ultimately a kids film based on a kids book. I was surprised at first when I saw how low the critical reaction to this film was, but on further consideration, while this is not at all a bad film, I understand how some critics may dislike it. There are two scenes in the film that rely heavily on fart humour. This is accurate to the book, but perhaps seeing it in motion isn't as pleasant as reading it in words.Mark Rylance as the titular character was astounding. He made the BFG's broken English from the original novel sound perfectly genuine and realistic. Speaking in this sort of broken English could easily come out stilted and clumsy, but he pulled it off fantastically. Ruby Barnhill as Sophie, the little girl that the BFG whisks away, was also a decent actor in her role, although perhaps her role at the beginning feels like the sort of bratty Hermione from the first Harry Potter film.I think the BFG's biggest flaw is how reliant on the original source material it is. My favourite Roald Dahl adaptation is Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox, which uses the incredibly short source material to build a compelling and complex film the whole family can watch and enjoy at different levels. Both adaptations of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory build on the source material to further flesh out the novel, to greater or lesser success. The BFG, however, sticks to the book over making small changes for the purpose of pacing.Don't get me wrong, this film is definitely worth watching, especially if you're a fan of the original book. I hope I don't come across too hard on this film, as I really did enjoy it, but it's hard to not recognise the flaws, especially in pacing and tone.",The BFG
106,nmholland,An Enjoyable Family Movie With Some Jaw Dropping Motion Capture,7,13 July 2016,"The BFG is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Ruby Barnhill as Sophie, a little girl living in an orphanage in England, who believes in tales of giants coming during the night to eat children. She thinks that these giants come at around 3 in the morning, the only time of the night when she's awake, and nobody else is. One night, a giant whisks her away to giant country, but she learns that he's a Big Friendly Giant (or BFG), and doesn't eat children. However, the older giants do, and it is up to the BFG to protect Sophie from the giants that are much bigger than him, him being the runt of the giants.I don't even care what the title is, or what the story is about, if Steven Spielberg is directing it, I know I'm going to enjoy the movie in the long run. Steven Spielberg is a legend when it comes to filmmaking, and his name is enough to get me to buy a ticket. As expected, The BFG is a pretty good movie. There are some points where it somewhat falters, and I wouldn't call it Spielberg's best, but it was enjoyable in many different ways.The first point that I have to address is the motion capture work done by Mark Rylance as The BFG. We have gotten to the point in cinema in which CG can, if done right, look better than makeup or practical effects. The motion capture done on Mark Rylance is the best motion capture work put to film since Andy Serkis' Caesar in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014). I loved the CG put to use in this movie, and not just in Mark Rylance's motion capture, but in the magical world of giant country. All of the CG used in this film is utterly impressive, and took The BFG to the next level.Mark Rylance did great as far as acting as well. The BFG (the character) does have a speech impediment, and Rylance pulled off the lines containing odd words used by The BFG in a great way, heightening his filmography by another great movie. Ruby Barnhill as Sophie was a great casting choice, and did amazing in the film. This is one of the best child performances of Spielberg's career, and one of the best child performances of the year. All of the other actors do pretty well, especially Jemaine Clement as the unspoken leader of the giants, Fleshlumpeater. I likes his motion capture a lot, and his character was the type that the audience really begins to dislike, which makes the main characters all the more likable.Now, towards the end of the second act, I was really getting into the movie. I started enjoying it on a high level, and was wanting to see what happened in the next act. However, with the start of the third act, the movie completely fell apart for me. I don't want to spoil it, but Sophie and The BFG's plan to take down the mean giants metaphorically threw me out of the theater. I was getting very immersed into the world that the filmmakers had created, but was sucked out of it very quickly once the third act had started.Also, some of the humor fell flat. Most of the comedy was genuine, and I enjoyed it, but, I'd say probably a quarter of the jokes weren't all that funny. However, there were some jabs at comedy that I don't normally like, but had me laughing pretty hard in this film, because it was done right. Anyone who's seen the movie most likely knows what jokes I'm talking about, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone that hasn't seen The BFG.Overall, The BFG is a very fun family film, with a lot of good laughs and some amazing motion capture and CGI. I'd suggest the movie to anyone who can sit down and just have fun with a movie.",The BFG

108,trevor-82944,Introducing a Generation to the Modern-Day Fairy Tale,5,1 July 2016,"Once upon a time, a seven-year-old boy dedicated his free time to one thing and one thing only: fairy tales. He would make his family reenact his favorite stories, take his father to see low-budget musical productions of these stories, and even illustrate his own versions of Jack and the Beanstalk, The Three Little Pigs, Rapunzel, and so on and so forth. Coupled with the Disney classics, he simply could not get enough of these highly interpretive whimsical tales. Then came the third grade, when he read a little book called The BFG. As he read it, he had difficulty putting it down because of the wonderfully dim- witted yet big heart of the title character. Even to this day he still remembers how heavily it resonated with his love for fantasy.Yes, I was that boy from the story. While this book has stayed in the back of my head for years, I never lost my love of fairy tales, particularly in what Disney can do with them. Then Steven Spielberg announced his upcoming project focused on the classic: very dumbfounding considering how he has long ago retired the captivating child fantasies for much more mature political studies. My admiration of Spielberg's heart for filmmaking did not affect my concern on how it would result; at the same time, I knew The BFG needed to scare us and make us smile at the same time, reminding us of the good in the world.The Big Friendly Giant himself, portrayed through CGI magic by Mark Rylance, makes any true kid at heart fall in love with him. What he does is simple: he snatches children in the night at the witching hour, and takes them away into Giant Country. It's the only company he could ever find, as the other, much larger giants see him as an insult to giant peoples. During the day, he catches dreams found in a magical tree, sorts them into jars, and blows them into children's heads at night. Much like the sandman or the tooth fairy or old Saint Nick, here is yet another entity for children's nighttime fantasies. This elephant-eared giant may look evil at first as he hides his way through London's streets, but after hearing his kindly, sluggish speech, you instantly feel a personal connection with him. It's just a shame that the film is anchored by an unbelievable relationship between the BFG and little Sophie.Ruby Barnhill plays the orphan who stays up during the witching hour with the cat, and I could easily imagine any other actress in her shoes and playing the part possibly better. She isn't introduced with much detail, as she is carried away by the BFG too soon for a desire of following her journey to be initiated. It wasn't scary like it intended to feel, and nobody explained why the BFG chose her in particular to bring home. Maybe it explained in the book but I can't remember.Even without the girl-giant bond, the environment creation makes up for the entertainment. Composer John Williams does it again with his spellbinding sounds of sweet dreams, and production designer Rick Carter (Lincoln, Jurassic Park) recreates the large color of dreams with an upside-down tree shrouded with all the glowing sprites of dreams. Together, they create a spectacular light-show of northern lights, dripping leaves, and sprite chasing like we've all felt at some point way back when. If only the creative geniuses went back to old-school special effects without all the obtrusive CGI, then these moments would have felt all the more nostalgic for the generations beyond the millennials.If you ask me, the feature's third act officially lost me in its imagination and realism. Basically, Sophie sets a plan with the BFG to get rid of the other giants by sending a nightmare into the head of the queen. So they together successfully make it past the guards and get the nightmare into the queen's head, following with a scene so atrocious in direction that I am ashamed to place it along with the rest of the movie. Penelope Wilton, the actress portraying the queen of England, put no effort at all into her part, and the entire direction of the scene felt purely uncomfortable and out of place. At least it follows with an amusing if overlong sequence where the queen gladly welcomes the BFG by treating him to a huge breakfast, with a pitchfork and sword substituting for a fork and knife. Thinking back to Spielberg's history of portraying the political system on screen, I expect him to have done more with this historically relevant scenario to make things flow better. Alas, we just can't have the best of both.It disheartens me a bit to say that not enough was done with this whimsical fairy tale. The ""so what"" factor falls short compared to simple tales such as Goldilocks and the Three Bears or Pinocchio. But judging by the first two-thirds, the childhood escapism successfully triumphs. It teaches little ones the reward of being a good giant besides a greedy giant, and reminds older readers of these stories' timelessness over hundreds of years. Even today, we still can put ourselves in Little Red's place as she falls deceptive to the wolf's lies. We still see rags-to-riches stories similar to Cinderella's. I would love to see us all to start reading these old tales more frequently, including discussion on how a particularly story spoke to us individually. If we learn not to be afraid of the observant wandering child within us all, then we too can become little friendly people who can live happily ever after.Overall Grade: C",The BFG
109,spmact,Simply Delightful,8,15 December 2016,"First off, I'm not a huge children's movie fan, but this one was just so charming and cute I couldn't help but like it. The real star is the BFG. The funny way he talks and the emotions on his face really made the movie for me. The little girl does a pretty good job as well. This isn't the kind of movie you watch for the story. It's simple enough, but does the job. It's more for the interaction between the girl and the giant, and in that department the movie delivers. Sure there were some childish jokes, but there were plenty of other moments that made me laugh out loud without involving body functions.I don't get why so many people hated on this movie. Where they expecting Schindler's List? This wasn't that kind of Spielberg Movie. It was more about the interaction of a child and magical friend, akin to ET - and while it may not be quite as good, I still got a lot of enjoyment out of it.

110,kinolieber,So good I immediately went to see it again,10,4 July 2016,"This film is so rich in every department: visually, musically, in its excellent, charming, witty script, and the casting of actors who bring their best to the screen in their roles. For once a children's tale without the tiresome clichés that currently dominate kids' movies; a sometimes quiet and intimate film with sensitive, feeling characters who talk to each other in longish dialog scenes. This is a fable in an old fashioned mode, and yet is made from pure 21st century movie magic. As great as Mark Rylance is, and he is amazing, Penelope Wilton is unbelievably funny as a combination uptight, take charge and yet completely empathetic Queen. The whole breakfast scene, in fact the entire Royal Palace section, is one of the funniest things I've seen in ages. The film is doing poorly at the box office so catch it on the big screen before it's gone - it's absolutely gorgeous. And speaking of gorgeous, John Williams, collaborating with the some of the world's greatest musicians including Heather Clark on flute, has written a symphonic work that underscores just about every minute of the film. It's a masterpiece that ranks with the very best of what he has written for film in his long career.",The BFG

114,freemanpatrick7,Not sure what anyone else was expecting,8,10 September 2016,"I'm not sure what anyone else was expecting by I enjoyed this film very much. From all the negative comments and reviews I'm a little confused as to what others thought they'd be seeing.I had never even heard of the book so I had no clue what the title meant. Even the trailer I saw gave me no concrete answers and I had to guess. I think this might have been the biggest marketing SNAFU of the whole film. I'm sure Spielberg et al wanted to remain true to the source material but I think it would have been forgivable to change the title to Big Friendly Giant.Having seen the trailer I thought it looked good. When it came out and flopped I was a little confused but figured it must have been more of a problem with the film's marketing than the film itself. Having finally seen the movie I can say that I think it was wonderful and I only wish it had come out while my children were little.In spite of what others have said Ruby Barnhill, the little girl who plays Sophie, was awesome! I was constantly being impressive with her range and depth as an actor.OF course in a movie like this there will be lots of CGI. But it looks good. In fact some of was so impressive that I couldn't always tell what was real and what was CG.I do think the flatulence scenes were a bit much, even though they did make me laugh. Other than that I thought it was a delightful film.",The BFG

116,CinePendejo,Not as good as E.T. but still a great treat,7,21 July 2016,"At this point, I'm about as sick and tired of people throwing shade Spielberg simply by the fact that he never made the next E.T. ""What happened to Spielberg?!"" on one side, ""He's gone soft!"" on the other. It's annoying, mostly because Spielberg, arguably the most influential of geek filmmakers, is doing just fine! But all these constant articles keep telling me that he's in the ""washed-out"" phase like he's freaking Metallica when all I can think of this argument is ""well, what do you think? He can't make Jurassic Park all the damn time!"" And besides, since this is the same guy who made Close Encounters, Indiana Jones, Jaws, Schindler's List, Lincoln, and Minority Report, and pretty much shaped the blockbuster landscape decades ago, I believe he has all the rights in the world to put out at least one middlebrow film like this for a change!All that venting aside, calling The BFG ""middlebrow Spielberg"" isn't so much a criticism as much as it is a reminder that whatever this movie achieves may not bode well for those that either want more or less of it. In this case, the film strips most of Roald Dahl's classic tale into a lean and child-friendly adventure flick that lacks the complexities and or many adult undercurrents like his last films. But even as minor of an effort from the master of whimsy, the film is still a delightful, gorgeous, if a bit flawed, film that achieves much of what it wants to be to some extent. One of the said achievements is the major cog in this machine: Mark Rylance's facial motion capture of The BFG himself. Even though a lot would dismiss this type of animation as some type of ""uncanny valley"" gimmick, I believe it's used quite well, mostly due to the physical actor involved. Credit is due to the little girl playing Sophie (who is just adorable!) Rylance, in particular, breathes life into this character, while the filmmakers walk a fine line between too realistic and too cartoonish without tipping on either side. Speaking of the CG, this is one of those films that breaks free of Spielberg's real-life limitations and just swoops the camera wherever it wants, issuing a new standard for CG photography. Say what you want about Spielberg, even most of his shortcomings are about as good as this.That isn't to discredit what's not working, though. For all the downtime the film offers to grow the friendship between the Giant and Sophie, it also has too much going on in the second act that it almost loses itself from the plot. And not to disrespect the late Melissa Mathison, but it's not particularly her best-written effort, as it does skew too much for kids. Not that it's a bad thing to be exclusively child-accessible, but I could use a little more appeal to my taste. That being said, I enjoy the banter between the BFG and Sophie dealing with the giants broken language, as it is quite a cheer to listen to. Speaking about children, even though I don't mind the details of explosive farts as it was in the books, I doubt people would find it appealing. Even those minor issues aside, this goes to show how much even the slightest of a genius' efforts can still turn out better than anyone else. There is no denying the disappointed faces of those that expect the next E.T., but I believe that we can still appreciate the same level of heart and wonder that remains. Overall, recommended.For more reviews, check out my blog! https://itachisan125.blogspot.com/",The BFG
117,anandrajeev979,Everything I expected from Disney with Great Performances of lead but with a dull first half and far more cheerful and better second half.,8,4 November 2016,BFG is everything you can expect from Disney. Disney once again cast a magic spell on the titular character lead by last year Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner Rylance Magnificently. Ruby Barnhill is great too. The film is good but the thing is that this one plays too very good. Its the same story with seemingly similar characters from earlier Disney movies.It does have something worth remembering or anything that's makes it a standout among the crowd.The CGI is at its best. However the first half of the movie is really dull with nothing actually happening and its just mainly poor introduction to both characters filled with some old school jokes and language twisting that really works only for kids. But with the second half the movies gains pace and more importantly it becomes enjoyable.The meeting with the queen is really worth watching and its very exciting although the ending is far simpler.All the laugh comes from this meeting and also the twisted language works like a spell that will have you laughing hurting your stomach. Final word its a great movie but after Jungle Book its a bit of a low from Disney's current live action flicks.However Pete's dragon is better than this.I have my eyes on much anticipated Beauty and the Beast.So with some good CGI and good performance a perfect family flick but not enough adventurous. Still watch it for Sophie the main lead as the orphan girl which in my opinion is the very best part of this movie.,The BFG

The special effects are amazing, it's fantasy elements are its biggest strengths.The riskiest thing this movie does, is it uses a few fart jokes, that will definitely turn away some viewers, but it really doesn't detract from the overall film.There are exciting action scenes, fun comedic moments, dazzling and heartwarming scenes.The BFG is an excellent family friendly adventure well worth taking!",The BFG
119,tlooknbill,Most completely original imagined fantasy world I've ever seen & enjoyed in a movie.,10,7 July 2016,"Forget Avatar, Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings and even WarCraft. Spielberg brought back the lyrical and magical ambiance of early Disney live action of ""Darby O'Gill & the Little People"" and ""Mary Poppins"" in ""The BFG"" but with a more beautifully visual world so engrossing I couldn't believe what I was seeing.I've seen all those movies mentioned except Harry Potter & WarCraft, but this one is special. The characters and story are original. The dialog, naturalistic character acting (think Edgar Buchannan, Walter Brennan & Chill Wills) with all their lovable idiosyncratic speech patterns make this movie sparkle with the added visual style of '80's fantasy illustrators, ""The Hildebrandt Brothers"". (Google them).Beautiful color, lighting and ambiance with believable depiction of human giants. CGI acting is noticeably improved especially the expressiveness in the eyes which usually comes across in past movies as animated corpses in human like characters but I was sold in this movie. Just like in ""Mary Poppins"" I welled up in some scenes from the believable acting on this one.I really enjoyed and love this movie.",The BFG
120,anthonymichaelbangert,"Bold, Fun, Good",7,10 July 2016,"The BFG is directed by Stephen Spielberg and is based on Roald Dahl's children's book of the same name. In this fantasy tale, a little Orphan girl named Sophie who has insomnia is taken out of her room after she sees a giant (Mark Rylance). In this world giants come and gobble up Orphan children, so naturally, it's a scary moment. But Sophie quickly realizes she's with the only nice giant in all the land, the Big Friendly Giant. This giant is small for his kind, only eats a gross, stinky vegetable, and brings dreams to the children of the world. Sophie and the BFG must work together to keep her safe, and stop the giants from terrorizing children anymore. Let's start with the positives. There has never been a more faithful and loving adaptation of a Roald Dahl novel. Each scene seemed to leap from the mind of the innocent children's writer himself. The whole movie has an air of magic that only Stephen Spielberg himself could've brought. I can't see anyone else directing this and doing it so well in that sense. However there are some negatives. The acting in this film is honestly mediocre at best. Mark Rylance tried his best but the acting from Ruby Barnhill just wasn't convincing at all. I understand she's young and this is her first acting experience. And she basically had to talk to nothing there most of the movie. So I get what happened, but still. Gotta be honest. Plus the rest of the cast seems to phone it in. And the animation is dreadful. The mocap on this scale, especially when you have real actors, was not a smart choice. The world felt fake. I appreciate the amount of work put into making him look a little odd and just like the books, but in this case, prosthetics on a real person might have better done the job. I was happy to have such a faithful adaptation of one of my favorite children's writer's books. The world was full of magic and whimsy. There were definitely some areas that needed improvement. I'm giving The BFG a 7.",The BFG
121,trooper5783,"Good for kids, so-so for anyone else",6,16 January 2017,"I was dragged to see this movie last summer with my girlfriend because she thought it looked like a cute time-passer. I can't say I had high hopes, as I have never read the book and the film looked like nothing more than a high-budget Netflix movie, although I did have some excitement that Steven Spielberg was directing it and the CGI looked beautiful from the previews. After I walked out of the theater and recycled my 3D glasses, I was thinking to myself, ""that wasn't too bad for a family movie, but did I really HAVE to see that?"". There were positives- the visuals were spectacular, the musical score by John Williams was amazing as usual, and the performances were top-notch, but the problems were that I didn't find the movie rich in story or humor. It feels like a rip-off of E.T. only with juvenile kids movie humor, which made sense, due to the film having been directed by Spielberg and produced by Amblin Entertainment(hence the E.T. and Elliot bicycle moon logo at the intro), and it wasn't as heartfelt as the for-mentioned film, either. The attempts at comedy are amiable and suitably childish for the kind of movie this is, but at the theater I was in, I didn't hear much laughing out of any of the families that were watching the film. All in all, BFG will be enjoyed by the younger children, and anyone else won't hate themselves while watching it, but they'll still most likely be either checking their watches or playing games on their phone. However, my girlfriend enjoyed it immensely, so what can you do?",The BFG
122,leosmith-11166,Spielberg + Dahl + Disney = Magic,8,29 June 2016,"In recent years our good friend Steven Spielberg has been dishing out biopics and war films (War Horse, Lincoln and Bridge of Spies). But with the BFG, Spielberg allows himself to unleash his creativity and imagination that made him popular as a filmmaker in the first place. The film holds the same amount of magic and nostalgia as E.T or Jurassic Park. It's whimsical, humorous and at times emotional. Of course, we have to also give all due credit to Roald Dahl, who conjured up this simple, but enchanting story of a young orphan and a Big, Friendly Giant. His book was then exceptionally adapted by the late and great Melissa Mathison(who was also the screenwriter of E.T) . Her screenplay was then Moulded and translated by Spielberg, who did a fantastic job of bringing the characters up off the page and onto the screen. The film shows his visionary approach to directing, and displays the power of his imagination.The film, by all means, isn't for everyone. It is certainly no ""intellectual"" and I'm sure that the film buffs in the audience could identify dozens of plot holes. It is not thrilling, nor is it romantic. It tells a very basic story, and it's loaded with ""cliche"" Spielberg nostalgia. But if you are a fan of Dahl, Disney, Spielberg or the Magic of Cinema, this is a must see. It's a feel good story, captured in the most magical way. Forget Harry Potter and his wizardry, this is real Magic.",The BFG
123,AlienByChoice,Should've never attempted it,5,10 July 2016,"Let's start with the obvious. The BFG is a major disappointment on all fronts. The story doesn't hold interest and doesn't flow. The actors lack chemistry, and Ruby Barnhill is unfortunately a very poor casting choice. John Williams' score is bland, uninspiring and at times so obvious and overpowering that you just wish the music wasn't there at all. The CGI is occasionally brilliant, but mostly - mediocre. Not once did I see Sophie being carried in BFG's palm where it looked natural. So the less obvious question is - why and where did it go so wrong. The answer is that the treatment is all wrong. The brilliance of Dahl's BFG is that it's a multi-layered, complex novel, hiding behind the facade of a children's book. It's full of subtleties and innuendos and satire. But most importantly, it juxtaposes good and evil, beautiful and ugly, horror and amazement. The good balances the bad. Without them both, the incredible concoction that is The BFG is just some bland chicken soup. Which is exactly what the movie is. Disney and Spielberg have stripped the evil from the story, leaving us with a meaningless and sentimental journey to nowhere. Here is one example of the impact of this treatment. In the book, the characters of maid Mary and the butler Mr. Tibbs serve as the comic relief. Sure, there is some class criticism and satire in their characters, but mostly they are there to add some long needed laughter after some frightening and tense moments. In the film these two are straight characters (romantically involved), with only a hint of comedy. And this makes sense, because in absence of the evil and the frightening, there is no need for a comic relief in the movie.And so, we know the answer. The treatment of The BFG was totally wrong. It should have never been a Disney film. Nor a kids' film for that matter. The BFG is and should be treated as young adults literature, and the movie needs to reflect that. Otherwise, it's just some lukewarm snozzcumber soup.5/10",The BFG

But then it really didn't have to be faithful to the original because it is simply tremendous fun!

The reason people hate this movie is because they are comparing it to a proper Spielberg movie. I think Spielberg was trying to do something different this time for kid viewers. That said I think children watching it may well find it as enchanting as we adults found the animated one when we saw it. It is average movie.Sophie, a ten year old orphaned girl who lives in a London orphanage stays awake reading through the nights due to her insomnia. At 3:00 AM, she saw an elderly giant outside her window. The giant captures her and takes her into Giant Country. There, he explains that he named himself the ""Big Friendly Giant"" or the ""BFG"". After learning that she has insomnia and that she doesn't believe he can control dreams, he manages to read her to sleep and gives her a nightmare which was eat by another giant. Sophie convinces the BFG to take her to Dream Country to catch dreams together. As they leave, they accidentally wake up the Bloodbottler, who alerts the other man-eating giants of the BFG's presence. They torment and bully the BFG. Sophie tells the BFG that he shouldn't allow the other giants to bully him. Meanwhile, the Fleshlumpeater (another evil giant) and the Bloodbottler (another evil giant) find Sophie's blanket (which she had dropped before) and set out to look for her. Sophie and BFG have plan to draw away those evil giant. From this Sophie devises a plan to forge a nightmare and give it to Elizabeth II, the Queen of the United Kingdom. The nightmare consists of giants eating the children of England, the British Army fighting the giants, and Sophie appearing on her windowsill. the Queen spotting Sophie, her servant Mary, on hearing about the nightmare the Queen has just had, shows her a newspaper detailing a story about unexplained disappearances of a number of children. Sophie and the BFG inform the Queen and her servants Mary and Mr. Tibbs that the child-eating beasts in her dream are real and must be stopped at all costs. After a large breakfast they all enjoy, The Queen soon dispatches soldiers to Giant Country. The army's helicopters effortlessly ensnare and capture him and the other giants. The army put those evil giant to isolate island and give them vegetable for their eating. In the aftermath, Sophie begins living in the Queen's palace upon Mary adopting her while the BFG returns to Giant Country where he begins growing a wide variety of vegetables inspired by his time in England. He still delivers dreams. The film ends with Sophie narrating that whenever she feels lonely, which is less often than before, she talks to him; he can still hear her. Leaning out of her window, she whispers ""Good Morning, BFG"". At his writing desk, the BFG hears her words and smiles.",The BFG
127,a-kastenas,Promising yet not good enough story about friendship between a girl and a giant,6,26 October 2016,"Greetings,First of all let me tell you that it is a visually beautiful film piece. he effects, the music and even soundtrack is sometimes on very good level, as expected from such a huge producer. However, as much as I wanted to love this animated film, I could not. In fact, after watching it for about 30mins it has become unbearable and eventually I stopped watching it and have fast forwarded some parts to see the end.Pros: Interesting visuals, idea. Entertaining language of the giants. Cons: Non existent narrative. Unlikable characters (Lack of depth, B rate acting coming from the girl).I do know that this was a well marketed film aimed towards our little viewers, however there are much better films out there in the market. In fact if there was no Disney logo, and all the exposure that comes with it, this film would hardly go above 6/10.This is an OK film, maybe some children will enjoy it, especially little ladies (hence the heroine), however more quality is expected from Disney. In my opinion, if this was produced by another cinema company/less known brand, this film would not receive the attention nor exposure it has now.Disney, you can do better.",The BFG
128,makka-00955,Lovely family movie,8,28 November 2016,"I loved this adaptation, it is charming, funny and engaging. I've read some pretty scathing reviews, saying it's Spielberg's worst film - or one of, and I couldn't disagree more. It's really a kid's story, dressed up as a family movie. It's also a simple tale, requiring a simple plot and that is what you get, along with some Spielberg magic. The (gas) scene in Buckingham Palace is one of the funniest I've ever seen - it was hysterical! If you want to get all serious and pick fault with the plot line, you shouldn't be watching this kind of movie. It's a fantasy movie, involving some.... well... fantasy! There were some stereotypical British elements, which to us might be a bit overdone, but Spielberg isn't British. Whoever is slating this movie's plot and the movie in general obviously doesn't remember: E.T, Back to the Future; Poltergeist etc, who's plot lines were crackpot in the extreme.

130,chi-cerca-trova,"Bright and fluffy, not much substance",7,25 July 2016,"Overall: (Note: I have not read the book. Thus I am reviewing this as a film, rather than as a comparison to the book) The BFG is a meandering film that does not seem to really want to tell a structured story. Sophie is an underwritten character, who is whisked away to Giant Country before we even get to really know her, while the BFG doesn't really have a motivation and is given half of an arc. The pacing of the story drags in the middle, while it introduces an undeveloped and non-threatening conflict towards the climax. However, Mark Rylance and Ruby Barnhill give two stellar performances that ground the movie with a satisfying emotional core. While it is held back by some wonky special effects that don't jibe as neatly as they could and questionable storytelling choices, the BFG is a sweet and genuine movie that accomplishes what it sets out to do. Ultimately, it's a film that reminds what made me fall in love with movies as a child, even if through adult eyes I can find it somewhat lacking.7/10Detailed Review:Story/Script: The biggest fault here is the lack of a structured approach to the plot of the film. The characters don't have clear motivations or histories and the ultimate conflict does not feel threatening. While the action does get going quickly, the second act just meanders while the third act doesn't feel like there is much that needs to be resolved. At times, it feels like it is forcing itself upon you, trying to get you to feel the wonderment and whimsy that you would as a child without letting it happen organically. Yet, when the story relaxes and lets the characters tell the story, you do feel what it is trying at times to force upon you. There are genuine moments of wonder and whimsy, but that is quickly lost when it tries to force you to feel it. It feels like a child is telling this story, breathlessly going from point to point. But, the film is ultimately saved by the central performances and some deft design choices. -1Characterization: It's hard to separate the lack of characterization with the well delivered performances. Mark Rylance and Ruby Barnhall really place the film on a solid footing; the ability of these two actors to evoke the sense of friendship and camaraderie helps the film find its emotional center, which gives the audience a buy in point. When you get to the end of the movie, you have a genuine feeling of contentment for these two characters that doesn't come from the story or ordeal they've been through. Rather, it feels like these are two real characters that have formed a real friendship. And that is beautiful on in itself. +2Design: Bluntly put, the design of this movie really breathes life into the proceedings and gives the two leads an amazing backdrop to work off of. Little touches, such as a ship that is a bed in water or a tea tray made from a highway road sign, help make this fantastical world feel grounded. However, it does suffer from jarring ""uncanny valley"" moments, especially in the beginning. The green screen effects don't always seamlessly work together, which does throw the movie a bit and at times the sense of scale doesn't always quite evoke the emotion it's hoping for. Technically, there isn't anything here we haven't seen before, but the thought and artistry behind it is stunning. -1 Sound/Music: The Foley track helps support the visuals, where they are not over the top but help accentuate the action. Competently done. The music felt distracting, a John William's score without John William's ability to subtly use leit motifs. Once again, the score seemed to try and force a sense of wonder and whimsy but just couldn't just quite get there. Unfortunately, probably some the weakest parts in the movie. -2Miscellaneous: A movie like this is hard to review. I look for various things in films, such as character motivation, solid three act structure, consistent pacing, etc. This film lacked a lot of that. Yet, this isn't the point of this movie. It's a film made for families, and for that, it works exceedingly well. My critiques are nitpicky, because I still felt something at the end of the story and that's what matters. It's a film that reminds what made me fall in love with movies in the beginning, even if through adult eyes I can find it somewhat lacking.",The BFG

133,kevin_newdirections,A whizzpopper it is!,8,31 August 2016,"The odd sight of BFG's ""frobscottle"" – a green fizzy drink where the bubbles go down instead of up, speaks to the tonal dissonance that normally shouldn't work in this feature film. From the get go, The BFG begins like a classic, possibly dark, tale set in the cobbled streets of a 19th century London. Around the ""witching hour"", an insomniac orphan named Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is snatched from her bedroom by a scraggly-looking giant (Mark Rylance in motion capture) and takes her to the Giant Country. Director Steven Spielberg's then subtly builds up from the photo-realistic ""dream tree"" sequence to author Roald Dahl's otherwise, abrupt and wacky setting change – a modern-day Buckingham Palace where BFG consumes his royal breakfast at peace while the Queen of England (Penelope Wilton), her generals and pet corgis fart green clouds in satisfaction. Is this the same film that I walked into? The BFG will probably be best remembered for its short moments of silliness yet that's not necessarily a bad thing.Spielberg devotes the film's first hour in introducing us to Giant Country – its Hobbit-ish surroundings, glowing orbs and all to keep us visually entertained. For a while, the magic slowly starts to run thin and I was worried if The BFG will wake up from its frolic dream state and start working on its plot. Not to say that the singular performances from its leads are nothing short of spectacular, but this is the type of children's film where its plot offers no serious stakes and any sense of danger can be dismissed as a mild threat. The oohh-so-scary ""cannybulls"" which go by names Fleshlumpeater, Bloodbottler, Gizzardgulper, Childchewer, etc. are portrayed as merely comical dumb bullies weak enough to sustain the third act's liftoff. Sure enough, the film's straightforward and childish resolution involving the military will only sell to a bunch of eight-year olds. Spielberg choose to shy away from the potential grotesquerie in Dahl's fictional world and makes this film more harmless. Hence, if you're looking for that needed sense of adventure, The BFG can be a bit lackluster.Still, Spielberg's childlike sense of wonder and emotionally honest storytelling allows him to transform into a dream catcher. The BFG, as a bottled piece of a captured dream unmistakably radiates with the classic Spielbergian magic that we've all come to know and love. The unlikely bond between a young girl and a giant transcends to the mature themes of finding friendship amidst loneliness and learning to stand up for yourself. It may not earn the timeless, universal appeal of the closest Spielberg classic that comes to mind (E.T.) but this frothbuggling (i.e., silly in Gobblefunk) tale gets the warm and fuzzies going. A whizzpopper it is!",The BFG

I may have been the only one who never thought much of 'Jurassic Park' and our beloved alien 'E.T.' is outdated, because we all know he would have stayed in touch with Facebook nowadays. Many of his films to me are over-dramatic or obviously suffering from Spielberg's 'Peter Pan-Syndrome'. But, man! This movie is awesome! I loved the humor, the CGI is very good, the giant is just portrayed perfectly and it never becomes dull. Exciting, not too terrifying for young children and very creative. A true tribute to the late Roald Dahl.",The BFG
136,The_Film_Auditor,Disappointing...,5,19 September 2018,"When I found out The BFG was directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Melissa Mathison, I was looking forward to it having a similar feel to one of my favorite films of all time - E.T. the Extra Terrestrial. However, upon viewing this film, I can say that I was sorely disappointed. This film lacks feelings of whimsy and adventure, something you might expect from a film based on a Roald Dahl book or a Spielberg movie. Instead, it feels rather forgettable and uninteresting.I rolled my eyes so hard whenever there was farting on the screen. I mean really... farting corgis. I would have never guessed I would be watching a Spielberg film that contained a dog farting joke. CRINGE...Getting past the farting jokes, something else I was disappointed about and found distracting throughout the film was the special effects. There were many usages of CGI that looked terrible. Some of the shots looked like the visual effects artists didn't do a good job of blending what was computer generated and what was real. Other shots had computer imagery that looked like they were straight from a videogame. I mean honestly, I expected more from Disney, but it seems like many of these CGI-heavy films still look unnatural. That's not to say there weren't any good-looking shots in the entire film. There are a few moments, such as the scene where Sophie and BFG enter the dream realm, that looked nice.Despite all of that, there are some good things about this film. Mark Rylance's performance is probably the most obvious one. His motion capture performance is playful and fun. Many of the different faces and expressions Mark makes in the film genuinely made me smile. The same can be said for Mark's vocal performance, which was a perfect match for the big friendly giant. Another aspect that stood out to me was some of the small details in the film. The set design in particular had many clever details that really elevated the scenes and made the locations feel more like a fairy-tale. With that being said, I still would not recommend this one. Despite my love for Spielberg, I thought this was one of his worst films, and completely worth skipping.",The BFG
137,vincent-malisse,Marvelous story comes to life.,8,24 July 2016,"It is always difficult to capture a book in a movie. You always envision the story, the characters, the scenery different than the director and this was not different here. So yes, occasionally you have a feeling of disappointment, but oh boy, were these moments few.The CGI drips of the screen as you start watching, but I don't see how it could not, if you want this world to come alive. Of course the story is among the greatest I know, since my childhood, but the magic of the book was captured very well and the colors swirl around making you want to go there, to giant country and discover for yourself. The BFG, Sophie, The Queen, Mr. Tibbs, ... all characters just fit and help in bringing even more flair to the setup. Small details are added, including the funny talk, the dream mixer and the lovely breakfast scene.And so all the small disappointments (they are few) are forgotten before your next flitspopper.A happy movie with just a hint of sadness and a masterpiece for everyone who loves this story.",The BFG

Always play within a territory pre-determined by your parents.3. Read, remember, adore Roald Dahl books.Dahl's The BFG never really appealed to me as it seemed to whimsical when what I really desired was something darker and more menacing.I was never going to be too disappointed by this, quite workmanlike and enjoyable adaptation by none other than Steven Spielberg.",The BFG
139,snarkyphilo,The BFG: Exactly What the Title Promises.,8,15 July 2016,"This is a film that centres exactly on what the title says: a Big Friendly Giant.The strength of this movie lies in this simplicity. By maintaining the focus primarily on the relationship of BFG (Mark Rylance) with the other main character Sophie (Ruby Barnhill), the side characters and the antagonists, you get a very solid and somewhat focused film, and the character interactions, especially the dynamic between BFG and Sophie was the strongest yet so far in this year's family film fair, which is particularly impressive when you consider the fact that Barnhill is interacting with a green screen figment of digital animation imagination.Kudos goes to the voice acting of Rylance who really brought this character to life and was the perfect choice for BFG with his Shakespearean theatrical chops shining thorough especially well here.The computer animation (through motion capture) done on BFG and the other giants was particularly good. He looked younger in the face then his cover art from the Dahl book and his depiction in the 1989 animated version, but it oddly works here when combined with the balding greyness as it somewhat helps pull across that sort of ageless quality inherent in the character (and remarked upon in the film).Weta Digital did a good job with the the film's special effects, particularly with the dream tree scene.The plot meanwhile was fairly faithful to the book, if not quite capturing some of the couched darker tones of Dahl, with a pace that worked surprisingly swiftly for its run time in part carried by the relativity fluid transitions from one moment to the next carried on the back of the character byplay.The only drawback to the film is that the less darker tone from the source material took away from the unique experience that comes from a Dahl work, and if your a Dahl fan, this will likely annoy you.That being said it is a Disney film under the control of Spielberg which means that the ""Family film"" aspect will remain strictly traditional. Though its worth pointing out that with the increasing maturity of family television out there, the traditional notion is going to find a harder branch to perch on with young audiences.Overall, while it isn't exactly an epic film, it is a good film nonetheless that delivers on the promise of its premise with stellar acting, character designs on part of the giants, and visual effects and worth watching for all age groups.",The BFG
140,mcancea,The BFG,6,14 August 2016,The Bfg is Steven Spielberg's newest film and honestly one of his weak ones in resent times after bridge of spies that was great he makes the same actor Mark Rylance act as the Giant .it could be great but it wasn't even a good movie. It was a decent movie with pros but mostly cons for me for being so boring of a film. I don't like boring movies but Spielberg made a boring film for me. It doesn't have the things that he can do. The actress Ruby Barnhill is one of the only positives about this film. She gives it her all I give props to her for saving the film but it would not save it enough to it is still not good. It has its positives though Ike I've said it has her acting good. The story For This Film is OK but it could be better like I've said it's not good enough of a movie to have that story. Being good like jaws or ET it's just a boring movie For me and not worth time but better than really bad movies though and decently better than his bad movies this isn't a bad movie just boring still better than a Michael bay film. good family film I think and I think kids can like this though.,The BFG

142,CraigsCritique,The BFG is A-OK,7,2 August 2016,"Now I perceive The BFG to have many problems as a film...yet it has still somehow managed to charm the hell out of me.So what's the reason? Maybe it's in part thanks to Spielberg's ability to emotionally manipulate an audience and the apparent charm that comes with it or maybe it was the great audience reaction in the film screening I saw that has influenced my take on it.Do I think it's a brilliant family film? No I don't, yet do I believe it will have the required effect on the target audience? Yes I do, contradictory some may say, part of that feeling comes directly from my cinema experience amongst a large family audience with the child age range primarily of what I'd say to be 6-9 year old's, with countless child gasps and murmurs of 'Is that the dream tree?' and 'It's the BFG!' I've been in many a family/kids film audience where the child audience has been restless yet this film seemed to manage to encapsulate the sort of wonder that many kids animated films fail to do.So what's positively good about it? I have to begin with set design because if anything has been proved with this film and Spielberg's last film Bridge of Spies, the people he employs are surely the best set designers in the business with him wonderfully recreating London streets where the orphanage is situated in The BFG.The performance of the young Ruby Barnhill as the principle lead of Sophie the young girl who is taken from her orphanage by The BFG and took to the land of giants is nothing but exceptional, she offers enough intrigue and warmth that makes her thoroughly engaging throughout the film, Mark Rylance in a motion capture performance as The Big Friendly Giant is also entertaining with him charming his way through the film with his wonderful pronunciations of original novelist Roald Dahl's interesting dialogue.Not everything works though and it's fair to say sometimes Rylance's accent comes across a bit too twee for my liking, also even though the other giants are meant to be a decent part of the story they feel rather more like decorate dressing around our main two characters, my main two criticisms are bound to contradict each other with not enough humour for my liking and given the fact that giants are coming into children's bedrooms and eating them the film does a bit of a sanitisation job of the actual darker intentions of what made the book and Dahl's works in general so unique and wonderful.I certainly feel it will connect with the target demographic although I'd say definitely more here in the United Kingdom than say the U.S. and like I said I was surprised how much it did charm me.",The BFG
143,Fiurilli,Great acting and stunning visuals that couldn't quite offset the bad pacing.,6,20 July 2016,"Considering Mark Rylance great performance in Steven Spielberg's previous production 'Bridge of Spies' it really came as no surprise that we would be seeing more of him in one of Spielberg's films. This time Rylance stars as the BFG, short for Big Friendly Giant, alongside child actress Ruby Barnhill who plays a little girl called Sophie. At the start of the movie Sophie gets kidnapped by this aforementioned giant and what follows is movie where the main focus is the growing friendship between her and the giant.To properly capture the magical world created by Roald Dahl on the big screen Steven Spielberg uses a blend of real life footage and computer generated images. Although we've come a long way with CGI as a whole, the minor differences between images captured from the real world and those generated on a computer were just large enough that they were often times off-putting. Spielberg does do an amazing job to get the amount of times this happens to a minimum however by using certain techniques that make the real life footage seem more like computer generated ones rather than the other way around. That does not mean that the CGI in 'The BFG' was bad though, it's because they were so good that these moments happened. In fact a few times the visuals were so stunning that it could make almost everyone's jaw drop in amazement. That is not to say that the directing was flawless however.Over the course of the movie it becomes quite noticeable that there is a problem with the pacing. Quite a few times this has the effect that scenes which were mesmerizing at first drag on for too long, so long in fact that often times they will have overstayed their welcome. This is especially true for the few action scenes the movie has to offer. The bad pacing also causes the story to fizzle out and what is left is a movie that gets a little bit boring after only half of it's two hour running time.One of the movies redeeming factors however is the amazing acting by the aforementioned actor Mark Rylance who does a really good job at getting the viewer to care about this big and friendly giant. Another great performance is given by Ruby Barnhill who really shines as this little girl Sophie. Although there were a few moments where I think her acting felt a little bit off I am really curious where her career will go next. Together these two actors make the building friendship between their characters seem very believable and they are the reason the viewer will stay engrossed in the movies story.Overall the movie featured some amazing acting with stunning visuals, but sadly there is only so much that can be done to offset the bad pacing.My rating: 6/10",The BFG
144,BuddyBoy60,An Imaginative Children's Story Made More Magical with Spielberg's Seasoned Direction of Special Effects and Rylance's Highly Impeccable Voice Work,8,27 February 2018,"Adapted from the work of Roald Dahl, a famous writer of other beloved children's books such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, and The Witches, ""The BFG"" is centered around a little girl, who is an orphan, and an unusually gentle giant she comes to befriend through their journey to Giant Country. The story is endearing and imaginative as what you would expect from a Roald Dahl movie adaptation but what really makes it work in the cinematic form is the competent direction and the terrific delivery of the titular role. At the helm is Steven Spielberg collaborating with the late screenwriter,Melissa Mathison, whom he had worked with in E.T. Extraterrestrial. Spielberg, who has directed acclaimed films like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jaws, Close Encounters with the Third Kind, and The Adventures of Tintin which are known for their special effects, continues to prove his mastery of wielding this technical aspect for a greater drive on story telling.  Mark Rylance (who won an Academy Award for his supporting part in Spielberg's Bridge of Spies) lends an excellent voice work (and facial likeness) for the BFG which captures the gentleness of the character as well as his eccentricities especially his way with words.Given the strong aspects of the movie, this may not be the cup of tea for many mature audiences as the story itself is set in a fantastical world as seen through a child's eyes. Still, I predict that the regard for The BFG will grow over the years (like in the case of Spielberg's Hook) mostly due to the young viewers who are more capable of being moved by the moral of the story and of appreciating the movie's memorable sequences that no one seems to notice as of the moment .The BFG is a solid, great movie for children. For adults, you can enjoy it too, like I did.",The BFG
145,mother_of_popcorn,Wonderfully Whimsical,8,24 July 2016,"Anything relating to Roald Dahl – both books and films – will always be extremely nostalgic for me. As well as Enid Blyton, Dahl was one of my favourite authors growing up and I consistently found myself lured into his multiple magical worlds that were always full of kooky characters. Take this as a warning that my opinion on Steven Spielberg's take on The BFG might be biased on either side. I could either hold it up high on a pedestal where it's completely untouchable or I could be extra critical as it has a lot to live up to. Considering I haven't read the book in a long time, I believe I was quite fair when passing judgement on this film.From the very moment the BFG snatches little Sophie from her bed at the orphanage, the story started slowly coming back to me. Considering all of the modern day developments in visual effects, this movie certainly puts them to good use, with some scenes looking so incredibly realistic that even a grown woman like myself started questioning whether giants really do exist.Spielberg really is the king of children's fantasy – he brings out a fantastic performance from new-comer Ruby Barnhill who plays the bold orphan Sophie. It was almost reminiscent of Henry Thomas in E.T. It's a shame this film didn't perform too well at the box office because it's a movie that had a great combination of scares, imagination, heart and humour that I think every child (and adults alike) should go out and see. Escapism at its best, The BFG gave me a case of the warm and fuzzies – and also had me curious as to what exactly a snozzcumber tasted like.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com",The BFG
146,m_lecarre,A Lovely Heartwarming and Entertaining Movie,8,6 July 2016,"Not even a hint of a negative review here! I have read both positive and negative reviews of this movie here on IMDb - it seems that opinions are highly polarised - love it or the opposite. We (my wife and I) have just seen The BFG and thought it was a superb piece of entertainment that was entirely enjoyable in every respect. Poor acting? Humbug! Spielberg has lost his touch? Humbug! Boring ??? Well, I guess it didn't have any vampires or walking dead in it and it certainly wasn't a shoot-em-up action movie but as a heartwarming and utterly enjoyable movie with some laugh-out-loud moments it is a great success and as good a movie as we have seen for a long time.I can only agree with one reviewer who said that it may be too erudite for many people. The script was excellent, the timing was spot on and the whole movie presented with a wonderful overall coherence that is missing from so many contemporary films. Never too 'soggy' or sentimental but not too superficial either it presented a modernistic fairy tale fantasy in a consummately digestible manner. It should appeal to all ages.Without giving too much away about the comedic aspects (IMDB reviewers: if this is regarded as a spoiler please forgive the faux pas - it doesn't seem like a spoiler to me) imagine, if you will, a carbonated drink where the bubbles go downwards and not upwards in the glass: drinking the beverage certainly won't make you burp but it will make you ... well, I hope you get the idea! It was a highly visual 'gag' that wasn't overplayed and the results were hilarious, most especially when they take place in a certain wonderfully spoofed royal situation and environment.In summary then: visually stunning, well acted and wholesomely entertaining. Highly recommended.",The BFG
147,tvsterling,Brace Yourself For The Next Step,10,30 April 2017,"I loved this movie. A beautiful & classic Fairy Tale perfectly presented. Times change & the fart jokes will just have to be tolerated. Technically it's a marvel. A true photo realistic & live action blend. The Giants are a near perfect melting of live action & CGI. The technical wizardry did NOT overpower the entertainment; perhaps the greatest wizardry of all. Sources say Spielberg knocked himself out in pioneering this great leap forward. A true master craftsman. I reviewed Tin-Tin years ago & at that time I thought this level of integration would be many more years in coming. Technology moves faster & faster. The final thought I have is one of foreboding. Soon; very, very soon, all the great stars of the past are going to return from the dead. Film is a dog eat dog business with no room for common decency. Pandora's Box has really been opened. What will you do when The Duke, Tragic Marylin, Bogart, Elizabeth Taylor, The Stooges & any other film legends who are dear to you come back as some sort of Zombies. How about Debbie Reynolds & Carrie Fisher? Will you go watch Virtual Marylin's new film? Recoil in disgust or horror? They WILL NOT be allowed to rest in peace. It is not Spielberg's fault it is only progress. BRACE YOURSELF.If you want a sad illustration find the 'Audrey Hepburn' Commercial on U-Tube. ""Audrey Hepburn Resurrected in New TV Commercial - Creepy or Cool?"" This is actually old by several years & 'Audrey' looks a bit mannequin-like. IT IS ALREADY HAPPENING. Especially sad to see dear little Audrey brought back from the dead. She was a Anti-Nazi resistance fighter, Nearly starved to death, a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. Truly a remarkable human being. Told you so.Things are really beginning to heat up. James Dean will soon appear as ""Zombie James Dean"" in the upcoming Vietnam Era action film, 'Finding Jack.' It will be a minor role.

Finally I am walking out of the theater with my head hung low, this disappointed me on so many ways. Let me begin by saying that the main character Sophie, has absolutely no character development.The opening scene is when the BFG abducts her. It takes about 4 minutes for that to happen and doesn't take the time to introduce much about Sophie. I was trying to not let that bother me too much. But it is never explained why the BFG truly took her to giant country. It made no sense. My biggest issue with this movie is that it really has no plot. There is no conflict or problem needed to be solved. The final 30 minutes finally have something happening, but it is so poorly done and randomly included. I should give it credit for the character of the BFG being exactly like the book which was cool. And most of the things done in the movie were closely like the book. And the scene with the queen was fun and enjoyable. But other than that this movie is incredibly slow and dull. All my family fell asleep I was the only one who stayed awake to watch the entire thing. There are some really childish moments that someone under 5 would laugh at.

154,JustALittleBitRandom,Needs some serious editing to make it shorter but the third act is worth it,5,8 August 2016,"A young girl called Sophie is taken away from her orphanage by The ""Big Friendly Giant"" the only giant of his kind who fears the presence of all the other giants who happen to eat children.Steven Spielberg teams up with Mark Ryalnce to bring Roald Dahl's classic story to the big screen. Is this adaptation able to capture the magic and mystery of Dahl's imagination? Sort of. The biggest problem that this film has is that ,like many others this year, it's too long and quite a few of the scenes throughout it seem to drag and make the film seem a bit longer and some members of the audience seem to loose patience. If some scenes were cut a bit more then the film would not only be obviously shorter but it would also possibly drag less throughout some scenes. Mark Rylance delivers lines that no other actor should be able to say with a straight face and therefore provides a couple of chuckles for the audience but this seems to be the only source of comedy in the film as it't not really a gag heavy film until the third act. On the topic of the third act it is one of the best points of the film and is one of the things that makes the film what it is and does capture the essence of Dahl's original words and in some shots Quentin Blake's illustrations can be clearly seen translated onto the screen which does show how Spielberg and screenwriter Melissa Mathison did want to capture the magic and mystery of The BFG. The visual effects do add to the feeling of the film and do also have a very Spirlberg'ian feeling to them especially during one slightly lengthy scene involving dream catching. But unfortunately the visuals and the acting don't distract from long scenes. When put all together it just seems like it's a couple of steps away from being a panto.Yes the visuals and the acting are good and largely go towards making the film largely what it is but many scenes in The BFG are a bit too long and distract because of this. However just wait for the third act which is one of the best things about the film.*** <-- Three Stars",The BFG

Steven Spielberg has a tendency to lace everything with quantities of schmaltz which sometimes he gets away with and sometimes not. Here I am afraid it is NOT. There is far to much emphasis on the BFGs relationship with the young girl and not enough phantasmagoria the other giants are just not terrifying enough.Despite the excellence of Mark Rylance in the lead role this is something that just does not quite get there, a splash of Spielberg with a dash of Tim Burton and who knows this could have been a masterpiece.",The BFG

It's Steven Spielburg, what could possibly go wrong, right?Well, to be fair, this isn't the WORST movie ever made, but it's one of those waste-of- time movies that just doesn't instill any kind of coherent emotional reaction. I felt nothing during this movie. There was nothing for me to enjoy.The visuals were really phony. I know that a movie like this needs CGI if they wanted it to be live action, but the blending of the two was just AWFUL. Every time Sophie and the BFG were in a scene together I could tell she was sitting in front of a green screen. Most of the film was also whimsy for the sake of whimsy, with the pretty visuals of the sparkly dreams drifting around the fairytale forest landscape serving no function other than to wave pretty colors in the faces of children to keep them entertained. The story meandered. Then they introduced a conflict, which could have added a ticking clock element to the plot. And once I thought it was going somewhere, the plot stopped completely to make for hilarious antics of the BFG in Buckingham Palace. ""Isn't it hilarious that he's giant and everything else is tiny?"" the movie asks. ""No,"" I say. It's not really. Maybe a kid would find it funny, but since I'm not a kid I can't say for sure.""Isn't it funny that he says weird words in the presence of the Queen of England?"" the movie asks. ""No,"" I say again. It's really not. All the humor in this movie falls flat on its face. It's the kind of weirdly delivered humor that I remember movies like The Polar Express have, where there are ""wacky"" characters who do and say things that are not inherently funny, but based on the other characters reactions, the movie tells us that we were supposed to laugh at it. What was the point of the magical fart juice? Other than being true to the book, that is. Seriously, it was the most pointless joke in the movie. The delivery was bad, the timing of it was bad, and the execution of it was bad. The moment the BFG reached for that bottle of fart juice the second time (an hour after the movie introduced it and forgot about it), I had to walk out. That was it for me.I really don't know what else to say other than The BFG was a meandering, pointless waste of time. Nothing was funny, there was almost no tension, the plot goes nowhere, and I left without feeling anything for any of the characters. Maybe a kid of 10 or under would enjoy it, but as an adult in their twenties, I certainly didn't. I walked out of it, so I don't even know if it got better in the last half hour or so.Skip it. Unless you're young and easily entertained.",The BFG
157,johnnyjan16,Bore of a film,3,15 August 2016,"I'll say this - if I had children, I think it would have been a good trip. However, this was one of the more boring films this year and unfortunately ended up being an expensive nap.First of all, Ruby Barnhill. I think this will be her one film and that's it. A very annoying actress who just comes off as a brat. Her voice began to grate about 5 minutes in. A young Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) would have been perfect. The film was long for a 2 hour film and it drrraaaaggggeedddd. The scenes with the Queen were very forgettable. The scenes between the BFG and Sophie became a bore as it went on. The giant scenes were the more enjoyable just because they had a bit of humour.But overall this is an instant DVD film. I'm not surprised this hasn't done well at the box office and I don't think Spielberg has he Midas touch anymore in cinema.",The BFG
158,steerpike_2002,Charming but distant effort from Spielberg with brilliant turn from Mark Rylance,7,3 August 2016,"I've read a lot of negative reviews for ""The BFG"" on IMDb. While the film is flawed in several respects, I do think it showcases some of the elements that have made other Spielberg movies family classics.I'll start with the positives. Mark Rylance's performance in this film is sublime. Still a relative unknown on the screen when he won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor earlier in the year (for a performance that I wasn't so bowled over by), his performance of the BFG showcases his long stage experience. Only a classically trained actor could deliver the kind of nuanced expression and emotion in the tangled vocabulary of the dialogue here and Rylance never failed to captivate me for a single moment. It's fair to say that the film would not have succeeded without this crucial performance - Spielberg must have been grinning from ear to ear when he first witnessed it. It probably adds 2 points to my score here and is worth seeing the film to experience.Newcomer Ruby Barnhill needs to be mentioned here as well. While not lighting the screen up with her performance as the orphan Sophie, she capably carries the scenes that she needs to.The production design of the film is also impressive at times, particularly the giant sets in the BFG's house which convey a fun sense of wonder for Barnhill to navigate in. The area where the BFG keeps his dreams is also nicely designed with inventive water mechanisms which provide the basis of the best dramatic sequence in the film. That being said, I did have some niggling issues with the continuity of scale throughout the film, particularly between the 3 main dimensions of the humans, the BFG, and the considerably larger other giants. This seemed noticeably inconsistent to me which grated against my enjoyment of the film.The film successfully delivers the fun moments with some good family comedy moments. A particularly memorable set-up ""whizz-banger"" scene in Buckingham Palace is sure to make the kids (and most adults with a funny bone) laugh out loud.However it is in the drama that the film suffers. One of Roald Dahl's talents was in creating an unusual level of threat for a children's author and this is simply missing from the film. We're told that the other giants eat people but never come close to witnessing this on screen. As a result the bad guys more often come across as a bumbling gaggle of idiots than a source of dread. Roald Dahl takes time in the book to make us afraid of the other giants but Spielberg, possibly in search of his PG rating, declines to do so here to the detriment of the film. Contrast this with Nick Roeg's excellent adaptation of ""The Witches"" where the truly chilling opening is devoted to showing the evil and terrifying methods employed by the antagonists.As well as lacking in scares, the film rarely raises the adrenaline either. Unlike in the excellent ""The Adventures of Tintin"", Spielberg fails here to raise the pace much culminating in a truly limp finale.Overall this felt like a very old-fashioned kids movie which is not helped by the indistinct setting which veers in feel from modern day to Victorian. It has a lot of charm in its presentation and is aided enormously by the main performance but falls short of the source material and Spielberg's best.",The BFG
159,reborn-966-808248,so beautiful so gentle,10,6 August 2016,"This is my first review on IMDb. Why? Because I am surprised, better said shocked about the response to this movie. Such a beautiful film, so subtle so warm, humorous, what a wonderful world created. So much heart. It is not about spectacle, action and it is not specifically for children, it is for everybody with a young heart. Who still has a child inside full of wonder and gratitude of being alive. The characters are so beautiful, humorous, the gentle gentle giant. The girl, strong, direct but touched inside by this gentle giant. The visual effects wow so much to see, experience, the scene with chasing the dreams, beautiful beautiful. And can't say enough about this film, how wonderful wonderful this film was for me. Yes me, a man of 53 years old. And my girlfriend about the same age as me shares my opinion. Are we crazy, or is there something wrong with this world? Thank you Steven Spielberg for daring to create such a beautiful fairy tale, true magic of the heart. If you open yourself for it maybe it can touch you, you may feel it. Karel",The BFG
160,WinterbornTM,The BFG Review,7,6 July 2016,"The BFG is a fantasy movie directed by the great Steven Spielberg based on the Roald Dahl's book with the same name. The movie stars Mark Rylance as the titular character, Jemaine Clement, Rebeca Hall, Bill Hader and also introduces the young Ruby Barnhill.The movie tells the story of a young girl living in an orphanage, who, during one night, sees a giant and gets taken by him in Giant Country. Mark Rylance performs the so-called giant via motion- capture, bringing much heart and depth to the role, revealing himself to be a, well Big Friendly Giant. It's great too see Rylance work with Spielberg again, after they collaborated in Bridge of Spies (a role that brought Rylance the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor). The young actress playing Sophie, the girl who gets taken by the giant, Ruby Barnhill, is wonderful in her role and shows lot of promise, although sometimes her performance seems to be more aimed at stage theater rather than the movie screen. Her acting is not bad by any stretch of the imagination however, she is only twelve and in her first major picture role she's directed by Steven Spielberg. All things considered, she does a fine job.As soon as Sophie enters the Giant Country, she will see that not all giants all friendly, in fact some of them even want to eat children. The villainous giants are played wonderfully by Jemaine Clement and Bill Hader.With this movie, Spielberg goes back to his more kid-friendly type movies, like E.T., Hook or The Adventures of Tintin, and even though this movie is lovely and will be perfect for children, I feel like the story is not engaging enough at times. Also, and I might be a little too picky, but the CGI doesn't work that well. There are some scenes in which the giant holds Sophie and the special effects are really obvious. Sure, the children in the theater won't notice, but for Steven Spielberg it will get a little distracting. The movie has humour, adventure and a batch of lovely characters, but the sometimes dull plot elements and the distracting special effects won't make this the best Spielberg movie. It's not a bad movie and you should not skip it, but lower your expectations a tiny bit. I give The BFG a 7 out of 10.",The BFG
161,creetar,I liked it,8,27 November 2016,"I do understand that people are disappointed when watching a Kids movie and expecting an exciting and challenging plot. What is wrong with you guys? Just because it says Steven Spielberg doesn't mean this is a movie that is specifically designed for your needs. I am 30+ and I like this movie a lot, watching it from a kids perspective you even understand the breakfast scene and I bet all kids would laugh at it. It is kinda sad, seeing how incapable some people are recognizing a movie for kids as such. This is a proper 8! I like the accent, the CGI is fitting, the story is for kids, so if you are not a kid, stfu. I can fully recommend it to anybody with an open mind, who is not looking for the kids version of an Captain America Civil War CGI fest.",The BFG
162,Magic_Lantern,I think Roald Dahl would have approved,7,25 July 2016,"I developed a personal connection to Roald Dahl's stories when I was very young. His tales of ordinary or isolated people put into extraordinary circumstances still has an appeal to me now as an adult. So I was looking forward to seeing the master of fantasy films, Steven Spielberg, take on a cinema adaptation of Dahl's classic children's story, The BFG.The BFG is a big friendly giant from the fictional 'Giant Country' who catches and delivers dreams to the children of Britain in their sleep. It's a magical concept that lends itself well to cinema. The BFG himself is a simple yet lovable character with an appropriately warm and inviting West Country accent (an accent I'm very familiar with living in that part of England). The character has been recreated masterfully with state-of-the-art CGI that captures every subtle emotion on the giant's face beautifully. Mark Rylance's performance captures the BFG's likable vulnerability well. This works particularly well when juxtaposed with newcomer Ruby Barnhill's tough and feisty interpretation of Sophie, an young girl kidnapped by the BFG after seeing his secret dream work in the act. A classic Disney fundamental can be spotted in Sophie's set up as lonely orphan from Central London. The character, based on Dahl's own daughter, bounces really well off the bumbling BFG's sweet sensibility.Spielberg's technical skills as a director shine here. Stunning long takes, engaging camera-work and neat storytelling really bring the fantastical tale to life. However, the story that follows Sophie's kidnapping doesn't follow a typical Hollywood structure and lacks substance. Our hero's antagonists, child-eating Giants, lack depth and their motives are unclear. Some minor tweaks to the source material do well to dial up the emotion and lead character development but the silly and nonsensical story involving a rescue mission brought about by the Queen of England struggles to let the audience into its world. I feel that the film lacks the layers that many classic fantasy films (such as E.T., Beauty and the Beast or Edward Scissorhands) have to appeal to adults as much as young children. Similarly, the sense of humour in the film could be perceived as quite childish with an emphasis on toilet humour. The children in the cinema were laughing out loud at the more low brow moments but the same couldn't be said for me or the other adults in the auditorium. There are some emotionally and visually beautiful moments that get lost amongst the silly sense of humour which I believe will limit the films lasting appeal.Roald Dahl was notorious for disliking movie adaptations of his work but I genuinely believe he would have approved of this mostly faithful interpretation. I don't think this film will go down as a classic that will be remembered in years to come but it's light, visually entertaining and mostly fun to watch, especially if you have children to watch with you who will probably enjoy the movie more than you will.6.5/10",The BFG
163,gaxiola_fk,The BFG - Review,4,7 December 2016,"The BFG - Review Year: 2016 Director: Steven SpielbergThis is not Spielberg's masterpiece but is kind of decent. I think that he made it focusing on children because believe me, is a childish movie. I have problems with the hole movie. To begin they should have shown more about the origin and function of the giants in the introduction, the movie just starts with a giant in a city and you may think that they'll tell you what's going on but they never explain it. Despite of that the introduction show us how both of our main characters ended up together. The development of the movie and the climax is about the BFG's job and how cruel are the other giants that unluckily live outside of the BFG's home. The main problem of the movie becomes to save Sophie from the giants and to prevent the queen about the imminent attack. They show and prove them the existence of this gigantic beasts and they went ahead of them punishing the giants for a crime that they haven't committed leaving them in a super small island with nothing to eat except fruit. The animation is very good and fluent and the characters are well developed, the BFG as Mark Rylance and Sophie as Ruby Barnhill.I don't really enjoyed the movie because I didn't see the point in the hole problem, the BFG doesn't had a plan after taking Sophie to his country and the only strong point in the film is the relationship between BFG and Sophie.",The BFG
164,stephen-humphries,Sacrilegious Butchery of a Classic Story,1,2 December 2016,Good special effects but as usual arrogant movie makers manage to take the subtle and the sacrosanct and turn them into the superfluous and the sacrilegious. If you can't write your own story what on earth makes you think you can improve on someone else's?It's not just that they absolutely butchered the story and the characters - it's that they changed how the BFG spoke and what he said. Why? Is there some kind of agenda here? First it was the Lord Of The rings - The best fantasy story ever written reduced to facile fight scenes for the masses - and now the BFG. Is there some-kind of subconscious subliminal propaganda going on here? Is it Americanization? Whatever it is it's awful.,The BFG
165,adamph95,Amazing Family Film!,8,6 January 2017,"Going into the film I had no idea what to expect except for a Big Friendly Giant. This film completely felt like Spielberg and it was a heart warming film with a little of an unbelievable ending. Sophie played by Ruby Barnhill is a great young actress and her relationship with the BFG played by Mark Rylance made the whole film. At first, the BFG kidnaps Sophie to protect his existence from being revealed but later on Sophie sees good in the Giant and learns that he is the runt of the group of giants. The film deals with dreams the good ones and the bad ones and all in between have a different color. It reminds me of Inside Out. The BFG collects dreams and has the ability to create dreams. Sophie being a tiny human teaches the giant to stand up for himself and to trust more. which leads us to the ending. Sophie and the BFG team up and get help from the Queen and together they get rid of the mean giants. Overall, the film touched upon many human themes and is a well made beautiful film. If you haven't seen it I encourage you to do so. 8.4/10.",The BFG

I was excited to see this big-budget Spielberg-helmed film adaptation of one of my favorite childhood experiences. Unfortunately, some things are better left to the imagination.I think this book is just impossible to properly adapt to film. It's not Spielberg's fault that the source material works best in the head of the reader rather than on the big screen. I honestly believe Spielberg did an amazing job with what he was given, but unfortunately some of Roald Dahl's tone was lost in translation to the big screen format.Not sure if this will ever be properly adapted.

168,donuts_69,Thoroughly enjoyable!! Why all the hate?!?,8,6 August 2016,"Firstly, I just wanted to touch on some of the harsh negative reviews that seem to be dominating the top of the page for The BFG. In recent times where the movie going public have been subjected to such mediocrity including; Ghostbusters,Star Trek: Beyond, X-men: Apocalypse, Kung Fu Panda 3, Jungle Book etc it strikes me that when a half decent movie does indeed come out, so many of us are conditioned to these average movies we forget what a real movie experience actually is. A movie that can take you on a journey to the heady days of falling into Roald Dahls world and forgetting about the travails and stresses of everyday life. Where imagination and wonder plays as much apart of the experience as anything presented on the screen. The cinema should be more than just a two hour baby sitter when it comes to taking the kids and The BFG allows for real engagement between parents and kids with its simple, yet masterful approach in presenting the subject material to its audience (who else but Spielberg and co).The plot is simple, Orphan girl and outcast giant try to find a way to protect the children of the world from the horrible ""Bean"" eating giants that come from giant country. The story is motivated by the developing connection between a young girl with no parents who finds a paternal relationship and way to escape her reality, in the form of the beautifully realized, whimsical and mostly silly (the way your Grandpa would be) BFG. The BFG instills some pretty big ideals both in the book and on screen. Eg; Sticking to your principles - The BFG refuses to eat children because he knows it's wrong & so subjects himself to eating Snozzcumbers and bullying by the other giants. He also has experienced loss/grief in the form of the first child that he befriended who was killed by the giants. His relationship with Sophie provides him with the possibility of moving on from that grief and allowing himself to be happy again by making choices that may not have worked out for the best previously. Our protagonist, Sophie is presented as the - literally- little girl lost trying to find her dreams. The world of Giant Country, in particular BFG's home, is beautifully realized. While primarily a CGI enhanced environment, the set design for Sophie to interact with creates a seamless whole which is never distracting past the point of wonder. While there are one or two issues with pacing (the introduction to the Queen is distinctly drab and the final scene too brief), there's enough within the main set pieces to ensure we are never left dwelling on earlier moments as the highlight in proceedings. The entry into giant country/BFG's lair, dream catching sequence, opening exchange between BFG and Fleshlumpeater as well as the fantastically silly ""Breakfast with the Queen"" should have kids and parents alike giggling and cooing throughout.In a summer (or year, depending how you look at it) lacking any real family access to a decent movie going experience, The BFG is a pleasant relief. The best way to judge, is to find out for yourself. It'd be a shame to be put off by some of the poor reviews that, while completely acceptable opinions, may not reflect your own thoughts.",The BFG

The girl playing Sophie is an excellent Northern British actress who plays the part very well and is well cast, the giant character is funny, magical and full of warmth and charm with the CG very well done.

The technical expertise of the Weta Workshop in doing this is almost flawless. The story is easy to follow and its depiction here well accomplished. I had watched the trailer and was somewhat apprehensive about the entire product...the trailer is misleading, so my advice is...ignore any apprehension and go see this movie.I have been at a few screenings of movies where at the conclusion the audience clapped. This was one of them. The story is lighthearted and the performances authentic to the Raold Dahl characters. The late Melissa Mathison's screenplay is simple, yet thought-provoking in a gentle and positive way. The performances of the actors are where they need to be with the interplay between the two main characters a joy to watch. Mark Rylance as the big friendly giant and Ruby Barnhill as ten year old Sophie were good choices. And Penelope Wilton as the Queen of England was also a good choice. The John Williams musical score does the job of enhancing the story without being heavy-handed.This is one of a few movies I would enjoy viewing again sometime.",The BFG

175,pablospersonal,The Big Floppy Goof,5,7 September 2016,"This is the kind of review I hate leaving. As a child, I loved Roald Dahl novels. The stories were encapsulating and sparked the imagination, they drove you to turn the page so you could find out what happens next. I was genuinely looking forward to this movie. I was surprised and motivated by the fact that Steven Spielberg was directing the movie and thought ""yes, this is in the bag"" - so, sitting there with the wife, a bag of Revels and becoming the age of 10 again, I waited in anticipation..The problem was I was still waiting as the end credits rolled. My Revels had gone, I was 30ish again and I hadn't felt like I had been taken on the adventure I had been carried through when I was 10 years old. Try pushing a shopping trolley around a supermarket, with no wheels, and it be filled with concrete marmite. That was the feeling of this movie. It was slow, in fact it didn't really move from the start line. It had broken down and was awaiting the AA to come mend it. Spielberg, surprised me and not in a good way. I genuinely believed with his greatness at the helm of this movie, it would have shone. Instead it was a bit drab - nothing seem to stand out. Characters were slightly dull and at times tedious to watch on screen. The more screen time they had the more you wanted them to leave. Okay, maybe not that bad but they weren't exciting enough. Don't get me wrong the acting wasn't bad, not at all but there was no life. I nipped out to the loo half way through and I swear the BFG was still on the same sentence as when I had left 12 minutes earlier. The script seemed to drag, as did the movement of the film. This was not a movie I enjoyed, or at least not how I should have enjoyed it. It needed energy and a good kick up the backside. It wasn't a terrible film and is one of those movies that you could put on the TV for your kids when the council are in your house fixing the bathroom door. Read the book - it is a far greater waste of your time than watching this.

Plus, from a British perspective seemed a somewhat disconnected and insufferable American stereotype of Britons which grated on me. I also found the protagonist rather annoying at first. However, when things kick off with BFG screen time it was all quickly forgotten because Mark Rylance is perfect casting and he was such a lovable character. The motion capture technology used to embody the bumbling giant runt enabled all of the actors exquisite nuances to create the greatest on screen Interpretations of my personal favourite fictional characters.

The BFG takes the terrified Sophie gently from her orphanage bed and spends the rest of the movie bonding with her, precious soul to precious soul.

The BFG has his tormentors, and Sophie becomes his little supporter, encouraging him to deal rightly with his problem. Likewise, the BFG looks out for Sophie who needs all the love she can get.

183,senlarsen,Beautiful movie,8,17 July 2016,"Spielberg is a master story teller. This movie is no exception. In some ways, this movie harks back to the 70s and early 80s to a time when films had more innocence and much more heart without the soppiness, lowbrow, sexism and preaching you get from many children's movies in modern times. There is some very mild violence in this movie and themes of children being hurt. I would expect most 6 year olds would be OK with it, but expect scares for younger ones. What really captured the charm in this story was the beautiful relationship between the two main characters (a sweet but gutsy girl and a stunted giant). Rylance as the BFG was amazing. He's a combination of gentle and simple but not stupid. Most actors would have played the BFG as a dimwit. However, BFG came across as very capable but socially stunted through his own experiences. What also stood out was some amazing camera work. You really get a perspective of the size of the girl, the BFG and the bigger giants all the way through the movie. It's the first movie that seamlessly transitions between 3 wildly different sized characters extremely well. Imagine comparing a mouse with a dog and a human, but grounding the movie with the mouse's view. I expect more movies to copy this in coming years. Minor gripes with the movie include a few slightly long scenes and a slight grating tone from the main heroine. However, as a first time actress, she was superb. Thankfully, no ""girl power"" or ninja warrior sexism to sit through. For the non-sexist, that's a great in itself. In summary, a beautiful movie!",The BFG
184,billweiner,Great Visuals - Spoiler Alert!!,5,10 December 2016,"The visuals are classic Disney. I enjoyed the fantasy aspects with the dreams, however the entire Queen sequence took away from the fantasy aspect and IMHO ruined this movie. The attempt to mix fantasy with reality just did not work for me. The BFG was, however, very likable and touching. I understand the evil versus good concept but the Evil giants were not believable at all. I do not understand why so many of them had red hair. The Queen concept could have been removed without taking away from the movie. When she apparently called Ronald Reagan for air support to beat the evil giants also contributed to making this film unbelievable. I enjoyed the relationship between Sophie and The BFG as well as the visuals. The soundtrack was also supportive of the visuals. I thought the audio contributed to overall senses enjoyment. I would have really enjoyed this movie if it were all fantasy. The ""dreams"" were totally Disney and almost felt like tinker bell and the fairies from Peter Pan. Spielberg did a good job, however I feel like this was not his best piece of art. Seeing the Queen's dream could have added to that scene; giving the audience more of the fantasy visuals. I would not recommend getting this film from a more expensive venue than Redbox. For tow dollars I am fine but not for a rental of five dollars or more.",The BFG

The pacing of the movie was so slow that it made me wonder how a child could enjoy this movie if I was having trouble paying attention to it. The scenery and locations are gorgeous, but I felt like it was more of an artwork that actually telling the story. The last half of the film was much better as things started to unwind and become more interesting, but by that point, I was waiting for it to be over. I was highly disappointed in this movie.

If you're looking for a good movie to take your kids to, this will do, but there isn't really anything to hold onto for older audience members. I thought the little girl's performance was really awkward and unnatural at parts, a lot of the dialogue/sequence of events seemed pretty forced, and while the motion capture was really well done, any time the girl and the BFG were in the same shot the blue screen was painfully obvious. Not to mention that the last third of the movie is pretty boring (it was really testing my patience). Spielberg is a great director in his own right, so he does an overall good job with an incredibly lackluster script, but even so, there isn't much of anything here that you could call noteworthy in any way.",The BFG

I can only assume it has been a very long time since they last read it. Perhaps over time they have remembered it differently. Having read the book again immediately before seeing the film I can assure you it is almost entirely faithful to the original text (barring a couple of new scenes).2) If you HAVEN'T read the book then at the very least you should do your research before watching the film. I read a review from some fool who complained that they were annoyed by the giant getting his words all wrong! I guess they just don't get it and missed the point entirely. Perhaps they would have looked beyond that if they had read the book first.All in all, I personally think that though it is not perfect, it is still incredibly faithful to the quaint magic and mystery of the book, with a few beautiful cinematic moments thrown in. And for me there is one truly perfect aspect - Mark Rylance has the most incredibly warm and friendly eyes.

The movie is aimed at children so adults may find some parts of the film ""dull"". I went to see it last night and with it being almost 2 hours long it can get a bit boring. At the beginning of the film it isn't much but as it progresses it really begins to become quite a fast paced film. The BFG himself is a very moving character. With 9 other giants living alongside him in Giant Country it can get quite sad. At one point the other giants bully him and it can be quite sad. It gives you that feeling when you want to run up to the screen and punch that bully in the face. Altogether though The BFG is a great heartwarming film filled with little giggles and cries. It may not appeal to all adults and teens but it is a great choice for kids and family's to watch",The BFG

194,addietomic,"Missing ""E.T."" atmosphere, but still enjoyable.",7,29 May 2016,"Ever since Steven Spielberg ventured into grim and gritty features like ""A.I."", ""Minority Report"" or ""Munich"", I always secretly hoped he'd look to his early career days and yet again give audiences another wonderful experience as he did in full abundance with ""Close Encounters"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and of course, his, perhaps all-time creative triumph, ""E.T."". Late Melissa Mathison's emotionally mesmerizing writing helped the film's ultra-success (along with the unforgettable Oscar-winning John Williams score), and I dreamed for this home run collaboration to take another come around. And then, 34 years later, it finally did. I would have absolutely loved to write that it produced another very similar undertake in spirit as the story of the small, benign, brown alien with telepathic powers, but unfortunately, this isn't the case. Now, don't get me wrong. My 7 rating gives a distinctive I wasn't disappointed, but only if we differ ourselves from the Spielberg-Mathison-Williams mashup and watch ""The BFG"" as a standalone project. The CGI is impressive, but then again nothing noticeably technologically improved of humans-and-giants together than what we've already seen in, for example, ""Jack the Giant Slayer"", made back in 2012. Mark Rylance gives his usual mild and heartfelt performance as the virtually generated character, but in this case, by my modest opinion, perhaps Andy Serkis would have been a wiser choice for the role. Mathison's script this time takes a much stronger turn on a fairy tale storytelling rather than perhaps somewhat basing itself on realistic grounds, which I, personally feel was a wrong turn, since I completely failed to connect to it, as I did with ""E.T."". Kids ages from 5 to 15 however, might find this more appealing. Spielberg's directing, along with the John Williams soundtrack, is, as always, very smooth and without a false note, but still, one has to wonder if it still could've been on a higher scale. ""The Extra-Terrestrial"" was a film that spoke to everyone, all ages. ""The BFG"" will mainly speak only to children audiences. One also has to question if this endeavor could've, with just a little more creative effort been a cinematic experience to cherish for the next 34 years like with their 1982 feelings-roller-coaster blockbuster. This way, it'll just be for a year, maybe two.",The BFG

200,thomasandres-54232,P!ss off,6,18 February 2017,"Steven Spielberg makes a children's film based on a story by Roald Dahl featuring a magic giant: shouldn't this be great?Spielberg has grown to become a legend in cinema with massive cultural and critical hits such as Jaws, Indiana Jones, E.T., Jurassic Park, need I go on? I mean he made Schindler's List. What happened?The movie is about Sophie who is abducted by a dream-creating friendly giant. The start was good, it was light, charming, funny, you really like the characters of Sophie and the BFG but that was not the problem, and there is a problem. The acting was really fine, Rylance was good as the giant and Barnhill was very likable. Once again the half of the movie I enjoyed and was very optimistic but then it kind of all went down the s*hole.I mean when you have a great cast, a great director who still can make incredible cinema why this?? The scene in Dreamland, with the tree and the dreams was really good, really magical. But it's like he gave up halfway there. The story suddenly doesn't make any sense. They go find the queen to help them (or something, I don't care) and then you get the most despicable scene I have seen in a long time, in the queen's palace. It was just foul. Cheap humour like that is so beneath the potential that this film had, let alone Spielberg. How can a man like him, a visionary, make something that honestly made me think of Garfield 2. Just so very disappointing. The ending did not make any sense, it was so painfully stupid.The CGI is partly very beautiful, partly creepy and ugly to look at.In the end it's really not a terrible movie or anything, it had some really strong scenes and performances but no.

This is a slow and charming tale for those kids that are not too spoiled by fast paced and/or action orientated movies. It also has no love undertones, no violence, no bad language which is a rare happening in movies so in that sense I find it is the ideal movie for a kid.So how about older kids? This movie is not a comedy by any means but it has lots of subtle humor, wit, and at times attempts at action comedy. Enough to entertain the little ones and adults who like this type of humor. It also has a lot of heart. The story is at time too naive and a little choppy for older movie critics but still worth watching. The animation is magnificent and in and of itself makes the movie worth watching. For the word lovers, this movie has a giant that scrambles his words, adds or substitutes syllables which will keep you guessing as to what the words are.

My family (Including my mother) was in stitches laughing. The rest of the movie wasn't that funny though. It was better than I expected it to be though. But honestly, It's overrated. I almost fell asleep half way through. Even my 7 year old brother didn't enjoy it. I couldn't understand half the tings the BFG said. No, erase that. I didn't understand ANYTHING he said.

This film can appeal to anyone of any age. I particularly liked the James Joycean speak of the BFG or God. I tend to like to think of a God in such a manner as a kind and stumbling caretaker unwilling to harm others including those that harm others, have to have free will. The girl shows faith in her bravery to face up to her fears and that inspires the BFG ""whom can hear every whisper"". Well done presentation of this famous story.It was nice to not have to watch a battle scene with the giants which would have blown it in terms of telling the story it seems. So much gets ruined these days with overplayed action films, don't get me wrong, I love any of the other kinds of films as much as anyone else, I just prefer when competent film makers make works of art such as this that can appeal to any age, it maybe as though age maybe of minimal importance to the message, and there was definitely a message in this one.

206,dleecher5,The BFG: impressions,7,22 July 2016,"Occasional fairy tale movie always interests me and this one wasn't an exception. Artful and almost-photorealistic trailer indeed called for attention and the movie itself wasn't disappointing. Visually and atmospherically movie completes its magical mission with ease. What concerns me more is that world of this movie seems cramped inside BFG's (Who said Doom?) wood-and-rock hut. It has an intricate interior with all these beautiful wispy dreams in the cans, ingenious mechanisms and slight cozy chaos. But it is almost all the space that we're getting for this 2-hour flick besides few scenes in London and outside the hut. Event-wise The BFG feels accordingly. It almost totally consists of dialogues between Sophie and her giant friend, who are indeed deliver great job acting. Especially impressive looks Rylance's job. Facial and voice skillfulness of this year's Oscar winner is pretty impressive. Young British actress that plays impossibly restrained and educate orphan Sophie does good enough as well. But it is not enough to be a great movie.The movie starts to feel sleepy so I started to loose my attention somewhere after the middle. There is simply not enough adventure. As soon as I've adjusted to interesting fantasy of this world I started to feel slightly bored. There is not enough tension here and the biggest threat to our heroes is almost not stressful at all. It somewhat delivers pleasure from it's humorous endeavors, but these efforts are pretty limited. Enough to say that big place on the 'humor' shelf here takes a fart joke (that **spoiler alert** involves Queen of England). Most of enjoyable fun goes from cuteness of the pair of the main characters. I'd like to say that screenplay feels decent, dialogue is solid and smart enough especially for a kids movie. But main plot seems limited enough with a taste of absurdity near the end. The magic of fantastic giant-land fades with real world invasion into it. The ending seems unfulfilling in this circumstances. And why did they use 40s London (or it was just my imagination) and then jumped to modern days anyway? For me it was not bad, but not good enough movie. 7 is a good rank for it. I would compare it with Jungle Book, which wins by all means here. It was more fun, more dynamic, more graphically appealing and not a bit boring. But The BFG is still a decent enough family/kids movie.",The BFG

Why she picked this movie, I will never understand. As I was leaving the house my brother yelled ""You know they're calling that movie the worst film ever directed by Spielberg, right?"" Oh, how I should have listened. I was sitting in between two of my other friends (not the birthday girl). Thank goodness, because I think I might've ruined her birthday with my constant ""What are they doing?"" and ""Are they serious with this dialogue right now?"" At one point I actually fell asleep. When I fell asleep, they were frolicking around the magic dream tree. When I woke up, they were outside the window of the Queen of England. Yes, it's as ridiculous as it sounds. And miraculously enough, I was still completely caught up plot-wise, despite falling asleep. THAT is how stupid this movie was.The small child, whose name we don't learn until the very end, was every stereotypical child-wonder ever. I'm pretty sure the filmmakers decided to take Matilda, take away her superpowers, and stick her into Giantville. The BFG himself is quite frightening, really. His habit of screwing up every word out of his mouth comes across as annoying rather than endearing. And why in the world did he take the child in the first place? It's so confusing. And his little dream-lab is frightening, to say the least.The ""message"" of the film is actually pretty screwed up. When the BFG decides to put the child back in her orphanage for her own good (the smartest decision he'll make in the film, btw), she throws herself out the window, believing that the BFG will catch her. That works out great for her, but what about the small impressionable children watching the film? And at the very end, it is revealed that the BFG can actually hear the whispers of children everywhere. I left the theater disturbed rather than happy at that revelation.The CGI is laughable. When I saw the trailer, I was convinced for a few moments that it was an animated film. My friend came into the theater convinced that it was an animated film.

However, to judge the BFG along those lines would be a great disservice to a movie that has a great many merits, particularly as a family film. Shed of much of the darkness of Roald Dahl's source material, Spielberg breathes a healthy dose of his magic into The BFG, though it never reaches to the greatness of ET. Spielberg, however, does get some very strong performances from Mark Rylance as the title character and newcomer Ruby Barnhill as the young orphan who befriends the giant. The real star of the movie is probably the spot-on motion capture that brings the giants to life. If you're expecting a groundbreaking film like Raiders of the Lost Ark or a crisply directed work like Catch Me If You Can, you're in the wrong movie.

I hated Shopie's (Ruby Barnwell's) weird wooden acting, there was no connection between her and any other character - especially as most of it is green screen, on her own, and she's just not good at it. The best performance was Jemaine Clement as Fleshlumpeater. I didn't even know this was a Spielberg film until the credits and I thought ""This film should have been better."" Spielberg really let himself down with this. I went to see this with my 7 year old niece, who is a mature 7; an hour into the film she was asking when it finished. If you want to watch the BFG, watch the 1989 animated one.",The BFG

It was really quite emotional to see it being brought to life.The cinematography and CGI was amazing, but that didn't compare to the wonderful atmosphere created by splendid storytelling and interesting character development.The balance of suspense and cheerfulness were just right for a family film. I've seen some complain about the giants not being 'scary enough', but I thought they were at a decent level. My friend and I jumped at a couple places, and a mum rushed out with her young child (but later returned) who was getting too scared. We need to remember that this IS, after all, a children's tale! Even with that said, I'm sure a few children throughout the world will have some nightmares in relation to the man-eating giants!It was really quite amazing seeing this film, and I hope it does well so we can continue to have more like it.",The BFG

219,dankbladders,"Amongst other things, should have been fully animated.",6,2 September 2016,"The first film to really perfectly blend live-action with digital animation was likely Avatar; previous attempts like Sky Captain were impressive but not exactly life-like. I would say that for a few years Avatar held the record for the most advanced digital effects in cinema, until in 2013 it passed that record to Gravity, which in turn passed it to Jungle Book earlier this year.I like Jungle Book, mainly because it surprised us all by being an objectively entertaining and emotive film -- as well as looking fantastic. It set a high bar which, unfortunately, Spielberg has whacked his head on.The first thing that annoyed me was that whenever the live-action Sophie was being carried around by the CGI BFG, she jerked around slightly in a manner that was never quite realistic, as though the tracking technology was having a tough time incorporating her layer effectively into the frame. Or maybe the tracker was working perfectly, and the uncanny-valley movement of Sophie is down to the disconnect actors have working with screens. Whatever, people who've seen the film will know what I'm talking about.The troubles don't stop there. Live-action Sophie doesn't quite blend properly with her 3D computer environment. It's not the lights or the actress: it's just the cartoonish appearance of the whole set, into which I'm afraid a real child just doesn't fit. It looks great, don't get me wrong, fantastical-umscious! But my disbelief is not suspended in the way it would have been if the live- action 0.5% had just been dispensed with all-together. The BFG himself is especially bad; although he is a triumph of animation the team should be proud of, he looks like a cartoon. I wouldn't actually mind watching a cartoon -- I quite dig the look -- but by incorporating an actually real actor into the mix Spielberg is telling me he wants to trick me into thinking the whole environment is actually real, and I'm afraid it just hasn't worked.This is a common problem that we also saw with Peter Jackson's Hobbit. I won't bore you with a lecture, but some things are just easier to make convincingly out of CGI than others, and detailed creatures similar to humans rank quite low on the list. I'm not saying it can't be done -- Gollum proved it can over a decade ago -- but you don't want to try too often, and you certainly don't want to draw attention to your computer-trickery by saturating the entire frame with it. By replacing all of his heavily made up Uruk-hai with CGI goblins for the second trilogy, and seeing off the wonderful landscape of New Zealand for PineWood Studios, Jackson turned his blockbuster epic into a cartoon. It doesn't matter how good your CGI is: it isn't that good, and won't be for decades yet (human actors in Avatar were generally kept in practical environments, or covered head to toe; now you know why).Jungle Book was lucky. Not only is the work generally much better on that film, but the jungle environment is also a fair bit easier to do, because there's a bigger margin for trees and crops when compared with something like a house made of bricks, and there weren't many instances where the human actor (or double) got digitally picked up and flung across the screen; he generally moved under his own power around the set, or was replaced with CGI himself, which plays down the uncanny-valley wonkiness I was talking about when Sophie was getting carried about.There's other issues as well, outside of the impressive-but-not-quite-impressive-enough special effects, but others will talk about them. I've said my piece and rate 6 stars (or whatever they are) out of 10.",The BFG

221,popcornpaul,"The BFG or as he is also known, the Big Friendly Giant.",7,2 November 2016,"Legendary director Steven Spielberg and award winning actor Mark Rylance find themselves working together once again in the live action remake of Roald Dahl's classic novel, The BFG. Starring Rylance as the titular character and relative newcomer Ruby Barnhill as the matter-of-fact, insomniac orphan Sophie, The BFG is a gigantic fantasy adventure for all ages.Based on the bestselling book from the Dahl archives, The BFG is all about orphan Sophie who wanders around at night in an orphanage because she cannot sleep. One night she is distracted by noises outside and inadvertently sees a gigantic man tiptoeing through the streets. In order to keep his existence secret he pretty much kidnaps her and takes her to his home in Giant Land (somewhere a little further north than the Outer Hebrides) and keeps her in his house. After somewhat of a Stockholm Syndrome situation (or as the film portrays it an unlikely friendship blossoms between the two) the Big Friendly Giant and Sophie explore issues that include being so small in a big world and how to deal with bullies. Fantastical in the classical sense, The BFG is at times silly and over the top but it somehow fits in with the movie and the sort of whimsical far-fetched imagination a child would come up with. It makes me think that, for all an adult's imagination is limited by sense and the laws of the world, a child's is not tied down by logic and a background of reality. Anything can happen, even if it doesn't make sense or is over the top. The BFG is like this – it thinks nothing of going to see the Queen or calling in an army to help with bullies – this is fantasy at its up most. The giant's world is breathtakingly done, as we see it from Sophie's perspective and some of it (especially in 3D) is overwhelming making you feel as small as Sophie is. Not only that, but he might be a Big Friendly Giant, but in comparison to his people, he's actually little. Overall the film is quite good, staying true to the book. Rylance does a great job at creating a lovable character – sad in some respects but wise in others. Even his confused and muddled language is brilliantly performed and I give top marks for his acting skills. Barnhill, as Sophie, is great as the sassy little girl and the dynamic between the two is brilliant. Elements of the movie, especially when the both go out to explore and catch dreams is clearly influenced by such classic literature as Alice in Wonderland, and the effects and experience is great to watch too. There's a few flaws here and there and questions to be asked (like there's only so many giants on the land, but why are they all broad cockney and the BFG sounds like he's from Cornwall or something) but overall an enjoyable kids movie.",The BFG

This is why so many people don't like it.I'm only half-way through it, and I already adore it. Now, admittedly, the writing and plot movement seem a bit rushed (hence only 8 stars), but the way it plays out, the way it appeals to one's inner child, the way it makes us remember believing in magic and playing in our back yards with our magical cloaks (bath towel held in place by a clothespin) and anything but planting a chainsaw into someone's forehead for a laugh is what makes it special.So many have forgotten this.

What I liked the most was the way in which the main characters "" the giant "" & ""the girl"" interact in the story, it is a lovely and magical friendship that is immersed into action. At the same time, I liked so much the roles they play in the story because they are so charming. Throughout the movie, I could perceive the girl represents the innocence and courage that children of her same age posses in childhood.

The trailers didn't get my kids excited, but I convinced them to check it out. We didn't go in the theater with super-high expectations, because I saw the mixed reviews and my kids were just not excited. But during the movie my kids turned to me and told me saying ""Dad, this is great!"". And I do agree with them, this was great. Finally an original story, that you just cannot predict. As a father, I am a fan of all recent Pixar, Dreamworks and various other CGI cartoons, but we are getting a bit bored with the predictability of Manny and Diego rubbing shoulders for the umpteenth time. On the other hand this story had some magic in it, like when you are reading a good Andersen tale. The story had its moments of suspense, excitement and laughter; the characters are nicely acted, the CGI is up to what you would expect in 2016 (not perfect, but that's the adult in you noticing those occasional moments) and the whole story sucked me in. It's surely not the excitement of a Marvel comic book (those are not for this age group, anyhow - we do double check commonsensemedia), but we enjoyed it thoroughly. The closest reference in style (and positive surprise) would be Paddington, though surely that must have come through more evidently as The BFG seems to have more mixed reviews. So I do very much recommend it. If you do not expect Indiana Jones because it's Mr. Spielberg in the director's seat, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Children aged 4-10 (or those that still believe in magic and monsters).Who did Spielberg make this film for? Not you if your reading this review.I took my 5 year old daughter to the London BFI IMAX as a birthday treat and she was blown away by the magical and immersive enveloping world of Sophie the norphan and the Big Friendly Giant - the film is perfectly timed, paced well and scary enough for the average CHILD. I don't want my kid to be mentally scared by watching a film that was supposed to about a little girl and a FRIENDLY GIANT. She laughed a lot, she cried and she was just enough scared and didn't get up for a wee once (which is a sure sign she wasn't bored).If you have kids go and see it with them. Don't be the sad 30+ man in the anorak and note book sitting on your own with Spielbergian expectations of being scared the poop out of your pants because guess what this film is not made for you - in fact if Spielberg did make the film for adults he would have dishonoured Roald Dahls great legacy of work (as growed ups like us are horrid).I read the book as a kid and read it recently to my daughter - the film is perfectly placed in her imagination to fill her life with positivity and for her to realise that not all big people are bad and just because life sometimes throws you a bad apple, as long as you dream big you can achieve anything no matter who you are. That message shines through both the book and the film.And if you think ""so what does this blokes kid know anyway"" well by age 5 my daughters seen every kids film possible and knows when to tell me ""Pan"", ""Capture the flag"", ""Minions"" and ""the Good Dinosaur"" are boring etc - she knows her stuff.I implore you to take a child and show them a world of dreams and magic, let's not sour their childhood with our growed up angst and bitterness - the world needs more of that like it needs grown ups reviewing kids films :p (yes that is a raspberry).",The BFG

234,sastranks,a heartwarming and thoughtful film,7,10 August 2016,"Firsty, i am very surprised by the negative comments about the film being 'boring'. The BFG is a childhood classic loved by millions of British kids (and adults alike), but I did fear that audiences unfamiliar with growing up with Roald Dahl may not have the same reaction to the film. The film was engaging from start to finish, and did the book justice. The BFG was written for Dahl's granddaughter, Sophie. It told the tale of a peace-loving, outcast giant from the North who stumbled over his words and wanted to bring joy to the world instead of stealing and eating its innocence. Dahl, a giant of a man in real life at a whopping 6'6 was of Norwegian decent, dyslexic and after seeing the horrors of WWII, an advocate of peace. Dahl is The BFG! and the book/film is his story for Sophie.This is a subtle film, which creeps upon you; dealing with the issues of loneliness, mental health and being different. Sophie, a young orphan with insomnia is plucked from her bed by what she thinks is a monster - by all accounts he should be - but he is a vegetarian, almost Buddhist like giant living amongst bloodthirsty cannibal giants who enjoy eating little children. Sophie is catapulted into a world beyond her imagination, where her BFG is catching dreams to deliver to those sleeping back in the land of the beings. Mark Rylance is a joy to watch as the BFG. Yes, it could have been darker, but i liked the way Spielberg has concentrated his efforts on creating a dreamlike, fun world that is lighthearted and true to the world Roald Dahl created through his writing.",The BFG

237,itsWillCarne,"Big, Friendly, but Not Worth Watching",2,24 July 2016,"On paper you could argue that 'The BFG' screams ""blockbuster summer movie"" - a combination of Disney, Steven Spielberg and beloved children's author Roald Dahl with one of the best children's books ever. But the reality is a disappointing mess of dull special effects with mismatching awe-inspiring music.The flaw in turning Roald Dahl books into family films, is that words on a page don't have movie-style ratings. In the BFG the main plot of the film is the existence of child- eating giants, which naturally due to the rating and audience of the film we only see materialized in a giant sniffing Sophie and going 'yum'. I wasn't expecting graphic images of children being mauled, but with no darkness whatsoever the other giants became comical stereotypes who define the disclaimer on the back of the DVD of 'mild threat', despite their main role in the story being outrageous murderous beasts that require military intervention. So immediately from the word go, the main drive for the film is fundamentally flawed: the giants aren't scary, it just looked like the dwarfs from the Hobbit trilogy got lost.If you've read the book you'll know the main story: (a) Girl taken to giant-land by the BFG. (b) Girl learns about other children-eating giants, and that the BFG just goes around giving children nice dreams. (c) They go to the queen and use the army to round up the giants and put them in a hole. Yet it's almost laughable that we spend the majority of the film in (b), sat around laughing at the BFG's speech impediment (ha, disability) and despite taking a lot of the dialogue directly from the book, failing to transfer the magic. There's no conversation about how different children from different countries taste (hilarious - go read the book), or even explanation about the Snozzcumber (amusing - go read the book). The outcome is a movie that feels both slow at times, and rushed at others. And you get epic music climaxing as the young girl looks around in awe, but you're left wondering how she knows what's going on because as an audience we certainly don't.Admittedly the quality of the visuals in terms of realism of the CGI and use of motion- capture was top notch. However in the modern world of cinema this is far from impressive; it's been normalized so much over the past few years of filmmaking that I'd argue that CGI is only significant if done badly.It is possible to make a film about a classic story using groundbreaking special effects while retaining the heart and drive of a classic family movie (see Disney's 2016 'The Jungle Book'). And go back in time and release 'The BFG' ten, or twenty years ago and the effects may be distracting enough to make up for the shoddy storytelling. But if you're looking to go to the cinema today I'd recommend every other film currently showing over the BFG, and there lies the problem. The film isn't the worst thing to ever grace our screens - but put simply there are so many better films out there, if you find yourself watching this one I'd recommend you reassess your life (I know I certainly am). Let this stand as a warning to films made from classic books, or films made from re-making earlier classic films: at the end of the day if it isn't as good as it's inspiration, you'd be better off reading the book or watching the original. And in the case of the Big Friendly Giant, I would recommend you doing just that.",The BFG

Not only is the story as minimal as meat on a turkey after Thanksgiving feast, but the dialogue just comes off as random and arbitrary, adding little to nothing to the already confusing ""plot"" (if you can call it that). And that's the major problem with this film. The plot is as confused, inconsistent, and as bare boned as a screenplay can possibly get. Sometimes the film feels like telling the ""story"". And sometimes it just- doesn't. There's no rhyme or reason as to why it feels like taking a break from the three act structure. It just- does. And it's BORING. So incredibly boring. I appreciate the CGI. But it just looks boring. There's even a scene where the BFG does nothing but hop around and giggle. Why, you may ask? I don't know. The film definitely doesn't know.

I loved it and I've even seen the animated film from all those years ago.My memory of the book is a bit fuzzy, but what I recall of it is actually somewhat close to what the film does. Yes, it's missing a few elements, but the plot of the film is well put together, it's not fancy, but rather sweet actually. This is a family-friendly film and that's what's so charming about it.The BFG had a few darker elements that they didn't touch on as much, but overall. I'll say that it's definitely worth watching. What surprises me though the most is the simple fact that it was such a failure at the box office.On top of that, I have to wonder just why everyone is being so harsh on it. Yeah, it's not the greatest film ever, but it's better than some of the crap being put out today.That's all I really have to say about this film. I highly recommend you watch it for yourself before you judge it. And if at best, Read the book too.I think honestly it's the generational gap.

245,andrew-21392,A splendid visualisation of the book,9,15 August 2016,"Have you got here eventually? Good.Disregard every bad review in its entirety. Everyone that says it is boring, that the acting is bad, that the plot makes no sense, that there is no magic. Have a chuckle at the one that says there should be more Doom weapons by all means - but the rest - utter cacbabble. You don't have to read the book to love this film, but the book is the story and the story comes alive in this film. The BFG is flawed, he is a small giant, he is a gentle giant in a time of angry giants but he tries to do right. He can't articulate well but he tries. Sophie is lost and alone and seeks purpose and not only finds a friend who will always be listening, but saves children and raises an army by having a plan. I'll grant a little slow at times - I thought the palace scene could've been snappier but then I'm watching it from the PoV of knowing the punchline. My four year old did hide behind her open fingers when the bad giants came by, and was elated at the end. ""That movie was brilliant"" she declared. For me it was Quentin Blake's images of the story Dhal put in my head, brought to life.Dreamlands, Giant lands, concocting dreams and why they are important to have and believe in. What could be more magical?If you have no imagination or sense of wonder, you may struggle here - don't watch Matilda either. If you need detailed plot history and Letts notes for a PG, stop reading George R R Martin, start reading Hemingway, or Dhal. Magic needs no explanation - that's why its magic: just like this film.",The BFG
246,frank-88097,A story justifying child abduction,4,14 August 2016,"We watched BFG last night and my mind is still trying to grasp the twisted messages of this movie. If you haven't seen it the basic premise is this. (Spolier) An old guy abducts children. His justification is so they ""don't tell his secret"". Each child after their abduction ends up getting murdered. He tells the little girl of only one other abducted boy, but remains quiet on the apparent dozens of others as he presents her with the assorted clothing of both boys and girls. Which one can only assume are souvenirs of each dead child, a characteristic pattern of any serial killer. But we are led to believe by a child suffering from Stockholm Syndrome that he is a Big Friendly Giant. Then there is end of the movie. The British Military captures the bad Giants and takes them to an island where they can't hurt anyone. Sounds like a pleasant ending except when you realize this island is actually Guantanamo bay. Before the attack (which takes place on an unknown foreign country) the queen calls the US president. No contents of the discussion are disclosed and since the US took no part in the attack the logical conclusion is that it was to secure a location for the prisoners since they obviously weren't returned to the UK. This movie is probably the most twisted ""kids"" movie since the drug scene in the good dinosaur.",The BFG
247,edumeghasen,A huge let down,5,24 August 2016,"I am a Roald Dahl fan. When I came to know that BFG was being made into a movie, that too by Steven Spielberg, I was waiting for its release with the eagerness of a 10-year-old. I really enjoyed reading the book. I do not venture out to cinema halls to watch movies these days. It is almost 4 years. But for BFG, I made an exception. I was looking forward to all the funny, crazy things from the book, imagining watching them on the screen when I entered the hall.And the movie was a big disappointment. Technically, the movie may be brilliant but it did not do justice to the book. If only they had stuck to the original story. The opening scene itself killed the spirit of the book and was a huge disappointment. The giant country is supposed to be very hot, sandy and without anything growing around. The giants sleep during the day and go hunting during nights. Those scenes should have been in brighter light. The 'frolicking' indulged in the giants with the car was totally out of story line.Even catching of dreams was dragged for too long and unnecessarily made serious. Only one dream that the child was shown having was no good. There could have been more beautiful and colorful dreams as shown in the book. The nightmare that BFG blows into Fleshlumpeater was completely dropped. It could have been a hilarious scene.Sophie was hiding in his pocket when BFG was hurled around by other giants which would have had more impact.Even BFG's cave is supposed to be simple with a table and walls with shelves full of jars, with the friendly giant not bothering to cook. That simplicity was the beauty of BFG. The last scene of catching the giants and dropping them in a pit specially dug for them could have been a little more elaborate. It looked as if it was wrapped up in a hurry. The only saving grace was whizzpoppers and palace scenes.On the whole it was a big low down. May be it is sacrilegious to be critical about a Steven Spielberg film, so all reviews were good. I am still an admirer of SS films and hope and wish that his coming ventures do not disappoint.",The BFG
248,ckwong7,"Loved it! Don't miss ! Magical, beautiful, heartwarming +funny with lovely soundtracks",9,25 August 2016,"I truly feel sorry for those who miss this movie. I think it's a very beautiful, heart warming, magical and funny movie with lovely soundtracks. A movie to be watched from the lens of childlike innocence and imagination. A movie with depth and hilarious dialogue as the giants speak funny English. Amazing acting from Mark Rylance as the BFG and Ruby Barnhill as Sophie.THANK YOU STEVEN SPIELBERG for making this movie - I am reminded of the fun younger days reading all of Roald Dahl's books and Quentin Blake's cute illustrations .My friend (age 40s who saw the movie with me) has never read a Roald Dahl book yet she thinks the movie is awesome. Glad we didn't listen to the negative sayers , we think its a great movie for everyone (but not toddlers afraid of giants) and its especially for adults - if you want to feel young again.",The BFG
249,joanagramaca-42784,Strange Feeling,6,1 November 2016,"when i first started watching the movie i fell in love with it, the style, the fantasy, everything. The story is very inspiring and touching, but when the giant and the girl were headed to talk to the queen of England, in my opinion,it was absurd and did not matched with the style of the movie,it was a huge disappointment.All the stuff with the choppers taking the other giants, it was really disturbing knowing that it could be so much better. Spielberg really could have done an amazing work with this guide, but he was not on his best. In the end, the movie isn't horrible but its not amazing too.Its not a kind of a movie that i would like to see a 2nd time.",The BFG
250,arspedf,A beautiful and sweet story,10,2 November 2016,"This movie is splendid. Without the boring gimmicks it is heart touching and purely lovely. In this world you can see through a child eye, the kindly queens and her helpers, the friendly giant, the lovely little girl. The scenes are beautiful and he tale is profound. I love the plot, as it's not conventional, but laying out in a beautiful way. And it does show the lovely characteristics of English people, their kind and open heart. Also their splendid culture and hearts. And there are many funny details too. Also some sad ones, when they depart. ""But what did she say. It tells a story of little gal. "" I love this scene with its music, it's just very touching. And those scenes are many, and they feel organic and lively.And the most gorgeous depiction is the relationship between the little girl and the old giant. I like both of them. Recommend this movie for everyone who has a child's heart, a youthful dream. And thanks for the movie makers, thank you very much to being us this movie!",The BFG

I is the BFG!""",10,5 November 2016,"I watched this movie with my 7 year old daughter yesterday, literally 10 times back to back. Not only are the graphics in this movie beautiful but the message is as well. My daughter has been experiencing bullying lately and this movie couldn't have come at a better time. It taught my daughter how to stand up to bully's and not to let them affect or change her. The movie teaches you that it is OK to ask for help. It is OK to be different. It is OK to dream and believe in magic. I cannot understand why someone would give this movie under 10 stars. One of the best Disney movies I have seen in a long time.

I am a 68 year old woman, and this is one of the most delightful, charming, magical. movies I have ever seen. It made me smile, laugh and cry all in the same movie. Obviously myself and the other reviewers must be from different planets. My husband, daughter, granddaughter, and son in law watched it with me, and they all thought it was a very good movie. The interactions between the characters are believable. Some scenes might be a bit a bit scary for small children, only the whole i was an excellent movie...well put together, and with a good story-line. I would watch it again and again.",The BFG
253,evelyngrzedzicki,Disappointing,2,1 December 2016,"Having enjoyed the Roald Dahl books as a child, of course I had to see this movie. I wish I hadn't. I just can't recommend it. Visually, the movie looks good, it's pretty, the animation is fairly detailed, bright and smooth. Thaaaat's.. about all I can say on the good side.To begin with, I understand that movies are adaptations of books, and that they will not follow them to the letter, fine fine. The actress Ruby Barnhill was immediately irritating. (A book note, Sophie seemed like a sweet enough child, lonely, bookish, etc) Sophie in this movie was simply a snobby, overbearing little brat with absolutely nothing likable about her. This actress, (or just her portrayal of Sophie as I don't remember seeing her elsewhere), made the movie a chore to watch. The plot was slow and dull, everything dumbed down or left out, (even for a children's movie), the pace was poor, the humour wasn't even bad enough to be funny, just bad, the giants were not scary as intended, just stupid, it had none of the charm of the original, no-one at all was memorable or endearing, not even the BFG himself.I.. just hated it :/",The BFG
254,smitpiet-41703,"Such a great movie! If only children and their parents would rate this movie, it would have gotten all the stars!",10,14 December 2016,"This movie is great and does capture the original story very well, also with such beautiful imagery and rich scenes! Saw it with my little nephew and nieces, they loved it! And I did probably love it even more! As a kid I've read the book, and my fantasy went through the roof. People and especially kids need to have their mind and heart go on adventures, and this movie is a great recipe for that. Of course is the original story much darker, but it does not need to be like that for the movie. For a children-book the dark details are hefty and might be on the edge for some, but it works out great. For a children-movie it would probably be way too much scare, in my opinion.I'm glad that our world is so well cultivated by great art and stories/movies like these. Without a great dose of fantasizing, naughty humor (such as whizzpopping ;)) and victorious dreaming, the grayish square tends to close in on people, turning them slowly into square- headed human beings who hardly can open up to dreaming, be it fictive, romantically or artistically. How empty is that. If you rate this movie very low, please try to open up a bit more, because it is kinda tragic you know. This movie/story inspires us to dream, to have fun. It's also a great way to introduce children to the world which is a place of magic and love but also of certain scare and despair. These stories are an escape, a journey of the mind as well as a lesson of the good and bad, which is important to know from young on. No matter your age, I'll highly suggest to go see it. Enjoy!",The BFG
255,nicksear,Not an enjoyable watch.,3,12 February 2017,"So, me and my partner needed a film to watch and we settled on the BFG. Within the first 5 minutes we both agreed that the film was being ruined by the character of Sophie. Wooden acting and an annoying and overly pretentious voice. This continued throughout the film and proceeded to annoy us further. The fact the BFG had an uncanny resemblance to Ryan Stiles was on my mind the entire film. The movie has a massive play on British people. It over stereotypes Britain as a pompous country. The Queen also is horribly stereotyped with her butlers and Corgi's. I have a feeling this was done to appeal to an American audience. However, my biggest gripe is the time jumps in the film. So it all starts off in what appears modern day Britain as you see a modern double decker bus going past Westminster. However as the movie plays through the opening scenes with Sophie we see frequent clues to it being around 1940-1950. Moving through the film, we see Mr Tibbs use a walkie talkie from around the 1970's-1980's, also the military uniforms used are of 1990's on wards as are the majority of military aircraft. I know that's an odd thing to pick up on, but it was so annoying for someone like myself. Bad acting, over stereotyped for an American audience, loads of inaccuracies, and the ending was a bit naff. Would not recommend.",The BFG
256,bakerbubba,Great Movie,9,6 April 2017,"""Bigger Than Life"" Movie Review of The BFG.The BFG, or Big Friendly Giant, is a heart-warming family film that explores the idea of finding friendships in the most unusual circumstances. The balance of action, magical intrigue, and humor will keep adults and children alike glued to the movie screen. The story follows a young orphan girl, Sophie (played by Ruby Barnhill), who mistakenly observes a giant snooping around the streets of London from her bedroom window in the middle of the night. This giant, The BFG (played by Mark Rylance), snatches her from her bed and takes her with him to giant country to ensure that the knowledge of his existence remains a secret. Terrified at first, Sophie begins to learn about the BFG's life, as well as the existence of other, much less friendly, man- eating giants. Together, Sophie and The BFG plot out a plan to rid the world of these horrible giants, while developing a friendship that both parties are desperately in need of. The screenplay stayed true to the story line of the original novel, and captured the comic nature of The BFG's backward speech. Spielberg's ability to create a bigger than life on screen giant is impeccably done.I do caution; the PG rating may be somewhat misleading, as younger viewers may find some of the giants to be a bit imposing, to downright terrifying. Overall 4 Stars; must see! The movie is derived from the 1982 novel by Roald Dahl. This 2016 movie production was directed by Steven Spielberg in conjunction with Melissa Mathison, who also worked with him on E.T.",The BFG

Went to the theater with my 89 year old great grandma, about 2 minutes in after the trailers finished she fell asleep and didn't open her eyes until the cinema lights came back on. Honestly, she was the lucky one, my great grandma didn't have to experience the torture.The acting was so bad I wanted to cry at various points, the storyline was terrible and the characters had to force their words out of their mouths.
