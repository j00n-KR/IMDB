0,Leofwine_draca,A decent debut effort from Eli Roth,6,21 December 2015,"Eli Roth's debut film as director shares some of the queasiness and disturbing atmosphere of his later HOSTEL horrors, albeit on a lower budget and with less intensity. Saying that, it's a darn sight better than HOSTEL PART II and even if it does share inevitable comparisons with the likes of THE EVIL DEAD and other set-in-the-woods shockers, that's not necessarily a negative. In fact I found CABIN FEVER to be a well-made film, focusing a little more on character than you'd expect from a teen movie and offering plenty of scares and tension during the running time. Okay, things fall apart twenty minutes before the end, and the film finishes on a silly joke rather than on anything more substantial, but nevertheless this is a thoroughly effective effort which definitely isn't for the faint-hearted! Essentially the old teenagers-in-peril plot is utilised once more yet despite this, there aren't many clichés to be seen. Instead the film has an ambiance of '70s grindhouse flicks or genuinely frightening early '80s terror tales. The acting from the various cast members is decent throughout and one of the main reasons to keep watching, and the camera-work is great, with some really inventive moments. Being an Eli Roth film, there are the inevitable gore effects, all of which are sickeningly convincing. Roth goes for the gross-out on occasion, offering a cringeworthy and infamous leg-shaving scene and a woman's face missing, and eventually body parts are strewn around the landscape in full-blown gore movie mode. Yet the idea of having a flesh-eating virus as the villain is a pleasingly fresh one, and it makes for many paranoid moments as the characters (and viewers) attempt to figure out who's infected and who's clean. If the cheap, anything-goes climax had been more inspiring, this would have been a top-notch genre offering; as it is, it's a worthwhile and decent effort.",Cabin Fever
1,SnoopyStyle,Ugly Douche-a-thon,2,10 February 2014,"This is Eli Roth's coming out party. Five college friends rent a cabin in the woods after finishing the finals. They suffer horrific flesh-eating disease, crazy locals, and each other. Other than Rider Strong, there aren't any compelling actors here. The style is lacking. The story is grindingly boring, unfunny and unscary. Bert is such an annoying jerk that his antics infect the rest of the group. Quite frankly, I couldn't care whether any of them survive. There are too many douchie guys in this movie.The best and only good thing here is the gore. That part is good considering it's a low budget first time effort. Eli is able to copy that part for this 'The Evil Dead' tribute. However I can't really take the douche-a-thon. As a movie, I have to sell the characters. Eli does show flashes of capable filmmaking.",Cabin Fever
2,claudio_carvalho,Very Gore With Potential of Cult-Movie,8,10 July 2005,"The college friends Paul (Rider Strong), Karen (Jordan Ladd), Bert (James DeBello), Marcy (Cerina Vincent) and Jeff (Joey Kern) rent an isolated cabin in the woods to spend a week together. When they arrive, a man contaminated with a weird disease asks for help to them, but they get in panic and burn the man, who falls in the water reservoir and dies. The whole group, except Karen, makes a pact of drinking only beer along the week without knowing where the dead body is. When Karen drinks tap water and gets the disease, the group begins their journey to hell.""Cabin Fever"" is a collection of clichés and parts of horror movies (""Evil Dead"", ""Outbreak"", ""The Night of the Living Dead"" – the remake, ""Braindead"" etc.) that works very well. There is lots of gore, impressive special effects and this movie has potential to become cult. In the cover of the Brazilian DVD, there is a reference to Peter Jackson, who seems to have liked this movie too. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Cabana do Inferno"" (""Cabin of the Hell"")Note: on 27 March 2015, I saw this movie again.",Cabin Fever
3,kosmasp,A funny and bloody little movie that could,7,4 November 2009,"Quite some people misjudged this movie. For different reasons, but they misjudged it. For once the Name ""Quentin Tarantino"" on the cover got (some) people riled up and thinking this was a new Tarantino movie. Of course it states right there, that he isn't actually the director, but that he is endorsing this movie.Nowadays people do know Eli Roth, but I guess it was necessary for the production company to have a big name behind/beside the title. Apart from that, other people misjudged this as a slick Horror movie. This isn't slick, this is down and dirty in more than one way (paying homage to Evil Dead and other movies Eli Roth seemingly likes). This is really scary at times and finds a pretty neat ending for a movie like this ...",Cabin Fever
4,gavin6942,Best American Horror Film in Years,8,23 February 2006,"A group of college kids goes camping, only to run into a vagrant with a very nasty disease that involves vomiting blood. After killing the bum, and dumping him in the river, things actually get worse: the water supply comes from this very same river.Writer-Director Eli Roth is like the great American hope when it comes to horror movies. He grew up ingesting 70s and 80s horror (which are undeniably the best decades for horror ever) and is personal friends with director David Lynch and composer Angelo Badalamenti (who made some of the music for this film)... This is the perfect witch's cauldron to brew up the future of horror and save us from the mediocre horse crap that's been coming out the past 15 years.Cabin Fever is the cure. We have a group of teenagers going to the woods to party, and they end up encountering a monster that's actually believable: a flesh-eating virus. With music that sets the tone, perfect lighting, quality acting and gobs and buckets of blood, gore fans are in for a treat. The cliché of teenagers drunk in the woods actually makes sense rather than simply being an overdone idea. In an odd turn of events, the alcohol turns out to be their only hope for salvation (but will they find out in time?). And a powerful performance by Rider Strong. All the actors were great, and the characters were dead-on. I have seen films where characters aren't developed enough to know them or over-developed (because why should we care if they'll die anyway). I could identify most of the kids in this film with people I've known in real life: Strong as the boy in love with his childhood friend, the guy who will only drink beer... these are real personalities.Another great thing about this movie is the humor. I found myself laughing out loud a dozen times in the first fifteen minutes. And as the movie gets darker, so does the humor. You have to be truly sick to find some of it funny, but if you're watching horror films you're probably sick enough. Keep an eye on the sign behind the rabid boy when they return to the shop. The reference to ""Deliverance"" combined with the kung-fu is something you will never forget. And the end of the movie, which I won't reveal here, has one of the strangest ""reverse racist"" jokes I've ever seen. And the character of Winston, while a bit of an extreme case of caricature, is pretty amusing.If you're a fan of horror, be sure to watch the making-of documentary. It's only 20 minutes, so you won't get bored as they quickly move from the acting to music to effects. Not too technical, but gives you enough overview to really appreciate the thought that went into every little detail. Roger Ebert says, ""The movie adds up to a few good ideas and a lot of bad ones, wandering around in search of an organizing principle."" I don't agree with Ebert at all, which is sad because I normally would. The film is quite organized and linear, with a central theme and plot. The ""few good ideas"" permeate the course of the film. Are the ""bad ideas"" his homages to other films? The use of the theme from ""Last House on the Left"" was brilliant and subtle.As I said in the intro, Eli Roth is the man you want making your horror films -- he knows the secret recipe and accepts no substitutions. Highly recommended!",Cabin Fever
5,jboothmillard,Cabin Fever,4,27 February 2007,"I can agree with the critics that it is similar to the same formula as past horror films, e.g. Night of the Living Dead with the last survivor being shot accidentally (or on purpose), and The Evil Dead with the isolated cabin, but I think it is alright. It is a pretty gritty and gross horror film, especially from debuting director Eli Roth (Hostel). The film starts with a guy finding his dog dead with no insides and blood going in his face, and then it moves to the main plot. Five teenagers, Paul (Rider Strong), Karen (Jordan Ladd), Bert (James DeBello), Marcy (Cerina Vincent) and Jeff (Joey Kern) have graduated school, and have rented a cabin in the woods to spend a short sex and alcohol filled vacation. While there, they see the guy at the beginning who has caught a terrifying flesh-eating virus. When they set him on fire, you see him dead in the lake, and this is where the bigger problem comes, his virus filled fluids drain are going into the water supply of the cabin. Slowly, one by one, with the exposure and use of water, the virus spreads in all of them and the friends turn on each other as their bodies disintegrate. Also starring Arie Verveen as Henry (The Hermit), Robert Harris as Old Man Cadwell, Roth as Justin (aka Grim) and Giuseppe Andrews as Deputy Winston. The scene where one of the girl shaves herself in the bath, and her skin is pealing to blood is particularly horrific, and there are many other nasty moments to have fun with, I will admit its not great, but it's certainly worth watching. Okay!",Cabin Fever
6,BA_Harrison,Forgettable B-movie horror from Eli 'Hostel' Roth.,5,19 November 2006,"Cabin Fever, Eli Roth's directorial debut, is a fun slice of schlock horror that is worth a watch, but is in no way deserving of the praise that is plastered all over the box. ""A modern horror classic"" it certainly isn't!Roth's tale of a group of teenagers vacationing in the wilds, who fall victim to a contagious flesh-eating virus, is pure B-movie fodder; fun while it lasts, but instantly forgettable. The story, which admittedly has a lot of potential, is weakened somewhat by some poor characterisation and quite a few ridiculous plot turns.Roth compensates a little for the less than perfect script with some disturbing scenes of gore, a pervading atmosphere of gloom, and some welcome gratuitous nudity courtesy of the lovely Cerina Vincent (unfortunately, Jordan Ladd only strips down to her bikini), but my overall impression of the film is one of a wasted opportunity.As was the case with Hostel, I can't help feeling that Roth has no problem coming up with the basic premise for a good film, but has no idea about how to actually make the best of it.",Cabin Fever
7,Quinoa1984,"surprisingly run-of-the-mill for the most part, a fairly average, stupid/bad horror fest",4,21 January 2007,"I had heard some bad things about Cabin Fever almost as much as I heard the cultish hype. As it turns out, the first film from the new impresario Eli Roth, it's just a so-so effort with the IQ points dropping as the film progresses. There are worse movies out there, and surely more gory ones (while I'm not sure how the hype-meter got so high on the blood-count for Hostel, there is a good amount for genre fans here). The premise isn't necessarily bad either though: kids go to a cabin for a week of partying, only to come across a very sick man, covered in blood, whom in a panic they set on fire. He winds up dead in the water that feeds the reservoir, and soon the characters all succumb to the flesh-eating virus one way or another. The characters, either the lead college kids (including Rider Strong as the hero and James DiBello as the goofy side-bar) or the supporting 'village' folks are archetypal to the point of inertia, if not painfully so. As they meet their fates, the townspeople get pretty weird, and it just seems to be non-sensibly thrown together without the many laughs; 'Pancakes kid' comes out of nowhere, and maybe might have been funnier in another movie or by itself, but in the context of the rest of the movie, it just doesn't work. There's also a young police character who is even dumber and less convincing than the others. And the family that goes after DiBello following an incident has some possibilities that aren't realized. But all the while, Roth pumps up his script with common sense out the window and sudden scares and frights with people hacking up blood on one another and a killer dog rambling around. Which isn't all for not either. Now, unlike lesser Troma horror movies or even lesser ones of the 70s or 80s- to which I'm sure Roth is a die-hard fan- he doesn't make it unwatchable. It's also smart to not have any explanation for where the virus comes from. But unlike those films too, he also doesn't really have a fine idea of what makes for great campy-horror times. His film tries for that, of course, and only once or twice does he make it a goofy, bloody time (I did like the random bunny Strong sees while on the gurney). It's not even very poorly shot a lot of the time (albeit with its own contrived style-choices ala red tint on the lens or that story with the bowling-alley worker). It simply contains a lot of illogical scenarios and choices made (shave your legs with a deadly virus, uh-huh), and it aims for fairly typical ground. If that's your cup of tea, more power to you. But at the end I found it to be actually un-exceptional genre territory that doesn't offend audience sensibilities ala Saw, but doesn't swing for the fence either as a clever B-movie. Roth also has the temerity to end the movie on a true note of 'what-the-hell' as the Santa Claus bearded convenience store clerk from earlier in the film serves a bunch of black people. It could work if he followed up on it with something better, or if he dropped it altogether. Same could be said for a lot of the movie. C-",Cabin Fever
8,wes-connors,Eli's Coming (Hide Your Heart),7,22 July 2009,"""Jeff, Karen, Paul, Marcy and Bert embark on a vacation deep into the mountains. With the top down and the music up, they drive to a remote cabin to enjoy their last days of decadence after college. Then somebody gets sick. Karen's skin starts to bubble and burn as something grows inside her, tunneling beneath her flesh. As the others try to save her, they look at one another and realize that any one of them could be next. One by one they turn on each other and the rest of the town realizing that the disease is the least of their problems,"" according to the film's official synopsis.Excellent first feature from director Eli Roth; ""Cabin Fever"" is a bloody mess, with irreverent humor. It's both an update and a spoof of 1980s movies, like ""The Evil Dead"". But, you also get Rider Strong doing the end of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and Joey Kern reprising ""Night of the Living Dead"". The college-aged cast is an improvement over the slew of movies with too-old ""teenagers"". But, the lasting appeal of this film may be in re-visiting its hilarious cast of supporting characters and bit players - like Roth as the party-seeking dude who can't decide if he's ""Just-in"" or ""Grim"".******* Cabin Fever (9/14/02) Eli Roth ~ Rider Strong, Cerina Vincent, Joey Kern",Cabin Fever
9,Coventry,Rotten!,3,9 August 2004,"THIS is the long awaited and fresh horror from the new prodigy Roth? What did I miss then? Because all I saw was a bunch of irritating, stinking, uninspired and unfunny crap! Director Eli Roth is the 'future of horror' as much as I am Mother Theresa! In an interview, I saw Roth talking about how annoying he thinks it is that horror doesn't feature originality and vision nowadays. Well, where was the originality in his film? I saw bits and pieces stolen from The Evil Dead, Deliverance, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House on the Left and maybe even a bit the Hills have Eyes but where exactly was Eli Roth's contribution to horror? And what about vision? Cabin Fever features the same old stereotype characters and the same overused twists and clichés. Five people in their early twenties rent a cabin in the woods and die. A flesh-eating virus, which origin is never explained, causes their skins to rot and their friendships to end. The people living in the nearby communities form an extra threat since they're completely crazed rednecks and apparently inbred. The jokes and funny situations fail miserably and there isn't one scary moment to detect throughout the entire film! There's more than enough gorebut somebody please inform Eli Roth that it takes more than grossness to create a successful horror film. Bottom line: Cabin Fever is a giant disappointment! Even when your expectations are set low, Eli Roth still manages to disappoint you with his vain nonsense. If he really is the future of horror (Quentin Tarantino repeatedly referred to him like this) I'll be glad to continue living in the past. My vote of better recent horror movie goes to 'Wrong Turn' That might be a TCM-rip off as well, but at least the creators of this film were modest and didn't try to sell their product as original and inventive.",Cabin Fever
10,michaelRokeefe,Not just a walk in the woods.,5,21 February 2004,"Gore and paranoia is the fuel that keeps this quirky thriller burning. Written and directed by Eli Roth, this flick is not for one with a weak stomach. Five college students decide to spend a week in a cabin in the woods before joining the real world. Don't ask how or why...a flesh-eating virus is introduced to the group by a dying hermit(Arie Verveen). Interesting and odd is that it is not the virus that actually kills off the decadent vacationers one by one. The acting is as lame as the story but CABIN FEVER is a dose of chilling entertainment. The cast features Rider Strong, Jordan Ladd, Cerina Vincent, Joey Kern, James DeBello and even a bit part for Roth. NOTE: Ladd is the daughter of a former ""Charlie's Angel"" Cheryl Ladd. Strong in spite of a name fit for a porno star is better known for his TV work. Forget the popcorn for this one because it won't stay down long. If you're a gore monger you will be pleased.",Cabin Fever
11,hitchcockthelegend,If you go down to the woods today.....,6,9 January 2011,"Cabin Fever is the directing debut of Eli Rothi, who also co-writes and co-produces. It stars Rider Strong, Jordan Ladd, James DeBello, Cerina Vincent, Joey Kern & Jeff Hoffman. Plot sees a group of young college graduates rent a cabin out in the woods for party weekend but start to fall victim to a flesh eating virus.Eli Roth has never been shy in coming forward, happy to be a self publicist and megaphone for hyperbole, he made some bold statements in the run up to the release of Cabin Fever. He had been bemoaning the lack of gore and nastiness in the current crop of horror film's, even venturing that horror should get back to the 80's style of The Evil Dead et al. With that in mind, Cabin Fever is a little disappointing in that it's not as outrageous as expected, but it's a nice touch having a virus as the cause for the horror, even if in reality the structure is cribbed from other more notable back-to-the-woods horror film's. However, where he does score bonus points is that his ""fever"" is double ended, it's not just the virus as a fever motif at work, but the fever of the group as well, their reactions to the infected and their fear of the disease itself. This allows Roth to slide in some grue and nudity as he dabbles in interesting fates for his characters.Roth would make good on his ""more blood "" promise with his follow up to Cabin Fever, Hostel, and then top that with that film's sequel. It seems that Cabin Fever, with its modest budget, was merely the stepping stone that he needed. It made over $30 million in profit Worldwide, proof if ever it was needed, that horror is always a big money earner if done right. Cabin Fever did not live up to initial expectations, but it's still a bloody gooey good time for the discerning horror faithful. 6.5/10",Cabin Fever
12,Doylenf,Mindlessly juvenile horror film gets worse as the plot unwinds...,5,19 August 2006,"Whatever horror is in store for the mindless young vacationers in CABIN FEVER is exactly what they deserve. This is the kind of tale that gets off to a slow start, introducing a bunch of unlikeable main characters before we start getting to the gore. Nothing subtle about this one.It goes downhill after the first half-hour and never quite recovers, perhaps because the writer/director team only think they're creating a ""cool horror film"" but give their principal characters pages of unbelievably dull and completely banal dialog when they aren't spitting blood or vomit. Its puerile appeal is not aimed toward the discriminating horror fan.The plot hinges on a homeless man who appears to need their help. When he attempts to steal their car, they turn into overly defensive savages and succeed in killing him when he's accidentally burned to death. As happened in another recent horror film, JEEPERS CREEPERS, the youngsters begin to turn on each other as they cope with their collective guilt. When a flesh-eating virus, presumably caused by the man they killed, gets into their drinking water, they begin worrying about their fate when one of the girls becomes infected.If the tale had been constructed with above average intelligence, something worthwhile might have emerged. But it's bogged down by banal juvenile dialog and the fact that none of the characters have any more appeal than a bunch of sick animals. They seem to exist only to show us how foolish the overdrawn tale is. The humor is tasteless and the one character along for comic relief is boorish and disgusting. In fact, that's the overall effect of the film based on the premise that a stinking reservoir is enough to create a horror plot.It's all amateurishly directed without a shred of inspiration by Eli Roth who must have been overly influenced by something like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, minus the shaky camera. Too much of the gore involves his main characters vomiting or spitting blood. The only redeeming feature is some handsome autumnal photography of the countryside. Other than that, forget it.Easily a so-called horror film you can afford to miss. Only decent character in the story seems to be Rider Strong who also delivers the only likable performance.",Cabin Fever
13,preppy-3,"Unpleasant, bloody and boring",5,14 September 2003,"Five extremely annoying college students decide to spend a weekend in a cabin in the woods.  They're attacked (sort of) by a man infected by a flesh-eating virus.  He's killed but not before infecting them and they start to unravel as they battle the virus...and themselves.The plot is totally by the numbers and the dialogue is just OK, but there are passages of jaw-droppingly stupid lines.  There is one horrendous sequence in which they meet a ""partying"" sheriff who is stupid and annoying, and says things that no human being would ever say with a straight face. Also we're never told where the virus came from.  I suppose that's supposed to make it scarier but I just found it annoying.  The special effects are very good but downright sickening.  Seeing a bunch of young kids having their flesh peel off or spitting out blood is not my idea of entertainment. And you know next to nothing about these kids--how can you care that they're dying when you don't know a thing about them?The only things that make this bearable is some nice wide-screen photography, a very good score and some pretty good acting.  Paul (Rider Storm) plays the good guy--he gives a good performance but his goody-goody nature got on my nerves.  Karen (Jordan Ladd) is very good but given next to nothing to work with.  Jeff (Joey Kern) is terrible but he's not in the film enough to destroy it.  Bert (James DeBello) is the--sigh--beer-swilling, stupid, dumb, sexist ""comic"" relief--definetely one of the most disposable characters.  Best of all is Marcy (Cerina Vincent).  She's strong, intelligent and sexy.  Her performance was dead on target.But mostly the film either disgusts you with the special effects or bores you with the totally predictable story line--one characters demise was so telegraphed and predictable I seriously thought they were kidding.

15,poolandrews,"""Do NOT sit next to Dennis."" Awful teen horror/comedy.",3,13 July 2005,"Cabin fever starts with Henry the Hermit (Arie Verveen) trying to wake his pet dog & discovering that he is in very bad shape. Five vacationing teenagers, two couples Paul (Rider Strong) & Karen (Jordan Ladd), Jeff (Joey Kern) & Marcy (Cerina Vincent) plus their bachelor friend Bert (James DeBello) head to an isolated cabin situated in woods deep in Reneck country. Before long they are hassled by the now extremely ill Henry. The teenagers panic & refuse to go near the disease ridden & potentially contagious Henry who tries to steal their car. In an ensuing struggle the car is badly damaged & Henry disappears into the woods when he is set on fire. The five friends decide to tell the truth to the police, but first they need to get back to town. Bert starts to fix the car, but soon Karen starts to develop the skin markings that Henry had signifying that she has the disease. Paranoia sets in as the friends begin to turn against each other in a desperate bid for survival & the pursuit of self preservation. But flesh-eating virus's are not their only problem as a group of local Redneck's decide to clean their woods up & when they finally manage to contact the authorities & police they get an unexpected reception...Written, produced & directed by Eli Roth who also plays the weed smoking (art imitating life?!) Justin, I thought Cabin Fever was a pretty poor attempt at a teen horror/comedy. The script by Roth & his roommate in film school Randy Pearlstein misses most of what it tries to achieve by a proverbial mile. The comedy elements come across as just plain weird, what the hell is up with that Dennis (Matthew Helms) kid with his hand biting & kung-fu fighting nonsense? I thought I was watching The Matrix (1999) for a few seconds at one point! That annoying bike riding Deputy Winston (Giuseppe Andrews) is obviously meant to be the comedy relief character but he comes across as a complete buffoon, a police officer would simply not act in the way he does & the film loses a lot of credibility by having this idiot running around. I also found Bert highly irritating as yet another comedy relief character, two of these comedy relief characters in the same film would be fine except that in Cabin Fever neither of them are funny in the slightest. The horror elements fare little better, the origins of the flesh-eating virus is never discussed or explained & generally speaking Cabin Fever is not scary, has no atmosphere or tension & comes across as rather bland. Cabin Fever rips-off or pays homage, whichever way you want to look at it, to far superior films from the like's of Night of the Living Dead (1968) to Deliverance (1971) & The Evil Dead (1981). Peoples reactions are all wrong & feel out of place, why does Bert not try to fix the car straight away instead of leaving it till the next day? Why, if there's a flesh-eating virus killing your friends would someone take the time to have a bath & shave her legs like she was getting ready to go out for the night? Why if you have the opportunity to possibly obtain help would you not because you recognise a photo of the guy who was ill to begin with? Would you take a gun on vacation with you so you could 'shoot squirrel's'? Why would a dog literary tear someone apart & scatter their body parts everywhere? Would one of the last two remaining survivors really stay behind to pack his bag & carry all the beer they borough under his arm? I could carry on about all the daft & stupid things which happen in Cabin Fever but I'd run out of space, this must be blamed on writer & director Roth. On a positive note I quite liked most of the characters, Deputy Winston & Bert excepted. It's very well made with some nice cinematography & good special make-up effects although I actually found the gore levels to be somewhat disappointing. There is a scene where someone's face is rotted away to their skull, a mutilated burned corpse, various brief shots of body parts & blood splattered locations, a few skin blemishes, a few dead animals including a dog & some rabbits & a legless corpse in a cave. The acting is decent enough, it's just a shame the material they were given to work with is of such a low standard. The film has a certain polish throughout that belies it's fairly low $1.5 million budget. Overall I didn't like Cabin Fever, the mix of horror & comedy just didn't work. There is nothing new or original about Cabin Fever & as a whole left me both perplexed & irritated. Extremely disappointing & of very little entertainment value especially to horror fans whom I think would feel insulted by this, I do. I just wish I knew what that freaky kid Dennis was all about, unfortunately I'm not going to sit through any of the five(!) commentary tracks on the DVD to try & find out what on Earth Roth was thinking...",Cabin Fever
16,grantss,Better than the average horror movie,5,16 October 2014,"Better than the average horror movie. Not that this says much. Mostly formulaic in terms of progression, the main villain is reasonably original. Plus, the side-plots make it a bit more interesting than most.Ending is reasonably different too.This all said, it is predictable enough that you feel you've seen it several times before.The most perplexing thing is how is Eli Roth regarded by some as some kind of horror genius and get to be endorsed by Quentin Tarantino, no less. Cabin Fever is regarded as Roth's best work and, having seen his other stuff, eg Hostel, I agree with this. Yet this is hardly a masterpiece. Odd.",Cabin Fever
17,Boba_Fett1138,Eli Roth; the new master of horror!,7,17 October 2008,"What Eli Roth always does well with his horror movies is using all of the usual horror clichés but he still knows to deliver the in a refreshing and original way. It's the reason why his movies still work out surprising, despite following the usual and expected formula. In a way he is also always subtly making fun of all the genre clichés but without becoming ridicules or a spoof.What Eli Roth also always does well is implying a lot of things but is then turning 180 degrees and starts heading in a totally different and unexpected direction. For instance you might be expecting this movie to turn into a typical teenage slasher genre flick, which it really doesn't. It takes a whole different other approach with its horror, which I wont spoil. Yes, it's true that it doesn't always the most exciting movie to watch and it's a bit slow at times when basically nothing is happening in the movie. So I can understand the people who did not liked this movie very much. I however did liked it due to Eli Roth's approach of the genre. He's a real horror fan who just happens to be good at making movies as well. He understands and loves the genre and this always shows well in his movies.It's also a really gory made movie, as as well can be expected from Eli Roth. The movie was a fairly cheap one to made with its $1,500,000 budget but movies like this proof that you don't need a lot of things or a big bundle of money to make a good and effective genre movie with. The movie is exaggerating with its gore at times, which is really in tone with the rest of the movie its style. It's a special kind of style not just all people will just 'get' and appreciate but it's what makes Eli Roth such a special young new director to me.

The movie started off weak, remained weak, and ended weaker. This movie was built upon a foundation of sand. Come on! SPOILER** What was wrong with those kids anyway?? A guy with an obvious ailment comes upon you so you kill him? Then, invariably, everyone else gets sick. Then the transportation out of the diseased woods is shot to hell, and oh! now the crazy town folk want to kill you. Not to mention the dog, the retarded kid, and the sheriff. And although we're all dying of this unknown, incredibly deadly disease, how about we have sex.**End Spoiler**This movie was just a blood bath stemming from a diseased man, or should I say diseased plot. It had no substance, no believability, no good writing, and no good content. Terrible.",Cabin Fever
19,bombersflyup,Garbage,2,6 September 2018,"Cabin Fever is a terrible trashy film, with horrible characters, that has a smidgen of amusement.This looks like Eli Roth's first film, probably got his mates to act in it and himself. The film's purposely stupid to be funny. Not one likable character, the dialogue awful. The premise unimaginative and silly, then it's all about gore and how each of them is going to die. You have the girl shaving her legs when you know the skin's going to come off and you have the last guy alive celebrating, of course he's going to get it or be killed in the next 20 seconds.

20,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Overrated and not all that good,5,28 September 2015,"Heading to a cabin in the woods, a group of friends enjoying a weekend getaway finds a drifter has contaminated them with a flesh-eating virus and must find a way of dealing with their own afflictions when they contract it as well.On the whole this one wasn't all that impressive and had some problems with it. One of the biggest issues with this one is the fact that the story here is so off-kilter that it really makes no sense at all. The fact that the group doesn't consider the true ramifications of their actions and what's happening here which causes them to stay at the cabin in danger to themselves and others is simply hard to believe as there's no reason why they spend as much time in the second half arguing about their course of actions which tends to run into the same thing over and over. There's no real scares here dealing with the after-effects of the virus, and most of the film here leads into another huge problem in feeling borrowed from the horror giants of the past for so much of what happens unnecessarily that it can't get out of its own way. The central premise of five teenagers at the cabin-in-the-woods, the background characters, the final fate of the group at the end and the random selection of insert shots are among the other instances where the film's influences are put out there, which are the same old scenes anyway. It's getting quite tiresome to keep on making films that homage the same classic films that twenty others have done. There are other film films that have worthy features, yet to continually reference the same films like this one does grows tiresome after awhile. These here are what lower this one significantly while there's a few somewhat fun scenes here. The fact that the threat comes from a relatable and real source gives some punch to it and makes it a little more creepy with a realistic feeling getting caught in that situation. It's best scenes are where it utilizes and milks these factors, from the initial hermit attack on their cabin and the ensuring panic makes for quite a dark, thrilling scene, while the ending bloodbath out in the woods makes for a nicely effective series of action scenes with the townspeople out hunting them through the woods. That leads into the film's other great part as the blood and gore has a lot to like about as the wounds and scars are really life-like which is a nice feat and really has some freaky moments about it. The greatest is the shower sequence where one character shaves their lags and reveals bloody lesions and scars under each the shaving soap with each stroke which is a highly original moment. Otherwise, there's not a whole lot here worthwhile amidst the flaws.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, Nudity and several sex scenes.",Cabin Fever

As it spreads among the friends, their true feelings and personalities emerge as they struggle to survive the virus and each other.....Whatever you think of Eli Roth now ( a hack who puts his name on any old thing to endorse it ), one cannot deny that his first two movies paved the way for the Gorenography outburst we had between 2003, right up until present.With out this movie, you wouldn't have had the Saw series, The Wrong Turn Movies, and other movies like Turistas, and The Collector.The premise is simple, five deplorable people drink water and their bodies start to waste away in ever increasing grotesque ways. They meet a few god fearing people, a random child who has a penchant for pancakes, and more and more blood spattered sheets.Its exploitation for exploitations sake, and it doesn't try to be anything other than that.It's not scary in the slightest, but its funny, and very, very gross.Plus it has a wonderful little twist at the end, and a very funny joke involving a gun.",Cabin Fever
22,Wuchakk,"Somewhat amusing, but mostly overrated trash",3,12 March 2014,"Released in 2003, ""Cabin Fever"" was Eli Roth's film debut; he would go on to make the 2005 horror hit ""Hostel."" ""Cabin Fever"" has become somewhat of a modern cult film due to its eccentricities and Roth's later notoriety.THE PLOT: Five college youths -- 3 guys and 2 girls -- take a cabin vacation in the sticks of NC where they are threatened by a serious disease where those infected spit out blood while their skin wastes away. They soon discover that the local reservoir is contaminated. Can they make it out alive?This is a heavy 'R' picture; Roth was tired of what he called the ""watered down PG-13"" horror films of the studios, and refused to compromise on the violence, nudity and cussing, insisting they were essential ingredients to an '80s-style horror film. Essential ingredients maybe, but such things can't make up for overall ineffectiveness. I just don't get what's so great about ""Cabin Fever."" The plot is good, as are other items, but the film leaves a lot to be desired, unless of course you're not looking for much intelligence or authentic horror and just want a fun, quasi-horror experience. Or maybe you have to be a ""true horror aficionado"" to appreciate it, whatever that is.WHAT WORKS:I was interested in ""Cabin Fever"" mainly due to the beautiful Cerina Vincent. She was only 21 when the film was made and it shows. As good as she looks in ""Cabin Fever"" she's far more gorgeous in later films like 2006's ""Sasquatch Mountain"" and 2005's ""It Waits,"" where she's more curvy with a fuller mane. - The picture's eccentricities are enjoyable, such as the weirdo party-dude deputy, the inbred karate boy (who looks like a girl) and, especially, the part where we're led to believe an old shopkeeper is prejudiced against blacks until we discover the truth at the end; that was a good one! - I like the early Fall backwoods North Carolina cinematography.WHAT DOESN'T WORK:The biggest problem with ""Cabin Fever"" is that it doesn't take itself seriously enough. Isn't this supposed to be a horror film? Well, how can the viewer be horrified when the filmmakers keep telegraphing that it's all a joke? If we can't take the story seriously, we can't take the horror seriously either. Suffice to say, the story could have been horrifying but it's not. What we're left with is a somewhat amusing flick with horror trappings and gruesome elements, but no real horror. By contrast, the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" was successfully horrifying because the film (and filmmakers) took the subject seriously. - Some say the five protagonists are unlikable, but this isn't really true. They act like typical college youths trying to have a good time on vacation. What is a turn-off, however, is their over-the-top cussing. Don't get me wrong here because I actually prefer realistic cussing in film; in other words, I prefer that the characters talk like people in real life. As such, it's very rare that I complain about cussing in a movie (almost never). But, here, it's just total overkill. Now, someone may defend it on the grounds that people would likely cuss a lot in such a horrific situation and I would agree, but the characters overdo it well BEFORE anything horrific happens. Maybe the cussing overkill is part of Roth's joke: ""Let's go ultra R-rated and overdo everything that's watered-down in a PG-13 film."" Regardless, this approach makes his protagonists sound like morons who have no right to step foot into an elementary school English class let alone be college graduates.BOTTOM LINE: While ""Cabin Fever"" has some positive elements -- Cerina Vincent, the NC backwoods cinematography, a couple of amusing parts and the end-credits song -- it's not horrifying at all because it's pretty much a big joke. But it is sometimes gruesome, if that's your thang. Furthermore, the overkill cussing of the protagonists gets old real quick. It's a trashy, ignoble movie and I don't get the hype.The unrated version runs 98 minutes and the film was shot mainly in North Carolina, with some parts in Dundas, Ontario, and the Los Angeles area.GRADE: D+",Cabin Fever

25,christopher-underwood,just not scary enough for a horror film,5,11 January 2007,"Its a bit of a cliche but also a truism that in horror films involving youngsters going off for a vacation in the woods, we as an audience, immediately begin to anticipate the order of their deaths. Usually there are a couple of annoying characters that we are glad to see go while we trust that the others might survive. At least this is the usual formulae. Here by accident (director's first film) or design (he really has proven to be most capable) we don't like anyone. The are either dumb, uncaring, naive or just plain stupid. Add to this a rather far fetched plague element and this is never going to reach the heights that now and again it deserves. One more important problem is that it is not scary.

The gang stop at grocery store and get some refreshment's and a little girl who loves to bite people, gave one of the guys a good nip or two on the hand.

27,Smells_Like_Cheese,"It's um, well, it's interesting",6,16 November 2003,"After all the hype reviews, especially from Peter Jackson, the director from Lord of the Rings, who wouldn't want to see this movie? We all need a good scare every once in a while. This was indeed, a scary movie. I think because it felt real and it could happen. A lot of the images were very disturbing and not fun to watch.But the movie and story itself? Not on the bright view of my movie knowledge. There were some things that seemed like this was a college wanna-be director's first movie. While it had a very good and scary feeling of being claustrophobic and turning against your friends in a heartbeat, it didn't have any depth. I liked how he turned the friends into the monsters of the story. Because, in the beginning of the movie, they seem like your typical American college friends who get along very well. But when this ""desease"" pops up, they turn against each other in a heart beat. I felt that the director could have gone more into that. Another problem, the girls. I know that every good horror flick usually has to have sex in it, but this wasn't really necessary. It seemed like the director said ""I have two hot chicks, how can I get them naked?"" Over all, I don't mind watching this movie. It's not too bad, but it's not worthy of the classic horror films. You get the gore, the blood, the scares, the senseless violence. So for horror fans, this is a go, but if your just looking for a movie, you have my warnings.6/10",Cabin Fever
28,Red-Barracuda,Nothing new here,5,2 September 2010,"For a film director who virtually needs no introduction, Eli Roth hasn't exactly got the most impressive back catalogue. Cabin Fever is his debut movie and it's a pretty unremarkable feature all-in-in-all. It has to be said however that Roth sets out his basic ethos here. He appears to be a horror film director that seems to believe that as long as you load your movie with buckets of gore then you don't really need to bother too much with anything else. At least, that's how it sometimes appears with Roth. While Cabin Fever is relatively restrained in direct comparison to the two Hostel movies, it still effectively follows the same principle. While I don't exactly mind this approach, I do think that a little more effort could be put into creating a proper atmosphere of dread, and maybe building up suspense here and there. Cabin Fever doesn't really have much of an idea to begin with – it's really only about a horrible flesh-destroying virus that people contract in the woods – so it too often resorts to mildly annoying humour, such as the cretinous Party Cop character or the final scene that is really just an excuse for a stupid joke. Roth's films sadly often have a tendency to include stupid moments that deflate the overall whole – even his best film Hostel: Part II is guilty of this in its final few minutes. It's hard to see how Roth could have generated such a high profile career on the back of such an unoriginal film as Cabin Fever if it had not been for his friendship with Quentin Tarantino.Still, despite all of this Cabin Fever is by no means an awful film. It's just very average. A bunch of annoying teens go for a cabin holiday in the woods that goes horribly wrong, while the unfriendly redneck locals look on in disgust. It sure isn't ticking any new boxes. Well maybe one. The way in which Roth incorporates the rednecks directly into the story's narrative is via a scene with a weird boy called Dennis, and it truly is one stupid scene, but different, I will give you that. Roth himself appears in a small role as a character called Grim and the best that can be said is he is following his mentor Tarantino here seeing as QT liked to star in his early movies, however, unlike QT's early roles, Roth's appearance is truly pointless and simply vanity. I mean what was the purpose in this character? Roth has gradually got better since this first film. It's a pretty inauspicious start but it's OK.",Cabin Fever
29,disdressed12,"Roth's pre Hostel effort crap,but less crap than Hostel",3,19 January 2007,"Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth.Roth and Randy Pearlstein co wrote the script from a story by Roth.this a zombie film,which owes a lot to George Romero and his earlier ""living dead movies"",and to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot to mention Sam Ramie's ""Evil Dead"".there is nothing original here,and the story is not compelling.the acting is about par with this genre,it's just that the story fails.we have pretty much seen this movie before and better made.having said that,after having achieved commercial, if not artistic success from this movie,Roth decided he was a director and came out with the abysmally atrocious,mean spirited,pointless(though much more ambitious)crap fest Hostel.Roth should have quit while he was behind.Cabin Fever is not a good film,however compared to Hostel it is a work of art.I hope somebody (preferably a psychiatrist)convinces this guy that film-making is the wrong career choice.as for Cabin fever,a weak 3/10 for not being as abysmal as Hostel.",Cabin Fever
30,thesar-2,80s Fever...Catch it!,8,3 March 2010,"Wow, if you're a fan of late 1970s and early 1980s horror films, you'll love the homage played out in Cabin Fever. Not to mention those pesky virus/infected movies in addition to cabin in the woods horror flicks. This movie has practically every cliché involving those horrors of days/decades past.And it's gruesome. Bloody. Gross. Weird. Somewhat funny. Pancake! It's the usual suspects: graduating buddies, 2 girls, 3 dudes head off to a cabin for a week. We have the sympathetic weakling of a man: Paul (Strong), the dumb jock: Bert (DeBello – and on a side note, personally the cutest, yet dumbest of the group), the Preppy: Jeff (Kern), the sex-crazed: Marcy (Vincent) and the innocent: Karen (Ladd.) Wait – did I just describe The Breakfast Club? Perhaps, but this is one of hundreds of movies this imitates.The Scooby-Gang immediately encounter the normal hillbillies stereotypes (SEE: Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or any Wrong Turn-Type movie) at the normal general store before hitting up their cabin. Soon after, they encounter both a druggie and dog (M.D.) in tow and a very sick, blood-infested male that Bert inadvertently shot with a BB gun earlier in his manly-man-macho act of killing ""gay"" squirrels. Nevertheless, the very-ill man needs help and appears to be attacking them. The group accidentally destroys their only set of wheels and sets him on fire to, well, shoo him away. And it works...for the most part.The guilty conscious they experience is nothing to the disease one of them encounters. Without any transportation, they (strangely) place the infected in a disgusting barn and that member getsworse.""Cabin fever"" does set in, and they begin to turn on each other, meet the striking locals and come up with individual and ""unique"" ways to deal with their predicament.The movie is very original even though dealing with a hundred of movie references, including Night of the Living Dead, Evil Dead and even Donnie Darko (speaking of which – love the end credit's tribute to this), just to name a few more. It's crazy at times (SEE: The Pancake Pounce and The Mile High Sex Club at Ground Level) but it's worth checking out, especially, again for those sick and twisted horror fans of the 1980s, like myself.Side & Final Note: (Spoiler) Despite the ""how could it end any other way"" finale, that I actually liked in this feature, it would be nice, for once, it wouldn't actually conclude and not leave open for a sequel. I've seen every Living Dead film (to date) and it's always the same. I understand the theme of the movie, but aside from the movie Outbreak, it rarely ends on a positive, ""WE BEAT IT!"" conclusion.That said, it's an appropriate climax to the overall feel of the movie. As it's really not marketed as a ""Feel-Good"" movie, is it?",Cabin Fever
31,sol-kay,A Bloody Mess,6,26 October 2004,"***SPOILERS*** ""Cabin Fever"" is one of those lost in the woods like horror movies this time about a group of collage students who rented out a cabin for a weeks vacation. The students are encountered by this weird nut Henry the Hermit, Avie Verveen, who somehow got infected by some ebola-like blood illness that he spreads with him having only to breath on you, was this another secret government experiment gone wrong? Staggering through the forest Henry is mistaken for a squirrel and accidentally shot by one of the students Bert, James DeBello, with his B.B gun. Later that night Henry tries to get help from the students for his deteriorating health condition but as his coughing up blood is so sickening and dangerous that he's chased out of the area. Also when Henry then tries to drive off with the students SUV which he contaminated with a about a gallon of blood that he spewed out. Beaten and lit up with gasoline by the students Henry runs for his life through the forest.Set on fire and dying Henry later falls dead into the local reservoir causing the entire community to get infected with his deadly disease. All the students starting with Karen, Jordan Ladd, but with the possible exception of Jeff, Joey Kern, fall victim to the deadly plague. Their skin starts to turn red and later blisters and peels off where they eventually go into shock and bleed to death. Jeff who wasn't effected by the illness due to not drinking any tap water is shot to death by the local police thinking that he was carrying the disease and then together with the rest of the dead students, except Paul (Rider Strong), is cremated. Paul who was found almost dead on the highway by the police and taken to the hospital where later thrown into a stream by the not too bright deputy sheriff Winston, Giuseppe Andrews. The stream is used to bottle it's famous and clean and healthy spring water all throughout the state spreading the deadly plague even farther.The movie had a number of jolting and scary scenes and the gore even though it was very extensive wasn't that overdone. With a deer later in the film slamming through the students SUV's windshield and almost killing Paul. There's also a group of party goers in the woods together with the party loving sheriff deputy Winston getting hit hard by the festering disease; which seemed to kill everyone but lucky Winston who I guess was too stupid to be effected by it. Besides the top cast members the film ""Cabin Fever"" had it's number of secondary oddballs including a Santa Clause like hardware store owner Old Man Cardwell, Robert Harris. There's also young Dennis, Matthew Helms, who at first you thought was mute until for no reason at all started yelling out the words PANCAKES PANCAKES! Dennis then goes into a what looked a martial arts routine after he almost bit off one of Bert's fingers.",Cabin Fever
32,MOscarbradley,Good gross-out fun,7,17 July 2007,"A thoroughly nasty and thoroughly brilliant horror movie from Eli Roth which should have you squirming in your seat and averting your eyes in all the appropriate places. It's like a hybrid of ""The Evil Dead"" and ""Deliverance"" and there is a deliciously mean streak of black humour running through it.It begins like so many of its ilk with a bunch of over-sexed kids heading off to the woods for a week's fornication but things quickly go downhill when they encounter a guy running around who seems to have been eaten out from the inside. Yep, it's that old chestnut, the flesh-eating virus movie. Actually, that's what makes it so good. In this movie you don't get to see 'the monster', just the very horrible results of what it does. Nor does it fully explain where it came from. We're not in the medical procedural genre here, just good old gross-out horror. The acting is appalling but Roth really does pull out all the stops and never lets up. Relentless, somewhat sick fun.",Cabin Fever
33,bowmanblue,Really enjoyed it (in the end),9,4 January 2015,"I remember watching 'Cabin Fever' in the cinema when it first came out. If you'd asked me what I thought of it after I came out I'd have said, ""Yeah, it's okay,"" and left it at that. It wasn't until after I saw it did I keep hearing how it was a 'homage to Evil Dead.' Now, I'm a big fan of the Evil Dead trilogy (excluding remake) and I didn't remember much in Cabin Fever that could be considered a 'homage.' So I watched it again when it came out on DVD and I guess I saw what I'd missed the first time round.Basically, Cabin Fever is hardly original – five college friends go to a remote cabin in the woods and meet a sticky end. However, it's done just differently enough to make it worth watching. It's not perfect by any means – there are still a couple of 'plot points' which I always objected to – namely because I felt that I could see them coming a mile off and I could tell that the writers were trying to make what happened a surprise.However, despite the odd wrong turn, the narrative is pretty good. It's worth noting that the man responsible for the soundtrack to (the brilliantly-weird) Twin Peaks did the music for this, too. And, like each other, they have more than their fair share of 'weird/surreal' moments which makes the whole thing stand out.The five characters aren't that nice. You won't really like them, but that doesn't really mean that you won't root for them. Even the annoying one with the really bad haircut is stupidly-annoying enough for you to enjoy watching him, but special kudos to 'Bert' who is a total wally and yet he's still quite entertaining to watch.I won't go into too much detail as to what happens to our five, daft teens as you probably already know or, if you don't, it'll hopefully be a bit of a surprise. But, I will say that it is a definite horror movie, therefore you'll get more than you monies worth of gore from this outing.After all these years I've now watched Cabin Fever a number of times and I seem to enjoy it more and more each time. Like I say, it's not perfect, but if you're looking for a nice little tongue-in-cheek film with plenty of gore and sets out not to take itself seriously, then this is it. And, yes, there were a fair few nods to Evil Dead which completely went over my head the first time round (just don't ask me for 'pancakes' after this film).",Cabin Fever

36,johnnyboyz,"A Nasty excuse for a horror film with few-to-no scares, brainless scripting and a screenplay that runs so far out of ideas, it's laughable.",4,14 July 2007,"Rather recently, it would seem that Cabin Fever director Eli Roth has become very 'chummy' with fellow American directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino following some work on 2007's 'Grindhouse'. If we take each debut film from these three directors we can see that Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) could be marked down as genius and Rodriguez's El Mariachi (also 1992) could be marked down as pretty good but over rated. Ten years on from those two and after viewing Roth's debut film Cabin Fever; it would seem Tarantino and Rodriguez see something in him I don't.I watched Roth's second film; 'Hostel', several months ago and I was impressed at how he managed to get across an intense atmosphere of hopelessness and how he managed to play out the final third like it was a gritty revenge film, even though the script left much to be desired given the first third. With Cabin Fever, I appreciate it was his first film but still expected some things that made Hostel watchable to remain with this one. Unfortunately, what was there was minimal. You can't dispute the fact that Eli likes his horror films; he's obviously spent the last ten years watching them and thus manages to reference the 'Evil Dead' films, the 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' films and even throws a bit of 'Deliverance' into the mix. What he doesn't do that these three examples did is make it memorable.Through techniques used in Deliverance and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, we are expected to build up pity, remorse and sympathy to a bunch of teenagers driving to a remote cabin in the woods that isn't really that remote. We are expected to evoke these emotions to characters who like to shoot squirrels, whom like to jump into bed with any one they lay eyes on; characters who smoke drugs and think camping in a wood getting high and laid is 'fun'. Very much like the beginning of Hostel, the build up and script is not great.Forgive me if I'm incorrect but Cabin Fever is listed as a horror film, is it not? I did not actually find myself genuinely scared during this film; nor did I feel the bleak, hopelessness and pity I should've felt towards the lone character towards the end  something I DID feel during Hostel as Paxton acted against all odds to at least TRY and succeed. In Cabin Fever, Roth has done the same thing with the whole 'lone guy in a gore-fest scenario' but I can forgive him for not pulling it off first time round. Along with this and despite the opening credits being the eeriest thing the film possesses, there were one or two jumps thanks to the editing such as the face of the girl following the virus' wrath but these sort of schlock scares are nothing more but a rush of adrenaline.Not only this but the film as a whole towards the end when we're having this attempt of a climax presented to us falls so far short of anything remotely good, it's worrying. The script as well as the actions of the characters are shocking; a character sees a dead body in the water but feels it necessary to climb down a rickety ladder to check anyway  needless to say, they fall in. Also, one character is in possession of a gun for most of the film yet when they go to the wood shed to check something, they leave it on the ground  resulting in having to run back to get it when something happens - brainless, brainless things being presented to us in a laughable attempt to create suspense.If this isn't enough, the film does actually creep over that line of normality  something that keeps films from becoming mere spoofs or shocking displays of film-making. The final fifteen minutes is nuts  it's just pure nuts. Rather than staying cool, the flesh eating virus has obviously eaten away at the lone character's mind as they choose to attack, attack, attack anybody they encounter rather than explain the situation. Screwdrivers, spades, sticks  anything they can get their hands on and would rather murder someone in cold blood than risk stopping and explaining. Even the police start to mistake the whole charade for a killing spree when in reality, it's the virus doing the damage and they know it.With an immediate ending that more resembles a 'Scary Movie' film; Cabin Fever is so lacklustre and silly in everything that it does, in the future people may be looking at Roth as someone who got progressively better rather than a guy who made an immediately impressive impact; alá Tarantino and Rodriguez.",Cabin Fever
37,filipemanuelneto,"Better than other similar films, but still loaded with the usual vices in teen films.",5,6 September 2020,"This film is within the basic teen horror and, despite being unoriginal and overloaded with clichés that we have seen a thousand times in cinema, it works and entertains the public. It even manages to be better than many similar films, and we've seen many! Here, the enemy can be everywhere and, ultimately it turns out to be isolation itself. In fact, the title of the film indicates that, given that ""cabin fever"", from the point of view of psychology, is a kind of psychosis that arises in groups of isolated individuals in the same place for too long.The story is simple: five friends go to a forest hut to enjoy themselves after the end of the school year. However, they find there a very sick man with marked red skin. Frightened and fearing that it would be contagious, they try to drive him away but end up killing him. From there, isolated in the middle of nowhere, fear overwhelms them as, one after another, they begin to show signs of the same disease.Although the script is rather weak and predictable, tension and suspense are skillfully built and, ultimately, this makes the film effective in its task. Unfortunately, I agree with the opinion of many expert critics who pointed the finger at the director, Eli Roth, and said that he sometimes did not know if he was trying to scare us or make us laugh. In fact, the film is both scary and cynical and there are some scenes, particularly closer to the end, where the film seems to accentuate its sarcastic streak. For me, the final part was very weak and showed that Roth (who is also partly responsible for the script) did not know how to end his story. The climax is predictable and conventional and the way all characters behave prevents us from wanting anything other than to see them die, and quickly.The cast is sufficiently capable for the characters, which are the usual clichés of teen films and do not require effort from the actors. Rider Strong and James DeBello receive two of the strongest and most interesting characters, but the remaining cast hardly deserves a positive note. Joey Kern is highly irritating with so much hypochondria and individualism; Jordan Ladd and Cerina Vincent are there for being sexy at the sex scenes; Giuseppe Andrews is the stupidest cop I've seen in years. The rest is forgettable and does only what it really needs to do.Technically, it is a film that has not particularly caught my attention. Cinematography is good and uses forest scenes and filming locations skillfully. The special effects are limited to corpses, blood and signs of illness in the cast's bodies, but they work well and are truly frightening.",Cabin Fever
38,Tweetienator,Of Catching Fever,6,10 March 2019,"Solid horror flick for a mainstream horror audience. Cabin Fever combines the well known theme ""young guys and gals without much for brains on vacation getting in some serious troubles in some remote place"" with the virus/infection theme.I wouldn't say that Cabin Fever is a must-watch or masterpiece of the genre, but still a good one to pass some sparetime and enjoy some moments of nice horror and spitting blood.",Cabin Fever
39,BaronBl00d,"""I've Got You Under my Skin""",4,20 December 2008,"Five college students on break(2 girls and 3 guys)travel to the woods in an isolated area to spend time there in a cabin. Along the way they meet up with a child on a store front bench that bites one of their hands, a rabid-like dog(actually several), and finally a man who is bloodied that asks for help. Not only do these fine young people NOT offer this truly sick man any help but they end up shooting at him, beating him, and finally dousing him with flames. The spread of infectious disease then permeates their thoughts and soon they quarrel amongst themselves and begin to fall apart from within. Such is the basic premise of Cabin Fever. What else do we get? Some adolescent behaviour even for college kids, lots of bloody scenes with skin scratching, some weird surrealistic scenes that seem to make no sense at all, and some humour that doesn't quite work but has promise. I am not sure what the film was trying to do exactly - whether it is to be a horror film or a comedy, but I will go with horror film based on the blood, body count, and grisly gore that abounds not to mention the total lack of humanity the characters lack in the film. I cared for none of them as none of them were characters to care for in any way. The town is populated with stereotypes of backward country bumpkins. The kids are partyers all the way(until they start peeling away). At the core of the film is a neat little idea of the spread of contagions and what psychological effects they might have on an isolated group, but the execution is amateurish. The script is the biggest detractor for me as virtually none of the character motivations make any real sense. Why would good friends turn so quickly on each other with so little initial reasons? Why would they remain in and near the woods so that each one of them will get infected and die? What is the deal with the guy in the bunny suit? Many more question could be posed regarding non-existent logic. Did I like anything about the movie? The acting isn't the worst I have seen. Rider Strong as the principal guy is okay and none of the college kids is horrible in terms of performance. They are nothing great either. Robert Harris and Guiseppe Andrews are real hoots in their scenes as the local color(shopkeeper and deputy respectively). The director Eli Roth has a small role as Grim - a character for no other reason put in other than to escalate the body count and give the director a cameo. Roth has some promise with both the horror elements and the comedic bits. He just needs to finely tune the blend if that is the direction he wishes to pursue. He did direct the ""Thanksgiving"" segment in Grindhouse and that was one of the funniest little spoofs I have ever seen. Cabin Fever is an earlier work and a work chock full of flaws.",Cabin Fever

Like Rob Zombie, it's a decently sincere love letter to the grindhouse genre, but never quite reaches the insane spiritedness of the best of that ilk.

I agree with everyone that says that it's already a cult movie. Eli Roth's debut couldn't be better. With this budget he created one of the best horror flicks from the new millennium. The f/x are gruesome but very effective. At first I thought that the death scenes and gore was un called but I couldn't be more wrong. The movie asks for brutality. I liked the plot very much and it is supported by solid acting. Roth knows how to create an intesting, violent movie. Eli Roth has a brilliant future and he demonstrated that he has the capacity to create a good Horror movie. He took the correct influences and he applied his own style. The result is an effective movie that will serve as a reference for future movie making.",Cabin Fever
42,Anonymous_Maxine,An odd twist on the horror genre that doesn't really lead anywhere.,4,25 February 2004,"Pretty much the only interesting thing about Cabin Fever is that there really isn't a bad guy. It's a goofy teenage horror film about a lot of college kids that go out to the woods to act out all their impulses, kind of like the kids in just about every Friday the 13th film, and then they all start dying. Cabin Fever's contribution to the genre is that they all start getting killed, but by some kind of disease and not by a faceless slasher as in so many other modern horror films. Granted, this is also not the most original idea, but at least it's something a little different.The problem with that premise is that it really leaves no room for any kind of motive behind the killings, and so renders some characters so outlandish that they make the whole film look more clownish than it should, such as the college-age police officer more obsessed with partying than law enforcement. Another little problem with the rampant disease that eats away at the cast is that the movie never explains what it is or where it came from. Yes, there is some sort of stagnant lake with a dead body floating in it, which apparently leaks the disease into the drinking water. But what, is the flesh-eating disease a byproduct of the decay of that body? Is it some sort of biological weapon that was accidentally released? Purposely released? Tested and forgotten, but still active?Probably not many people care, especially in this movie's audience. Horror movies are famous for defying all manner of reality-based logic, I don't know why I can't help wondering about things like that. If you can overlook the spontaneous generation of this disease, the movie still doesn't really go anywhere. It's difficult for a movie to create tension when the killer is an airborne disease. Or foodborne. Or waterborne. Or whatever it was. In the movie's defense, it is unusually aptly named.The idea of having a lot of college students go into the woods, carelessly blowing off the backwards mountain people that warn them all along the way, is nothing new. This is the biggest cliché in the movie by far. The characters are just as meaningless and one-dimensional as in the vast majority of horror movies, but I think that the real problem with this one is the same sort of thing that was wrong with Hollow Man a few years ago. There are so many possibilities, and had the movie taken only a few slightly different turns, it would have been enormously better than it was.Plague films, for example, can be almost as endlessly fascinating as time travel films, but they have to be innovative and do something interesting with the overall premise. You can't make a time travel movie, for example, and simply have the characters find themselves in the wrong time and then spend an hour and forty minutes trying to get back. Cabin Fever is about a lot of college kids that go out into the woods, start to catch the mysterious disease, and spend the rest of the movie trying to get back out of the woods. Yawn.The beginning of the film shows an example of the lack of creativity that plagues the rest of the movie (no pun intended). As the characters stop at a local corner store on their way into the deep dark woods, there is a little blonde-haired boy sitting on a bench out front. When one of the guys goes to shake his hand, the kid grabs it and tries to take a bite out of it. No reason is given for the kid being a little strange other than that he's one of the backwoods rednecks. The boy's father, emerging cockily from the store as though he has no idea that these kids could slap him with an enormous lawsuit (one of them even mentions it, then walks away as though the idea were ridiculous), tells the bite victim basically to be more careful and oh by the way, there's a stream out back you wanna go wash your hand. Not only does the guy idiotically go out back and wash his hand in the river water (hardly the most sanitary place, even when there aren't diseases floating through it), but when a couple strange dogs wander up to him, he pets and plays with them eagerly. Personally, strange dogs are the last things I'd want to be touching after having been bitten already by a strange kid.Thus enters the dogs, one of the more pointless elements of the film. The majority of the tension comes from the characters trying to quarantine themselves from the diseased man who wanders out of the woods, the rabid dogs that periodically come out of nowhere, and eventually from each other as they start to get sick themselves. Even worse, when the police eventually do show up, they come in the form of a single frat-boy officer who asks the guy there if there was a disturbance, then hearing that there was, goes on to talk about how he must like to party with his girlfriend, wink wink. He talks about the best places to party and the best ways to avoid your party being broken up, all while standing within arm's reach of the kids' truck, beaten and broken and splattered with blood. Who wrote this character? I've been on a horror kick recently, so I've seen tons and tons of really really bad movies lately, but this is one of the worst written parts I've ever seen.The gore in the movie is interesting, often going so over-the-top that it's hard to miss homages to such famously over-the-top films as The Evil Dead and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The effects of the virus on victims includes sweating blood, apparently, as well as projectile vomiting it in massive quantities. There are some genuinely squirm-inducing scenes, such as a character late in the film noticing a dead body floating in a lake and then falling on top of it, and one of the girls shaving her legs, revealing that the virus has eaten away the flesh under the shaving cream (although this last is more disturbing at her dedication to be nice and silky smooth even though the skin on her leg is rotting off).Clearly, there are mountains of possibilities for a premise involving a flesh-eating virus and a lot of kids who don't even know how it's transmitted trying to get away from it and then away from each other when others in their party start to vomit blood all over the truck. Unfortunately, the movie is brought down by the movie's failure to actually capitalize on any of those possibilities. The movie tiredly retreads the same old ground covered by countless other horror films, replacing the masked slasher with a flesh-eating virus. A noble effort, I have to say, but it could have been so much better with such a small amount of extra effort.
Sadly, the best thing about this movie is an extra feature on the DVD labeled `Pancakes.' That is one of the funniest things I've seen in quite some time.",Cabin Fever

It sounds familiar, but that's what ""Cabin Fever"" is about. I liked the setting of the movie, and the cast was great too. Cheryl Ladd's daughter Jordan, very beautiful. The others very cool looking as well. I liked the part where they go to the general store and they see the rifle on the rack, and the old man used a racial slur that angered the teen couples. Don't blame them whatsoever. When they go out into the cabins. The movie title proves its point, but in a different way. Find the source of the pollution way easy, but how would a corpse would cause such damage? For the people at the general store, I sure was fooled. The old man wasn't as racist as anybody thought he was. The African-American travelers were into hunting as well as anyone. And he was talking hip-hop like, he was cool. Depsite what went on in the movie, it was very watchable. I wish the critics were easy on this film. What's their problem? I've never complained about it. It was great!

45,dee.reid,"Grisly, gruesome, good fun",7,29 July 2004,"Here we go again into idiocy and mediocrity, or so I thought with my first viewing of ""Cabin Fever,"" another tailor-made, teen horror flick ready for consumption by the braindead, MTV-energized masses of blood/sex-crazed adolescents.Five friends have (unwisely) chosen to venture into the woods for a week-long vacation. They end up spending their time in one of those big, spooky cabins that brings back memories of another classic horror film that took place in the woods (""The Evil Dead,"" anyone?). As you would know it, the friends all start coming down with the symptoms of an unknown contagion, and alas, they realize that they've all been infected with a flesh-eating virus, which causes all kinds of nasty scabs and copious amounts of blood to form on the skin through no visible wounds. The friends all naturally start to panic (""Don't touch him/her!"" or ""I am getting the hell out of here!"") and pretty much everything starts to come apart between them (pretty much like society would if there really was a deadly virus on the loose; more on this later).""Cabin Fever"" took a lot of people by surprise last September. I noticed that the film was completed in 2002 but its release was delayed until last year, probably because of the very real and scary S.A.R.S. outbreaks in Asia and Canada. The movie itself has quite a lot of tension, shockingly gross special effects (watch out for that bathtub shaving scene), and some very bizarre dark humor, mostly involving the locals. For a horror film, I wouldn't recommend showing this one to the kiddies as they might be frightened by some of the horrific things that they see on screen.What I picked up from the film is that it attempts to be a parable on one of the great scare stories of our time  the unknown, out-of-control virus. It works on the premise that somewhere out there, maybe in the forest or a top-secret lab, lurks a virus so deadly that if it got out, would unleash hell on earth.To further deliver that terrifying notion, the friends pretty much serve as a stable society that's about to become very ""unstable."" ENTER: a dissident, a catalyst; something to throw this society into a panic that it would eventually fall into and never recover  in this case, that catalyst is a lethal virus that to quote Dustin Hoffman from 1995's ""Outbreak,"" ""Is one-billionth our size and it's killing us."" This formerly stable society starts to crumble under its own paranoia and fear as the virus spreads and kills whomever/whatever it comes into contact with; the friends (society) start to become suspicious of one another, instead of trying to work together to stamp the virus out. And well, it is anarchy from that point on... ...And the ending further proves that anarchy will reign supreme if a sequel is ever produced.",Cabin Fever

But since I started following this thread I have expanded my Horror repertoire. I was right 'Cabin Fever' was garbage . Well not so fast . I was bored with the lame acting and was suffering the Net as I watched . But about 2/3rd through the film . Eli Roth really stared ti ramp up the entire film by like 100% . He introduced a black sheep deputy sheriff who was hilarious. Spoiler but not to bad . At one point the deputy sheriff gets a call from the 'Sheriff' asking if he had found the crazy party in the woods at this point the deputy sheriff had found the crazy party and was in full participation drinking beer and smoking weed instead of busting up the party. Funny as hell. That when I shut off my PC and was engaged . Then 'Cabin Fever' went for a crap film to a blood bath of gore and black comedy . The red necks out for revenge was graet. The weird kid that bits "" Pancake's pancake's what a trip. The infection that ramps up and spreads killing in glorious blood soaking vomit splashing gore fest . Bottom line the film did a 180 and it turn out to be very satisfying. And the bluegrass music at the end of film was the cherry on top. I want more like this film gushing blood vomit fest .

A real mix of horror, comedy and gross-out gore but it worked for me.

49,lukem-52760,ELI ROTH'S DEBUT FILM IS A BLOOD SOAKED MASTERPIECE!!!,10,25 August 2018,"I have absolutely loved Eli Roth's now cult classic ""CABIN FEVER"" ever since i first saw it in the cinema on a rainy Autumn afternoon & i just loved everything about it, actually it's always been a favourite Horror movie of mine & one of my most watched films ever!!!
A very very rare thing is about this great film is the bunch of ""kids"" are a group i really liked, except maybe ""Bert"" lol he was an idiot but funny, i really like that group & most or nearly all Horror films have a bunch of kids/ teens that you hate & really want them to die except maybe like one person!!!
Eli Roth also served us the best possible mix of Horror & Comedy, so we are shocked at the gore but can laugh at the kids reactions or over panicked state, it's the best blend I've ever seen in a Horror-comedy.It's now 2018 & i still think Cabin fever is Roth's best film, everything is just great Horror fun with excellent performances & a group of kids you actually like & want to survive.
Yep back in 2002 when Cabin fever came out it was a huge Horror hit & made on a tiny budget but Eli pulled it off as a fun throwback to the crazy, silly & funny 80's Horror flicks!!! It's pure late night entertainment!!!
The cast is excellent especially the underrated ""RIDER STRONG"" who really is great as the lead in this film, he's the guy you really want to survive & Rider gives a great performance like a young ""Bruce Campbell"" did in the first 1981 ""Evil Dead"" he's that good in this & infact Rider Strong became a go to guy for lots of low budget Horror movies after Cabin fever, some are good like the terrifying Borderland (2007) & the fun Tooth & Nail (2007) & some that was terrible like Pulse 3 (2008) & Cabin fever 2 (2009) both terrible lol but another good Horror Thriller flick Rider starred in was Death Valley (2004) that was a good film so He became a new Horror icon in a way like how the brilliant ""Tom Atkins"" started out!!!Cabin Fever is equally as great as the ""classic"" Horror's of the past such as those that inspired this movie such as Evil Dead (1981),The Thing (1982), Texas chainsaw massacre (1974), Deliverance (1972) & many more that's how BRILLIANT Cabin Fever is & how important this is to the Horror genre!!!!
This has become one of my favourite ""Horror"" films of all time & one of my personal favourite movies of all time!!!""ELI ROTH"" completely gets WHAT we all love in Horror, that balance of deranged humour & gory scares & because Roth was a Horror film geek before becoming a director he so knows what horror fans wanna see, he nailed it with Cabin fever & he won't ever beat the impact this had on the Horror genre at the time!!! Thank you Roth for being a perfectionist & that's why his Cabin fever looks beautiful & not just a cheap looking indie film.Cabin Fever has that proper vintage throwback feel of filthy-nasty-savage 70's & early 80's trashy grindhouse cinema but made with more skill & style than those made back then.I can't praise the excellent performance by ""Rider Strong"" enough as his ""Paul"" character goes through hell & goes from average timid teen to savage survival Hero, through the movie his character is the best written & Rider gives it his all with alot of emotion, heart & brings it up way above average for a low budget Horror!!! Infact Paul is one of the best written Horror heroe's in the genre & to me he's as good as ""Bruce Campbell"" in the first ""Evil Dead"" as both characters are put in similar survival circumstances & go from average joe to badass hero.
Also ""Rider Strong"" at the time of getting the role in ""Cabin fever"" really wanted to get as far away from his wholesome wimpy heartthrob character from the t.v series ""Boy Meets World"" & that was a great move for him as here's this young guy from the world of sickly sweet ""Disney"" series to a bloody gruesome gritty splatter flick, where he has sex & kills rednecks & gets absolutely covered in blood!!! A great part for him as the audience gets a nice comforting familiar feel seeing him in the movie, but he is becomes a savage killer in order to survive, he was perfectly cast in my opinion.It's a shame ""Rider Strong"" didn't become a breakout star after ""Cabin fever"" as he proved he is a great actor & can be a great unexpected lead.
Well in my opinion he made one of the best Horror movie hero characters come to life from the pages of Eli Roth's debut masterpiece classic & roth has still never done better!!!
Eli Roth does know the Horror genre & his Cabin fever is a brilliant homage to those old school 70's & 80's glory days of Horror like i said & it was so refreshing when it came out & with that decent cast!!!
Also another excellent performance is from ""Joey Kern"" as Jeff that's my 2nd fave performance after ""Strong's"" Performance.
My favourite scene is the Awesome sequence where ""Paul"" savagely kills the three rednecks that come to the Cabin to kill the teens, it's such an exciting,intense & bloody scene, just amazing!!!Cabin fever is a great Horror film that is gross out & fun & very violent but with great characters & a sense of fun, the cabin looks beautiful & old & full of history like the cool ""Evil Dead"" cabin, you feel there's a deep history behind that lonely old Cabin in the middle of the woods!!!
The flesh eating virus is terrifying & all too real, the local rednecks are scary but all done with that 80's sense of fun & when there is some very serious scenes the mood & atmosphere is perfect!!! Eli Roth just gets it all right in this movie, his other films are very good but it's his Debut that is the ""Classic"" or ""Masterpiece"" of his career.
There's so many good elements to this movie it's hard to name them all & so many nice little gems of scenes & imagery, like the Fall setting with all the crispy leaves falling & the ground covered with the colours of Autumn it looks beautiful!!!
Also the music score by Nathan Barr is amazing!!!
I am a ""Rider Strong"" fan because of his excellent performance as ""Paul"" in Cabin fever!!! A Nostalgic Horror CLASSIC to me & one I've watched hundreds of times & it never gets boring & that's the sign of a classic film!!!
Also it's a perfect Horror to watch over the Halloween season as it's set in the lovely Autumn time & the over all tone is very primal survival Thriller & bloody virus body Horror with some humour & heart full of 80's Horror fun.
The people that hate on this excellent film are the ones who really don't get that demented blood soaked comedy Horror from the 80's but i do & i loved it probably even more than most Horror's from that era!!!Cabin fever is still director Eli Roth's best film & it came out way back in 2002 but that's how good & how much fun it is as a proper well made bloody survival Horror film with some funny moments but at it's heart it's a proper Horror movie loving crafted like the one's we all grew up on so thank you Eli Roth.

The advertisements made it look more supernatural, but it was exactly the opposite. I was expecting something like ""The Shining"" perhaps, but ""Cabin Fever"" is so very far from that.""Cabin Fever"" follows five college students who rent a cabin in the woods to celebrate their graduation, have one fun time before entering the real world.

The true colors of the group begin to show, as they turn on each other and end up doing horrible things to try and avoid catching the mysterious virus. Kind of funny who it didn't matter if they were around the ones who were infected, because the virus was actually in the water system they were drinking from. This entire film is basically a nasty, sometimes comic bloodbath. The actors were good here and the secluded setting was also good, but the movie failed to scare me. It was more fun and games than just downright horror, more of a dark comedy. Dark comedy isn't bad, but it's just not what I was expecting from this movie.

Roth shares his other four commentary tracks with the cast, filmmakers, friends and his parents! DVD also has an behind the scenes featurette, director's animated shorts and more. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an terrific-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. This film is not the for the squeamish but the film is actually well received by several top critics and including Oscar-Winner Director:Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) loves this film! This movie does take it's time to start moving but do not miss this unique black horror comedy. Which is certainly worth a look. Super 35. (***/*****).",Cabin Fever
52,ferbs54,Note To Cerina Vincent: Call Me!,8,28 December 2011,"As a borderline hypochondriac myself, I must confess that the thought of necrotizing fasciitis--more popularly known as the flesh-eating virus--gives me the heebie-jeebies. (And for those viewers who think this disease is some kind of joke or urban myth, all I can say is, take a look at some of the hideous pictures that the Wikipedia site displays in its article for this subject!) Thus, I just knew that the 2003 film ""Cabin Fever""--in which a group of teens rents an idyllic retreat in an autumnal setting but soon contracts this dreaded illness from a wandering bum--would be a fairly intense experience for me. And, thanks to the great work done by co-writer, producer and director Eli Roth, as well as his quintet of young actors, man, was I ever right!In the film, as our five teens drive to their wilderness retreat, David Hess' song ""Wait for the Rain"" is heard playing on their car stereo; the same song that had presaged the doom of the two young gals in Wes Craven's repugnant ""Last House on the Left,"" and a sure sign, with its memorable line ""and the road leads to nowhere,"" that trouble is brewing. (If I were to ever hear this tune played when I was outside, I would probably immediately rush back home to huddle indoors!) And for the five teens--three guys, played by Rider Strong, James De Bello and Joey Kern, and two truly beautiful young women, played by Jordan Ladd and Cerina Vincent--that trouble erupts fairly quickly. To the film's great credit, these five are all likable and differentiated types, and their reactions to their horrible health crisis--only compounded when the whacky locals decide they must be wiped out--are credible and realistic. ""Cabin Fever"" begins on a humorous note but quickly gets a lot more serious, only shading back toward levity, unbecomingly and ironically, in its final few minutes. Besides the Craven film mentioned above, the film tips its hat in homage to such horror classics as ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" and, given the final fate of the Joey Kern character, ""Night of the Living Dead."" First-time director Roth, two years before working on his first ""Hostel"" film, displays great flair and imagination here; it is at times difficult to believe that ""Cabin Fever"" was his first go behind the camera! The film's special FX are just fine, though the gross-out images here are far less disturbing than those Wiki shots I mentioned earlier. The monster that Jordan Ladd's character becomes is perhaps the most shocking, especially when shown, contrapuntally in flashback, next to her gorgeous former self. ""Cabin Fever"" boasts many impressive and memorable scenes, especial standouts, for this viewer, being the gruesome spectacle of Cerina shaving her legs in a bathtub, that mentally disturbed kid screaming ""Pancakes"" as he sinks his teeth into one of the teen's hands, and those ""Christian"" rednecks coming after the De Bello character with their shotguns. In all, the film IS an extremely intense yet enjoyable experience, and a truly superior modern-day horror wringer. It was hugely profitable on its initial release, and deservedly so. To end on a lighter note, that Wiki article tells us that those prone to necrotizing fasciitis include people who are immunocompromised, diabetics, those with malignancies or chronic systemic diseases, and those who abuse drugs and alcohol. Care to take a guess as to which group our quintet of teens falls into?",Cabin Fever
53,aidanratesmovies,Ummmm,5,28 February 2021,"Truly one of the weirdest films i've ever encountered, Cabin Fever starts out strong, but ultimately feels too messy and too uneven to go any of the bold places it tries to go. The film is a weird combination of zombie flick, comedy, horror, isolation, parody, and so much more- it's hard to understand what they were exactly going for while making it. I enjoyed the beginning of the film, an amusing and obvious tribute to films like Evil Dead but as it goes on, it takes itself to a strangely dramatic and underwhelming place. The acting is all over the place, the look of the film is super 2000's- whether that's a good thing or not I don't know- but the fun little soundtrack at hand proves to be the only thing along with the look that the film is consistent with. The pacing can be a drag, the last 15 minutes are certainly a step in the right direction, but in the end Cabin Fever is too much of a mixed bag to be worth watching- and too all over the place to be enjoyable.

It's a lame game of ten little indians where the characters are totally one dimmensional, and not only do you not care if they get killed, you want them to get killed. I just can't explain how bad this truly is. it's as though Mr. Roth just put together a bunch of stupid ideas and put them into a stupid movie. The ending is pretty much stolen from ""Night of the Living Dead"" except for the hillbillies playing the guitars. I miss the old horror movies, where they were amusing, and ACTUALLY SCARY!!!!

There's a cool concept here, and even if it isn't executed in the best way possible it is interesting, and there are some decent scenes.

58,robertemerald,"Heady horror, but an original 'comedy' of errors",8,27 March 2020,"Cabin Fever is one of those movies where people make split second decisions that have monumental consequences. It's entertaining. You go through the movie, well into it, still somewhat amazed that if only they'd taken door B rather than door A the whole scenario would have been far less extreme. It's clever writing and the filmmaker justly deserves his accolades. Cabin Fever is an exciting watch, no problem, easily worth an 8. The joker in the pack is an oddity that I found somewhat irreconcilable with my brain without making a sympathetic effort. He looks way too old to be a 13 year old brat. To a lesser degrees his companions, both showing signs of early baldness, also look beyond their just-made-it-to-collage status. They are all great actors, as are the other characters, it's a fun movie.I also had a look at the 2016 remake. It's basically the same movie save for being far more scenic with a better edit. What I found difficult was rather than reigning in the paradoxes in the ages and behaviour, the new movie seems to exacerbates them. I got bored before the end and didn't finish it, but that's only because it became obvious that the same things were going to happen.",Cabin Fever

Eli Roth, a self-confessed admirer of all things horror and gore, brings quite a bit of atmosphere into his okay story but fails to establish the one important thing that could have made his film better: a close relationship between the audience and the main characters. It does seem to hurt his story, since we never get to find out why this infection is taking place or anything about these kids (and the young actors play their underwritten parts like they're in a much larger production). All we know is that Roth is setting them up for something incomprehensible and gory.

Direction, along with editing, deliver a scary and tense atmosphere that will probably frighten and entertain you. Some scenes are really agonizing to see, such as the bath's -- I confess I put my hand on my eyes in this part.

61,Matt_Layden,Good Entry For A First Timer,6,20 July 2009,"Here is our buddy Eli Roth, the new whiz kid in horror (or so I've been told) I figured I'd give more then one of his films a chance (second chance actually). Cabin Fever stars Boy Meets World favourite Shaun Hunter, or by his real name Rider Strong, which is also a good porn name. Also, Jordan Ladd plays his girlfriend. Along with their friends they go up to a Cabin to celebrate graduating. Things go bad when one gets a flesh eating disease and the friends turn on each other for survival.Sound familiar? Well, it's basically a remake of Evil Dead, with changes here and there. Instead of the undead, it's simply a flesh eating disease. There you go, same movie. The big difference is Evil Dead is pure genius, where Cabin Fever is a poor imitator.Why doesn't Cabin Fever play out like a decent homage to older scary horror films, because it's tries to be better then what it actually is. Cabin Fever is a B horror film that thinks it's actually scary. I'm sorry, but it isn't.One main problem is the atmosphere. What made Evil Dead scary was that the cabin was in the middle of nowhere. They were stuck and had no place to go. Here, there is a town not ten minutes away. Get in car, go to town, or better yet go home, movie over. I just couldn't get into it knowing that salvation was minutes away. The suspense is all gone.If it's not ripping off Evil Dead (Roth can call it homage all he wants, but it was a rip-off) then it's Night Of The Living Dead. Straight up, one character dies exactly the same way as another in the original Night of the Living Dead. When a film has a homage, there is a wink and a nod, Cabin Fever never winks or nods, he straight up steals. Not to mention half the audience watching this probably doesn't even know what films it is 'homaging'.Now I know Roth loves horror films and I know his intentions might have been good, but it just doesn't come across in the same manner, to me at least. the guy isn't a bad director, he just needs better, more original material.I enjoyed the make-up though. That was probably the most scary thing. I do give credit for what he accomplish though. First film and all, much better then his later efforts with Hostel. Cabin Fever is something that I might like years later, which is why this rating is really generous.Also...pancakes?",Cabin Fever
62,screenman,Brats Get Sick.,3,28 July 2008,"Yes. Well; As the publisher Anthony Blond once said; 'story is something that happens to someone you have been moved to care about.' I did not care about any character in this movie. Ergo; there was no story.It began as typically as all teen horror movies have always begun. A bunch of silly, shallow, hedonistic, impractical, irrational, self-centred brats find themselves confronted by something that's not very nice. It might be a blob. It might be a chainsaw in Texas. It could certainly be zombies. It might be Micheal Myers. It could even be Freddie Kruger. Crikey; it might even be some strange bloke with a seemingly incurable, rampant contagion wandering about in a forest.Whatever the case, its a cue for them to begin dying in the most disagreeable circumstances that any second-rate, unimaginative director can dream up.There have actually been some fairly well-made movies of this genre, though non actually come to mind. But this one is a plucked turkey.The prettier the babes, the more likely they are going to meet some especially grisly come-uppance. Whereas the 'dudes' - advertising their frivolous unreliability with backward-pointing baseball caps - will squabble and fall-out.Every little tired cliché happened by the numbers. Although I had never seen this movie before, I talked it through almost every trite little chill. You knew that one would fall in the water, fiddling about with the corpse. You knew that the sole survivor would get blown away at the very moment of triumph. You knew that they would never manage to shoot the dog. You knew that it wouldn't be the end of the matter when all of the juvenile protagonists had been slaughtered.I brought no expectations to this movie, but always a little hope. It is possible to do the thing in a believable, harrowing, and horrific way. It's simple, straightforward formula. But it wasn't used here.There are lots of interesting movies that touch upon a similar theme. There's the 'Living Dead' franchise. There's 'The Crazies'. Crikey; there's even John Carpenter's seminal 'The Thing'. OK; these don't entail teenagers, but whoever said that adolescents were interesting?

Is it supposed to be a homage, a slasher, a black comedy, or a scary movie with unintentional comedy? Nobody can tell. There's a serious scene at first and a second alter, it turns funny. When the film tries to be funny, the humor is quite bland, excluding the ending. I liked the ending a lot.But apart from the ending, I was pretty disappointed and disgusted. The violence is cringe-worthy, more looking away from the screen than being scared. The tone changes within each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a girl doing karate in slo-motion. What are we supposed to get from that? This same girl would bite one of the characters. Was that supposed to be funny? I don't know.Some of the performances were decent, and many were quite amateurish. I didn't care for most of the characters. I liked the plot but the execution was done horribly. As a horror film, I didn't know what it was trying to be. I didn't find it funny, tense, nor scary. By the end, you're left indifferent, thinking, ""What have I just been through?""

66,baumer,A great start for Roth,7,28 July 2007,"The whole idea of this film is pretty basic: it's the usual five kids taking a trip to a cabin in the woods, and so on. However, the approach is a bit different. While the movie is extremely bloody, and some parts are pretty shocking, the fact is that it's just all really funny. The characters were believable enough, but they were also presented in an unfavorable light that made them easy to laugh at. It was as if Eli Roth did not take any of his characters all that seriously, so he had no trouble making fun of them. The humorous twist made watching this movie a highly enjoyable experience. Also, I found it intriguing how after the initial encounter with the diseased man, the only threat was the possibility of being infected. I think this helped the film to seem more realistic and more terrifying than if it had gone in the more typical direction of having the kids fight off the same already-dead people for the duration of the movie.The film contains a number of tributes to classic horror films that are sure to please any fan, yet is still original and brilliant in its own right. It has everything: blood, suspense, humor, a great score, and an ending that is ironic and amusing.B+",Cabin Fever
67,IonicBreezeMachine,Eli Roth makes his debut and for better or worse makes it loud and unapoloetically Roth,6,9 March 2021,"Set in the backwoods area of Bunyan County, five college students come to a rented cabin for a vacation of sex, drinking, drugs, and debauchery. However after an encounter with a diseased hermit, one by one the group falls victim to an aggressive flesh eating virus taking a physical and mental toll on the group that spirals out of control.Eli Roth whether you like his work or hate it, one can't diminish his drive or tenacity. Working his way through the Hollywood scene in the 90s in fits and starts with people like Howard Stern, WCW, and even David Lynch, one can certainly say that Roth is a very passionate individual who doesn't slack when it comes to his passions. Made for a scant $1.5 million dollars, Cabin Fever put Eli Roth on the map as a filmmaker, becoming the fledgling studio Lionsgate's highest grossing movie of that year, and drawing praise from film critics such as Stephen Holden and Peter Travers, as well as filmmakers such as Peter Jackson and Quentin Tarantino (who would later become a friend and collaborator of Roth on several projects). Cabin Fever certainly has a lot working for it, but it challenges you to hate it with nearly unrelenting effort.A big reason that Cabin Fever tapped into the cultural zeitgeist of the horror scene when it did was it was one of the first major horror releases to try to make from the post modern mold that Scream had shepherded the genre towards. While Scream was and still is well regarded for what was a refreshingly acerbic and intelligent take on the horror genre, it also has gotten a fair share of detractors for how many rip-offs and copycats it spawned in not just tone, but also marketing, style, and general approach that filled the genre with pretentious, know-it-all teenagers to 20-somethings who seemed almost glib about the horror they were in rather than being legitimately scared by it. Cabin Fever breaks from this mold by going back to the beginning. While Cabin Fever is very contemporary and does feature homages in both style and setting to classic drive-in horror be it Friday the 13th type slashers, hillbilly horror like Deliverance or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or even Cabin in the Woods type features like the first The Evil Dead, it doesn't wear these influences on its sleeve nor does it call attention to them through self aware dialogue. Cabin Fever is definitely a horror film with a sense of humor, but it doesn't call attention to it as was the case with many post Scream horror films which makes it refreshing by being something of a throwback.The movie while technically solid and rich in atmosphere is definitely stamped with Roth's trademark style (which will determine whether you love or hate this movie). The five characters we follow are all varying degrees of abrasive, annoying, stupid, and/or unlikable. James DeBello as Bert, the group's one member who doesn't bring a female counter part, is definitely one of the most unlikable people ever created for a movie. When we're introduced to Bert he casually shoplifts a Snickers bar from the General Store for no other reason than ""he can"", and once he arrives at the cabin he goes around the woods causally shooting squirrels and chipmunks because ""they're gay"". The movie's dialogue is laced with causally usage of the word ""gay"" as a synonym for stupid or casual insinuations of homophobia and usage of the word ""retarded"" and while the movie is aware that its characters are all awful people, there's not all that much to them as we slowly wait for them to die off one by one.Roth for as much as he clearly loves the atmosphere and iconography of the films of his youth, doesn't feel like he understands them beyond the surface level. In many ways you can probably see parallels between Bert and Margot Kidder's Barb from Black Christmas or Larry Zerner's Shelly from Friday the 13th part 3 in how they're foul mouthed ""funny one"" who build their identities around casual insults and or pranks, but both Barb and Shelley had humanity behind their abrasiveness that made them feel human enough to see them as characters beneath their cruel behavior. Bert really doesn't have that humanity to him, in fact it's never even all that clear why these people are friends in the first place other than they've been put here by Roth to endure physical and psychological punishment. Maybe Roth is basing this on a dynamic he had with his own friends (since the movie was inspired by his skin infection he contracted with his friends in Iceland) but there's not much that sets up how this dynamic formed nor what it's built upon. Something like this CAN work, but you've got to throw the audience a bone so they can understand it.The actual horror in Cabin Fever is reasonably decent. The isolated backwoods areas that make up Bunyan County, the dilapidated shacks that populate the lakeside area, and the country General Store make for some nice atmospheric locations that give a good sense of dread and isolation. The humor is very hit and miss. Some humor such as some long form setups based around the General Store (particularly a joke involving the owner's causal use of the N-word that has a pitch perfect payoff at the end of the movie) are really good, while others such as a cop obsessed with partying with the wayward youth who come for sex, drinking, and drugs are more confusing than they are funny. I can't really say that Cabin Fever is all that ""scary"" since it doesn't really create much in the way of dread or panic and often feels more like an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon where we're waiting to see what insane levels of punishment await our characters.Cabin Fever excels with some really excellent gore work and many of its scenes such as the Bowling Alley Massacre story, the leg shaving scene, and too many others to mention becoming iconic benchmarks for the genre in the 00's decade. Roth makes these moments incredibly tangible and the squelching, splatter, and oozing are just so lovingly well constructed that it's easy to see why Peter Jackson was so generous with the praise.Cabin Fever is a divisive movie, and it's by design. Eli Roth as a filmmaker is a Provocateur who thumbs his nose at convention and makes his movies without restraint or consideration for good taste. While he doesn't balance the over the top gore and humor as well as his influences like Jackson and Raimi, he does have an understanding of his influences and exudes passion in his every frame with shots carrying a visceral and dynamic nature that brings beauty to the brutality. I'm not sure I can say I ""liked"" Cabin Fever, but it's an incredibly quotable movie with scenes that do stick with you because of how unrestrained they are. Eli Roth has made the movie he wanted to make, abrasive, violent, vulgar, silly, disgusting, juvenile, well shot, well crafted, atmospheric, with meticulous attention paid to little details. If that sounds like the type of movie you'd like, then look no further, you found it and it's a success.Love it or hate it, Eli Roth makes his debut going full force establishing his style unapologetically without remorse, shame, or restraint",Cabin Fever
68,film-critic,Cabin Fever; or a good reason to just drink beer in the woods,8,21 February 2010,"Watching ""Cabin Fever"" reminded me of the fun one could have while making a horror film. One could argue that modern horror is too detailed, over-produced, under talented, and quintessentially making the same mold over and over merely for cinema dollars. The argument is tired, but true. Made in 2002, and only grossing about 21 million, this was a small blip on everyone's radar. Found randomly on DVD one October at my local video store, ""Cabin Fever"" was a means to merely scare a gathering of friends, or perhaps just gather some laughs. Little did we realize that this was something stronger than just your average teen-horror flick. Director Eli Roth (speaking pre-""Hostel"") knew his horror genre. Being an assistant with David Lynch for many years, he understands that spooky doesn't mean linear, that blood does come in gallon containers and the more obscure the better. ""Cabin Fever"" proved that with mediocre dialogue, great horror shots, and the fear of the unknown (which was left unknown throughout the film). He tells us the fears, but not his characters – giving us tension with the horror. While ""Hostel"" seems too mainstream and less Lynch-ian for my standards, ""Cabin Fever"" complete with ""pancakes"", ""Denis"", the box, and the fear of this backwoods community, is that diamond in the rough. This singular film demonstrated the power behind Roth, and his missed opportunity for films to come.There is no arguing that this is an amateur film. The edits are rough, the story is haphazard, and the characters are bland, but what is impressive is the passion behind the camera. The flux of different genres blended together proves that Roth had done his homework, that he loves horror, and wasn't afraid of taking chances. He created a horror film without giving us a monster, the choice of a faceless virus wreaking havoc onto a group of unsuspecting teens was bold, but worked perfectly. Fear was created within the unknown, or more importantly, from what we knew but our characters did not. Cliché to the hilt, our leaders in this rag-tag group of C-actors (of which our leader is the boy from ""Boy Meets World"") try to break the mold, but nothing spectacular comes of it. This, oddly, works for ""Cabin Fever"" because the core of the film doesn't need popular faces, but instead a stark need for bleak realism. As horror watchers, we know that the outcome for those with cliché lines is not positive, so Roth plays with that. He builds non-existent characters to run around screaming, while we scream back. ""Go out of the woods"" – ""Get in the cabin"" – ""Don't stare at the naked woman"" – ""Get help!"" are all things not said within the film, but instead in the audience. Roth pulls you in. Instead of being a mere spectator, ""Cabin Fever"" asks you to be involved.Two big scenes (amongst many) stand out as reasons to watch this film. Whether you are a horror fan or not, these two speak volumes of what Roth learned from Lynch when working together. The first is Dennis. The child at the store that has a fascination with biting people that sit next to him, who loves pancakes, and equally enjoys karate moves – was one of those moments that proved Roth's loyalty to the trade. The slow motion karate reminded me of ""Twin Peaks"" and the music that accompanied added to that feel. The entire station was pulled from a Lynch world, and I would have considered this theft if the two hadn't worked together. Instead, it felt more like a homage, a brief ""thank you"" to Roth's mentor. With that said, the second scene that speaks volumes of Roth's talent is something that he has carried with him throughout his ""Hostel"" years. The unknown. Without spoiling anything, when our group of gun-toting locals arrive to the cabin, two have guns while one merely carries a box. When two fall shy of their goals, the other merely attempts to open a box as his form of defense. What was in that box? What could have protected him? This is the unknown makes ""Cabin Fever"" stand out stronger than others of this genre released at the same time. Sure, it's small – but the effect and conversation that follows with your peers is sublime.Again, ""Cabin Fever"" wasn't the bee's knees of horror films, but unlike Roth's future endeavors it demonstrated his ability to take a small idea and blossom it into true fear. Many will probably not enjoy this film, seeing ""Hostel"" as his penultimate work, this will seem lackluster – but for those nay-sayers against his torture-porn, this is a throwback to a stronger era of horror movie-making. One part David Lynch, one part ""Wrong Turn"", and one part ""The Stand"" (that's a lot of parts) – Roth proves that he can handle a camera, a story, and a crew whilst scaring us, grossing us out, and creating a world within a world.Overall, I am not afraid to say that I like ""Cabin Fever"". When I first saw it I was impressed by what little I understood and what Roth spoon-fed me. I thought he was a director to watch, and I still think he has quite a bit of potential, but to be remembered merely for ""Hostel"" just doesn't cut it. ""Cabin Fever"" is a great entry into the world of horror, creating genuine scares and following a predesigned structure (not a bad thing for this film) – he uses his own techniques to tell his story. ""Cabin Fever"" remains a strong entry into the world of horror. If you are new to Roth, I say start here – if you are disappointed with his future work – go back and see this again. You will not be disappointed.Grade: **** out of *****",Cabin Fever
69,rockman182,Cabin Fever (2002),7,29 May 2017,"saw this once before way back when and remember enjoying it. A lot of people don't like the work of Eli Roth. I don't think he is an amazing director or anything but I did enjoy Knock Knock and Hostel immensely. His films are often stupidly cheesy and full of graphic violence but I can appreciate that, the lowest form of entertainment. I knew I had to revisit this film after watching the terrible 2016 reboot (why the hell did that happen).The story of the film is quite simple. It's about 5 friends who are vacationing at a cabin. Little do they know that there is a type of flesh eating disease spreading around in the area that makes people's skin fall off. They also later find out that it is being spread through water. The film definitely is influenced by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Evil Dead but this film is definitely of that calibre. It's still a dumb enjoyable bloodfest. Which is what is expected from this director.The scares (the few that are present) don't really work and use the often played out jarring sound as something pops up. The blood and makeup is quite good. The skin falling off looks quite real and some of it really does make your skin crawl. The dialogue is so dumb and you get the typical prototype of dumb sex fueled teens who get themselves into trouble (as is par with horror films).The cast aren't particularly great although it was nice to see Rider Strong in a lead role. Jordan Ladd kind of faded into obscurity soon after. The film also has a cameo from Eli Roth, who basically plays an idiot. It's a truly dumb film but mindlessly entertaining. I don't think it's Roth's best (Knock Knock has definitely taken that cake) but it's an entertaining bloody debut.7/10",Cabin Fever
70,jluis1984,"Good, but not great",6,17 January 2006,"Director Eli Roth's first movie, ""Cabin Fever"", has been considered a breath of fresh air and a wake up call for the horror genre; while it is certainly different from most of this generation horror movies, the movie has a few big flaws that hurt the film and make the experience no as satisfying.Let's start from the beginning, the plot is an quite clever take on the ""alone in the woods"" set up. A group of college students go to a cabin in the woods in order to spent a week of beer, fun and sex. Everything goes right until they meet a hermit that carries a strange but deadly disease. While they get rid of him, one of them get the disease, and soon they find each other fighting between them and turning against each other.The plot is very original and is a great setting for a horror movie. Sadly, and while it really delivers some suspense, the concept of friends turning against each other is soon forgotten and we get strange scenes of comic relief that feel out of place. It is one of the major flaws because at the times when the suspense rises Roth suddenly includes an anti-climatic joke that not only breaks the suspense, it breaks the whole pace and rhythm of the movie.Fortunately, when the movie remembers it is a horror, it really works. The disease is some kind of flesh-eating bacteria that slowly rots the body while the person is still alive. The SFX of the disease symptoms are top-notch and the camera work is outstanding in general.The acting is quite good, and better than average; sadly,their performances are ruined by the uneven script that makes the characters unlikeable. A big mistake in my opinion, because horror movies make you feel sympathy for the character, not hate. However, I repeat, it is certainly not the actor's fault, because the script demands them to be that way. A shame indeed, because the cast ends up playing cartoons instead of real characters.The direction is remarkably good, with a definite style of its own although it clearly shows its influences, particularly Sam Raimi and his cult classic ""Evil Dead"". It makes a good movie that is worth a watch.Eli Roth has a bright future, with a better script he certainly will deliver a masterpiece soon. However, ""Cabin Fever"" is a good debut, a fine horror movie, but not the outstanding masterpiece the hype pretends it is. 6/10. Good movie? Yes. Future of horror? Not yet.",Cabin Fever
71,mario_c,"""I made it! I made it! I knew it!""...and I didn't regret!",8,8 February 2007,"Cabin Fever is the debut film of Eli Roth, as a producer, and what a debut, I might say! The film was really a surprise to me, as I wasn't expecting a movie with all that strength! Great plot (at last a horror/gore movie that hasn't psychos, sharpened knifes or ghosts!), great setting, nice acting, brilliant humour at some parts, great soundtrack (a few songs by Angelo Badalamenti and fantastic string sounds almost all the movie) and good horror scenes. In fact, after seeing Hostel, I didn't expect that the previous Eli Roth movie was so good! Comparing to this movie Hostel was a regression! The plot is really simple and follows, in a general way, the traditional plot-keys of a slashing movie. However it's very well structured and the main theme is a lot different from traditional horror movies. The ""killer"" it's not a psycho, a ghost, or a ""scary monster"", but just an epidemic/virus. I know it's not the first time that an epidemic is used in a horror movie, but it's not very common I guess. The acting is also very nice, and the setting explores the ""always fantastic"" interior southern lands of the U.S.A About the humour we cannot say it's always present, since it's not a comedy, but it has some great moments of dark humour! One I can remember is when the blond guy, at the end, starts shouting: "" I made it! I made it! I knew it! They are all dead, but I made it"", and suddenly he's full carved of bullets from sheriff and his men! Hilarious! But there's a few more The soundtrack was really great! First, because I adore Angelo Badalamenti, I know him from David Lynch movies, and he can creates fantastic sound atmospheres which mix melody with mystery He's a great musician! Second, because the soundtrack is full of scratching string sounds! Cellos, violins, freezing sounds! That's cool! It made me remember the horror movies from the 70's. That's the classic horror's film sound! The kind which we use to say: ""They don't make it anymore"" The horror/gory scenes are also very well done, especially because they're very realistic. Some of them made my blood run chill, not because they were scary, but because it's a kind of scene that really makes me freeze: when the girl is taking a bath and shaving her legs and her skin stars to drop! Skin someone alive impresses me, even more than if he's cut in pieces! Well, globally, the gory scenes were good because in spite of not being so many like that they were very bloody! Cabin Fever was really a nice surprise, a lot better than Hostel. I'm expecting to see the next works of Eli Roth!",Cabin Fever
72,Ben_Cheshire,Don't Drink the Water,6,10 May 2004,"(spoilers)There are some good scares to be had here, but this works mainly on trying to disgust you. A have this theory that if you want to know if a movie's scary, try eating while watching it (popcorn doesn't count). This movie is not a good one to eat in front of, since its fairly high on the disgust-o-meter. It has a fairly good creepy atmosphere, but its terribly uneven.Cabin Fever labours under the fact that the bad guy is an illness, betraying the fact that the filmmakers have constantly struggled to make it scary, constantly resulting to scare and shock tactics to make the audience jump to compensate for the lack of a human bad guy. The tactics include Dennis, the dog, the men from the store and the lamb. The music doesn't help - Ennio Morricone's three songs stick out like sore thumbs next to the music the rest of the film has.All this would be fine if not for the fact that the characters are so obnoxious! Cerina Vincent is beautiful but very synthetic-looking (Areola the naked exchange student from Not Another Teen Movie!), James DeBello with his Oscar-the-Grouch voice is that same tired backwards-cap jock we're all tired of, Rider Strong is (another one of those clean-cut Jared Leto types) is that same frustrated quiet guy in love with his best friend (Jordan Ladd), who is an uptight manipulator.Interestingly, Cerina and Jordan are the two girls from Lynch's digital video short Darkend Room if you've seen that.",Cabin Fever
73,deatman9,actullay not bad,6,22 May 2012,"This movie was actullay not bad despite what most people tend to think. The acting was actullay good the plot was interesting and it had some edge of your seat moments.This movie is about a group of 20 somethings who go out to a cabin in the woods for the weekend. While partying one night a strange ""hermit"" apporoaches them with what looks like some kind of disease. They are scared of it being contagious so they attempt to scare the stranger off accidentally killing him in he process. Having their vehicle wrecked in the encounter they are stranded as the disease starts to pick them off one by one.This movie was pretty good don't listen to everybody on here. It was low budget yes but you cant really tell. The only negative thing I would have to say about this movie is that for no reason at all Roth throws in jokes here and there. They are quite amusing but it throws off the entire atmosphere of the movie.Good movie though give it a watch",Cabin Fever

75,Superunknovvn,How pathetic,3,4 February 2004,"The premise of ""Cabin Fever"" may not be the most original one, but it could have set up a good claustrophobic thriller, a study of mankind even. ""Cabin Fever"" is neither. Instead it turned out to be ""Friday The 13th"" with a killer virus, only the dialog and the acting are even cheesier (yes, it's possible!). As soon as I recognized one of the actors (James DeBello, the guy who plays Bert) to be the same guy who had already annoyed the hell out of me in another useless movie, called ""100 Girls"", I knew that ""Cabin Fever"" was going to be a letdown. DeBello has such a moronic smile, I want to throw my T.V. out of the window every time he comes on. He's playing the immature, annoying member of the group again and he did a good job at that. Makes me think he's either like that in real life too or he's indeed a damn fine actor (yeah, right). All the time I couldn't stop thinking, why would anyone try to make something out of such a bad script? Why hire stunt people who set themselves on fire? Why the make-up artists and all the rest of the crew? Why buy the rights to the script in the first place? Had anybody actually read this? Apparently the movie was written by a six year-old! I bet, some people responsible for this mess got fired at Lion's Gate. I will give the movie one extra point for the final joke, which is kind of funny, but, well, completely out of place in a movie that's trying so hard to be scary for the rest of the time. Then again, maybe it was all just a big joke.",Cabin Fever
76,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,5,17 August 2014,"Eli Roth's directorial debut can be a bit dense at times and is full of shameless clichés, but has gained a cult-following over the years for being a halfway decent horror movie made at only a 1.5 million dollar budget. Five college graduates who rent a cabin in the woods (already two clichés in just half a sentence) fall victim to a flesh-eating virus. Idea came from Roth's experience of developing a facial rash from rotten hay during an Iceland trip. Sound mixer John Neff survived the real flesh-eating bacterium, which took 13 days of non-stop intensive care to cure. Despite the real-life inspirations from Roth and Neff who maintain the make-up in the film is 100% accurate, the movie never hooks the viewer into the story's reality.** (out of four)",Cabin Fever
77,DonFishies,"Eli Roth's first film delivers on everything his second should have, and more",6,27 May 2007,"Despite all of the hype, Hostel has got to be one of the worst and most vile pieces of celluloid I have ever had the displeasure of watching. Not for the violence, but for the fact that it just sucked, horrendously. I would see and read how well liked Eli Roth was for making the movie, and it would just disappoint me even more. I kept asking myself why anyone would like such a horrible movie, and then I realized that I had to see Cabin Fever before I tried to draw anymore conclusions.Following in the steps of The Evil Dead and Night of the Living Dead before it, Cabin Fever tells the story of five friends who rent a cottage in the woods after graduating from college. A chance arrival from a stranger covered with a flesh-eating disease ends in a murder, and before you know it, one of the friends has the virus. From here, they all race to try and get help, before it takes them too.No, the film is not deep, and no, it is not very original either. But thankfully, Roth pays homage to the men who have clearly inspired him, and made a decent horror movie that could actually play for scares and laughs (and not just for the sake of pointing out how ridiculous it is). What this film has, that Hostel sorrowly lacks, is being completely devoid of seriousness. Never is there a moment in the film where the characters go all serious. It plays itself up as a parody, and it stays very much in that realm for the entirety of the film. Yes, they have some dramatic moments, but they never cross the line between parody and complete earnestness. For that reason alone, I can respect this film a whole lot more than Hostel.But while the laughs come as fast and furious as the scares, the film still reeks of having the random and completely demented moments that I imagine Roth loves. They work better here than they did in Hostel, but do we really need a whole hour to pass before all hell breaks loose in the final thirty minutes? Clearly Roth could not have been that desperate for filler that he sacrificed his slow brooding horror for moments that just seem rather, off. He brings in random characters all over the place (including one played by himself), and really, they do nothing for the movie. Having them come to the enigmatic town, catch the disease and then try to get help would have been a much easier way of getting this movie from point A to point B. Hell, he could have even kept the ridiculous nature of the town's residents after they see the destruction of the disease, and it could have played itself out to be so much stronger than it is.But then, I must ask, why does no one in this movie seem to understand each other? Clearly he could have used one character to be sympathetic, but no one is. Even Jordan Ladd's Karen, who spends two of the film's three acts locked in a shed, does not even wince out the tiniest bit of sympathy. Does Roth really feel the need for all of his characters to do terrible things, and not be likable one bit? I came away with an awful taste in my mouth after watching the behaviour in the characters in Hostel, and here, they act out much of the same behaviour, only with a hell of a lot more drama and proper parody. It just seems a bit bizarre to have such off-putting characters, despite whether or not they do not last the entirety of the film's running time.The film also benefits from not dwindling on any one thing. The violence is fast, furious and brutal. But never are we subjected to long and ridiculous shots of it. Here, Roth seems to know exactly what to show, and exactly what to cut out. He seems very cooperative with his material, and he seems to know exactly what he is doing. So how then, can we compare this to his manipulative and perversely repetitive sequences in Hostel? I just cannot seem to shake the fact that he seems to really have an avid knowledge of what to do in this movie, but does not seem to have any sort of idea what to do with the far better concept at work in his second film. Maybe I should just chock it up to the likes of Sam Raimi, George Romero and Peter Jackson for obviously influencing his work in this film. Like his own personal fanboy Quentin Tarantino (which hurts me deeply), Roth wants to ape the successful moments from the films these directors made, and their unique visions. Through his own concoction, Roth managed to come up with a half-decent horror film that has all of the modern day problems all horror films have, but still manages to do what it sets out to do from the start.Eli, this is the type of film you were born to create. It has just the right amount of laughs and the right amount of cheeky horror to set itself apart from the movies that just want to scare the bejesus out of its viewer. You knew how to direct this kind of movie, and you clearly demonstrated how well you could do it with this film. So why change the formula? Was it really worth it? I can only hope that Hostel: Part II has more parts Cabin Fever than it does Hostel. Because if it is just the genre-melding mess the original film was, I am going to have to stay with my original diagnosis of Roth as a filmmaker. And sit saddened, wishing there could be a successor to this film, flaws and all.6/10.",Cabin Fever
78,moviesleuth2,Lost in the Woods,4,2 December 2009,"""Cabin Fever"" is an ambitious movie, but unfortunately, ambition doesn't equate to success. ""Cabin Fever"" wants to be many things, but it doesn't really succeed at any of them. Primarily, it wants to be both a scary bloodbath and also a homage to schlocky B-movies. While some movies have succeeded in this arena, they are more of the exception than the rule. And, sad to say it, ""Cabin Fever"" is not among them.Five friends Paul (Rider Strong), Karen (Jordan Ladd), Bert (James DeBello), Marcy (Cerina Vincent) and Jeff (Joey Kern) have just graduated from college and are taking a week long vacation in the woods to drink and have sex non-stop. But trouble starts even before they arrive. Soon, they are battling a skin disease that is eating them alive (literally).It's actually a shame that Eli Roth chose this premise as a means to pay homage to schlock movies. Done right, this could have been a terrifying movie (and filled with the copious amounts of gore that Roth clearly loves). As it is, it seems like a wasted premise instead of a homage. There's simply not enough cheese to make it enjoyable enough in that respect.The problems don't stop there. The actors are too boring to either sympathize with or laugh at. Needless to say, this severely hampers the film's ability to scare its audience or make them appreciate the homage. The only actor worth mentioning is James DeBello. He's terrific as the big dumbass Bert. This is the lumbering idiot who will gleefully be a slob and still laugh after you realize that he let one rip. Sadly, the other actors aren't as good. Rider Strong may have made his mark with TV audiences as Shawn Hunter in ""Boy Meets World,"" but he's lost in another movie here. He takes his performance way too seriously instead of going along with the flow and just having a good time, thus he comes across as stiff and out-of-place. Jordan Ladd and Cerina Vincent are basically the same except that they look different and have different things happen to them. Joey Kern is obnoxious as Jeff, but not in a good way. In one of the interviews on the DVD, Eli Roth commented that Jeff is supposed to be a dick, but Kern is so annoying that you can't wait for him to die. That's a far cry than appreciating someone for playing a character who's a complete jerk.Eli Roth is a member of the so-called ""Splatter Pack."" While he clearly is unafraid of showing blood and gore, as a filmmaker, he does not match up to the other members of the group, such as James Wan and Leigh Whanell (the ""Saw"" movies) or Neil Marshall (""The Descent,"" ""Dog Soldiers""). ""Cabin Fever"" suffers from a plethora of problems, one of which is pacing. Getting to know the characters is crucial for any film, but none of the characters in ""Cabin Fever"" are interesting enough to hold our attention for as long as it takes for Roth to get things going. The second problem is that Roth loses control of things fairly early in the movie. Films need to be directed by a sure hand; ""Cabin Fever"" seems uncertain of what it is doing. It keeps spinning its wheels, but it's doesn't know where it's going. Some characters and plot points are grafted into the screenplay, and they don't really fit.""Cabin Fever"" isn't a terrible movie; there are a few tense moments, and DeBello is always fun to watch, but it's just not a very good one. According to the documentary on making the film, people were lined up to get into a 1,000 seat theater at the Cannes Film Festival. I wouldn't be surprised if this was a movie that really depended on audience participation (like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show""). Or maybe I'm not ""schooled"" enough in the films that Roth is trying to pay homage to. Whatever the reason, I didn't enjoy ""Cabin Fever"" as much as I hoped I would.Note: Roth clearly has a sense of humor. Watch the ""Family Friendly Version"" in the Special Features, and you'll see why.",Cabin Fever
79,PeterMitchell-506-564364,"Cabin Fever, sadly no Hostel",4,25 February 2013,"This movie rides a too little story, and to depreciate it, is the awful acting, one girl in a black bikini, sun baking on a lazy boy in an plague infested river, she might as well been a corpse. The hillbilly music at the end credits was another minus. Five college friends head off to the woods, where a flesh eating virus, found in the polluted river, turns our fun seekers, into flesh rotting corpses. As to keep the movie running at adequate running time, which seems almost to last forever, first they show small symptoms like fevers, coughs whatever, until the slow and ugly disintegration takes effect where they form into grotesque states of being, one by one, where it's kill or be killed. Two knowing their fate have one last sexual encounter in a barn, where the first victim was kept in a quarantine by the others. So really there's your movie, it's gore, and make up effects, great, but this isn't enough to sustain it from being a good quality horror film, to Roth's following, brilliant shocker, Hostel, which is still one of the most scariest horrors I've seen in I don't know when. The mains, most of them unknowns, excluding one who's star shone bigger, gave such incredulously bad performances, I was in a state of utter disbelief. It's like they weren't ever trying to act, where you think a Christian name like Rider could make you a big star. One plus if you can call it that, was the psychopathic hillbilly locals, who added some air of menace to this insubstantial debut.

80,LoneWolfAndCub,An unfairly criticised debut; it really is not that bad,8,16 February 2008,"Eli Roth's debut, Cabin Fever, seems to be hated by the majority on IMDb and many other critics. I, however, found this to be a rather enjoyable little film that just falls short of being great. To sum up this movie: take a bit of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, a bit of The Evil Dead, a couple of elements from The Thing and Last House on the Left and you have Cabin Fever. A horror movie about five teenagers going to holiday in a cabin in the woods after college where the nearest town is filled with hicks and everything is slowly getting infected by an unknown virus which starts to turn everyone against each other. Roth blends horror with a small amount of comedy which suits this type of movie. The five teens are a mixed bunch (the dumb guy, the horny couple and the innocent couple). Most of them swear, drink, have wild sex and smoke drugs and because of this may seem annoying and clichéd, on the contrary, Roth has captured the attitude of what teenagers were (and still are) like. We do all that they do (well, not so much drugs..) and to me that makes them more realistic. The locals aren't so realistic and seem to be their for comic relief and body count (which isn't a bad thing). There is plenty of gore and plenty of scenes to make you squirm in disgust.The reason I don't give this a really high score is because the pacing seemed jumbled to me. For me, the running time was really short and there were not enough scares throughout. This movie had potential to be more than the final product but I respect what Roth has done and considering it was his first movie it is remarkably good and for that I give it:8/10",Cabin Fever

Director/writer Eli Roth shows that he's a genre fan, making references to a number of classic horror films, not to mention using some of David Hess's original songs for Craven's Last House on the Left (1972). Roth manages to use slick humor and spine-tingling horror together in a very effective way! The film has many of the horror movie conventions, yet never really falls into the cliché trappings of so many B horror flicks. You simply don't know where the twisting plot of the movie is going at any time. The movie is nicely shot in Mount Airy, NC. Roth tosses in some style in his direction, making some of the moments of dream-like psychological horror nightmarishly good. The musical score is quite good. David Hess's son Jesse Hess does a good cover on his father's old song 'The Road Leads to No Where' for the films closing credits. The makeup FX for this film are outstanding and stomach-churning! There's plenty of blood to be had for the gore-hounds. The cast is great. Rider Strong is good in his role of a teen struggling to survive. Beautiful Jordan Ladd does a heart-felt performance as Strong's love interest. The ever-funny James DeBello is perfect as a jerky friend. Cerina Vincent and Joey Kern also turn in good performances as the other desperate-to-survive youths. Giseppee Andrews does a humorous turn as a local deputy/""party man"" and Roth himself appears as a stoner camper. The rest of the cast, most of whom play weird country characters are solid as well.Why so many people have come to dislike this movie is a mystery to me! Many complain about Roth using both horror and off-beat humor, but it works!

The plot sounded promising and appeared to be a combination of teen-horror and disease/infection/virus disaster movies.The most I can say about this movie is that it delivered exactly what it promised, nothing more nothing less. The acting was average, but not bad at all. The characters were your usual stereotypical teens (""easy to get"" attractive girl and her douche boyfriend, a good girl, a good guy, and an idiot. Nothing even slightly innovative here). The story was textbook teen horror - going on vacation to a desolate old town, meeting some creepy locals, getting to a neat cabin in a creepy forest, the works! It's all there.Just when you'd expect Jason to appear and start hacking and slashing, the second ingredient of the combination appeared, and the disease outbreak began. One of the better things in this movie was how it portrayed the disease. Just enough gore to make it realistic, but not too much so as not to use gore as a cheap cheat. Another nice part of this movie was the relationship between good-boy and good-girl, which was quite beautiful.One thing was rather original, and that was the comic relief, provided this time not by ""the idiot"" (who wasn't all that funny), but by the weird freaky Sheriff's Deputy who spoke, behaved and looked just the stoner type idiot you'd expect to find in such films, only that he wasn't with the guys on vacation, he was the law!

Long story made short, the usual gang of idiotic college students encounters a flesh eating disease in the woods. (Jason was off fishing.)

Although the gore may be shocking to mainstream viewers, anyone familiar with Japanese or Chinese horror movies will be yawning. Furthermore, the characters are so stereotypical that you could care less what happens to them, so you have no real investment in the movie.The stereotypical characters also hurt in the comedy department.

One of the characters acts so weird all I could think of is ""I'm glad I didn't have to work with him."" And the ""documentary"" on the DVD didn't make him look any more normal! That's how bizarre this guy is. Nothing here to really sink your teeth into. And the characters are so cruel to the first victim of the ""skin condition"" you don't care what happens to THEM. Skip it.",Cabin Fever
90,emperor_bender,"Sick, Twisted, Demented....I love it",9,10 February 2008,"There are not many horror movies nowadays which I consider to actually be any good. ""The Ring"", ""The Grudge"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake,and ""30 Days of Night"" are examples of how sad and pathetic the Horror scene has become. However, ""Cabin Fever"" is a relief from those static, boring horrors of today. It is actually sick and twisted, like many older horror films. I loved it and was actually startled in many parts by the twists and shocks. THere weren't any cheap ""psychotic"" scenes, like in The Ring. Some of the characters were twisted and crazy, but thats what made them good. And I love the random humor throughout the eeriness. Recommend this movie to any classic horror fans. 9/10",Cabin Fever
91,Gafke,The Evil Dead Outbreak,6,1 June 2004,"I didn't think this movie was all THAT bad. I mean, at least it was somewhat original. Instead of several unlikable young adults heading off into the woods to drink and have sex and eventually get killed and eaten by inbred cannibals, we get several unlikable young adults heading off into the woods to drink and have sex and get killed off by their own stupidity. A nice, creepy, flyblown opening sets us up rather well. A nasty virus (origin unknown and never explained) finds its way to the cabin via a backwoods hobo, and quickly infects our cast of beautiful people. Their truck damaged by the virus-maddened hobo (and their drinking water polluted by his rotting corpse, which has fallen into the nearby river), our group of five is virtually stranded, and it isn't long before the flesh- eating disease is turning the beautiful people into some pretty nasty looking specimens. I found it difficult to feel any sympathy for the infected city folk; they were all pretty annoying and not terribly unlike the college kids in my apartment complex who yell and scream (and puke) underneath my bedroom window at 2am when I have to get up at 5am. I did, however, appreciate the realistic reactions of the characters when they realize what is happening: instead of bonding together and fighting to survive, they scatter, bicker, regard each other with suspicion, abandon their lovers, act like immature jackasses and kill each other. In short, they're pretty realistic in all of their shallowness and selfishness. I also rather enjoyed the dark comedy that ran through this film; the pancake loving Dennis, the nightmarish rabbit, the pot smoking deputy, the bowling alley massacre and the supposedly racist old man. These scenes were few and far between, but they were the most interesting ones in the movie, usurped only by the ending which is a morbid punchline to a very long, sick joke.This isn't a perfect film, but as far as horror films go, I've seen a LOT worse. People who enjoy bloody splatter and black comedy may appreciate this odd little film. I give it a 6 out of 10. Sue me, I kinda liked it.",Cabin Fever
92,postmanwhoalwaysringstwice,highly arrogant horror film-making,3,21 December 2006,"There's a major difference between releasing an original, intense, edge-of-your-seat, scary, gore-fest, and doing like filmmaker Eli Roth and his team have done with ""Cabin Fever"" and simply acted like it. The film follows five college graduates into a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal as one after the other succumbs to this mysterious, fast-acting, flesh-eating disease. It's not long before the friends turn on one another, and can barely stand the sight of one another, much less want to be in the same vicinity as them. As gross as it all sounds, there's a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked, in the hands of a less cocky filmmaker. Unfortunately what we end up with is poorly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting, a hackneyed script so profanity-laden as to leave the viewer tuning out the dialogue, and several incomprehensible subplots that motivate little more than (in one instance) an on-screen appearance by director Roth. This is sloppy film-making in several ways! Avoid this time devourer.",Cabin Fever

The movie was creepy and it gave me feelings of Evil Dead.For a debut movie, director did good work. Performance by the cast was okay, not effective. You are unable to connect with them and don't even feel sad for them.

94,christian123,So-So,4,13 July 2005,"Cabin Fever offers some intense and scary moments but its really just the same except not very memorable. As a last hurrah after college, friends Jeff, Karen, Paul, Marcy and Bert embark on a vacation deep into the mountains. They drive to a remote cabin to enjoy their last days of decadence before entering the working world. Then their friend Karen gets sick and to avoid catching her virus they lock her in a shed. They look at one another and realize that any one of them could also have it. What soon began as a struggle against the disease turns into a battle against friends, as the fear of contagion drives them to turn on each other. The kids confront the terror of having to kill anyone who comes near them, even if it's their closest friend. The plot sure does sound scary and they did a decent job of executing it. I had heard that this film was really scary and I guess I did have high expectations. I should have lowered them as this was a slightly above average horror flick and nothing more. The story was decent with some clever twists and then it also had some old, annoying clichés. The acting was alright with the best being Rider Strong. His performance was nothing special but he stood out from everyone else. The rest of the kids are played by Jordan Ladd, James DeBello, Joey Kern and Cerina Vincent. They all play their roles well but don't really have a big impact on the viewer, which is okay since this is just a teenage horror flick. Eli Roth did an okay job of directing but he isn't that great at building suspense. I thought the film got really stupid at times like the kid who liked pancakes. I guess the director was making a reference to some film but it wasn't really needed. There were a lot of plot holes as well like who was the pancake kid? The film is pretty gory not over the top but enough to satisfy people. Cabin Fever pays homage to older horror classics which is nice but I didn't really think that helped the quality of the picture. In the end, this is a decent horror flick that's worth checking out. Rating 6/10",Cabin Fever
95,jcbutthead86,"A Scary,Effective,Gory,and Darkly Funny Horror Film. Eli Roth's Best Film.",10,23 October 2012,"Eli Roth's Cabin Fever is a great horror film that combines scares,gore,frights and dark humor that wonderfully pays homage to Horror films from the 70s and 80s. This is Eli Roth's best film that deserves more respect and is very underrated.Cabin Fever tells the story of five college students Paul(Rider Strong),Karen(Jordan Ladd),Bert(James Debello),Marcy(Cerina Vincent)and Jeff(Joey Kern)who are on vacation and decide to rent a cabin in the woods. When there,the group discovers that there is a flesh eating virus that's spreading around the forest that threatens to to take them one by one. The group also has to deal with crazed local hillbillies,hermits,dangerous animals,cops and themselves getting into frightening and bizarre situations.Cabin Fever is a film that seems to have divided Horror fans since it's release in 2003 where some love the film and some hate the film I fall into the former category and truly feel that Cabin Fever is terribly underrated. Cabin Fever is a great Horror film that takes viewers back to the days when Horror Films were bloody,frightening,gory and truly politically incorrect and Roth just rolls with it paying homage to Horror classics from the 1970s and 80s such as John Carpenter's The Thing,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Evil Dead working as an homage but it's own film as well. The film has a great atmosphere that changes when things fall apart. In the beginning of the movie it's very fun and lighthearted where you get to know the main characters and what they're about and who they are. When the threat of the flesh eating virus comes around the film becomes darker and there's looming sense of dread and fear and when the characters start turning on each other it's real and believable. The film ultimately works as metaphor for the AIDS and HIV virus where most human beings live in fear of getting a deadly disease whether by breathing,touching or sex. The themes in the film will be relevant to people who watch the film and will stick with you after you view the film. What is also great about Cabin Fever is how it's not a Scream-type film and how the film takes itself seriously. While the film makes reference and pay's homage to the classic Horror films of the 70s and 80s,the film and it's characters aren't self-aware and know that they're in a Horror film. Roth smartly takes the material very seriously and the characters are in a horrific situation that is real and frightening and avoids having main the characters make lots of Humorous references to Horror films and treats the film as if you are with the characters going through the very same thing they are going through,treating the situation as dark and realistic as possible. What I also love about Cabin Fever is the dark Humor and slow build up. The Humor in the film is funny,insane,well-placed,dark and at times surreal and unexpected where one minute you are screaming in terror and you are laughing your head off the next. With CF Roth balances Horror and Humor well and that's one of the main reasons the CF works. Where most Horror films now are fast paced and get to the point,Cabin Fever is more like the Horror films of the 70s and 80s where Horror films were done with slow build-ups with characters and the dialog and then when things go to hell you care for the main characters. Eli Roth doesn't use fast editing or fancy camera tricks to get the viewer involved in the story,but with old fashion storytelling getting the viewer into the dark,scary and sometimes bizarre world of Cabin fever. Roth shows us the cabin and the woods making the main characters feel like their isolated from the world where there is no escape or hope. The ending of Cabin Fever is fantastic because it's funny and disturbing and will have you laughing in tears and disgust. A great ending. The cast does a great job. Rider Strong(best known for his role as Shawn Hunter on Boy Meets World)does a great job as Paul,bringing depth and sympathy to the role. Jordan Ladd is wonderful as Karen Paul's long time friend. James Debello is fantastic as Bert the funny guy. Cerina Vincent is great and sexy as Marcy the highly sexual girl in the group. Joey Kern does a wonderful job as Jeff,Marcy's boyfriend. Giuseppe Andrews is funny and memorable as Deputy Winston,a cop who loves woman and wants to party. Arie Verveen is wonderful as Henry the Hermit and brings sadness to the role. Director Eli Roth has a fun and small cameo as skateboarder Grim,a guy who hangs with group a bit.Eli Roth's direction is excellent with Roth bring slow camera movements,a great visual style and camera angles and color changes. Great job,Roth.The score by Nathan Barr is amazing and effective and fits in with the films tone. The score definitely reminded me of the Horror scores of the 70s and 80s and it's great. I also loved the use of songs from the Wes Craven classic The Last House on The Left and they fit in well with the film. The special effects by the great K.N.B EFX group is great,memorable,realistic,bloody and gory and messy. K.N.B does it again.In final word,if you love Horror films I highly suggest you see Cabin Fever,a scary,Gory,funny and memorable and probably in fifteen or twenty years will go down as a Horror classic and be more recognized. Highly Recommend. 10/10.",Cabin Fever
96,MovieGuy01,Not a bad film....,4,3 July 2010,"I thought that Cabin Fever was quite a good horror film, it was quite some time before i got the chance to see this film. the film is about five friends, Marcy,Bert,Karen,Paul,and Jeff who decide to leave the city for a get-way in the mountains, they rent a cabin in the hills. one of the friends Bert goes out shooting in the woods for squirrels but instead he shoots a man with a flesh eating disease.

97,mnpollio,"Repulsive, offensive and brainless - which makes it sound leagues more interesting than it is",1,11 June 2014,"While I certainly was no stranger to horror and slasher films in my youth and have soft spots for Halloween and even the first few Friday the 13th films, I neither understand nor find entertaining the torture porn genre that has infiltrated mainstream horror in the last couple of decades. Case in point being Eli Roth's Cabin Fever, which actually managed to get a mainstream release, a couple of critics and industry insiders who apparently felt there was something worthwhile here to compliment, and enough press coverage to arouse the interest of genre enthusiasts. The end result is pure torture for the viewer.Roth, who claims to be a horror genre fan (as well as believing he is a competent director), sets his story in the woods and provides five 20-somethings to blunder their way into his nightmare. Instead of a mad slasher, we get instead flesh-eating viruses. This might seem novel if there was any effort to develop anything in this screenplay, but I digress. In brief, our five nitwits encounter a gaggle of locals, who all appear to be suffering from some form of in-bred stupidity and played by people who were apparently rejects from casting for Deliverance. At one point, a wandering hermit obviously in the throes of a deadly illness, comes to them for help and our intrepid group naturally do what any would do to a sick person seeking help, they attack him and set him on fire. The burning carcass drags its way to the drinking well and falls in, thus contaminating the water supply to their cabin and starting an uninventive countdown of which one will be the first to contract the illness. It is not really spoiling anything in Roth's nasty film to say that it will naturally be the only person who experiences an iota of remorse for the death of the hermit.Pretty much nothing makes sense in Roth's asinine film, but it matters little to the director whose only goal seems to be to set the stage so that increasingly grotesque gross-out effects can take over. Filmmakers like Roth need to understand that there is a huge difference between being scared and being repelled - and if you cannot tell what that is than you are in the wrong line of work. Roth's idea of brilliant dialog revolves around how many times the F-word can be said in quick succession. ""Character development"" here seems to be confused with how stupid and unlikable the characters can be made to be. All five of the central characters are revealed fairly quickly to be dumb, thoughtless, selfish, hateful, nasty predators without any moral compass. The peripheral characters are not any better and feature such lunatic moments as a wacko who tries to bite people, while shouting ""PANCAKES"" and doing faux karate moves...seriously! Was it really impossible to come up with anyone who could evince even a moment's sympathy? Perhaps making everyone ethically repugnant is supposed to make the viewer ""enjoy"" watching the flesh blister and rot from bodies. I suppose there are those who enjoy such sights for their own merits. The ending is predictably downbeat and preposterous, but by that time if you are still watching, you probably will just be relieved that it is over.Of the cast, I only recognized one guy that used to be on the lousy Boy Meets World, but no one makes an impression in any good way here. Roth's direction, like the story, is nightmarishly incompetent. He has no idea of pacing or how to generate suspense - he just starts hurling blood, mucous, grime and body parts at the lens and hopes something will terrify the viewer. He has also revealed himself to be a one-trick pony - by consistently recycling the theme of young people who travel out of their comfort zone into a foreign setting and pay the price. His next films were the odious Hostel and Hostel 2 (with the victims being gruesomely tortured to death in Eastern Europe) and coming soon will be The Green Inferno, his feverish tribute to the Italian cannibal genre featuring young people crashing in the South American jungle and being eaten. Oh what ingenuity! One trembles to think what repulsive imagery Roth has concocted for that cakewalk.",Cabin Fever
98,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Nothing special,5,18 June 2008,"A sneaky and surprisingly smart horror flick, Cabin Fever sets up all the clichés of its particular sub genre (what might be called the ""sexy young people go into the woods"" horror movie, featuring hostile redneck locals, dead animals on hooks, cars that suddenly stop running, etc.) and by the end has played a clever twist on every standard element, often to darkly comic effect. What's the plot? Well, five sexy young people (Rider Strong, Jordan Ladd, Joey Kern, Cerina Vincent, and James DeBello) go to an isolated cabin where they contract a nasty bacteria that eats their flesh; this, combined with a bad-tempered dog and a party-loving police deputy (Giuseppe Andrews, giving a particularly funny performance), leads everyone into confusion and bloody chaos.

He asks for help but Bert leaves him. Later that night he shows up at the cabin and the five selfish idiots panic and end up lighting him on fire and killing him. He falls into the nearby lake and the water supply is infected. Karen (Ladd) is the first infected and the others lock her outside in a tool shed leaving her to die. All though we see the characters easily walk to near by cabins through out the film theses idiots can't seem to find away to escape the cabin and they soon become infected. This is the debut film from Writer / Director Eli Roth a self proclaimed horror fan who struggled for years to get this first feature made. Too bad this film with potential is as bad as it is. We could care less about these fully obnoxious characters and Roth himself has an annoying cameo scene as well. The flesh eating virus makes for some nice gore moments but there isn't one true scare in the film. Amazingly, the film has zero atmosphere either. With a creepy cabin set deep in the woods, it would seem Roth would just have to turn on the camera and you would get atmosphere but there is none. The cast is good but they're characters flat out suck. The movie takes a bunch of stupid turns along the way including the entire conclusion. What could have been a great bloody chiller turns into tedium in the hands of Roth.

101,Thrashman88,"Good, old time horror flick",7,8 November 2005,"CABIN FEVER does not break new ground. Having said that, the same applies to most of the movies that have been released so far this year (2005). CABIN FEVER is a surprisingly entertaining little horror flick, written and directed by horror aficionado Eli Roth. It's the story of a group of teens who decide to have a weekend party at some old cabin in the woods of North Caroline. OK, so the premise is nothing new and neither are all subsequent events, but one thing is sure: CABIN FEVER entertains! And that's what movies are for: entertainment. Well, these kids in the woods find themselves victims of some unidentified skin virus and thus puts them in awkward situations; like isolating one of themselves in order prevent the virus from spreading and infecting the rest of the teens. Shades of movies like Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, EVIL DEAD, DAWN OF THE DEAD and Friday THE 13th are all present in CABIN FEVER and I see this movie more like a tribute to all those slasher/splatter films of the late 70's and early 80's, when really gross films actually played out in theaters. Sure, there are a lot of plot holes and unresolved answers in CABIN FEVER. There's one scene where a trio of locals plan to kill the infected teens and one of them is carrying a little box in his hands. I mean, if you're gonna take someone out, shouldn't you also carry a gun??? We never know what this guy's carrying. We also never know where the virus came from; we only know that a dog dies from this virus and infects his owner, early on in the movie. There were little things in the movie that could have been turned into interesting plot twists, but Eli Roth keeps it raw ands simple and without any fancy plot twists.

The storyline is very common, still one can do a lot with it. But Eli Roth blew that chance by horrible script. The screenplay is so bad it becomes hilarious when combined with the gory scenes the movie contains. And for gore, well, it is abundant, but in wrong places. For example I expected much more gore in the leg-shaving scene.OK, jokes aside, I am fairly disappointed. B-grade horror movies always have their special places for a viewer, if made well.

If you don't understand the horror parameters, this movie may fly under your radar, but a seasoned horror fan will appreciate everything in this film. A nod to B-Grade horror movies like The Evil Dead, Cabin Fever is surprisingly original and fun to watch.

For the most part the movie was a well made horror film that tells the story of five college friends on vacation at a remote mountain cabin when one of them contacts a flesh-eating virus. The movie is a somewhat realistic look at how people would react to such a situation. The movie stars Rider Strong (from Boy Meets World), Jordan Ladd (Broken Lizard Club Dread), Cierina Vincent (whose ""spolier"" featured in two steamy sex scenes one of which is good and another is okay at first then it gets weird. For those of you who have seen it. You know what I mean), James DeBello (from Detriot Rock City), Joey Kern, and the rest of the cast of unknowns are believable in their roles. I didn't really like the ending which could've been better and the dialogue wasn't the greatest at times but overall Cabin Fever is an effective horror thriller better than others that have come out recently from writer/director Eli Roth the man behind Hostel and Hostel Part 2 which at least to me weren't as good as this one.

I put-off watching this for a while because it didn't look promising, but let me tell you, this film is so damn stupid that when it was all over I just found myself starring at the screen in awe. How could this have been made?Problems start with the script, which is brainless in the most extreme meaning of the word. The characters are so stupid, their actions so dumb, cliché's are plentiful, and the hillbilly endingwhat was that? How Eli Roth managed to get the film made is truly beyond me.Acting ranges from just plain good (Strong and Ladd stood out) to overdone (DeBello) to just plain bad (Andrews). Everyone involved must have wanted money really, really desperately. Hopefully they have all since fired their agents. The music was also annoying and out of place. A moodier, more atmospheric score maybe would have made the film at least a little effective, but the score the makers decided to use instead consist mostly of annoying pop songs.If there are any real merits here are the gore effects, from the always reliable KNB effects group, who have done a bang-up job here (the laughable Deer scene not withstanding). There's virtually no CG effects here, thankfully, and the old-school effects were the only thing that had me watching in the end.

108,mistoppi,Is everyone in horror movies an idiot?,5,25 April 2016,"I rented this movie today mostly because I loved Hostel movies directed and written by Eli Roth. I thought it would be interesting to see his earlier stuff. But funnily enough the most interesting thing about the whole thing is that it's listed as both ""comedy"" and ""horror"". Watching the film I had no idea it was supposed to be a comedy as well. Sure, it's slightly absurd, but not so much I'd see right away that it's comedy. There are jokes there, of course, but there are in several horror films, and they aren't automatically comedies. Well, you can always learn more about movies...The music in this film is completely unnerving. The soundtrack of this film is magnificent, and a good score always gives a horror film something extra. There are genres where it doesn't matter so much, but in horror it's surprisingly important. It keeps you on your toes. And even the lack of soundtrack is extremely effective in horror movies. But in Cabin Fever there is a soundtrack, and it works.The thing about Cabin Fever is that there's no serial killer hunting the young characters. The ""bad guy"" of the film is a disease. And what's the thing about that? You can't outsmart it. But still, the characters are idiots. That is of course a typical trope in horror, but sometimes someone does something so obvious you want to punch them. Someone is infected and you decide go touch them? Yeah that's definitely a great idea!Cabin Fever is thrilling, yet there's something about it that makes it slightly annoying.

110,RockPortReview,"A sick, twisted cabin in the woods horror movie",9,3 January 2010,"Cabin Fever 12/6/2009This film is the directorial debut for Eli Roth. Eli is a Boston native and horror fan boy at heart. Cabin Fever takes on several parts of well known horror films and put his out ideas and twists on them. This is a creepy cabin in the woods movie like Evil Dead. It's a mysterious virus movie like The Thing. Then throw in some crazy back woods rednecks like Deliverance. Cabin Fever is disturbingly authentic in the fact that this could actually happen. Eli got the idea from a real life experience, when he got a flesh eating bacteria at an Icelandic horse farm.Cabin Fever starts out like many recognizable horror flicks. A group of young people headed into the woods to a cabin for a weekend of partying. The main characters are Paul and Karen played by Rider Strong and Jordan Ladd. They have been ""friends"" forever, while Paul is always pushing for closer relationship. Bert is the not to bright football player like character played by James DeBello. Then there is the yuppie douche bag couple. The blonde haired Ivy League style jerks always get butchered and for good reason. The look of the film is set in the early to mid 1980's, so that rules out any cell phone usage. We don't ever learn the origins of the virus, although we do see a dead dog that infects a local hermit. Bert accidentally shoots and wounds the hermit while hunting for squirrels. That night the man comes to the cabin pleading for help. He is a horrible bloody mess who after puking infected blood all over their truck, is set on fire by the guys. The girls are upset by this and it creates a great deal of tension and dissension in the group. Paul finds the decomposing body floating in a lake. The virus has now infected the water supply for the whole town.Winston Olsen is a young sheriff deputy and quite the strange character. He is bored to death with his job and just likes to party with all the vacationers. Even when the story gets extremely gory he is only worried that that party is ruined. Another very unique character is Dennis, played by Matthew Helms. He sits on a swing in the front of the town general store. Don't get to close to him though because he bites, as Paul finds out. He is also known as the ""Pancakes"" boy who has a black belt in karate. Yes I know that sounds a little strange but you really have to see the movie.One of the most disturbing scenes in the movie is when Karen who hasn't been feeling well, lets Paul comfort her while she's napping. Paul moves his hand below her waist and you could say he has bad aim. He finds out that he is fingering a large flesh wound in her thigh. She is infected. Karen is then ostracized and quarantined from the others. She is locked in a shed with a grungy mattress and a blanket and then served food like a prisoner. The characters are now only interested in their own survival. Even though this movie was made in 1999, the main story line and the characters reactions to it seem to match today's fears of the swine flu and global flu pandemics. They all eventually get this virus and deal with it in their own separate ways. The leg shaving scene is quite possibly the most cringe inducing scene ever filmed. While the blonde guy take two six packs of beer and runs into the woods. If you look at the beer closely it's called ""Arrogant Bastard Beer"". He does how ever get his comeuppance for abandoning his friends. In one of the movies final scenes he is killed in a very similar fashion to that of the classic zombie flick ""Night of the Living Dead"" The last scene shows a semi truck full of tainted bottled water leaving the small town. There is a sequel, Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever which is directed by Ti West. It is currently showing at various film festivals around the country and is not yet out on DVD. Eli Roth had no part in the filming or production. So see it at your own risk.",Cabin Fever
111,JaydoDre,If you go unbiased into this film it's not that bad,6,26 March 2013,"This is a teen horror movie so the only rule it has to follow is that everybody gets killed off, one or two at a time, by a scary monster.The scary monster is given away in the title of the movie - it's a bacteria/virus. That was the first thing that was impressive, no matter how small. It always has to be about monsters, serial killers and other physical peekaboos. A teen horror flick with a virus is welcome change.The group of teenagers brought in for the slaughter is a group of not very likable city college students coming over to a strange small local community. They behave erratically and panic when under pressure. This unlikability and reactionary behavior makes them realistic, even though the specific actions of those characters are not.There is not that much happening in the movie and it could have done much more with the idea than it did, but the movie did creep me out - something a lot of horror movies fail to do.",Cabin Fever

115,lotus_chief,Movies don't get much worse than this.....,1,15 September 2003,"**SPOILERS BELOW!!!**Cabin Fever has my nod for WORST film of the year...that I've seen that is. This movie is straight GARBAGE!  There is so much wrong with the film you can't help but be amazed at how bad it really is.  This movie had so much potential to be good, but ultimately made nothing of it.  The characters were as dumb as one can be; for the entire movie you're just asking yourself ""why would you do that?"" or ""what's your point in doing this?""...this is how illogical and stupid the characters are.  We get NO background into them, so naturally you really don't give a rats as$ about their fate...you could only laugh at their stupidity.  The 'slut' (Marcy) for instance... was she that horny that she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)?  There was no point in that....its almost as if the filmmakers needed a excuse to give her the virus so voila!  UGH. 
Would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the faucet of a cabin WITHOUT looking at it first?Why didn't Bert just shoot the sick guy from the start?  Movie would've been over that way....besides, they ended up killing him anyway.Why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin, even if they had to walk?  'No, I'll just wait until 2 of my friends are infected (one a blink away from death) to finally opt to walk outta there.What was exactly the reasoning behind Paul's attempt to fish out the body of the Hermit, only to fall in the contaminated reservoir and get infected with the virus?  Pure STUPIDITY!I swear, common sense was not a friend, much less an aquaintance to these idiots.  I don't think there has ever been a worse ending to a movie.  In the beginning the kids ask the hick store cashier what the rifle was for, and he replied that 'its for the niggers'.  In the end of the film, 3 young Blacks (dressed in baggy clothes, one of them in a du-rag no less) go into the store....come to find out that the cashier was cleaning it for them to be used for hunting.  THEN, he proceeds to give them all pounds and handshakes and joke around with them as if they're his homeboys.Okay, WHAT THE HELL WAS THE POINT OF THAT?!?!?!?  How tasteless can one be, what were the filmmakers THINKING putting that in the movie?  I as a Black man was of course offended by the initial 'Nigger' comment.  It was a tasteless, pointless remark.  My question to the filmmakers: what was the point of the ending with the Black kids?  Was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier?  To smooth things over with Black viewers, by making a joke out of it?  Well, I for one, did NOT find that pathetic attempt at humor funny in the least bit.  The whole movie was a joke....a PATHETIC attempt at filmmaking that shouldn't be given the time of day.  Peter Jackson really thought this film was that good?  What film was HE looking at?  ZERO * out of **** stars....if I could give it a lower rating I would. Please, fellow IMDb'ers, don't waste 1 1/2 hours of your precious life watching this abomination of a 'movie'.  This is one of the worst movies I've EVER seen.",Cabin Fever

117,LanceBrave,"If she has contacted a flesh eating virus, locking her in a shed is not advisable.",7,7 November 2013,"Most of my movie-watching time is spent taking in new films. New releases, older stuff I'm just seeing for the first time, so on. That's one of the reasons why I enjoy Halloween so much. It's a time for me to revisit stuff I haven't seen in a while. Sometimes that's like visiting old friends. Other times that means reassessing my opinion on films I haven't seen a while. Thus: ""Cabin Fever."" I loved it when I first saw it in the theaters and I don't think I've seen it since then. With the possible exception of Rob Zombie, Eli Roth is the most divisive filmmaker to come out of the horror wave of the last decade. The tide of controversy his ""Hostel"" films ignited easily overshadowed his first feature.Roth's biggest problem is evident through all of his movies. The dude can not write genuine, likable characters. At best, they come off as simple sketches. At worst, they are intensely unpleasant jerks. Case in point: In ""Cabin Fever,"" characters are separated into two types. Rider Strong and Jordan Ladd are the main characters, defined solely by their relationship to each other. Strong's Paul is trying to transfer from childhood friend to serious romantic partner to Ladd's Karen. That's pretty much it. Their personalities otherwise morph in accordance to the story's whims. The rest of the main cast is obnoxious, deeply unlikable cartoon characters. Joey Kern's Jeff spews homophobic dialogue, does senseless things like shop-lift or shoot animals, and never lets the audience forget for a minute he's a jockish bonehead. As bad as Jeff is, James DeBello's Bert is even worse. An opportunistic lout who doesn't seem capable of caring for another person. He spends most of his screen time screaming profanity at his friends, begging the question of why he is on this trip with these people. Despite being a massive tool, the guy has an absurdly hot girlfriend in the shape of Cerina Vincent's Marcy.Marcy best exemplifies the movie's biggest issue. The characters lack any common sense. They made wildly bad decision for no particular reason. If you accidentally shoot a guy, you take him to the hospital and apologize profusely. If a sick person comes to your door, call 9/11. Do not attempt to beat him to death with bats and crowbars. (And stop taking swings if you're destroying your only mode of transportation.) Most definitely do not set him on fire. If a friend has contacted an aggressive flesh eating virus, locking her in a shed is not advisable. Marcy's only defining characteristic is her overwhelming sluttiness. When it becomes obvious she has the virus, she decides random, enthusiastic fornication is the only course of action. I know Cerina Vincent is really hot but, if she's infected with a vicious skin-eating disease, decline her sexual advances. It won't end well. And, hey, what's a natural thing to do when a horrible virus is drilling through your layers of dermis? ""Shave your legs"" is not an appropriate answer. If you see a dead body floating in a reservoir, do not climb down a rickety ladder just to poke it with a stick. Writing characters who are intentionally dumb is one thing. Having your characters do things that no human being would ever do is an entirely different faux-pas. Even the otherwise sensible humans make astonishing bad decisions.Roth's strengths as a writer and director is his surreal sense of humor and an ability of craft sickening horror set-pieces. And that's why ""Cabin Fever"" is worth checking out at all. The local redneck characters are bizarre enough to be humorous. Which do you prefer, the blonde hair kid who screams about pancakes and does inexplicable karate moves? The local deputy who highly moans about ""parties,"" in the face of all sanity? How about the kindly, folksy shop owners who engages in unexpected racist dialogue? (A gag that has a hilarious pay-off at the end.) Even Roth's aggravating cameo gets a laugh or two. Later on, the harmonica man and a resilient deer appear, to choruses of laughter. As for the horror sequences, some of them are gleefully nasty, like the Bowling Alley Massacre or Strong turning on the trio of invading rednecks, the result of a man weaned on seventies/eighties sleaze-exploitation horror films. Others are body-horror worthy of Cronenberg, like the snap of an ankle or red marks trailing down a back.Angelo Badalamenti's score is unnerving and gets under your skin in the same way the movie's disease does. Roth's direction is stylish enough. I'm not sure if his horror-nerd homages are endearing or annoying. All the songs on the soundtrack are from ""The Last House on the Left."" In any other movie, a lingering shot on your actress' plump butt would be just that. In a Roth film, it becomes a callback to ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" or ""Friday the 13th Part II."" A screwdriver in the ear? ""Dawn of the Dead."" Vomiting on somebody? ""The Fly."" The movie even has the Batcave putting in a cameo. Not to mention the entire premise owes a considerably amount to ""The Evil Dead."" Roth's homophobic dialogue is as tin-earred and hard-to-swallow here as it is in ""Hostel."" Talking about a dog sticking its nose up your anus isn't helping your case, Eli.Still, the parts are greater then the whole. ""Cabin Fever"" is worth sticking around through for the wacky or sickening moments, even if Roth's flaws as a writer are all too apparent. The ""Thanksgiving"" trailer is still the best thing he has ever done.",Cabin Fever
118,Ronin47,"Nice try, but no cigar (**)",5,19 October 2003,"Ah, damn. I really wanted this movie to be awesome. I've loved horror films my whole life, and ""Cabin Fever"" is being marketed as a return to the raw, low budget, deep-in-the-woods horror films like some of my favorites. And yes, those films, like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The Evil Dead"", and especially ""Night Of The Living Dead"" are constantly referenced and ripped-off (which I wouldn't mind if it was any good), but ""Cabin Fever"" itself, which should be able to stand up on its own...sorta sucks. The basic idea is a GREAT one. 5 mostly annoying college students rent a cabin in the woods to party for a week. That's interrupted on the first night by a drifter who stumbles up to their cabin. The drifter has some sort of flesh-eating virus that has already turned his skin into a bloody mess. Scared of contagion, the kids threaten him until he runs away, but not before he vomits blood all over their truck. Before long, one of their own, Karen (Jordan Ladd) begins to show signs of infection, so they lock her in a shed. Unfortunately, she's the only character who is sort of likable, so we're left with a bunch of jerks for most of the rest of the movie. The movie's main problem, and it's the one that kills it, is of tone. One minute it's a straight-up horror movie, then it's a stupid (and I mean STUPID) comedy. After a while we don't know whether we're supposed to go ""Ahh!"" or ""Haha!"" when the bodies start dropping, and as a result, do neither. Horror and comedy can mix quite well, but since the comedy here sucks, it keeps killing the mood and by the end has completely ruined it.
The horror elements are strong. There are some extremely unsettling ideas here, most notably the girl left in the shed to rot (literally), who is in much worse shape every time they go check on her. Wait til you see her in her final state. But every time it gets good, the ""comedy"" comes in and ruins it all over again. This movie honestly hurts me, because there is so much potential for a great, gory backwoods horror movie here. Director and co-writer Eli Roth obviously has good taste in horror movies, but he dropped the ball in a major way.",Cabin Fever

120,jrfranklin01,Gore Galore,5,31 May 2004,"Apart from the rest of the recent cheap horror movies, this movie is loaded with shocking gore and scenes so gross and at times nightmarish that if nothing else, you will remember it for some time to come.Cabin Fever has your basic plot (like that of Friday the 13th) where a bunch of teenagers decide to go to some remote location for a camping trip.  But the killer in this film is a flesh-eating disease that rots away at your body at an accelerated rate.  What's worse is that once the disease enters the bloodstream you're...yep, a goner!  And the death is slow, painless, and pretty much ruins your chances of getting a date on a Friday night.Five hapless individuals start out having the time of their youthful lives, living it up with the stereotypical sex, drugs, and rock-and- roll.  Soon after, they encounter a local man who is infected with the strange disease. The forester is somewhat delusional having been in the woods rotting away. He tries to seek help from the kids but their fear of him and the unknown that is eating away at him scare them.  In a panic they end up setting the stranger on fire.  What they fail to realize is that his dead body ends up floating in the nearby lake, infecting the small town's water supply. Anybody thirsty?  Well, of course, one of them ends up drinking the water. The remaining members go nuts over how the disease was contracted and they each begin turning on one another in a ""every man for himself"" philosophy. To add to the dire straits, their vehicle is out of commission so that they can't go for help.  As they try to repair it, time slowly ticks by.  One of them sits in a locked shed (sequestered from the others) slowly decomposing from the outside.  The rest of them are...well...standoffish to put it mildly.The ridiculous which is already somewhat present, enters in full when some of the villagers go after the teenagers to kill them before they contaminate the whole town.  The gore and shock levels then go up to a twelve on a ten-point scale with unforgettable scenes like the sleeping sick girl, the Listerine disinfecting (guys I know you'll cringe in pain), and the bathtub shaving scene (girls, this will make you feel different when shaving).This movie stands apart from the rest in disgustingly creative shock treatment with a killer that you can't see - a disease.

122,Condemned-Soul,The dialogue and characterisation is embarrassingly bad,3,16 March 2020,"The only positive for 'Cabin Fever' is that it boasts a decent premise. But lets be honest, anyone can come up with a good premise. What's particularly challenging, is writing a script that contains such bad dialogue that you can't recognise your fatal inability to script. It serves a warning for anyone getting into the film industry: if this is the best you can muster, do everyone a favour and pick a different career. Eli Roth and his co-writer (not even worth remembering his name) manage to create a horror film that is horrifying in all the wrong ways.The story is about a group of friends staying at a cabin in the woods who fall victim to a flesh-eating virus. Unfortunately, the characterisation and dialogue is so painfully immature and inept, that you don't care what happens to them. In fact, they are so unlikable in their own way - racist, cheats, or thieves to name a few - that they deserve to suffer. One by one they contract this nasty disease, and the decision-making becomes more implausible and excruciating as the film goes on.Pointless sex scenes, nonsensical homicidal streaks, stupid police enforcement, a random retarded kid who likes to bite ... it's all here ready to further antagonise any rational audience member. Even the gore effects are tame, with little creativity gone into the flesh-melting possibilities. All of this makes for an experience that has no entertainment value; the camera work is adequate, but everything else varies from problematic to downright abysmal. Like the virus, this is a horror film best avoided.3/10",Cabin Fever

My first initial reaction after leaving it the first time was extremely mediocre. I felt it was completely innovative and clever.  The acting was good, the spfx gory, the story decent and the direction a little off kiltered.  I'm probably one of the biggest horror fans you'll ever meet! So my expectations were pretty high and although I felt the film delivered on many levels.  I loved the homages to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Mother's Day, Last house on the left, Night of the living Dead, Evil Dead and etc. And the film is definatly a powerhouse for people who have seen these movies. But what the film truly lacked was entertainment value. It was truly an unpleasent film filled with nasty things.  Not very entertaining at all.  However, on second viewing after seeing it with an audience my opinion has changed. It's an audience movie, something cultish to be shown at midnight with a bunch of people that know the film scene for scene.  The auidence had a ball with this film, there was screaming and laughing.  And groans of disgust as they showed the nasty and believable fx(especially the leg shaving scene). So my opinion changed and I found it quite entertaining. Sure it's a sick movie but it definatly gets a great reaction from the audience and thats the way it should be seen.  The film may not be top of the line but the director and creator of this pic Eli Roth has big time flair.  I eagerly await his next and more finely tuned offerings. 7/10 -Don't miss out see it in the theatres",Cabin Fever

Most of the action is fairly believable, most of the secondary characters are totally over the top but also in a sort of believable way.The bad: The plot. We never learn the source of this bacteria, and the movie doesn't really have any ending as far as the spread of the disease.

When I first heard of Cabin Fever, I was foaming at the mouth. I had read nothing but praise for it, and was just dying to see what Eli Roth had committed to film. I read all the flack about ""...return to 70s"" and interviews with Eli about what he was trying to accomplish. I thought, ""Thank God, someone has come along with enough love for the genre that he could possibly resurrect from the stream of crap that it has become. All this just made me want to see it even more. When the day finally came, I was there, in the theater waiting with glee, wishing there were some way that I could hit the fast-forward button and skip through the trailers. I was a little nervous. Had I built it up too much? Had I set myself up for a big let down? No and no. ""Cabin Fever"" was even better than I had anticipated. My (then) girlfriend was repulsed and furious that we hadn't gone to see ""Matchstick Men"" instead. Me, being the selfish jerk that I am, found myself in the theater again, the very next weekend for a second viewing. I couldn't get enough. I was completely hooked.Why am I so obsessed with this movie? Well, I'm not exactly sure why. Maybe a shrink could figure it out, but I can tell you what I LOVED about this movie: First would be the characters. I loved every single one of these guys and gals and was with them all the way. For one, they were all REAL, not some cookie-cutter stereotypes that we're so used to seeing. These are real, flawed human beings. Ryder Strong did great as Paul and Joey Kern was very good as Jeff. He's the one that you love to hate. Cerina Vincent was wonderful as Marcy and Jordan Ladd was good as Karen. My personal favorite (aside from Deputy Winston) was Bert, played with great energy by James Debello. Yeah, he's the ""comedy relief"" and all and he's supposed to be annoying, but I love his carefree attitude and his laugh had me laughing. His squirrel shooting antics were hilarious and I still laugh when I think about the Snickers bar. Many have complained about Deputy Winston (Giuseppe Andrews) showing up midway through the movie and supposedly ""wrecking everything"". To me, these were some of the comic highlights and he gets most of the best lines in the movie. Just the idea of a party-hard Deputy puts a big smile on my face and his reaction to the truck still gets me. In fact, his reaction to anything odd gets to me.I love the look of the movie. I guess it's supposed to be Spring, since they're on Spring Break vacation, but to me, it looked like Fall. Whether this is a goof or not, I don't really care. It gave the film a great look. I loved the set-design of the cabin. That cabin is a character in itself. Next time you watch it, pay close attention to the detail.The pacing: I love it. The first half is relatively tame and plays more like a comedy. You meet the characters, spend time with them as they party and do their thing, and begin to feel sorry for them because you know all is about to be ruined. I especially loved the campfire tale about the bowling alley. Classic indeed. Once things finally kick into gear, the last third moves at a breakneck pace. THAT was great directing and as for the ending, well, (notice how I'm avoiding spoilers for those who haven't seen it) I really hope that Eli gets it in him to do a sequel because I want it to continue.In short, I love this movie so much it's downright scary. I don't know for sure how many times I've seen it over the last years and there's no telling how many times I'll watch it for years to come. Clichéd as it may sound, this is by a horror fan FOR horror fans. Easily in my top 5. HIGHLY Recommended",Cabin Fever
127,w00f,A Good Effort in the New Paranoia (possible spoilers),7,13 September 2003,"While not a perfect movie by any means, Cabin Fever succeeds in  creating an atmosphere of suspense at appropriate times while not becoming entirely dependent on gore and violence to get there.  The acting was passable and the story was well-told, with enough specifics left to the imagination to allow the audience to fill in the blanks with their own imagination -- a trademark of a successfully executed horror/suspense film.  The pacing is excellent; there are enough tongue-in-cheek moments and nods to the films which influenced it (including Cujo, Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead, and Friday the 13th) to let the audience catch their breath before they start waiting for the next crescendo.  Each of the main characters has their own story and their own moment of climax throughout the film, giving the whole enough energy to reach a conclusion that makes it obvious that there WILL be a sequel.  A few factors make this a foregone conclusion:* One of the main characters survives* What's in the box?  Hint:  The director is already at work on a film with the working title ""The Box.""* A truck full of the local water pulls out of town in the film's last scene.This film is part of a new genre.  In the 1950's and 1960's, the main source of paranoia was the USSR and nuclear weapons.  During the height of the Cold War, there were a long series of films about atomic mutants, creatures awakened by the bomb (e.g. Godzilla), and the world ending in nuclear war (On the Beach, for instance).  In today's new paranoia, the focus is on biological weapons, and hence we are seeing a new series of films that play to that fear.  ""28 Days Later..."" and ""Cabin Fever"" are excellent examples of this, and we can expect to see many more films of this sort coming at us in rapid succession over the next few years.All in all, ""Cabin Fever"" is worth seeing.  There's enough here to keep those who aren't going to faint at the sight of blood entertained.  It's not a great film, but it's definitely not a bad one.",Cabin Fever

The movie should not be taken too seriously, it is a fun film, and it looks as though the cast are all enjoying themselves. The five main actors - Rider Strong, Jordan Ladd, Cerina Vincent, James DeBello and Joey Kern - are all great, particularly Strong and Ladd. The premise of the film is nothing new for a horror and blends the hillbilly outback of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" with the cabins of ""Friday the 13th"", and a deadly virus liken to ""Monkey Shine"".

The story revolves around five teenagers who go to a remote cabin in the woods to spend a week of shooting squirrels, having sex and drinking, but instead end up with a flesh-eating virus.The plot naturally enough gives plenty of opportunity for gruesome special effects, which are good for the most part, and despite being riddled with implausibilities and some frankly ridiculous scenes, the film remains for the most part both suspenseful and fun. The teenagers are mostly adequate enough, but they are not really particularly likable or interesting enough to care for.Fans of ""splatter"" horror films will probably enjoy this.",Cabin Fever
130,McQualude,"This isn't a documentary, let's see some gore.",6,31 October 2003,"Cabin Fever should serve as a warning to new film makers... don't try to be clever. If you are clever, it will show in your work; if you're not clever no amount of trying will compensate.The movie starts well and has a very good, very straightforward plot: college kids in a remote location that are infected by a flesh eating bacteria. They try to survive each other as they try to survive the bacteria. But we can't just stop there, we have to have sexual intrigue (an excuse for nudity), a killer dog and some mentally unstable town's people and they just don't mesh together.I would have liked some stronger effects from the bacteria. They get infected, they bleed some, they fall down, bleed some more and die. Whoopee. This isn't a documentary, let's see some gore.",Cabin Fever
131,Zombified_660,"If you like downbeat 70s/80s style splatter horror, this'll be for you",7,14 September 2005,"Cabin Fever starts pretty much as it means to go on. Within about five minutes of the fairly odd opening credit sequence, we've seen a dead dog covered in flies split in two. If this makes you think you're gonna hurl, grab some sick bags or just don't watch the movie at all, as it doesn't get any better.You see, seems there's a virus passing around the backwoods. Cue braindead teenagers piling into said backwoods for a bracing weekend of beer and nookie. As they do, in the States at least. One encounter with an infected local leads to the virus getting into their water supply, and the rest is fairly self-explanatory.It's nice (in a way) to see something as uncompromisingly nasty as Cabin Fever. In a similar fashion to Wrong Turn and The Toolbox Murders remake, Cabin Fever is unrepentantly un-PC and downbeat, and honestly all the better for it. Nobody in this movie gets off easy, good guys or bad guys, and to be honest, the teenagers are such vile self-serving pieces of work that it seems almost right that something bad should happen to them.That said, the movie is totally unbalanced. An attempt to inject some Evil Dead style slapstick comedy is pretty badly judged, and the less said about the almost Dude Where's My Car style dialogue the better. The main reason both are unwelcome is that without them, Cabin Fever would pack so much more punch. The failure for the elements of frat-boy comedy, doom-laden plotting and visceral gore sequences to ever mesh means that you'll come out wondering what the hell you just saw.Basically, Cabin Fever is a brave, violent addition to the horror genre, but not without it's flaws. On a final note, if you learn anything from this film let it be this: DON'T SET FIRE TO PEOPLE WHO TRY TO ASK YOU FOR HELP. THEY MIGHT BE INFECTED WITH A FLESH EATING SUPERVIRUS.",Cabin Fever

I was actually p***ed that i had seen it when it was finally over. There is an hour and a half i will never get back. This movie is so terrible and so full of plot holes that it looks like a Swiss Cheese. The kids make one idiotic choice after another and if they shared half a braincell between each other they would all survive. Do people actually think this is what people in that situation would do? And suddenly Rider Strong turns out to be a cold blooded killer. And what about the ending, how much did that suck??? I am so very glad that i borrowed this movie from a friend and that i didn't pay money to see it, because then i would probably kill myself.

133,drpakmanrains,Disappointing After Promising Start,7,26 August 2010,"As one who has been somewhat of a horror thriller fan for over a half century, I was surprised to see that a 2002 film had somehow totally escaped my attention, so I recently rented it on Netflix. It has been so thoroughly reviewed on this site I won't go into the plot itself. The early scenes got me interested and hopeful. I always enjoy when movies show a rural gas-station general store that has some strange people, as in ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" for example, or more recently, ""Population 436"", and the girlie looking Dennis certainly fit the stereo-type of strange or weird, with a sign warning people not to sit next to him, apparently with good reason. Then I heard a song by David Alexander Hess called ""Wait For The Rain"" which was written for the original ""Last House On The Left"" from 1973. Also the infected man with the flesh-eating disease was genuinely frightening. So I was hooked and hopeful I had overlooked a minor horror gem. I was wrong. As others have noted, the 5 teenagers (who look older than teenagers) have little resemblance to any college students I have known. More like itinerant construction workers on beer. Then too much time was devoted to their sexual appetites, slowing the pace somewhat, so the 90 minutes seemed much longer than that. Also it was hard to tell who was who, with a lot of unnecessary characters. The sequences often seemed confused and illogical. I think it had the potential to be a truly scary and rather original idea, but by the end it was a convoluted retread with some homages to better films. By the way, two other films about the water being a source of danger were 1986's ""The Curse"", with Wil Wheaton, and a slightly older minor indie ""Nightmare At Noon"" filmed in Moab, Utah. Neither were great films, but at least they were coherent, and I liked ""The Curse"" infinitely more than ""Cabin Fever"". Not as bad as some say, but not very good either, despite a promising beginning. Update: Repeated viewings have raised my opinion of this to about a 7 or 7.5.",Cabin Fever
134,jbartelone,Stupid College Kids/Stupider Adults+Poor Plot=Bad Movie!!!,2,25 January 2007,"The premise of Cabin Fever starts like it MIGHT have something to offer. A group of college teens after finals (in the fall?) goes to a resort cabin in the woods where one by one they are attacked by an unseen flesh eating virus.Unfortunately, the first paragraph is where any remote elements of film quality stop. Cabin Fever is little more than college kids looking for sex, booze, talking non-stop about nothing, and seeing how many F-bombs they can get into 1:40 minutes or however long this mess is.The kids act and react stupidly to everything around them. One of them for instance discovers that the skin virus has infected her legs, so what does she do? She keeps shaving her legs failing to take proper medical attention for her wounds. The scene is little more than a gross out. In another scene, Rider Strong from ""Boy Meets World"" gets bitten on the hand by some kid who only says ""Pancakes"" and likes to do karate kicks on those who sit next to him. If you can figure out the reason for why the ""Pancakes"" kid was included, I'd love to know. Anyway, Rider pets a wild dog and goes off to wash his bitten hand in a most likely contaminated creek. Another kid likes to drop F-bombs in reacting to everything around him and shoot squirrels. Why? Your guess is as good as mine!Rider Strong is the ONLY kid with any recognition in this movie. He tries to calm people down in-between the yelling and screaming and F*** Y**! bombs that people are throwing around. When the kids aren't yelling, they are having or talking about sex or talking nonsense to the other adult characters who are EVEN MORE (if that is possible)idiotic than the kids! The idiot cop with an IQ of 60 at best may be one of the WORST acting jobs I have ever seen in a movie. You talk about people not playing with a full deck, this dork doesn't even know how to find the cards! LOL! I was like, ""Will you PLEASE shut up already?!"" He makes the kid actors look like geniuses! The only part that I sort of liked was Rider's scary story (although gory) about the deranged bowling alley guy. In interviews, Rider said that he had a great deal of respect for director Eli Roth. But the problem is that Mr. Roth appears to be going for little more than shock and gore. There are far too many bad things about this movie for Mr. Roth to get any credit. I wish I could agree with Rider and find something likable about this movie. Maybe the fall scenery in the beginning? Actually, Rider Strong JUST saves this movie from being a 1! Hopefully, he was compensated for this junk!",Cabin Fever

Watching Cabin Fever is as watching those prior flicks with a bit millennium touch. The result is a scary and intense gore-fest.Cabin Fever told us about a bunch kids spend their weekend in a cabin deep in the wood. Little do they know, a deadly virus spread over the wood. When they realize that their life in danger, it's too late for them! The act for survive can be deadly it self.There's a lot horror movies lately, but most of them could easily watch with our own entire family (they aren't scary). In this case, I think the director is well managed the tension and did a good amount between scary and funny moments. Despite the cliché character and plot (it's the homage, right?), this is a good movie, even I can say that it is a restless movie. I must warn those whose have weak-hearted, this is not your cup of coffee and avoid it like the virus it self, before you burst your intestines out.

138,Phantasm01,Doesn't even warrant a 1 star rating!,1,14 May 2006,"Anyone who has read my review for Uwe Boll's ""Alone In The Dark"" will remember that I compared the unenviable task of sitting through that piece of human waste to having each and every hair on your arm pulled out. Well, take that analogy a step further with this irredeemable gutter trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth extracted without novacaine. Do that, and you'll have a general idea of what Eli Roth's ""Cabin Fever"" is all about.I never believed any one film was capable of topping the sheer agonizing dreck that Uwe Boll cranks out as the ""worst film ever made."" But, in all honesty, I have to say ""Cabin Fever"" comes very close. This is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theatrical release. For somebody who claims to love the horror genre as much as Eli Roth does, he has created the single most annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie I think I have ever seen in my entire life. How do you screw up a story like this? Think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters, without the bad writing, and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy. A movie dealing with a grotesque flesh-eating virus could and should have been so much better than what Roth dished out for us here. This script failed on so many levels with me. And, while I do not doubt the evident talent this director possesses, I do know that he fumbled the ball big time on an idea that could very well have redefined the horror genre.To say this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a gross play on words. A generous amount of blood and unsettling special effects can't even save it, and that is one element I normally go for. There really was nothing about ""Cabin Fever"" that I could easily recommend to anybody. When three quarters of the crowd walks out of the theater halfway through, you know the movie is sinking fast. My best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent before purchasing. One viewing was more than enough for me to know that I will most likely never bother with it again.",Cabin Fever

Is it because we're afraid they'll monopolize film?  Corrupt us? Desensitize us?I am sorely disappointed at the critical response to this film.  Most seem to be willing to denounce it as uneven, choppy, gory, and generally garbage. Even the positive reviews come up short, gleefully wallowing in the spectacle of this film's nastier scenes.Hey!  Did it ever occur to you folks that this film might actually have something to offer or *gasp* an intelligent message?This particular horror story has it all in spades.  Not since George Romero's Living Dead films have I seen a horror movie with such a strong sense of its social and political environment.  As a vision and critique of contemporary American society (with all its paranoia and not-quite-genuine altruism), this film outshines anything we've seen lately.  All you have to do is take a step back and examine what you think might be represented by the people at the general store.If that's too subtle for you (though I can't imagine how, given the karate sequence), don't despair.  There's even a conversation which likens the characters' plight to being on a crashing plane.  A crashing plane?  Hmm . .. . It also manages the rather neat trick of making us like its characters, despite their frequently deranged behavior. (with the possible exception of Jeff, but I'll let you make up your own mind).  Even the perpetual screw-up Bert manages to be somewhat endearing in his own way, if for no other reason than his apparent isolation from the rest of the human race.You're free to like or dislike this movie.

144,maxastree,Utter Crap derived from 80s straight-to-video horror,2,17 April 2015,"During the additional features option on the DVD of Cabin Fever, Eli Roth's (rich) Dad explains that Eli was ""destined to make horror movies"" because as a child he vomited during the gross-out scene in Ridley Scotts movie ""Alien"". Play that backwards, symbolically, and you get the impetus for every reason Eli Roth shouldn't make movies.This film is, really, bargain basement trash - almost like a 1987 straight-to-video slasher in so many ways; the young adults look like extras, or amateurs, complete with bland TV-hairstyling (in the remote wilderness, for some reason?), and the foul mouthed and generally unlikeable young adults get in trouble when a hideous disease, sort of a scabby, zombified necrotising fasciitis breaks out and starts turning the characters into gore covered corpses. The solution? There isn't one - the movie has a premise and no plot development whatsoever.Worse still, the film has a ""comic relief"" character thats supposedly a sleazy, sexist policeman, who IS weird, but ISN'T funny. Numerous scenes are dedicated to the pretty young female cast members appearing semi-naked or having chaste porn sex on screen, usually to be revealed later to be covered in massive, pus filled sores, their skin literally peeling off from a devastating virus.The worst, and I mean, easily the worst thing about this film is its use of ""uneasy racial humour""; a local redneck in Cabin Fever refers to some black kids as ""niggers"", which the city folk take as shockingly intolerable, but later on, its all, like ""hey, my niggaz, wassup??"" as if, supposedly, the redneck kook that fixes rifles at a small rural community store is so in with local black community that he affectionately calls them ""niggers"". In all honesty, a lot of viewers won't get to the end of the movie, so they won't see this quick turn around into a type of black comedy that betrays Eli Roth's inept sense of humour and poor taste as a filmmaker.Lastly, there is a bizarre, slow motion kung-fu segment featuring a disturbed hillbilly kid that feels, perhaps unintentionally, like a homage to Claudio Fragasso's Troll 2.Cabin Fever is utter crap, as I stated above, but ultimately, its very cheap filmmaking, meaning that its nominal profit margin will allow for sequels, same as the garbage 80s slasher movies that Eli Roth is ""paying tribute"" to. Essentially, this is a cheap 80s-style slasher without an actual bad guy in sight.",Cabin Fever

149,quridley,Influential and holds up okay,8,31 May 2017,"Bearing a shallow resemblance to Evil Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Cabin Fever is closer in style and tone to the Scream franchise. What elevates it is a younger taste in horror-comedy. The fratboy humor is dated and mostly flat, but the shocks are still disturbing and gross. Its not a scary film but it builds in tension and mood about halfway through. Eli Roth is a modest director who isn't great with actors or a shooting action, but he is a smart producer who hires a wonderful cinematographer and borrows the great Angelo Badalamenti from David Lynch. Roth was Lynch's assistant and also worked for Troma's Lloyd Kaufman. Borrowing more than a little from both directors is what made Roth look like a weirdo, sick genius to a generation, but he's really a clever ripoff artist like his future mentor Quentin Tarantino. Cabin Fever is well-produced and weird and somewhat fun, but under the surface its pretty dumb, thin on story and a pale imitation of much better movies.

151,Nigel St. Buggering,A thoroughly hateful waste of celluloid,2,23 January 2004,"Generally, I don't expect a great deal from horror films, particularly ones that begin with a group of college kids in a secluded cabin in the woods. Also, I'd heard some pretty harsh things about this one from various critics and Internet sites.  Consequently, I went in with very low expectations. Miraculously, it still managed to disappoint me.This is, quite simply, one of the most inept attempts at narrative it has ever been my misfortune to witness.  Throwing aside the concepts of plot logic, narrative progression, character development, or even making a point, Cabin Fever opts instead for an approach that can only be described as ""a bunch of stuff that happens"".  It is not enough that nothing happens for any readily discernible reason.  To compound its sins, the screenplay assumes that the audience is too monumentally stupid to grasp even the simplest plot points.  For instance, we're given a shot establishing that the water supply is contaminated.  Fine.  We are then treated to endless reminders, from close-ups of glasses, to shots of characters pouring and drinking the water, to eerie musical cues accompanying any appearance of water.  And if that isn't enough to get the point across, we are treated to a second sequence in which a character DISCOVERS the contamination.I'm certain that the entire genesis of this film lay in the mock-clever wordplay of the title.  Once you've heard the title, you've pretty much experienced what the film has to offer.  The rest is cheap gross-outs and pointless side-events that pop up at random, never coming to much of anything.The sad part is, there is potential in this basic idea.  Unfortunately, Eli Roth seems entirely uninterested in wondering how these character would actually deal with the situation.  Anytime it looks like they might have to begin to deal with their plight, he simply throws a vicious dog or a party of rampaging rednecks or another close-up of bloody sores into the mix, thus relieving himself of the responsibility of having to actually tell a story. And what in god's name is the ""pancakes"" kid about?Roth manages to compound the pointlessness of it all by ending the film with a throwaway joke concerning a racial epithet that should have payed off in the first act, then following it up by beating the audience over the head with more references to tainted water.I've seen many bad films, but only rarely have I spent the entire running time angered with the director.  A bad movie is just a bad movie.  Cabin Fever is a personal insult.",Cabin Fever
152,canadude,Much Better Than I Originally Thought,7,8 July 2004,"When I first saw ""Cabin Fever"" I did not like it, because it seemed unduly cruel and stark for me. No one has any empathy for anybody, the characters are exposed as selfish and, selfishly violent.The story is like any other typical teenage horror film: five kids finish college, head to woods and start dying because of deadly disease that makes them bleed out of every orifice in their body, while creating new ones. The plot sounds silly and when you watch it, the gore can be offputting. While the film is not very violent (few people actually get punched or killed), the effects of the chief enemy, the ambiguous disease are absolutely disgusting. And the film basks in it, mocking the amount of it - it remains detached, showing us cold outpouring of blood.Consider a scene in which one of the main characters finally grows the testicles to allow an old, blond and hot friend of his know how he feels. He does so by lying in bed with her as she rests her head from her headache and massages her neck, then breasts, then navel and then his hand travels into the darker nether-regions of the under-the-sheet-world. The girl gasps excitedly, even though an unsettling I'm-fingering-a-jar-of-peanut-butter sound can be heard in the background. Clearly something is not right. The hero, bright as he is, catches on quickly and his hand returns into daylight from its unlit encounter with the-object-of-its-lust's lower body. Except the return to daylight is anything but reassuring - the hand, soiled with blood and sticky flesh, shocks the hero. The sheets fly off (in what would have inevitably been the course of action anyway, though perhaps with a different result if the girl wasn't gasping excitedly from disease not from approaching orgasm) and lo, behold: a hole in her thigh.This is merely the beginning. The plot commences with scenes like this and ends with the collapse of benevolent human relations between these friends. The sick girl is isolated from the rest of the group who do not want to get sick. Soon, however, they do - otherwise there would be no horror. And they begin vomiting copious amounts of blood, all over their car mainly (something about that damn truck...) and each other, and the terror heightens.Now, by its end, the film has exposed the viewer to really unpleasant events, some involving road kill, some involving blood and gore, and some involving simple lack of human sympathy and a general indifference to the growing tragedy. This final element is particularly gruesome, because though these horrid things unravel, no one really seems to care about anything, but saving their own skin. Or partying like one notably strange character, who is also supposed to be the symbol of authority.By the end, few of the friends are friends and few people are alive. Having witnessed this strange evil character, an ambiguous, omnipresent disease swallow life up (metaphorically and literally) it's easy to be repulsed and disgusted. To feel unclean.However, when the movie ended and I had forgotten about it, it returned to me. Yeah, not one character was likable, not one course of action was honorable, and even the ending was a joke in poor taste. Still, the feeling of uncleanness is precisely what ""Cabin Fever"" is after. It's very successful at making the viewer uneasy and that's precisely what a good horror film should do. And the horror of ""Cabin Fever"" is not so much the disease that eats up all that it puts its germs on, but that a tragedy can so easily expose the darkness lurking in people, their truly repulsive disgusting nature. Nothing in ""Cabin Fever"" is as it appears - that is precisely its point. That's why an officer of the law constantly speaks of ""partying"" and ""crashing parties"" and that's why the lines at the end are a qualification of *apparently* negative nature of those same lines in the beginning. And, most importantly, those we love or consider friends suddenly become our enemies, attacking our well-being.""Cabin Fever"" is about the state of nature, where life is nasty, brutish and short. This is a place where no alliances are forged out of good will, where social institutions like hospitals and police are either useless or inimical in and of themselves, and where friends are friends until they stop being useful in safe sexual gratification. ""Cabin Fever"" is a scary film precisely because the gore is the context, while the way the characters react to it is its subject. It is about psychological de-humanization (though I don't want to give it too much credit - it is, after all, only a horror movie.)",Cabin Fever
153,weberpr,Cabin Fever,7,4 June 2005,"Mastermind horror genius new on the block Eli Roth director of Cabin Fever, A story of 5 college friends on break who decide to hire a cabin in the woods, when a flesh eating-virus is introduced into the group it's a fight between the friends and there will to survive. Rider Strong, ""Boy Meets World"" plays Paul, ""Joey Kern"" plays Jeff, ""James Debello"" plays Bert ""Jordan Ladd"" plays Karen and ""Cerina Vincent"" plays the sexy Marcy also with the funniest appearance from cartoon animator ""Giuseppe Andrews"" For a disgusting, violent and adult horror movie Cabin Fever was a masterpiece that's all I was expecting and that's what I got. Very entertaining with comic scenes but did not stray away from the struggle between this group of friends who basically destroy everything around them. Entertaining, believable storyline and special effects, Roth has the qualities of a true horror director. In Cabin Fever aspects of Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" Wes Craven's ""Scream"" and other flashes of Dawn of the Dead and Evil Dead and other horror classics are used just relating to horror fans I guess.

Gets infected by random virus, transfers it to kids at a camp, kids start to get infected and die, town finds out about it and rather than help them, kills them. then the water is infected and everyone dies. the end.Seriously, that's the whole movie.all the characters are completely retarded, you don't care for any of them, and the one kid should have stuck with boy meets world. Me and my friend found that talking about how fat and bitchy our one classmate was to be far more enjoyable than paying attention to this movie. We did manage to make it all the way to the end while screaming bulls$@t, because this film will make you do that.and i'm still confused by the random slow motion karate moves of the one random kid and how apparently everybody out in the country is completely retarded and hickish. And again, why did this dog attack the girl? why did the kid the hicks were trying to kill sit in a chair waiting for them to kill him? that was part of the two of their's plan? wow. best plan ever. i cannot believe this movie got a theatrical release. i could barely stomach the DVD, let alone have to sit in a theater not moving for an hour and a half.

162,Finntroll,Passable at best.,4,20 August 2004,"""Cabin Fever"" is an uneven mix of parody, horror and clumsy attempts at comedy which often falls short and it's probably best described as ""Evil Dead"" for the MTV-age. Well I may have loved ""Evil Dead"", but this is basically a pale imitation with a lot higher budget, added sex scenes and less spooky atmosphere. The story is OK, and it could have been a good movie but the unlikeable characters, mostly dumb attempts at humor and constant stupidity lowers the experience. It also goes completely over the top at the end and destroys it's chances of being regarded as a solid horror movie.The reason it's given 4 instead of 3 is solely for the weirdest case of death by suffocation I've seen and that sequence alone almost makes this movie worth watching.It still, despite all it's faults, manages to come across as reasonably entertaining if you watch it with a couple of friends and a case of beer.4/10",Cabin Fever

And I do not buy to ""check up on everyone, or get more beer""  Jeff was so hellbent on leaving, wouldnt he wander back into town and get a ride outta there?   In any case, hey, if you are gonna die, you might as well get some, that probably would happen.  The virus is pretty much an unknown quantity although they discover its source, but never its origin.

But its also not total dreck. In a perfect world it would be a thoroughly mediocre dark little movie with splashes of humor -- in the sad state of modern horror, its actually above average. The best thing it does is try to do the ""explore the darkness within"" thing, as the characters all react with degrees of selfishness to the flesh eating virus which is the ""monster"" here. The worst thing it does is get confused about whether its trying to be scary or funny, or a little of both. I suspect it was trying to emulate an Evil Dead type mix (the homage is fairly obvious), but it ends up striking a darker note than that. Nonetheless in a horror market flooded by a million cheap slasher ripoffs, and a million and one cheap Alien ripoffs, its nice to get something a little more insidious as a bad guy. And the movie does at times show a little bit of fearlessness long since departed from most major studio movies -- it will go for a random bit of over the top humor or a gross out effect just to keep things interesting.There is too much that is clichéd and not well thought out here to make this into any sort of classic, but when the uneven mix works, its better than most of the REAL dreck in the field. Perhaps more of a sad statement on the state of horror than a compliment for this movie, but you could do much much worse if you were going to rent a horror flick some Friday night. For people who don't have the stomach for it, or those looking for something more sophisticated, this is no doubt an icky ""1"" (I always wonder when people give that vote have they really seen the true dreck that is out there?).

Overall, it was pretty good. It had some good twists, and the gore wasn't unbearable. I still feel squeamish when watching the shaving scene. The effects were pretty solid. Also, the comedy was actually pretty funny. The final shot with the water being sent out was such a good addition. Makes you think of everyone else who'll get the virus.

168,TensersFloatingDisk,The 70's were bad the first time through...,4,30 March 2004,"What's up with the horror movie these days?  They seem to come in three flavors: 1.) the ""intelligent"" horror flick (""The Ring,"" ""Sixthe Sense"") which goes for creepy atmosphere and careful characterization. 2.) the poorly plotted, but brilliantly filmed ""technical"" horror perfected by the Dark Castle group with films like ""Th13teen Ghosts"" and ""Ghost Ship."" 3.) And then there's the most recent trend, the homage to the 70's.  Rob Zombie's ""House of 1000 corpses"" provides one cogent example, and this film another.  They have all the weak characterization, scenery-chewing acting, grainy film stock, over-the-top gore and inside jokes you could want from a 70's schlock-horror-fest.But why bother?Frankly, there's nothing to be gained here.  Writer/Director/Co-Star Eli Roth hits all the right notes, but it's strictly a karaoke performance. The cast of pretty-young-things go through a number of grisly death sequences, and they're clearly having fun doing so, but this ends up feeling more like a film-school effort than a professional movie.  If they were trying to recapture the operatic scope of an ""Alien"" or the creeping psychological ""gotcha"" of ""Diabolique,"" or even the old-school tension of a ""Psycho"" or something, they might at least be aiming for something worthwhile...but WHY would we want to recapture one of the poorest periods for Horror in Hollywood history?  Remake the ""Excorcist""?  Good luck, but you're welcome to try...but this film tries to remake ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" and that's frankly a much less worthy goal.

171,Teebs2,"Eli Roth: Saviour of Horror? Maybe, but not yet.",6,15 September 2004,"Eli Roth's Cabin Fever (2002) promises a return to the straight visceral horror films of the late 1970's and early 1980's after many years of diluted horror-comedies and the later ironic horror films such as Wes Craven's Scream trilogy. With recent re-makes of the 70's classics Dawn of the Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacre it seems that the horror film may be making a comeback to the mainstream. Now, I'm no fanatical gorehound, but I've seen my share of such films. Unfortunately, considering the articles in the film press proclaiming Roth as the 'new saviour of horror', I remain to be convinced by this claim. Having watched the extensive interview with Roth on the UK DVD plus one of his many commentaries Roth is obviously a devotee of this genre of cinema and knows his stuff inside out. The guy is obviously great at promoting and expressing his passion for horror and is a very entertaining person to listen to. Unfortunately I don't think Cabin Fever lives up to all the hype.The premise of the film is standard fare: Five college students celebrate their graduation with a week of partying in a remote forest cabin. They are infected by a flesh-eating virus which causes the students to isolate the first infected and soon causes the entire group to disintegrate into self-preservation. Unfortunately there's a major problem even in this basic premise and it's not the virus. The virus is actually a great idea, far easier to identify with and fear than any amount of Sumerian Demons or psychotic killers. No, the problem is with the people. Watching the film I was convinced that Roth had written the most annoying, obnoxious, least likable group of characters possible. I was shocked and amused when Roth mentions in the commentary that we are actually supposed to sympathies with these characters and good third of the film is devoted to establishing the group. So we have a complete numbskull who's idea of fun is shooting squirrels 'cos they're gay'. Then there are the two couples; Jeff, a self obsessed arrogant twit and Marcy, played by Cerina Vincent, clearly hired for both of her 'talents', neither of which are acting. Then there's the other two, Karen and 'Boy meets World'. She thinks they're great close friends, he wants to finally get in her pants. Fortunately Roth's sympathy for the characters only extends so far and a cruel sadism soon takes over, from the spread of the virus through to the arbitrary deaths and a Night of the Living Dead influenced downer ending. In terms of horror and gore the film is pretty tame, only the leg-shaving and fingering scenes really stand out. In fact the whole film is comprised of elements that have been seen before in countless films - from the Evil Dead cabin, the rednecks from Deliverance (although these guys are far too clean to be really threatening), the rabid dog from The Thing, blah blah blah . Although heralded as a straight-out horror flick, Roth has decided to add several doses of absurd humour, which are detrimental to the tone and pace of the film. A young stoner cop who likes to 'partee' is only funny once and a golden-mulleted, kick-boxing kid named Dennis is just bizarre, as is a gag involving a harmonica. Touches such as these along with severely un-likable characters diffuse the tension and suspense created by the main plot. Roth is often compared to early Sam Raimi in the press but Cabin Fever has none of the stylistic flair, imagination, and gore of Raimi's early films. I know this review sounds like I hated the film. I really didn't, it was decent enough entertainment when you're in the right mood. The music was particularly effective, always crucial in this genre. Given Roth's obvious passion and enthusiasm for the genre I was quite surprised and a little disappointed how distinctly average this film is. In spite of this, I'm sure this isn't the last we'll hear of Eli Roth - let's hope his next film is as entertaining as he is. Rate 6/10",Cabin Fever

It's almost a parody of horror movies from the '70s. Ignore the negative reviews that seem to consist mainly of people going along with other reviewers.

Ever since Resident Evil replaced zombies with crazed, decaying plague carriers in the horror film lexicon, I haven't been particularly pleased with the results. RE itself turned out to be just another video-game stinker, 28 Days Later was way too self-conscious to be scary, and so on. But now we have Cabin Fever, a film that remembers that the zombie sub-genre is about helplessness, moral quagmires, and visceral, gut-wrenching effects. (Well, OK, except when it's about Linnea Quigley dancing naked in a graveyard...)Cabin Fever strays further from the old zombie toolkit to further define this new batch of plague movies. In particular, it's the first to notice that carriers don't need to be homicidal to become objects of horror - the prospect of contagion is more than enough to transform a person into a monster in the eyes of others. The fact that, to the camera's eye, they are merely sick, frightened people who desperately want help adds a uniquely new disturbing tone to the proceedings.Like the Romero films that started it all, the message here is less about fear of disease than about ordinary people acting badly when threatened by crisis, and, like Romero, the message is occasionally delivered with a heavy hand (including one rather-too-overt reference to Night of the Living Dead).

It has more campy humor than most horror films, but that part doesn't work (see below). The best part of this movie are the excellent nude scenes featuring Cerina Vincent.A bunch of college students go to a mountain cabin to party, but find themselves in a region afflicted with some kind of hemorrhagic fever, like ebola. Once a person has the plague, everybody else is afraid to aid them, for fear of contagion. Thus, the friends all get to bickering when they could easily get help if they cooperated. On top of that, the locals are extremely (comically) inbred and hostile.The main trouble with this film is that you can't make a campy horror movie about a disease. There is a gruesome humor to over-the-top monsters and slashers, because they are too crazy and brutal to be anything but fiction. There isn't anything funny about a disease that makes you bleed to death. Sadly enough, this happens to people all over the world all of the time. It isn't exciting or suspenseful to wait for someone to perish from disease.

179,VenturousArtist,"""Not Very Infectious.""",5,19 December 2017,"Cabin Fever is a bloated corpse filled with various ideas and mistakes.The premise simply follows a group of college students partaking a vacation within the woodlands to unknowingly have contact with a biological virus. They're far from proper medical attention, or any safety in this regard, but this gives them and the film enough time to risk being greater. Unfortunately, the film doesn't properly risk enough when it constantly relies on weird humor, disjointed pacing, and middling storytelling with a severe identity crisis. Throughout the film's time introducing characters, and other strange subplots, audiences learn how limited they are by either not appearing enough, being disposable and tedious, or serving nothing special. However, aside its flaws, it's fairly tolerable when it finally descends into madness and less characters survive the premise's gruesome focus. It's not just an original idea ahead of its time, created at the wrong time, but one of its own kind that unfortunately couldn't become better if a reenactment followed its similar middling direction.It's a nasty virus film that's not very infectious as an actual viral infection.",Cabin Fever
180,PlutonicLove,Unmitigated crap,1,29 September 2003,"Why many horror fans and critics have embraced this unmitigated crap is beyond me. It's not even a real horror movie, for Pete's sake! It's a pointless excercise in pure randomness, lacking any purpose or objective, featuring idiotic characters making idiotic decisions, scenes that don't go anywhere (there's even a FADE OUT during an ACTION SCENE!), and - for no apparent reason - Dukes of Hazzard-type hillbilly stereotypes. Plot points and characters are introduced and abandoned recklessly, as is any attempt at continuity. The filmmakers' love for throwing erratic references to other (much better) horror movies in our faces is regrettably far stronger than their desire to tell a story. The result is aimless, arbitrary, and wanton.",Cabin Fever
181,bobwildhorror,"Unexpected, Creative Genre Outing",9,19 July 2008,"I'm not one of those people who consider Eli Roth a classic horror director. But I do feel that he's got talent and good imagination, something CABIN FEVER demonstrates effectively.This is an imaginative little film that never tries to be more than what it is: a B-Horror shot on a shoestring in the woods. But where many lesser filmmakers -- nearly every one who has tried to make a ""teens menaced in the woods"" feature -- follow the tried and true blueprint established by EVIL DEAD, Roth turns the tables. He imagines an environment where there isn't a serial killer/monster/demon lurking behind every tree, looking for an excuse to jump out. Where endless shots of running teen girls aren't intercut for jiggle effect.What Roth has created is a horror movie without an antagonist (which is the cleverest aspect of CABIN FEVER). The monsters here are all internal, the kids turning on each other in believable fashion when they're faced with a desperate situation.Don't be dissuaded by my review if you're a gorehound. There's plenty of blood and guts to be found. It's just not of the expected variety...And we horror fans have to look long and hard to find a movie that defies expectations!",Cabin Fever

I love slashers, thrillers, horrors, suspense, and comedy cabin fever has a little of it all. kids fresh out of college go up in the woods for some fun time and to go along with Psycho hillbillies, A canibalistic kid, a retarted party cop, and a stoner. they throw a drifter carrying possibly one of the most Fu**ed up desises you can have, decides to spit tons of blood all over the car and the yard thereby spreading a virus that eats Jordan Ladds' characters face off and drives rider strongs' character to murder. before that Paul (Rider) sets the hermit on fire then of course he's gonna look for water but he dives into the drinking water and officially infects everyone. but only paul dies from the virus because if you pay attention to the deaths. Bert gets his head blown off, Jeff gets shot to death, the hermit burns, Paul beats Karen to death, Mercy (After Shaving the skin off her legs,That part still makes me cringe,) is eaten by the stoner's(Directors Eli Roth) crazy dog. and paul does die from the virus but of course he falls into the reservoir thereby infecting hundreds of people. this movie is a thrilling rush of gore that will make your blood run cold. trust me i'm not exaggerating this is the absolute goriest movie i've ever seen it's not for the weak, but if you think your stomach can take it then check it out.",Cabin Fever
184,chanvat,Wrong Turn Meets the Black Plague...,6,6 April 2004,"Well first off I have to say that the first hour or so of the film is really slowwwwwwww, but the last half hour is one of the quickest I have seen in any recent horror film.The acting in this film is average, which is to be expected.  The majority of the characters are populated by lower rung actors, whose most notable previous appearances include the topless girl in Not Another Teen Movie (and SURPRISE she has no problem baring them again here) and the pothead in Super Troopers.I actually got a laugh out of a lot of the scenes in the film as they are very much in the campy horror venue.  The guy who wore the ""FU"" hat was basically a total idiot doing tons of stupid things throughout the film. Then there was the little kid who liked to bite people on the hand.  Of course there was also the requisite rednecks in the film who have this gag in the beginning which continues to the end (which has to been seen to be believed and I wont spoil it for you either).As for the movie being a genre buster, not really.  I liked the concept of using a plaque that doesnt actually turn you into a zombie, but just wastes you away into a bleeding skeletal mass.  The whole thing with the vicious dog I didnt really understand, I mean does he just zone in and kill those that are infected?  Didnt quite get that part.  The movie does have one surprise in that one character totally changes from a whimp into a badass beat em up killing machine once he contracts the virus (whereas all the other ones basically act the same).  The ending wasnt shocking at all, as in every horror film if you blatantly brag about surviving it means your doom within 45 seconds (and this film proves that point once again).  For those that remember Night of the Living Dead, the ending of the main characters (not the other WTF? ending) seems to rip that one off.All in all, this film garners a 6/10, better than Wrong Turn thats for certain, but nothing spectacular either.",Cabin Fever
185,R-P-McMurphy,"It Feels like any Proper Horror Film Should Feel, like a Roller Coaster Ride",8,2 August 2013,"I wasn't expecting much from a movie coming from Eli Roth, who I've only heard bad things about, but I ended up being surprised by how good this film actually was. Unlike ""Martyrs"", ""Cabin Fever"" knows how to show just the right amount of gore, no more and no less. It gives enough fun and likable characters to make it worth the watch, this feels like any proper horror film should feel, like a roller coaster ride.In this tale of survival, a group of five college graduates rent a cabin in the woods and begin to fall victim to a horrifying flesh-eating virus.Quentin Tarantino was right when he called Eli Roth ""The Future of Horror"" after seeing this film, but not in a good way. Every movie now tries to emulate what they did in this movie with bad results, a recent example of this is the remake of ""Evil Dead"". If only modern horror movies stopped taking themselves so seriously or maybe if they were a little more creative. Its not that they remake other films, its that they put so little effort in doing so. ""Black Swan"" is practically a remake of ""Carrie"" mixed with ""The Red Shoes"" but that movie is something of its own, it gives a twist on the story we already know and for that it's worth watching, if only more horror movies were as enjoyable as this one I'd probably be watching them all the time.If you haven't already seen it, I can't recommend it any more than I already have, reading the stories about it on wikipedia and IMDb just make the experience even better. Here's one little on-set story about Eli Roth and an actress that didn't want to show too much on-screen so they managed to reach a compromise - Cerina would bare one inch of her buttocks on camera, no more, no less. Eli Roth brought a ruler along to the filming and measured Cerina's buttocks, to be sure he got his one inch.Here's another cool story: Peter Jackson stopped production on ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" three times to screen this movie for the entire crew. Jackson was so enthusiastic about the film he gave director Eli Roth publicity quotes.I'd recommend this to anyone who liked ""Contagion"", zombie movies, ""White Dog"", ""Evil Dead"", ""The Cabin in the Woods"", ""An American Werewolf in London""",Cabin Fever

Utter Disappointment....,1,23 March 2004,"Cabin Fever was hyped to be something great and different for the usual muck that studio churn out every year in this genre. This was bad. Wait that was an understatement. Its horrendous. The horror was overused to the nth degree and the comic relief and humorous moments fell flat on its face. This seemed more like a shock the audience with as much red cellophane as you can rather than scare or an attempt at real horror. The line between when to laugh and when to be scared/horrified is extremely blurred. The acting well... what do you think? Terrible.

It's pretty dark on the surface and full of gore, but also has completely ridiculous moments which make it a parody of itself.

A lot of people seem to be harping about its over-the-top action and general silliness, apparently not realising that this is the point - Cabin Fever is a black comedy. Filled with great, quirky characters and an interesting streak of sadism, it's an expert subversion of the horror genre.A little like My Little Eye (another great recent film), the script-writer delights in killing off every one of the characters and cleverly inverting the standard kids/rednecks formula: turns out the hicks are more sophisticated than your average, and one kid in particular just loses all semblance of humanity, turning psycho and killing everyone that gets in his way. There's also some truly unpleasant moments of gore and (SEMI-SPOILER AHEAD!) a neat apocalyptic twist reminiscent of Cronenberg's Rabid.Great film-making.",Cabin Fever

The first part of the movie feels bland, the characters are laughable, the acting terrible, the music score non existent. But after things take a turn for the worst, the movie improves. It completely changes. The acting gets a little better, we recognize the tributes, there are some funny moments and a few disturbing ones... Even the music gets exciting at last.

And that extra section towards the end with the storekeeper guy and the 'African-Americans', to use the politically correct term, was funny, not the least because it was unexpected.

Its no Evil Dead though, and I have to admit the humor didn't touch me at all. Some of it was very pale.. I liked the policeman character though, he was so wrong!

203,prod74,Pancakes and gay squirrels. Wow! How original!!!,5,12 July 2004,"I'm a fan of horror movies. I like to be scared and I' m not put off by gore. When I heard about Cabin Fever I was anxious to watch it and I was ready to like it. So last night I went to the video store and as soon as I saw it I rented it (even though my girlfriend doesn't like gore). I went home, put the movie in the DVD player, turned off the lights and got ready for a scare. After an hour and a half I was still waiting to be scared but the end credits were already rolling. What was this film all about? Silly jokes, weird characters and lots of gore (although I must admit it was very well done) don't make a movie scary. And if a horror movie isn't scary then it is not a good horror movie. Even my girlfriend wasn't scared (and she gets scared by a bloody nose) except in one scene: (*****spoilers*****) In the bathtub where Cerina Vincent shaves her legs and the razor reveals that she is infected - but I guess that's a woman thing.I won't comment on the acting, direction, photography or anything else in the film, because there's no point. The film fails in it's most basic function - it is NOT scary. So it doesn't matter if the acting or direction was good, or if the story was somewhat original. What matters is that the result is not what it should be. Maybe I didn't get the movie or maybe I'm not easily scared but this is one movie I wouldn't recommend to horror fans. I give this one 5 out of 10, only because it's not the worst horror film I've ever watched and because the story has some potential.",Cabin Fever

It's not that I scare easily but after a long day I'd much rather watch something pleasant or meaningful. Anyway, I mustered up the courage to watch this flick one night and it wasn't nearly as scary as I thought it would be. It was sexier than I anticipated (and I really enjoyed that part) but otherwise, it seemed more or less like any other, 'kids-lost-in-the-woods' type of movie. Personally, I feel it could have been improved in many ways to give the characters and story more depth.

206,TJ1380,Could have been much better...,5,14 June 2005,"First of all, I would like to say that I love nothing more than a really good, well-done horror movie. I wouldn't say that I'm a total horror geek, but I can appreciate a movie that manages to scare me. It's not very often that I am scared by a movie, so when a movie actually manages to really creep me out, I see it as quite a feat and an indicator that the filmmakers were really doing something right. While there are moments of ""Cabin Fever"" that I found to be genuinely creepy, there were still too many elements of the movie that I didn't like at all. With its creepy isolated-cabin-in-the-woods setting (a horror cliché that still manages to be effective), lots and lots of gore, and the fact that the studio that released this didn't try to turn it into a star-studded PG-13 affair to draw in the tween crowd (as is the case with almost every horror movie released in the last 10 years), this film had a lot of potential. Too bad it didn't live up to it.The thing that really bugged me about this movie is the way the characters are portrayed. The things that happen to the young college kids that make up the main cast are truly horrible, but it was kind of hard for me to have an emotional response to any of it since I really hated most of the characters. In most bad horror movies, the characters are shallow, obnoxious, and dumb enough to do things like go for late night walks through the woods when there's a psycho killer nearby. The characters in ""Cabin Fever"" are as shallow, obnoxious, and dumb as the cast of a typical ""Friday the 13th"" movie, but they're also selfish. The flesh-eating disease that threatens to kill them is definitely scary, but when the characters react to the threat by locking one of their own in a tool shed so she doesn't infect anyone else (wouldn't a locked bedroom door be just as effective, not to mention more comfortable?), having meaningless sex (because no diseases are ever spread through sexual contact, ever), setting a diseased man on fire, driving a disease-infested truck into town (it's a BIOHAZARD, people), and running out into the woods with a six-pack of beer when the going gets tough, I found that I really didn't care if every one of them decomposed into rotting piles of meat before they died. There are also some very strange and random moments that don't make a lot of sense. with such weirdness as a possibly stoned deputy that likes to ""party"" and a strangely androgynous karate kid who bites people for no good reason, I found it very difficult to take this movie seriously after awhile.Despite my complaints about this movie, there are still some things that I liked. There are some genuinely creepy moments in the last half-hour or so that almost save this movie, such as a bathtub scene in which an infected girl tries to shave her legs and ends up peeling a layer of skin off, and another infected girl who apparently no longer has a face. The ending is also one of the most evil and twisted endings I've ever seen, which makes it the perfect horror movie ending. Let's just say that it involves contaminated water, kids selling contaminated lemonade, and even more contaminated water being shipped to a nearby town. After seeing what happened to the poor bastards who got infected earlier, the idea of an entire town getting infected is scary indeed.",Cabin Fever
207,quincy-white,Stupid and unimpressive,1,15 September 2003,"With Evil Dead, Sam Raimi made a good, solid horror movie. With Evil Dead 2, Sam Raimi made a very funny horror parody. With Cabin Fever, Eli Roth tries to do both, and comes up short either way. Cabin Fever has some intense moments, but they are undermined by too much comic relief.  I think there was also supposed to be some social commentary in there, about the mistreatment of people with diseases, but that does not work either.  Maybe the movie was just trying to be stupid.  In that case, Eli Roth forgets the important rule:  a movie is only bad enough to be funny if it is trying to be good.  Try to make a bad movie and you just have a bad movie.

208,meganmarie-19902,The Start Of Roth's Horror Climb,6,2 December 2018,"When we look at the horror masterpieces Eli Roth has gone on to create, Cabin Fever falls quite short of his best. Whilst the storyline, acting, and SFX are good, it is the script that lets it down. The gaps in the dialogue make it hard to share a connection with the characters, which is a vital part of horror movies.
So, the movie follows a group of college students who rent a cabin in the woods for a weekend of fun, sex, and alcohol. The weekend soon turns sour when a local hermit, who is carrying a strange but deadly disease, arrives begging for help and to warn them away. Of course, the students believe he is just crazy and quickly gets rid of him.
Cabin Fever is Roth's directorial debut and taking that into account it would be pretty harsh to slate the film when overall it is not bad. Minus the gaps in the script, it is still very watchable and defiantly worth your time",Cabin Fever

As their friends, lovers, and companions are stricken with the disease or killed, none of the other characters seem to care at all. Their lack of any emotions make what could have been a pretty good horror movie into a below average movie. Oddly enough, this film as a very high 62% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, especially consideirng critics don't usually like the genre.I give ""Cabin Fever"" 4/10. See it only if you're a die-hard horror or Roth fan.",Cabin Fever
215,HCG714,This is more like the film horror fans have been waiting a decade to avoid.,1,19 September 2003,"""Cabin Fever"" is one film I'm adding to the top of my ""Worst Films of 2003"" list.Poorly written, poorly directed, and just a really bad over hyped horror film!My partner & I are still wondering why ""Cabin Fever"" was wowed at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.  Did we miss something?""Cabin Fever"" as to be the most over hyped indi horror film to come out of a studio since the very crappy and very over rated ""Blair Witch Project"".As far as the plot to the film goes, a group of five college students get done with their finals and go off to celebrate at a lonesome cabin out in the woods.  The college students in ""Cabin Fever"" meet up with a blood-spewing infected who's been made all the more nasty with some disease.Sounds like a great set-up right?  Wrong!  What we get instead is a movie with too many plot holes, not enough horror, and a director who didn't know if he was making a spoof, a comedy or a horror film.I'm a huge horror fan, and I was really expecting so much.  What I got instead was a silly horror film where a director used other peoples films I.E. ""The Evil Dead"", ""Night of the Lving Dead"" etc to make a film. What started off as a good idea turned into a mess of ideas and plot. I mean pancakes, a child who bites, crazy backwoods people. ""Cabin Fever"" was just too much and too over the top to be taken seriously or scary.The only thing missing from this mess was a cameo by Bruce Campbell!""Cabin Fever is about as scary as a third-grade play.Who did ""Cabin Fever"" Director and Screenwriter Eli Roth have to sleep with to get Peter Jackson to claim that his horror film was the one that fans had been waiting a decade to attend?There is promise and potential around every corner in this film.  It's too bad that the pacing of the movie is abhorrent.  You'll find yourself bored, more often than not, while watching what is apparently a ""greatest hit"" clip from past horror flicks.Don't believe the hype, as the only frightening thing about this effort is how it received a nationwide theatrical release rather than an instant burial in the straight to video market.
The only thing scary about Cabin Fever is that well-connected hacks get deals.

216,tcdarkness,This movie is ridiculously bad,2,19 February 2004,"It is almost bad in an Ed Wood sort of way, except that the day and night shots actually do look like day and night.  No surprise that the writer/director is a Troma vet, as the film's best assets are two brief sex scenes and gross-out violence.  Terribly bad dialogue is rampant, yet somehow with as much as is included in the film it seems to fit.  The film does seem to want to be taken seriously sometimes though so the message is very mixed.  Direction is bad.  Except for American Wedding I have never seen more overuse of a wide-angle lens. Plotholes/questions galore as well, but if you like Troma or B-cinema you should like this.  Some scenes are kind of laugh out loud bad, so the movie isn't a total waste even to the casual viewer.

They didn't even go with the strong female role, both women are there to either be a)Naked or b)killed.  The entire cast was virtually unlikable and deserved death. Mind telling me why people are drinking and bathing in water that's coming from a virtual mosquito breeding ground pond? No? Didn't think so. And what was with the nutty kid biting people?

220,fabulousrice,Very bad,1,5 March 2006,"I don't really know whether Cabin Fever is supposed to be a joke or a film... But as far as I know, it's much closer to being a joke than anything else. A few years ago, the community of horror film makers decided to take a new step and make fun of the genre, thus giving birth to the Scream series. A list was given in Scream, of all the stupid things horror film characters will do that are predictable, and the characters in Scream ended up doing exactly the same things, which added a lot of humor and irony to this analysis of the genre, and led to hope that horror films from now on would show a bit different, either full of irony towards the genre, self-derision towards the film itself, or at least different in their dramatic process than all the ""old"" films that responded to the same tired criteria. In seeing ""Cabin Fever"", alas, many will see how unoriginal, serious, pretentious, boring and even not scary some supposedly ""scary"" films are now, even a few years later. First of all, this film lacks originality in a way few others do. It has been said several times, how little imagination horror directors have today, remaking remakes of foreign sequels, but setting the film in a cabin in the woods just doesn't seem to be an ""hommage"" to anything, it seems to be, simply, a ripoff. Whoever wishes to be surprised by other factors of the film's story won't be: once again, we are dealing with a film whose characters are all in their early twenties, who won't think rationally when placed in front of a problem, will rather argue for hours and pick up fights than try to think and do something about it. Not much excitement there either. For the umpteenth time in a horror film, they are tempted to kiss, make love and just basically have fun, all sorts of things that don't really make them any different than any other horror film victims seen previously. Secondly, this film is unimaginatively serious. Every situation the characters are in, every dialog, every situation in the film is treated with such seriousness that any viewer with a little sense of derision will be relieved when some characters finally end up dying. Nothing in the way the film is directed, written or acted shows any sign of humor or sarcasm, which is quite amazing considering the film is about an invisible-never-heard-of-before-flesh-eating-virus (no laughs please). I won't even bring up the acting, since there are no actors in this film. The cast was most certainly hired for being friends or neighbors with the director. Thirdly, and this will strike whoever has seen a ""good"" horror film before, the screenplay is absolutely empty. Nothing really happens, some actions are repeated several times (""let's try to get help!""), nothing makes sense, either in the facts, the psychology of the characters, or even the hilariously lame last sequence of the film, which is probably supposed to be funny according to the director and screenwriters. In the end I will only remark that a horror film is supposed to have something scary in it. Gallons of fake blood, whether they are being vomited, squirted from severed limbs or simply dripping from wounds, never were enough to scare an audience. Such major features as screenplay, ideas, and even cruelty are requested for whoever claims to have shot something scary. If I wasn't considering it to be a total failure, I would agree to reckon that the film has one talent: it is filthy disgusting to watch. Yet being grossed-out and being scared are two very different feelings, let it be known.I would like to encourage anyone a tad curious or interested in seeing this film to check older major horror films first, why not from the 60s, the 70s, the 80s, films made by Wes Craven, Dario Argento, Sam Raimi, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, Roger Corman, William Lustig, John Carpenter... it might not only give a good definition of what is scary, or self-derisory horror, but also convince viewers that ""new"" isn't necessarily ""better"". A good example related to the film is the few tracks composer Angelo Badalamenti provided for this film, even although they are unmistakably close to his previous compositions, they are below anything he has ever done before.",Cabin Fever
221,rumfoord,Bland American fare,1,28 August 2004,"Cabin Fever kind of reminded me of that awful steven king flick dreamcatcher, sans aliens. You're probably thinking that it must be an improvement, but to be honest it's not. At least dreamcatcher tried to give us *something* unique. By contrast, Cabin Fever brings us the same thing we've seen thousand times before in various permutations. The result is total boredom.Why are Americans so scared of making interesting films? When it comes to horror, Japan is vastly ahead of us. It's time for us to remember what makes a film scary. Here's a hint, gore, predictable rhythm, and formulaic plots do little to further the whole horror thing. <yawn>",Cabin Fever
222,stiff5,Not bad but..,7,19 August 2008,"Cabin Fever really had potential to be a truly amazing horror film, but overall it ends up being an average B movie. Before seeing this I looked at all the reviews on here and thought it would be utterly terrible, but after seeing it, I thought it to be a really enjoyable fun horror film. It's shocking and some parts were even suspenseful and quite scary. Sure, it's not perfect. The film is very cliché, some scenes are stupid, and some of the logic of the film is undeniably eyebrow raising. The acting isn't perfect, but it's decent. Taking the film as a serious horror film, over analyzing every detail, and keeping a checklist of all the mistakes it made will just end up with extreme hate for the film. I admit, even though you're supposed to take the film lightly, some scenes just can't surpass extreme stupidity. But overall, Cabin Fever is a very entertaining horror/comedy flick to be taken for a night of truly enjoyable popcorn fun.",Cabin Fever
223,tetractys,An amusing hoot -- good solid mindless trash like a grocery store novel,6,22 April 2007,"Front to back, this flick is a hoot. Genuinely scary in parts, and successful overall in its attempt to bring back the good old days of 70s horror. Far better than either of the offerings in the later ""Grindhouse"" by supposedly better directors, it almost became a cult classic and deserves the status. Despite a few clumsy sequences and hard-to-decipher shots, the film survives and leads the viewer relentlessly into a cesspool of destruction, decay and mayhem.The finish is an hilariously macabre and deadly twist that won't fail to delight. (I don't mean the homage to Night of the Living Dead, but what follows. You'll never stop at a lemonade stand or purchase bottled water with quite the same confidence.)The movie is a non-stop quote fest that will send you to IMDb to see if anyone else noticed such gems as ""Pancakes! Pancakes!"" and ""Yeah he's a professor -- of being a dog!"" Then you'll need to check out UrbanDictionary.com in search of definitions for neologisms like ""Faced!"" and ""Scratch moded!""The writers are good at twisting your neck. References to gay bashing and shooting African-Americans turn out funny. Kids are brutally killed by their friends, and you're glad. Sex scenes steam you up and then make you sick. When quirky anecdotal scenes included just for kicks don't fit the storyline, you're happy they weren't cut, because they're so rich and hilarious or just ominously creepy.Finally, a horror movie where the villain isn't a guy in a mask or a rubber suit. In fact, one can debate at intelligent length just what or who the villain is. And contrary to current cinematic trends, there are no build-ups that don't pay off with a genuine moment of true disgust.",Cabin Fever
224,Doctor_Cheese,Pancakes? What the Hell?,3,8 February 2004,"The best thing about ""Cabin Fever"" is the versatile and effectively creepy score, composed by none other than Angelo ""Twin Peaks"" Badalamenti. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie really isn't all that remarkable. Which is a shame, since it had potential.To be honest, I'm not entirely sure why this movie left me cold. It has a fair amount of cheesy splatter in it, and some disturbing scenery. And Cerina Vincent makes for some pretty nice eye candy.But I guess what ruined it was that all the characters, when they aren't saying something really stupid, are busy doing something really stupid. (Although I do admire the one guy who, in the face of danger and death, bravely grabs some beers and stumbles off into the woods, not to be seen again until the very end of the film.)Yeah, there's some black humor and the movie is ""paying homage"" to horror films of the 1970s and 80s and whatever. But really, the humor isn't all that humorous, and as for homage, why can't someone just make an original and interesting horror movie instead of using the ""homage"" excuse to rehash stupid crap that's already been done?Maybe the problem is my expectations were somewhat elevated owing to the critical buzz this movie received. And also because I think the deadly contagious disease concept hasn't yet been as fully exploited on the screen as it could be.My advice? See ""28 Days Later"" instead. That's not the greatest movie either, but it's more interesting and you don't feel the urge to slap the characters every 30 seconds or so.",Cabin Fever
225,bnl771,Bloody fun in the woods,10,4 March 2004,"Those looking forward to Cabin Fever for months before its theatrical release found out quickly that this film, hailed as a balls-to-the-wall return to 80s style gore filled horror, was a victim of misleading marketing. While there are some intense moments of shock and gore, Cabin Fever serves more of a self-referential study of horror films of the past. Once one is able to get past the disappointment of watching a different film than promised, it is easy to have a great time with the films comedic elements.Like most good horror films, Cabin Fever begins with a group of young men (with the only real star being Rider Strong of TVs Boy Meets World fame) and women isolating themselves and setting themselves up for later terror. In this particular movie, the young men and women have rented a cabin in the woods to celebrate something or another. The plot doesn't matter, really, as things quickly go downhill.A flesh eating virus is loose in the sleepy backwoods town and is brought to the group by way of an infected hermit that not only scares the daylights out of the gang but also manages to cause the destruction of their vehicle. What ensues is a paranoid struggle of life and death that begins with one girl getting sick and the others worried about the possibility of infection.
While the plot sounds potential terrifying, the movie is often played for laughs. Fans of the genre will appreciate many hidden nods to classics (watch in particular for a homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre when the camera follows Marcy to a house from behind the actress). This is a messy movie, with much blood and gore. There are also some genuinely unsettling moments scattered throughout, though the virus plot fails to inspire any real terror and much of the horror is left up to sporadic boo-scares.Director Eli Roth has proven himself to be full of potential with this freshman outing. He knows the genre well and has written and directed a solid film that is, while not as much fun the second and third time, extremely entertaining. Go into Cabin Fever expecting a fun examination of the genre through a paper thin plot and you won't be disappointed by the lack of much real horror.",Cabin Fever
226,gnxfan,Cabin Fever - Don't Catch It.,1,15 September 2003,"CF got me.  I read the decent reviews and thought - OK, they finally have made another decent horror flick.  Boy was I wrong.Low budget flicks sometimes get you sidetracked because you pay attention to how cheezy everything looks.  That is not the case here as the blood and guts look pretty good.  What sidetracks you is how bad the acting is.  I mean God Awful.  I also spent some time wondering if Joey Kern is really that odd looking or if he was made up to look like a really bad looking Owen Wilson and whether James DeBello is the 6th Baldwin - the Baldwin who can't act and is a bit overweight.  Not, not Daniel.The idea was ok - flesh eating virus attacks everyone.  But the rationale behind how it started (a hunter returns to his obviously dead and bleeding dog and somehow doesn't realize the dog is dead) is poorly explained and the plot development is worse than any of the middle Freddy or Jasons.  (So, if your best friends were deathly ill, would you lock them up outside, especially while a manic dog is on the loose?)I am going to bet that the dropoff after its opening week will be titanic. Word of mouth amongst those of us non pro critics has been terrible.  The only redeeming feature of this whole 1 and a half hours is the N-word joke that occurs at the very end.

It soon spreads amongst the group and their ruthless selves begin to emerge. Eli Roth delivers an eerie tale of a flesh-eating virus and the way people react when their lives are in danger. This is such a great movie because it's not really your typical ""horror"" at all. There is no serial killer, mutant zombie, or made doctor, it's just a flesh-eating virus. I think the real horror with this is showing how everyone quickly turns on one another after discovering some may be infected. Aside from some very random parts that had nothing to do with this movie at all (""pancakes""), it was a very effective and disturbing horror movie.",Cabin Fever

Underneath all those 'rocks' are a lot of things that squirm and bite. These often-dangerous things have absolutely no respect for smug, cynical and foul-mouthed college-aged friends looking for Spring-Break adventures out in the middle of Nowhere-Woods.I found this film thoroughly enjoyable, albeit very often frighteningly disturbing. There's a lesson to be learned here, and I'm not speaking as one of your parents when you were a teenager (or college student). I must accept what I see and hear in this little horror movie, especially since I discovered that the director himself (Eli Roth)was once infected with a similar type of flesh-eating bacteria when working in another country.The plot devices, production values and techniques used in this movie harken back to 1970s horror films such as ""Deliverance,"" ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" among countless others. There's even a touch of the old 1968 horror film, George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead.""

I first watched it not long after it came out and I was disappointed, recently I watched it twice again to see firstly did I judge it too harshly as you generally over judge hyped up films and secondly to see if it's one of those films that grow on you, sadly it's neither. Don't get me wrong it's not a bad film but a decent one. The start is pretty good and the end is also quite good, it just doesn't flow well and losses you halfway through with filler scene's and characters you just don't give a s**t about, the actors are pretty good, they just aren't likable characters, I get that's the point but you need a balance even in a cheese filled horror otherwise you may as well be watching The young and the Restless. For the Cheese fans it has its moments but seems to be trying too hard, without spoiling there is one scene involving a gun and a shovel I'll let your imagination work on that one.

I think this respect more the original horror genre. This is pure.What I don't like is that there is too much ""peekaboo"" scenes. Really, it's just annoying. There's no need for them. Especially when you are not in the mood of being scared. I mean I really like the horrifying feeling and atmosphere that film creates, but scaring is really not necessary in this case.Well.

231,NightOfTheLivingDon,"Well, the title was appropriate in the fact that the film succeeded in making me ill.",2,6 February 2008,"When I was in college, I never had much money (surprise, surprise). Therefore, I rarely got to the theater during my stint. One film that I really wanted to see was Eli Roth's debut CABIN FEVER. From what I was reading, and a new friend's recommendation, the movie seemed to be right up my alley. I am a consummate fan of horror films, and the promise of a new movie that stayed true to old school roots sounded like something I had to see.LIES!! Instead of seeing the supposed return to the heyday of horror, I was treated to a sloppy hodgepodge of influences. This wasn't some disciple of the old school come to save the horror film; it was the same insipid nonsense that killed it off in the first place. Roth's grasp of storytelling is about as strong as Britney Spears' grip on reality. Half of the movie was a display of just how many horror movies Roth has seen. ""Yes, we get it Eli. You're a horror dork. Welcome to the club."" The biggest problem Roth seems to have when attempting to deliver a horror movie is investing interest. Let's take the five main characters of CABIN FEVER. Five selfish, boring, and painfully typical college kids of whom I could not bring myself to emotionally invest in to any degree. I wasn't compelled to feel for the characters at all. Now, I get why they were like that. It's because we, the audience, are supposed to revel at their demises. The problem with the whole thing is, I for one, didn't care what happened to them in the first place. The end reaction is simply, ""Good they're dead. You could have just told me that, and I would have been just as happy."" The film was trite, and the gore wasn't even that great. The characters are simply annoying. They are not completely disdainful like the Stillo Gang, nor do they possess the strange charm of the Firefly Family (both gangs, and the films they appear in, are mentioned numerous times in numerous reviews). And where's this humor I keep on hearing about? I'll be the first to admit a few moments, but to go ahead and call the movie ""funny?"" That's a stretch. Turning the faceless killer/monster into a flesh eating virus did not add any kind of bonus suspense or intrigue. If anything, it reduced the little interest I had to begin with. There wasn't even a good ol' satifyin' kill, because, let's face it, killin' rednecks is old hat. Of course, Roth would try to make up for this with his next film HOSTEL and simply succeed in making a snuff film intended to be an homage to CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. He just forgot that CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST had much more of a plot than selfish, boring, and painfully typical college kids backpacking across Europe. Do you see a trend here, because I sure do...Okay, I'll give the devil his dues. There were a couple of scenes near the end that I enjoyed. The deer coming through the windshield and the kid getting the harmonica smacked down his throat were pretty good. I have to concede that those two scenes were ridiculous enough to put a long overdue smile on my face. However, they came far too late in the film to come close to saving it.Oh, and I later found out that the friend of mine who recommended the film to me actually has no real taste in horror films. His favorite movie is THE RING, he won't watch any film that is black and white (even SCHINDLER'S LIST), and he thought that the original DAWN OF THE DEAD sucked even before he saw the remake (which he liked, of course). Good guy other than his lack of knowledge as to what a good film is. He's a bells and whistles kind of guy, though he does love THE WARRIORS so he's not all bad.Hopefully, the insufferability of HOSTEL: PART 2 will either A) stop Eli Roth from torturing us with his films, or B) make Eli Roth reevaluate what he believes makes a good film. I hear he is in line to butcher a Stephen King movie, because he already wants to change the pace of the story. You know, because Eli Roth has such a better grasp on characters and plot than Stephen King. Roth's obsession with violence has done nothing more than terrorize his audience with mindless slop. I don't know what's worse, the fact that he gets away with it, or the fact that most modern horror fans let him!",Cabin Fever

The main point here is to pile on the gore and humor similar to what was done in films like Bad Taste and Dead Alive.  Anybody expecting another cliche stalker-on-the-loose horror flick should learn how to read up on horror films before seeing them because not all great horror films follow that theme.  In fact the majority of crap that's been released lately follows that theme because people are dumb enough to go see anything labeled ""horror"".This film is also more of a nod to fans of old school horror from the 70s and 80s.

233,SrCAPnCDLvl99,One gory masterpiece of a film! Well...almost.,9,15 January 2004,"Cabin Fever is one of those films that you'll never quite forget. You really cannot do that, it's too shocking, too graphic in it's nature. There's not that many films that you can compare it with. There's 28 Days Later of course, but that film took the same thematic elements and put it into a much grander scale than this film did. 28 Days Later's fictional disease affected an entire country, which in a way makes this film so much more intimate and claustrophobic. Being that these characters are together from the beginning of the film also makes you feel more for them as they gradually become infected. Supporting characters such as the ""pancakes kid"", the owners of that dreadful gas-station and the comedic police man with his bike all make this film feel like a part of the family of films that include films such as Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Wrong Turn and House of 1.000 Corpses. A truly frightening film that is. The film is rather gory from time to time, but not overly gory. There's loads of blood and guts spilled and the make-up effects are fantastically gruesome. There's also a ""love theme"" by genre veteran Angelo Badalamenti.
The only thing that I find to complain about regarding this film is the ending. ** SPOILER**When Jeff comes out of the cabin at the end, after having discovered the fact that he is the only survivor, screaming that he made it, you know what's going to happen as he walks out that door. It's pretty obvious he's going to be shot and thus a bit disappointing. I can't quite seem to remember if this is the final scene of the film or if there was yet another scene after that, but the facts remain as it takes the edge of a film that could have turned out to be a masterpiece if it had been slightly better executed.",Cabin Fever

Upon watching the DVD it is discovered (by listening to the director's commentary) that this movie is a TRIBUTE to old horror movies (Evil Dead Series, The Thing and Texas Chainsaw Massacre to be exact.)  The movie from what I saw was a refreshing horror movie compared to the dribble that comes off as being horror today.  From what I saw the movie is PERFECT IN EVERY WAY.  It totally brought the genre back to life and I have since become a fan of Eli Roth.  Keep up the great work Eli!!!  No, I don't think that the movie was scary as I am a seasoned Horror fan, but the entire premise of the movie drags you into it and explodes with over the top gore.

235,camachbr0,Makes Watching College Kids Die Fun,8,6 March 2014,"It took some time after I screened Cabin Fever to enjoy what I watched. It's actually real fun and I think that's what splatter films and Eli Roth is all about. There is some kind of chuckle of surrealism I do at some point in a film like this, usually towards the end of the second act, when I've seen enough buckets of blood make their way onto the screen. It's along the lines of ""Come on dude, this is absurd."" This happened for me in Cabin Fever, not because of an un-necessary amount of gore but because it becomes so much fun and it's so ridiculous. The film builds itself up beautifully to a great climax. A climax built where you don't give a crap about the kids, or anyone, being killed because it satisfies the sick pleasure that made us watch this film. The five college kids are each more unlikable than likable. I don't know if Roth and Pearlstein gave them the whack-est lines and college slang to say on purpose but I felt good knowing they wouldn't be able to convince me to come with on their getaway. Our ""protagonist"" has a squeaky voice and is friend zoned by the nice, respectable chick (yes there is a whore to compare her with). We have the husky goon who gets no ass but loves to get drunk and the alpha male who's false sense of tough is derived from the slut he bangs. What Eli Roth and Randy Pearlstein do here is non traditionally infect a character. Traditionally, meaning the unwritten law in horror where ""so and so"" is supposed to die before ""so and so"" because of ""such and such"" reason. Once that happens all morality goes out the door and pretty much we're not rooting for anyone to be safe, we just want to see in which way they succumb to the disease. And it's not in their sleep trying to nurse themselves in warm blankets and hot cocoa. The best part is, if you're infected you're screwed, and the unspecified countdown commences! The title's figurative meaning makes for an intelligent theme in the film as well and that also makes the 5 college students just more the reason to slaughter. As we can see from Roth's filmography he loves to make killing fun and he does that in Cabin Fever, better than he did in Hostel where it's just sick and sadistic. I happen to love the misc-en-scene towards the conclusion that makes you feel like you've caught the disease yourself. I also love Cerina Vincent. In all, this is recommendable if you want to have fun 90 minutes.",Cabin Fever

When I heard about it I thought hmmm.... seems interesting.  Since there haven't been any good Horror movies released since, Oh I don't know about the early 80's, I just decided to go see this.  I wish I hadn't.  I had no idea that this movie was an independent film.  I think Blair Witch was much better and much more convincing.  I shortly figured out what was going to happen when the kids got to the cabin and once The Dufus shot the ""squirrel"" -->guy, I knew the movie would be stupid from then on out.  The only reason I stayed and kept watching and didn't walk out is because right down to the last minute of the film, I actually thought it would get better.  Actually finally the point was made, but then it reminded me of how much of a plot the movie was missing.  The plot was not organized or clear at all.  I'm just glad I've seen enough Horror movies and movies altogether to know that this was not necessarily a winner.  It's got the feel of a good horror flick with no substance.  I guess what the people at the Toronto Film Festival saw was future promise.  With the help of some of the best horror film writers and directors, this could have been better.  But, then again look what they did to the Blair Witch Project II.  First movie was much better than the second.",Cabin Fever

I caught one night coming home late from work when I couldn't go to sleep and kept watching out of morbid curiosity that a film could be so bad.This is the most disgusting, vile piece of trash I've ever seen. But upon seeing the ending I burst out laughing with some confusion. Well, it was an attempt at comedy by the 'writers' but why? It was as if they had come to the end of the film and, realising how much of joke the film was they attempted to go out with a laugh as if to say 'it was all in good fun'. Truly bizarre.Blast, not 10 lines. I think they should make an exception with this film, its not worthy of two. Better re-cap the 'plot'. Group of teenagers go into the woods on vacation. A man comes to their cabin late at night and infects them with some flesh-eating disease, turns out it's coming from the river water.

If this guy is trying to remake Evil Dead 2, he needs to watch it a few more times, because he's not even close to figuring out the secret. (Maybe he's missing the requisite talent gene.) This film isn't scary in the slightest probably because he never creates characters you care about. You want to see them die, because they are stupid, shallow people. And as for them getting the virus - no wonder they shout to that kid to avoid going to college, because they didn't learn anything from their experiences there. Uh if a person is spitting blood, you probably don't want to be handling them or standing near them. The disease was a lot like ebola, and yet how was this being spread? By drinking it? Give me a break. Once logic was thrown completely out of the window, I just couldn't wait until this was over. A few things are mildly humorous -was that deputy supposed to be Crispin Glover? - but overall it was just the product of a very infantile mind.I beg you. Avoid this film at all costs.

The ""I made it"" scene was predictable, and kind of corny, but better than it could've ended. I noticed that no matter how far anyone walked, ran, drove, boated, etc. away from the cabin, they somehow always ended back at the cabin. (didn't Jeff LEAVE). And, that truck was going fast enough, there is no way it could've stopped that fast. But, other than that, good enough to keep one on the edge of the seat.

243,bibleboyiam,Warning: This movie is not to be taken literally.,6,17 September 2003,"*Possible Spoilers* Sure the acting wasnt fantastic, the plot was ridiculous, and the characters were brainless, but what the hell do you expect from a movie of this type?? This movie wasnt meant to be scary. It goes along with many of the horror flicks of the 80's, such as the Friday the 13th series and the later sequels of A Nightmare on Elm Street. Nobody in their right mind is scared by these movies, if they are a trip to a psychiatrist couldnt hurt. They are meant to be a funny, sex/nudity filled adrenaline rush. For those of you who thought that this movie wasnt gory, it makes me wonder if you shouldnt be checking into your local psych ward. This film was full of splattering, spewing, squirting blood. There was flesh rotting off of bodies, severed limbs, heads, and feet. There were beatings, bodies shot to death, skin torn off a leg with a razor, and one character was torn to pieces by a dog. What else do you want from a film, exploding bodies? Chopped up organs? Maybe the graphic systematic slaughter of children?? I swear there are some true psychos among us!!! I would say that nearly 200 F-bombs are dropped in this film, a bit excessive, but actually pretty close to reality when considering the source, a group of 5 college students. The nudity, all of which is credited to Cerina Vincent is a nice addition for the young male viewers. The end of the movie is rather satisfying as nearly every character in the film either dies horribly or will die horribly shortly after the film comes to a close.
Sure some absurd content was added, such as the kung fu by the little boy/girl, the murderous rampage of the lead character at the end, and the whole inclusion of the party animal cop who weakened the already frail credibility of the film, but overall it was a mission accomplished.",Cabin Fever

No slasher, no monster and no demon, but an unknown flesh eating virus. and the acting is good. Does it make difference ? It's up to you. If you are looking after a good teen-gore movie and have seen Evil Dead too many times, you could try this one. I won't dare to say it's refreshing, but... let's say it does something new with old ideas, and it is not disappointing.After reading many comments on this movie I wonder why some people are so upset by the very tame 'sex scenes'... Seems it is alright to show people shooting, killing, and butchering each others, but a couple in bed or the seeing of a pair of tits is unbearable, even in such a gory movie ! Sure, children wouldn't watch it, BECAUSE of the sex scenes :-)The DVD contains some bonus. Not really interesting, but some people do like bonus... some cartoon, the kung-fu kid and the usual 'making off' or 'behind the scenes' uninteresting stuffing. THis too is amazing.

247,revcosmo,instant cult classic,6,29 August 2005,"Cabin Fever is a smart, self-aware horror flick that hearkens back to the good ole horror days of yore, learns from it, and creates a whole new beast.For a while, it seemed as though all the innovation in horror had been exhausted.. nearly everything that came out in the genre in the late 90's seemed to be either a shoddy remake of a horror classic, or a shoddy remake of a quality Asian horror in an attempt at making it ""palatable"" for American audiences. In either case, the results have been mediocre at best. Horror needed a breath of fresh air, a new approach.. and Cabin Fever fits the bill.The trick was putting new twists on the old tried, true, and yet tired horror foundations, such as the basic plot (group of randy teens who go off to a remote cabin seeking a little fun only to find the horrors aplenty), and breathing new life into it. Cabin Fever was so well aware of its ""traditional"" horror foundations that it succeeded round the board in a satire of the genre, while still being a solid scary movie. It's rare to find a film that can successfully mock the genre it's patterned after and yet still be as effective as standard genre fair. This is probably Cabin Fever's greatest strength. It's an entertaining horror film; scary, good effects, etc, and it is also an effective and quite funny send up of the horror genre. The writers definitely did their homework.That being said, a film like Cabin Fever is destined to primarily appeal to a cult audience. This is a film that was made specifically for horror aficionados, much of the humour is aimed at people who have spent hours and hours watching the old cult horror flicks (Evil Dead, H.G. Lewis's stuff, Peter Jackson's, etc). If you're not someone who delights in (and has spent a great deal of time watching) the old cheesy horror stuff, a lot of the point of the film is lost. But I suspect Cabin Fever, like Evil Dead, 2000 Maniacs, etc, will be playing at midnight movies 20 years from now.",Cabin Fever
248,BobforTrish,(Wooden) Cabin Fever (Failure),4,25 October 2014,"In the seemingly endless chain of modern horror movies Cabin Fever has achieved something of a cult status. This can surely be put down to the various production asides rather than any aesthetic viewing experience.The debut film of director Eli Roth from his own story concerns five college graduates who rent a cabin in the woods. Unfortunately for them a flesh-eating virus has entered the local water supply. After they kill an infected victim things soon degenerate. The group begins to disintegrate as self-preservation and selflessness come to the fore. Matters come to a head when the involvement of both the local population and officials leads to an even higher level of danger.Stock characters are clearly delineated from the start, thus we have heroic Paul (Rider Strong), nice girl Karen (Jordan Ladd), trampy girl Marcy (Cerina Vincent), dimwit Bert (James DeBello) and the egocentric strange one Jeff (Joey Kern).In the old days (i.e. the 70s) we could ascertain with a fair degree of certainty which of these people would survive. In the ways of modern horror, Cabin Fever prefers to give us characters with few if any redemptive or empathic features. Accordingly, the ending - even with any lame twists - fails to either surprise or please. The 90-odd previous minutes contain some gory scenes, largely ordinary acting, some poor acting from minor characters, fairly good special effects and some very poor dialogue interspersed with an overuse of the 'f' word. The plot becomes increasingly unfathomable as the film progresses until it eventually simply runs out of steam. There is a soundtrack which simply adds to the annoyance.Since the 2002 release of this film there have been two sequels (with a third in production) and a remake, none of which were necessary.One further point which most reviewers either missed or chose not to mention: At one point Old Man Cadwell (played by Robert Harris), running the shop, makes a racist comment. Later, almost as if by an act of contrition, there is a 'twist' scene involving the same character. Great horror films almost invariably contain comic scenes. If that was the purpose here, in this reviewers' opinion it failed miserably and merely left a bad taste...",Cabin Fever
249,leagueofstruggle,Boredom will kill you faster than the flesh-eating virus...,1,16 February 2004,"Cabin Fever covers the predictable misadventures of five thoroughly unlikeable twenty-somethings as they combat an esoteric virus that consumes flesh at a variable rate depending on... something. Usually movies like this have archetype prankster and archetype jerk. Watch as Cabin Fever combines them to make Bert the jerky prankster! From the start of the film you will wonder what this character is doing there. He has no redeeming qualities and seems the perfect mood killer for a couples get away. No amount of suspension of belief will allow you to justify the rock bottom stupid choices these characters make. The film just drags on and on with its lackluster cinematography and plot twists (if you can call them twists). Generally predictable except for the leaping conclusions of illogical action these dunderheads periodically make. Guaranteed to give the audience several groaning moments in a bad way.

Where does the virus come from? We're never told or at least I didn't pick up on it.Notice the virus doesn't *actually* kill anyone? Everyone is killed by someone else. Perhaps this is supposed to be the black humor I heard about?
Pancakes?!!? What was up with that? Perhaps it was explained in the DVD extras. I was too numb at the end to do anything but hit OPEN on my player and get that disc back to the rental hut quick. It was a very annoying scene regardless.Burning this movie would be an insult to fire.0/10",Cabin Fever
250,bigfella2k1,Gory and funny in equal measure,8,19 September 2003,"(Major Spoilers)Some of the reviews I've read of this movie seem to be entirely missing the point. Sure, this movie is derivative (Evil Dead meets 28 Days Later meets Night of The Living Dead) and somewhat predictable (although anyone that says they were expecting the ""Pancakes"" scene is a damn liar), but so what? The whole horror genre is built on exploitation and homage. There are bad ways to do this (Darkness Falls) and interesting, creative ways to do this, like Cabin Fever. We have the requisite sex scene and shower scene, tons of gore,inbred locals and idiotic law enforcement- all you need for a horror movie! This movie revels in its indebtedness to other movies. It has a great sense of humor (""Don't sit next to Dennis"", the hysterical ""Pancakes"" scene, the classic exchange of: ""Why are you shooting squirrels?"" ""Because they're gay."" and a bunch of other weird sight gags (like the Bunny) that show how much fun the filmmakers must have had making this. And that leg-shaving scene, OH MY GOD! Utterly classic. Plus, NOBODY WINS! That's right, they all die! How cool is that? More subtly, nobody actually dies from the so-called virus in this movie if you pay attention: all the deaths are attributable to the characters lack of moral fiber (the bum is set on fire, the first infected girl is dispatched with a shovel, etc. etc.) This movie is bound to be a cult classic and beats the pants off of the boring and predictable Freddy vs. Jason.

251,blackwolf14016,"A gross, but entertaining popcorn flick.",10,13 September 2003,"Let me say this: It takes a lot to gross me out. But this movie manages to do it, more than once even. A basic breakdown of the plot: ========================================================== *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*Five young college students rent a cabin in the woods, near a small, rural community. The first night they arrive they are beset by a bloody, dirty, diseased hermit, who infects one of them. Then slowly the disease spreads, causing distrust amongst them. When the locals find out about the spreading illness, they drive to the cabin to eliminate the cause....========================================================== The story is pretty stereotypical of the teen/horror genre. Five horny kids in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, drinking liquor, having sex, etc.
The acting was pretty good, considering there wasn't an A movie star within 100 miles of this movie. The biggest star in this movie was on an ABC sitcom for about 4-5 years. But despite that, they do their jobs pretty well, especially since the script was pretty bad in some places.
The gore is VERY good. I mean, it's very sickening in a lot of places. This may be the first time I've ever said this, but I almost think they could have taken a bit out in a few places. My biggest beef with this movie is the comedy. Now, you can have a horror movie with a few comedy bits and still have a great movie, but (at least in the first 1/2) you have trouble determining if this is a horror or a comedy. Don't get me wrong, the Comedy is good. Just a little too much in the wrong places. Another minor beef is the lack of 'real' violence - for a horror flick, there isn't a lot of killing/shooting, they mostly let the virus do all the work. Lastly, the sex. This movie is obviously meant for teenagers. Being one (18), I understand/appreciate that. But they only include 2 sex scenes, both of them short and one of them pretty disturbing. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a pervert, but more promise of T&A would have brought a bigger crowd.Overall though, a pretty good flick. If you enjoy being scared, and are not too haughty to mind a sub-par story/script, you will like this movie. 7.5/10James ""Black Wolf"" Johnston",Cabin Fever

If it's goal was to re-invent the genre, it didn't quite measure up. No wonder it took Roth so long to get this made. While I'm impressed that he did manage to get it completed and distributed, it's fairly easy to see where he went wrong. Roth seems to know the genre quite well, but he's not able to advance the genre. This was more of a gore film than a scary thriller. It's too bad Roth couldn't come up with an explanation of where the flesh-eating virus came from. And Paul having sex with Marcy? No... The wonderful Avie Verveen was very underused (though there wasn't much he could actually do). Any 'cabin in the woods' needs a plot device to disable the car. Here it was... WEAK! And a way to explain the gun. Here it was... WEAK! None of the characters were likable. Was happy when all of them died. Jordan Ladd was some nice eye candy, as was Cerina Vincent. DeBello's character was a one-note overdone awful character. Kern was simply there. And the 'nigger' joke at the end? Didn't add anything to the film.

253,stereoplaysjunk,Not Quite 'Last House...' But Up The Same Street...,7,20 January 2006,"It should be obvious to everyone by now that there hasn't been a gory, unabashed horror film for a long time. During the 80s, the 'Video Nasties' were on the rise, 'Evil Dead' and 'Last House on the Left' were all met with a icy reception from up-tight, Left-wing campaigners and consequently banned.Director/writer Eli Roth is obviously a big fan of these slasher flicks and he knows his horror films from the looks of his debut 'Cabin Fever'.Written back in 1995, Roth wanted this little number to hark back to the Dario Agento and early Wes Craven era and with due respect to the guy he's almost there.'Cabin Fever' tells the story of five college students who rent a cabin in the woods for a week (they should have turned back when they realised that said cabin passes quite a resemblance for the legendary 'Evil Dead' cabin, but hey... this is a horror film!) It's not long before the kids are getting themselves into trouble and building animosity between them and the local inbreds, but as all teenagers do they take the troubles in their stride.Although a log cabin in the woods of some out-of-the-way town might be an all too obvious setting for a horror film, it works well. Sometimes the clichés need to be there.Roth builds up a very comic script, which makes it a pleasure to watch during the beginning stages unlike a lot of other horror films that take so long for any action to start that by the time it does, you've lost all interest.'Cabin Fever' however takes you along with the gross-out gore and ""crude"" jokes and by the last fifteen minutes you kind of ""get"" what Roth is trying to achieve. While wanting to scare the pants off his audience and gross them out completely the guy wants to make us laugh as well. Whether or not the humour transpires to all people is obviously questionable, but on a minuscule budget of around $1,000,000 the film does very well.I love a low-budget horror, and these days it's hard to find one, but Cabin Fever (along with recent psycho hit Saw) is an example of how money can't buy you talent. Roth does more with 'Cabin Fever' and a million bucks than other directors can do with $30,000,000 and if you're a fan of 80s slasher flicks that this is a must. It might not measure up to 'Last House' and 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', but in this day and age, it comes pretty damn close.",Cabin Fever

A bunch of college friends go camping in the woods where one by one they are infected with a disease that causes their bodies to rot and burn. The movie is pretty gory, but not much. It has good performances from its cast. The biggest problem with the movie is that it is way too cheesy and comedic. Horror films these days try to mix horror and comedy and it just does not work.

First, because I was intrigued by the story idea, and second because I am an avid fan of the horror movies of the 70's and early 80's - that was the 'golden era' of the slasher film. I guess we should give Eli Roth an 'E' for effort in trying to pay homage to such great films as 'The Evil Dead' (I own a copy). But, what always impressed me about Sam Raimi (Evil Dead director) was his inventive camerawork and cohesion of his storyline, even though it deals with incredible situations as in this movie. Mr. Raimi skillfully used the 'dutch angle' and dynamic camera to great effect. This movie had zero creative camerawork, and really only resembles 'The Evil Dead' in gore. Even there, 'Evil Dead' has it beat because Raimi knows how to really go over the top. Hearing that Peter Jackson apparently endorsed this film surprises me, because I also own a copy of his 'Dead Alive' AKA: 'BrainDead' which again was incredibly innovative and had logical editing throughout. I can only imagine that he had some vested interest in 'Cabin Fever' and hadn't seen the final print. I think most fans of campy horror like myself can forgive a lot when it comes to weak plot developments (I still don't understand how some blood and a few swings of a baseball bat could incapacitate a pick-up truck - they couldn't think of a more imaginative way to have the truck not start?)but if you're going to get really illogical, then you might as well pull out all the stops and let the boom microphone swing into the scene or have a background extra or technician partially showing at the edge of the frame.

261,zillizard,"Like lettuce. Doesn't age well, tasteless, & drab",2,24 February 2020,"I love horror movies. I will watch pretty much any horror movie, and I don't mind corny effects or bad acting if the mood/setting/ambiance are well established and executed. This movie doesn't really have any of those redeeming qualities. The ambiance is nonexistent, the acting is terrible even by horror standards, and the scares are non existent.Looking past these flaws, the original version of this movie has a lot of slurs (n word, r word and characters refer to things they don't like as gay) to the point of all of the characters coming off as ignorant and contrite. They get upset a shopkeeper is racist, but continue to call things gay or r****ded? While I know these were more acceptable in 2002, this still lands completely the wrong way.The movie has no depth for any character except the comic relief sheriff deputy Winston. His presence is maybe the only reason I don't give this one star, because he was a refreshing change of pace, albeit a creepy gross guy. The way he was written and performed it seemed like the actor and writers were aware he is a caricature of someone we are all familiar with.The references this movie makes to other movies are well incorporated, and watching this really made me want to rewatch true parodies (Tucker and dale vs evil/cabin in the woods). Both of those movies are more worth your time.

262,Tokugawa,"Buckets and Buckets of Blood, and Few Laughs",5,8 April 2004,"Saw ""Cabin Fever"" last night.In ""Narc"" there was a better example of a head being blown off with a shotgun. In ""Underworld"" and ""Ghost Ship"" we saw heads cut in half with the upper part sliding off - more interesting than horrifying, actually. In ""Blade II"" I saw actor Ron Perlman, the current ""Hellboy"", cut in two from crotch to scalp with both halves falling to either side.When you've seen that, where else do you go? Do the non-CG FX and buckets of Karo syrup and red dye in ""Cabin Fever"" shock me? Hardly. And director/writer Eli Roth surely is obsessed with blood, and more and more blood.So, it was not really horrifying, although it was somewhat gruesome and very gross. The idea of a skin-eating disease randomly and unexpectedly striking down people, who then begin and inexorable slide into blood and decay, is not that scary. Scary means somebody - some maniac - out to get you and you never know when he will.So, did I like it? 2 1/2 stars out of 4. If you see the DVD check director Roth's sanguinary claymations - ""Rotten Fruit"", which are also steeped in blood. It was worth a rental.I should add the lemonade scene at the end of ""Cabin Fever"" was pretty good. By then Roth and everyone was having a good laugh, which is fine and entertaining, but also tells me no one walked out ""horrified"".",Cabin Fever

Hope that they learn a lesson and go back to acting school ASAP, thats if they ever went to school.

265,jefonline,Read this if you plan to see Cabin Fever,1,31 October 2007,"This is one of those movies that either a) never should have been made, or b) be completely redone. To its credit however, it did get off to a pretty good start. That's what kept me watching...a bunch of friends huddled around a campfire in the middle of the woods, that was a good start. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The part where it lost me was when the guy originally shot by Bert came to the cabin looking for help...there was something about that scene that just did not click. One of the worst parts was when Bert fixed the truck and drove off on his own after Karen's blood splattered on the windshield. Really poorly done. The little kid at the gas station yelling 'pancakes' was just plain freaky and the kid's dad was just psycho. The other thing I didn't like was that there was no sign at all where the flesh-eating virus started. There was the hobo in the woods, but that didn't suggest an unstoppable virus. The ending was also pretty bad, although it might be seen as a foreshadowing to what i heard will be a sequel. When Marcy realizes everyone is dying, including herself, she starts shaving her legs and revealing the virus effects. That was like the director's horribly attempt at putting a sexy spin on things. Also, I saw this movie shortly after seeing The Hills Have Eyes, which I'm still amazed how well done that one was, so my expectations were pretty high for this one.",Cabin Fever
266,sunset-at-night,I Honestly think the Hype Killed this Film.,7,18 October 2005,"Before Cabin Fever came out.. the word in the horror world was that Cabin Fever is one of the most gruesome, bloodiest, scariest, funniest, craziest horror movie ever. So when it opened in theaters, everyone's expectation was sky high ..even mine. Yes, I was kind of disappointed with Cabin Fever because it was hyped so much. I mean you had Peter Jackson the director of Lord of the Rings saying in the trailer this is one of best horror movie he's ever seen. Now if I did not go in with such huge expectations, I could had enjoyed it for what it was. I really started enjoying Cabin Fever once it started playing on cable. Every time it comes on I watch it and I begin to love this film a lot more.Cabin Fever is directed by up and comer Eli Roth. He's a guy that loves horror films and mentioned in several articles this movie pay homage to his favorites like Evil Dead.Cabin Fever is about 5 college kids who had just finish test finals and are enjoying some relaxation and fun in a cabin in the woods but the fun is cut short when they learn a flesh eating bacteria disease is around. The main character Paul is played by Boy Meets World actor Rider Strong. Rider was surprisingly good in this movie and Paul is the character you root for the most to not get the disease.The movie is funny. The funniest movie ever? Hell no! This movie is scary. The scariest movie ever? Hell no! This movie is bloody. The bloodiest? Hell no! So I'm finally enjoying the movie for what it's worth and it is and has a potential to end up being a horror movie classic. There are tons of films that people hated when it first came out and then come to love it semi years later. Cabin Fever I believe is one of them.",Cabin Fever

268,sgurgolo,"A Classic, somebody will like it in a few years.",10,19 October 2003,"The thing that sucks most of this movie is the comments about this movie! Most of the people really seem to loose the whole point of watching a movie. They expect to see something... I hope they never go to watch a Bergman movie thinking they'll see a drama, when their idea of a drama is Titanic. They wouldn't really know what they're going to feel for the next hours, they'd feel sick! There is a misunderstanding in the concept of genre. Ok, the distributors have to sell it. What should they say? ""This is a movie that's straight forward in the future without losing its roots in the past""? They have to sell it as a horror movie, of course. This is a horror-apocalyptic-end of the world-lost in the woods-menaced by rednecks-drama-comedy-grotesque... how can you define a masterwork? Well, this is actually not a masterwork, but sure a good attempt at. I'm sure Scream-like fans (and i'm cool with Scream-like movies) will hate this movie, but this one is just in the line of 28 Days Later and My Little Eye, this is not a slasher movie! Don't expect your usual popcorn/girliesqueezing flick. And ok, i have to admit the last minutes are pretty wack (but the last joke that some PC guy labeled as ""racist"" is a great piece of comedy). Anyway guys, c'mon! There's Deliverance in there (but without the obviousness of Wrong Turn - a really wack piece of crap), and there's Evil Dead, and there's The Night Of The Living Dead. A lot of inspiration but no copycat here, just the roots that a good tree need to grow (Nicotero and his team are some expert gardeners too!).  This is a really good original movie, somebody will like it in a few years, this is a step forward.If you are into horror movies only for the thrill of the moment, you should step back and get your gasp watching some Wrong Turn lookalike.

269,fearfact0,This is a pretty good horror movie...to say the least.,7,25 June 2006,"Horror is subjective. Some people like jump scares, some people like building tension, some people like slasher films, some people like vampire. You get my point, and if this doesn't illustrate it perfectly, my stepbrother likes jump scares and while I like gore, I prefer the thinking-man's eerie kinda horror movie. Hence he prefers Feardotcom to The Ring, and I chastise him about it. And he doesn't care, he hates the Ring but loves Feardotcom, it's his kind of horror.Cabin Fever is for horror fans who like the fact that not all of them take themselves seriously. The Evil Dead is in my opinion of the twenty greatest horror movies ever made...and it's hilarious. Dead/Alive also. You get what I'm saying. Cabin Fever is of that mode, not particularly being SCARY in a traditional sense, but gory as all get out (on a budget of 1.5 million, no less) and funny. If you watch Cabin Fever thinking it is going to resurrect horror, then you would be wrong. What it did was begin the writing/directing career of Eli Roth, who is one of the people resurrecting horror. This was the predecessor to Hostel, which is brilliance in horror. Interesting enough, I still like this more. Can't wait to see what he does with Cell.",Cabin Fever

272,thelegendarywd,It's no Evil Dead....,5,15 September 2003,"I was very excited to see the preview for this movie when I went to see 28 Days Later. It seems as if the return of low budget horror/gore films is finally here. Although I was extremely disappointed with House of 1000 Corpses, the fact that I was able to see it in the theater was a plus... Lions Gate Films should be commended. Then I got to see 28 Days Later in the theater... a zombie movie!!! And after reading about Cabin Fever in Fangoria for a while I now got to see that... again, thanks to Lions Gate. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed with the movie. I guess I was expected some zombie carnage or something... there was none. I was expecting a certain visceral thrill, Evil Dead style... not there either. The film is about a virus that eats it's victims flesh... and that's the only flesh eating... no gut munching zombies or demons. It also takes quite a while before the virus starts to spread to really pick up the pace. This being said, the film does have it's positive points: a decent sense of humor and some great make-up effects, and when the final victim learns he has the disease he gets pretty violent. I might have to view it a second time to appreciate it more now that I know it's not the ultra-violent splatter-fest I thought it would be (I mean it is only rated R). So while Cabin Fever isn't quite up to films like The Evil Dead, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or even the excellent 28 Days Later, it's certainly better the House of 1000 Corpses and more importantly it's a step in the right direction... back to the hey-day of gore MAKE-UP EFFECTS and not crappy, cartoonish, and cold CGI. Hopefully, one day we will see the return of the Unrated horror film to the theaters... like The Evil Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead in their days... HEY... GEORGE ROMERO...

273,pistolaro_amigo,Welcome to the party,9,25 August 2009,"Eli Roth didn't wait for opportunity to knock... instead he kicked in the door and sent splinters flying everywhere! This is his calling card and many of the elements seen in his later films have been established here. 1) Good looking thespians with little or no range 2) Ultra violence mixed with college boy frat humor 3) Tarantino-esqe cultdom 4) Gruesome violence and subjects not handled as deeply as they could be exploredbut here is how Roth uses all of those elements to his advantage and creates a unique experience.1) Jordan Ladd (underused since Gregg Araki's Nowhere) has built up a nice IMDb resume since appearing in this flick and is destined to become a cult icon in the same circle of Tarantino/ Rodriguez/ Roth circles. Rider Strong found life beyond Boy Meets World where later in the show they started exploring his character's darker side, and this was his spring board for meatier roles in Tooth & Nail and Borderland, 2 interesting genre submissions. Cerina Vincent beyond being eye candy has the strongest pressence in this film and is actually the film's femme fatale leading to the demise of 2 male characters eventually leading to her own demise in the film's most explicit scene. How come she is not offered more roles is a head scratcher 2) Gore porn is handled in a more dramatic way in some of the Splat Pack's films (High Tension, Devil's Rejects) but Roth handles his in a dark comedy fashion that it is not tended to be taken serioulsy rather the humor is numbing the already numb vision that has been seen. Look at this film, Hostel I and II, and Thanksgiving trailer (his most accomplished and critic-fav submission) 3) The fact that he knows that he is not the greatest actor aside, he is actually not annoying when he appears in his films unlike the fore-mentioned director. In fact he becomes the most welcomed director cameo since Hitchcock. And he has actual acting chops seen in Death Proof and Inglorious Basterds 4) Flesh eating diseases and tourist killings can be intriguing documentaries but in Roth's hands it is nothing more than the McGuffin for the ensuing violence. And besides, isn't fact always more frightening than fiction? Who's to say that what has been depicted in his films haven't' already been done in real life? Plus Roth brings back the frightening and haunting horrific images that once embedded itself in the subconscious of minds from the '70's/ '80's horror flicks. Roth is bringing it back and this was the original spring board but be prepared to be divided; either you're on this side of the fence or the other. There is no middle ground",Cabin Fever
274,Mrcheeks,Winner of the worst film of the year award,1,2 November 2003,"This movie was so awful I don't know where to start. From bad acting to a seemingly dialog-less script this film has to be one of the biggest stinkers of all time. The plot was pitiful and the outcomes for each character were just plain VERY stupid. I have watched all of Peter Jacksons horror films and the man needs to stick to elves, wizards and warriors. The kids in this film are supposed to be college kids or something I guess but thats yet another part of the story that's not quite explained. This is one of those R movies that's really geared towards the 17 and under crowd and even 17 is pushing it. How it earned a 5.7 from voter ratings I'm dumbfounded. A thin boring plot that the kiddies can grasp with a bit of nudity and gore to wow them with. This film was just pathetic!!! From the mystery disease that they all catch to the p*** poor acting by the town folk that were mirrored straight from the script of Deliverance, it's just so god awful I can not explain. How someone wrote a long detailed review of this movie praising it ...it's just pathetic to see other human beings are so shallow, dense, lack personality and insight along with a whole other slew of personality and character flaws. I'm disgusted by the reviews, the votes and most of all the film. It's an edgier immature teen/pre-teen film. Nothing more.Here's the summary: 5 teens or...young adults, the film never really specified though they were drinking, go off to a cabin for what reasons we have no idea. Simply to drink and soak in the environment from the film Deliverance. A stranger shows up with an illness after having an encounter with the most unruly of the 5 kids. He begs for help, there is a confrontation and in turn the man is set on fire, running off into the woods where he collapses in the towns water reservoir infecting the first of the kids. Ok here we go. None of it made any sense. It all just happened to happen. It was a made up story and a very poorly one at that. Zero sense of reality here folks! This film definitely didn't have a script it was an outline at best and thrown together very poorly on set. From the reality of the disease that spread so easily to the p*** poor reaction of the kids is just ignorant. I do believe the average 21 year old would react as foolishly and childish as they do in the situations that arrive, but in the world of reality none of this could ever happen. If this film were made of toilet paper I wouldn't wipe my butt with it!!!! More so anyone who actually saw something in this film deserves the nasty rash the kids got in this poor excuse of a movie. No wonder people download movies. Why pay $14 for a ticket a soda and some popcorn and get ripped off on this piece of crap!! I'd demand my money back and in fact by law that have to refund it! If you did actually like this film I'd almost pity you but rather wish you dead so as to have one less mindless, personality-less idiot on the planet. ...Two good things about the movie I'll admit. Some of the acting from the 5 kids was good and the very best thing about this film is when the stupid thing ended!",Cabin Fever
275,jimmykebab,"Nah I'm kidding, i'll shoot em if they're gay or straight.",10,20 July 2006,"OK, here goes. This film is quite simply, a masterpiece. Relentlessly watchable and better each time it is watched. Initially when I saw the film I thought it was good, then I watched it again and i thought it was still good then I watched it again and it was amazing! Honestly, this is up there with the best horror films ever, but then thats not saying much as there are so many bad ones. This film has it all, hilarious characters with a complementing script; a smattering of blood ( a couple of real cringe- OW painful moments) and a very unsettling atmosphere with nerve shattering music.The premise is simple. Kids in a wood (pretty damn stupid ones) deserted except for a nearby village full of mentalists, a diseased hermit, a ""party""ing cop (hilarious....quite simply hilarious) and a crazy stoner (Eli Roth himself- in a fantastic little role) with his vicious almost demonic dog (that, oh, just so happens to want to eat everything it sees). Endlessly self knowing but not to the extent that it becomes irritating because you are too taken in by the no holds barred nature of the film. IT rockets along at such a pace that nothing is even remotely boring. One minute you'll be on the floor in tears of laughter and the next you'll be cowering or cringing (well the most squeamish of you at least, like my friend Sam, haha when i showed it to him the other day); and other occasions it mixes both- for instance the head on collision with a (very fake looking deer) and its subsequent bloody demise; i literally laughed my ass off.SO in conclusion, despite all the hype that has led to people not liking the film; I say, ignore every prejudice you may have about the film. Buy it from amazon UK for like a pound and watch and enjoy then watch again and again, and introduce all your friends to it. THis is a criminally under-appreciated film. IT fooookin rocks! Eli ROth is a legend! Blows every horror film recently out of the water, its just so much fun to watch! Forget wussy ""psychological thrillers"" like abysmal crap of hide and seek the ring and godsend vein and see this. A TRUE horror film, that'll have you laughing as well. WATCH IT!",Cabin Fever
276,Buggieblade,Cabin Fever (2002) 6/10,6,15 March 2004,Cabin Fever is 1/3 away from being a pretty decent film.  It is a horror/comedy about a group of friends who go to a cabin on a weekend get-away.  They encounter a strange virus that drives them to test the limits of their trust and friendship.  It starts off promising and even grabs your attention throughout but the ending is something left to be desired even though it leaves it open to a sequel (either theatrical or direct to video).

But then you keep watching and a chick gets torn to shreds by a dog. A dude gets a screwdriver shoved into his brain. And you think, ""Hey! A real horror movie!""When the movie first begins, you think it looks pretty promising. Something about the opening credits has sort of a 70's horror film style to it and you think it might be going somewhere good. But then you see the stupid teenagers (including Shawn from BOY MEETS WORLD, God forbid) and you're thinking, ""Oh great, here we go."" And for a while, it really does seem to be going there. The teenagers are unbelievably annoying, they do unbelievably cliché things, and you want them to be killed in unbelievably painful ways.Now, see, this is where most horror movies would fail. We know that, certainly, the teenagers will be dispatched with in various creative ways. But in most cases, the camera shies away from the carnage and what you've got is a boring, annoying movie. But CABIN FEVER does not shy away. It is surprisingly brutal for a film made in 2003 that was actually shown in theaters. Yes, the dialogue will have you wanting to throw up and the over-acting will have you rolling your eyes, but when it is time to kill off the teens, its serious business.You've got people throwing up blood all over the place; you've got guys getting set on fire; you've got the flesh rotting off people's faces while they're still alive; and you've got the aforementioned creative use of a screw driver and some mean dogs. This movie really does come right at you and earns your respect that it originally did not have.Eli Roth directed this picture and he hasn't done anything of any particular note prior to this, but it is clear he knows where he's going. There are many plot points presented that you are fully expecting not to be tied up. But surprisingly, he nails down (with really sharp nails and a big sledge hammer) every single one of them by the end. It's because of this the movie seems to go on forever, even though it has merely a 90-minute runtime. But I mean that in a good (RETURN OF THE KING) way.And you know what? The ending is great. I don't often say that about horror movies, but this one has several payoffs that are very clever and quite funny, actually. It shows simultaneously how fair and yet brutal this film is. No doubt there's a lot of camp. But if you miss the days of horror movies that went straight for the throat, check this one out. It's worth a rent. *** stars (out of ****)",Cabin Fever
279,generichorrorfreak,major flop,2,11 August 2010,"So many things in this movie were either generic/predictable, completely unrelated to anything else in the movie, or made no sense at all. The characters were all as generic as they come. A group of college kids interested in having a good time with the personality of a rodent between the five of them. Scratch that.. I would much have rather watched a hamster nibble on cheese and exercise on a hamster wheel for an hour than watched this rubbish.The script was horrible. It was trying too hard to sound typical of the characters (college kids), and the horrendous acting on top of it made it so unbearably.. what's the word I'm looking for? Boring? Crappy? Eye-roll inducing? The only remotely real character was Bert, yes the obnoxious one, he was the only person in the movie I was even remotely interested in finding out what was going to happen to him. The acting was horrible too. You don't believe the characters believe anything that they're saying, against except for Bert.Back to the unrelated or makes no sense issue. A good chunk of this movie involves scenes or characters or lines that have nothing to do with anything. The worst of these was the pancakes/ karate scene. Why is there a slow-mo karate scene in the middle of the movie, by a minor character, who also has pretty much nothing to do with anything, and why is he yelling ""pancakes""? Well at least Bert's reaction was pretty funny. There are way too many unnecessary/ senseless things in this movie and none of them are clever or at least cool to look at or anything.The ""mystery"" of the infection is given away the first time the camera focuses on the water glass and plays some suspenseful music, so all that's really left in the majority of the movie is watching if and how the idiot college kids figure it out. With how obvious the focus on the water is made, I think the director must take everyone who watches this movie for a complete idiot. And he might be right because I feel pretty dumb for having spent my money on this so called horror movie. The movie has a decent plot but how the scenes come together wasn't thought out well enough, which in addition to a hastily written script and cruddy acting, intertwined with a lot of things that seem to be put in just for the heck of it, really make Cabin Fever a flop.",Cabin Fever

281,savagerocks,Stylish,6,21 September 2007,Cabin Fever wasn't at all what I expected based on the title. I thought it would be a slasher movie. I would have rated this movie higher if it didn't go overkill on the gore. Movie has sort of a nostalgic feel to it. Especially when the movie sets up the story. It has a 70's exploitation flick feel to it including the gore. Not a slasher flick at all. The water is tainted with a nasty bacteria. Anyone that comes in contact with it winds up losing their skin literally. They also spit up blood which can infect more people. Very well done movie even with the gore factor. I'm not sure I like the set up for a sequel though. You see a lot of people get killed by this stuff and no one really understands what caused this so you get the idea that there may be plans for another movie.,Cabin Fever

The performances are outstanding, particularly Rider Strong (who has come a long way from ""Boy Meets World""), with other standouts including Cerina Vincent, in a role that redefines the often stereotypical ""bimbo"" persona (her character, Marcy, is both sexually aggressive and likely the smartest among the film's protagonists), Joey Kern, in another redefined archtypcal role (group leader turned coward, showing the same comic skill he demonstrated in Broken Lizard's ""Super Troopers"") and James DeBello and Giuseppe Andrews making most of the audience forget their earlier roles in the regrettable ""Detroit Rock City.""Alternately scary (what wouldn't be with an original Badalamenti, assisted by Nathan Barr, score) and funny with outrageous gore effects rivaling earlier work by Sam Raimi in the ""Evil Dead"" Trilogy and Peter Jackson in his earlier work (pre-""Frighteners).

But overall, the movie is absolutely terrible, with one of the worst endings I have ever seen in a movie period.  What was the point of the joke with the old man at the end?  Stupid!!!!

""Cabin Fever"" is Eli Roth's loving nod to the horror genre; Roth, a well-spoken man whose defense of this genre on Fox News is perhaps the best I've ever heard, loves films and understands a fact that many are resistant to admit: there are few ideas that have not already been done to death, especially in horror. Rather than attempt (and, no doubt, fail) to reinvent the genre he knows and admires, he is paying homage to it here; connections to such films as ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""The Evil Dead"" are rampant, and Roth uses them with an aura of gratitude rather than thievery. It is unfortunate that such a good film is kept from being great due to the limitations of its decidedly small budget.Read My Full Review Here: www.thechrisclarkblog.blogspot.com",Cabin Fever

BUT, when it was all said and done Cabin Fever was pretty entertaining and had good macabre humor.It is a great example of early Eli Roth's horror visions (before he became a lap dog of Hollywood production). The acting is a bit thin and the character actions are contradicting. But what you ultimately get is a strange world full of goofy and most times annoying characters and a slight twist of the regurgitated ""teens on a camping trip from hell"" idea.

The cuts are so dumb, leaving the viewer in total confusion. Cliché camera shots like the one which follows the tubes from the reservoir up to the cabin. No building up of tension, you can foresee the scare by two minutes. Oh, what scares ? The only thing that was mildly scaring was the girl getting stuffed into the shack.But this could have been sooooo much better. A lot more paranoia between the group members (Eli, just watch Carpenter's ""The Thing"" please) and leave out this stupid policeman who IS NOT COOL ! The bunny man IS NOT COOL !

291,Tito32,What the f@&% ?,5,11 September 2004,"Since this movie ""came out"" I have read pages and pages about it. Reviews were mostly great,critics called it a new,fresh and different approach to teenage horror films. Even Peter Jackson loved it! How can director of Brain Dead be wrong, right? Director was called amazing talent and the future of horror,the film was getting four,even five stars in many film mags and it was simple-if you like horror movies like I do after reading so much about Cabin Fever I just had to see it.So I ordered a copy,got it,turned off the lights,got stoned and armed myself with tons of popcorn and Coke and everything else that goes with it. And after about 90 minutes of ""entertainment"" I just couldn't believe it.What the f..k is all the fuss about? I mean nothing, absolutely nothing about this movie was new,original,scary or disturbing. With better actors,better script and better director this movie could have been something cause basic idea isn't all that bad. But when you're watching 20+ years old brainless teens running around,reasoning and behaving like they are 12 (and amazingly stupid 12 year olds at that) you just give it up and lose interest. It is simple,if you really are that dumb ( as people in this flick were) you simply deserve to die! It has nothing new or even good to offer,you have seen it all before. It is just another so-so teen horror movie and if I was to describe and point out (which I am not going to do) all the mistakes,stupid and annoying things in this movie it would probably take an hour or so. This movie will probably be awesome to most of those between 11 and 17 but for the rest of seasoned fans it has absolutely nothing to offer besides another 90 minutes wasted in search of something truly good. The director is newest talent, the ""future of horror"" they say. I already feel sorry for horror and for its fans!

This is not one of the best horror films of recent years, there have actually been quite a few very good ones recently, but it's fun entertainment in the style of the comedy/horror films that you might have seen at a drive-in in the '80s. It's the kind of movie I wanted to hate: as I watched it, I couldn't help but be constantly reminded of better films (particularly ""28 Days Later""), but it never loses its sense of fun. There's something really good about cheese that knows that it's cheese, and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's not all that scary, not hilariously funny, not really great at any one thing (except maybe shock- the gore gets pretty nasty)...but it's just good enough at a lot of things to make a pretty entertaining movie.

Seems like a big split on this one - half of us think this film is rubbish, half think it is a wonderful revitalization of the genre. For me, the only interesting scene was when Dennis the Pancake Kid started going all chop-socky on Bert. It's the only scene I feel like watching again - I was laughing so hard I almost fell out of my chair. As a result, everyone I've described this film to now refers to it as ""The Pancake Movie.""The gore is well-done, but not particularly shocking or disturbing (it's no ""Ice From the Sun"", but then again, it's not a low-budget independent film, either). The acting is OK given the weak dialog.The biggest problem: THE STORY. It doesn't create any sense of fear/tension or paranoia. Here's how I would've re-written the script: 5 kids enter a cabin in the forest. There's a flesh-eating virus out there somewhere, which they quickly discover when they find several rotting forest creatures/people. The problem is, no one knows the source of the disease. Is it the water? Do you get it from transfer of infected blood? Is it in the air? A food source? A bite from an infected animal? Etc. The kids are trapped in the area (for some reason I'd have to make up - like some hicks steal their car and they're 20 miles from the nearest town) and start going crazy wondering who is sick, creating a growing paranoia. In the end, they turn on each other and kill each other one by one. None of them actually HAS the virus, but they're so scared of getting it they go nuts. Then, when only one kid is left, he/she befalls some unfortunate accident and gets infected, and we finally find out what the source of the virus is. Now wouldn't that be better?Instead, we get a dog who eats people (huh?), trigger-happy cops, etc... if you want to watch a decent, recent horror film in a rural setting, check out Wrong Turn instead.",Cabin Fever

Anyway when it comes to making a great horror film, I think its imperative to have a great score,that is if you plan on having one at all. The music I believe was done beautifully, I really liked how they did the opening credits. Another thing that is interesting to me is the concept of an invisible killer. On the initial viewing I kept thinking at any moment a masked killer is going to start offing them one by one, but instead its a virus! Perhaps its a metaphor for something else. I agree with the other viewers there are scenes put in the movie that just don't make sense other than to add comic relief. But yet this would be a trademark for Eli Roth.

306,filmguy_07,"Eli Roth gave me a disease, and I think it was herpes",1,12 January 2006,"When I first was introduced to the TV spots for Cabin Fever, I was thoroughly excited by confusion. I asked myself, ""What exactly is Cabin Fever about?"" I will say that the ambiguity attracted me, as the main part of what I saw was young adults were in constant peril and apparently dying harsh and horrifying deaths. And hell, a slasher movie junkie like me couldn't pass up on the possibility that another franchise was about to come to fruition. I rented the DVD and nestled down to what I thought was going to be horror movie gold. Instead, I think Eli Roth gave me a disease, and I think it was herpes of the horror film.The first thing I noticed about this film was the fact that it was a NOBODY cast, and I mean NOBODY. When Rider Strong (who has an awesome f*cking name), the supporting character from Boy Meets World, ends up being the only one with enough Hollywood muscle to play the lead, it is safe to say that your cast is full of nobodies. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, as some horror film actors begin as nobodies and turn into massive stars (Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Bacon, Johnny Depp... and so on). However, this pack of no-names swung the other way with the most horrific acting since Kevin Costner starred in... well, anything. Thirty minutes into the film and I felt that Sleepaway Camp's Felissa Rose deserved an Oscar for Best Actress *shudder*.Since I couldn't depend on acting, I felt I at least had plot to save the film for me. The fact that it wasn't the slasher film I thought it might be didn't bother me. A killer skin disease is actually not a bad idea (thank you Resident Evil for the T-Virus). But ultimately, what did this movie do in terms of plot? The only two things I remember definitively is the girl with the chewed up face, the dead dog bursting, and the worst sex scene ever filmed, and I have seen Pamela and Tommy's video (easy joke). The plot was insanely boring amid the death and paranoia, and the acting made the plot even more ridiculous.After 45 minutes of viewing this film, I was begging the cast to die so I could sulk over the $10.50 I lost at Movie World. I paid late fees so I could watch this schlock. Cabin Fever is undoubtedly a horror movie that should have never made it to a big screen, a small screen... hell, the screen in Eli Roth's mind.

I believe that they did a really good job on everything, even though in 2002 the sfx might've not been as good. The acting was also appropriate and doesn't distract from the story. It's a GOOD movies, don't get me wrong, but because I've watched all the other Cabin Fever movies and all those zombie apocalypse movies, when I watched this, there was nothing new to me.So to people who have never watched movies along this storyline or genre, then I highly recommend your watch this movie and all the other original, classic horror films.

From the characters to the plot, everything works. Joey Kern as Jeff kills it. Giuseppe Andrews as Deputy Winston? Kills it. James DeBello as Burt is great as well, acting in a similar way to his role in ""Detroit Rock City"". Rider Strong as Paul is probably the weakest out of the actors for me but I can still get behind his performance. Cerina Vincent as Marcy is great and sexy. Jordan Ladd as Karen is the only other weak point I can see. Even the rednecks from the store work.Everything is how it should be and it's hard for me to try and see anything wrong with it. I just wish it were longer.The score is amazing and I'm not sure if anyone else noticed where some of them originated from. ""Last House on the Left"", anyone? Yes, some of the scores are from that 1972 film directed by Wes Craven. Those particular scores are by David A. Hess who stars in ""Last House on the Left"". It fits perfectly and just adds to the greatness and eeriness of this film. The other sounds and scores throughout the film are great, creepy and just make the movie flow so well.The vibe, the shots and the scenery in this film are excellent.

The story is set when a group of young fresh eager to die bunch of kids arrives to this cabin, where sex drugs and alcohol is just waiting to justify their horrible and painful death.

The moral in movies like this is always the same. If you don't follow the social rules, you will die die die! And society will fall fall fall. I think it's unfair to send out messages like this in the time we live in now, cause you will not die horribly if go out with you friends and have a good time. I would rather see a movie where a group of high society leaders, and stoke holders, fire 1000s of people, exploiting minorities and hard working people, die horrible instead!

I thought it was going to be a typical in the woods serial killer and had no idea about it being about a virus. That makes all the more creepier and more gruesome. I just don't understand why they didn't shoot Grim's dog the first time it came back and tried to attack them. Although it wouldn't matter because they all had the disease by then in the first place. I like the hill billy guy in the store before they leave. The one that looks like Santa Claus. Also what was up with that kid Pancakes? I didn't get that part. But it ended pretty cool and I think they could get away with making a sequel and it might be worth watching. I like diseas movies and all that and it gave the the creeps the part when the girl was in the bathtub shaving her legs. That was pretty bloody. This is the best HORROR movie beside House of 1000 Corspes and that is in a different range of horror. I give it a 10 for have it's own fresh ideas and all the blood was pretty good.

The best bit in the movie was the credits when I was finally free to leave in the hope that the next movie I went to see would be better.  It probably isn't possible for any film to be worse.",Cabin Fever

Some good gory goodness, along with some very interesting scenes and a few likable characters couldn't save this film that just doesn't really go anywhere with it's direction (the characters just run in circles) and the adding of characters that were both annoying (the Rednecks), forgetable, and some with no point to them (like the druggie with the dog).

(Or perhaps there are slightly more anchovies than good bites.) The basic plot has lots of problems. E.g. where does this disease come from? Why does the dumb dude just leave that sick guy in the woods? Does a cabin really get water straight from a stream, without any filtration? And the characters do dumb thing of course. And some things are just predictable (such as the ending with the one guy who survived but then met his fate as he was celebrating). But the weird humor throughout is just enough to save the movie from going straight into the campfire. The movie is really schizophrenic in this regard; at times it purports to be a real horror movie, and at others it makes a mockery of itself. E.g. early scene where the clerk asks the guy why he would steal a candy bar, and he answers ""nougat""; that's funny. And the scene with the rifle in the store is funny; very long gap between set-up and delivery of that joke.

Director Eli Roth presents us with familiar characters and situations and a plot which lacks the fine tuning necessary to suspend disbelief long enough for us to question the logic of why people do what they do. The geography is a problem too - at some points the kids appear to be in the middle of nowhere, at others they appear to be just across the way from various homesteads which might potentially offer assistance. There's a presumably deliberate attempt to evoke a sense of the menace of ""Deliverance"", but the hillbillies seem more like caricatures than characters.

It's alright to pay homage to some of the greats, but one also needs to stand on his/her own without COPYING VERBATIM its predecessors.

The premise certainly sounded good and I was hearing some good reviews (albiet from internet sites). Well, to say it bluntly the movie was garbage. You know in horror movies where the person (i.e. victim) is doing something stupid and you want to yell out "" Hey idiot, keep running"" or ""Don't go in that house!"" EVERY scene in this movie is like that. This kids have to be the dumbest people on the planet. When one of your friends gets horribly sick from a virus, I personally would run until I found a hospital and if they couldn't help, I would call or assume they would call, someone who could help. The kids throw their friend in a tool shed and slowly all contract it. Sure there was some gore, but I have never wanted the ""victims"" to die as much as I did here.The script was poor, the acting subpar, the jokes fell flat, etc. etc. All of the people who have given this great reviews are seriously misleading you people. They might try to play the ""I understand what this movie was trying to say"" card and dare you to, but it is a ruse. There is nothing to understand.

I've shied away from watching ""horror"" movies of late because they are just the usual studio production line crap. Cabin Fever is a welcome change--a nod to the old days of true cult horror. I've read many reviews--most of them calling it ""stupid"" and ""insipid,"" among other adjectives. Anyone who uses these words to describe this movie simply does not understand the genre. There are many types of horror movies, and to compare this to a ""serious"" horror film is a travesty, robbing a true future classic of its value.Cabin Fever would have been terrible if it weren't ""stupid"" and ""insipid."" It's a tongue-in-cheek homage to the great cult classics. Tongue-in-cheek doesn't work very well if the retarded viewer tries to judge it as a serious horror. If that's your intent, skip this one. It's not for you. But for everyone who loves chips with their cheesy horrors, drop everything and see Cabin Fever. For those of you who worship Sam Raimi and Pre-LOTR Peter Jackson (Don't get me wrong, the trilogy rocks too), this movie is certain to end up in your DVD collection.So to sum up, here's my review: As a serious horror = 1.

And also, the way that those in town deal with a character's presence with the line ""If you're sick, that's your problem.  But if my son is sick, that makes it my problem.  We need to stop the problem!""  This akin to the way many straight people handled the exspantion of AIDS outside the Homosexual comunity.

That effect could not have been reached had the movie taken place in a densely populated area. This could of weird off behavior is typical and is seen in a lot of movies which take place in small town deep in the middle of nowhere.The psychological basis of the group dynamics used for the main characters was actually quite flawed seen from a scientific point of view but that shouldn't be a problem with a movie like this.

Now I love my horror and many so called ""gore fans"" will tell you that bad acting is what horror movies are all about. Well I'm sorry to burst all those horror guru wannabes bubbles but guess what guys - bad acting is bad acting, it doesn't matter if your watching Pride and Prejudice or Toxic Grannies - it is horrible to watch and in the case of Cabin Fever it was truly terrible. The cast failed to bring anything to their cardboard cut out, stereotypical, bland, middle American characters. The usual suspects of tough jocks and cheer leaders, nerds and rednecks, not one of the characters had a single memorable line. If only the gore had been as horrible it might have had some redeeming features.Gore: well no, not really - remarkably tame. Anyone who has watched Cannibal Ferox would say that this was barely even blood thirsty. Only a true newbie to the horror/gore fest genre would find this movie overly gory, all the gore fans will just be bored by it. The projectile vomiting of blood, something which was done far better in 28 Days later and incidentally the actors in that film could actually act, supposedly makes this film gory but really it is just lame.Cabin Fever brought nothing new to the genre, a typical rehash of old horror films with a modern setting and annoyingly stereotypical American teens played by people 10 years older than their characters. The woodland setting was straight out of a Friday the 13th movie. The disease ridden locals idea was about as unoriginal as you can get. Nothing about this movie was remotely scary. The only reason I can recommend watching this movie is as a cure for a particularly bad case of insomnia and I actually did fall asleep trying to watch this - no joke, middle of the day I zonked out and woke up 2 hours later, rewound the movie and realised why I had fallen asleep in the first place.A couple of redeeming features: it was so bad it made me laugh, although I did not laugh at one of the cheesy jokes that were written into the movie..... all in all, do yourself a favour and watch 28 Days Later, Friday the 13th or Cannibal Ferox since these movies did it better and they did it first.",Cabin Fever

The fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior were so far fetched, added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low-budget disaster. Money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film.

332,neil-591,Pancakes... pancakes.... why pancakes???,2,5 November 2007,"This is a comedy film. Which is unfortunate because people call it a horror movie. They are wrong. It is one of the funniest movies you will ever see. If you are looking for a laugh, look no further. If you are looking for horror or suspense, you had better not see this. The film centers around five friends who are celebrating the fact that they have finished finals by going to a remote cabin to party. They apparently drive very far from their college because it is spring in the college town and either fall or winter by the time they get to the cabin. The town, as is required by Hollywood law, is inhabited by simpletons who have lots of guns and make weird faces and seemingly racist remarks at the college kids, one of the young locals even goes so far as to bite people who come near him.Meanwhile, a man who lives in the woods (?) sees a very, very dead dog but decides to poke it and prod it in an attempt to wake it up. The dog, as near as I can tell, died from a reaction to the squirtgun it swallowed which was full of fake red blood which shoots the man in the face and makes him sick with Icky Dead Dog Skin Virus. So, then we see the Hot Brunette Chick's breasts and we learn that the nerdy kid has a crush on the blonde girl who plays the part of the Hot Chick Whose Breasts We Don't Get To See. The Kid With The Green Hat finds a rifle and shoots at a man whom he mistakes for a squirrel. Seriously, I'm not kidding, he thought the man was a squirrel. The man, as it turns out, happens to have Icky Dead Dog Skin Virus and asks for help. Like all people, The Kid With The Green Hat just pretends it didn't happen and goes back to the cabin to party some more. A random stoner kid shows up and he has an old dog with a stupid name. Then he leaves and never comes back, but, the way I see it, he fell in the Fountain Of Youth and subsequently died but his dog got younger and became vicious as a result. For the rest of the movie, when it gets too boring the dog comes back and they shoot at it but somehow miss. Other times, when it is too boring, the Hot Brunette Chick shows her breasts again. After awhile, they get sick from drinking the water - not from being exposed to blood, mind you - but drinking the water. Which I think is weird because the first guy got Icky Dead Dog Skin Virus from the blood. In case the audience starts to ask questions, like, for example, why aren't they getting Icky Dead Dog Skin Virus the way the first guy did? the nerdy kid runs through the woods yelling ""it's the water' 'it's the water'.Now, at this point, the movie starts to make no sense and the characters start doing increasingly dumber things.This was a film that cost 1.5 million dollars to make and made over 40 million dollars in it's domestic theatrical run alone. That fact alone says that we, as a country, need electroshock treatment. It also shows that if you have nice breasts in a film, it really doesn't matter what the movie is about. As near as I can tell, about halfway through the screenplay, the writers decided to just make it a comedy. Once they ran out of excuses for the Hot Brunette Chick to show her breasts (four times total, BTW) they opted to go for straight up comedy. Consider the scene in which the Kid Who Bites People screams 'pancakes' and then performs a kind of kung-fu/dance routine... before biting someone. Also, the seemingly racist man is revealed to not be racist in what I imagine the writers considered an M. Night Shamalan-ish ""twist."" They also, as is required by Hollywood law, added a bumbling simpleton deputy but they had the common sense not to name him 'Dewey'. My feeling is that if the Hot Chick Whose Breasts We Don't Get To See actually showed her breasts that this movie would have made 80 million dollars. In conclusion, the film gets a '2' because it had two breasts in it.",Cabin Fever
333,budwheizzah,A plain horror flick with a slice of lime,6,3 January 2007,"OK, so I somewhat agree with the negative critics that this isn't the horror film of the year, but why so many 1/10 ratings?! In my opinion, rarely should we ever rate a movie 1/10 or 10/10... It's too extreme and most often is done out of overreaction.This was a plain horror flick with some very shallow characters, but it's not like this movie deserves to be rewarded with a big bucketful of vomit.Overall, I liked it. Cabin Fever brought to me some of what I expect out of a horror movie. Some thrills, a few cheap scares and good disgust. In fact, the parts where I felt most uncomfortable were BEFORE the actual gore even begins.I've said this in my review of Hostel, which I saw before this feature: Eli Roth is a sick bastard. If you can't deal with sick bastard's movies, don't ever watch any Eli Roth art ever again and please, I reiterate: Don't post a damn review about his work!! I watched this movie with zero (minus one) expectations. Since I don't ever read the ""specialist's"" opinions nor watch critic shows with mindless, pretentious people who call themselves professionals ranting or praising about what they see at the movies, I had no idea what awaited - except for the fact that I had seen Hostel and thought it would be cool to explore Eli's work.The plot is the definite pro in this movie. Making the main character in your movie be a disease was a pretty cool idea to me. Plus, given this couldn't be an easy task in any given way, especially with such a starve-to-death budget, I have to give more than a crummy rating. 6/10 it is.The cons? Well, they're bundled right in with the pros. The acting is a bit ""grade 1 of theater school"", but movies such as Friday the Thirteenth and others also had bad actors in them, and still made killings! Personally, it just makes me enjoy the character's deaths all that bit more. Also, it feels like the movie is arranged so that the main characters can't ever get help from normal people and doctors through the entire time. I can understand that they're in the middle of bumhole nowhere, but in these days, you can almost GPS emergency rescue over, provided by NORMAL people from pretty much anywhere.Anyway, the point is this isn't that much of a horror flick, but it does the job, and I completely enjoyed it.

However, the approach is a bit different.  While the movie is extremely bloody, and some parts are pretty shocking, the fact is that it's just all really funny.  The characters were believable enough, but they were also presented in an unfavorable light that made them easy to laugh at.  It was as if Eli Roth did not take any of his characters all that seriously, so he had no trouble making fun of them.  The humorous twist made watching this movie a highly enjoyable experience. Also, I found it intriguing how after the initial encounter with the diseased man, the only threat was the possibility of being infected.  I think this helped the film to seem more realistic and more terrifying than if it had gone in the more typical direction of having the kids fight off the same already-dead people for the duration of the movie.The film contains a number of tributes to classic horror films that are sure to please any fan, yet is still original and brilliant in its own right.

The gore is of high quality and can really make you cringe, but as the film progresses, gore becomes the focal point until it's so over the top that it's comical at the same time. Once the plot falls apart and the gore no longer commands any interest, the movie drags on like a boring, wounded animal.

Point #1: There are two very attractive girls in the film, and, point #2: There's some nudity... But even those two very valid points don't make this film worth seeing.Now, on to the real review. The movie was obviously very low-budget... maybe Eli Roth called Uwe Boll for some directorial advice? This is evident in the lack of any well known actor or actress, the lack of quality special effects (not so much ""special"", just that the blood looks like red food coloring mixed in with water) and the lack of any damn bit of sense.The cast was less than stellar, and that reflected in the overall quality of the film.

Is it supposed to be funny? Its not, as far as i know, but it has its moments where it is quite hilarious... although i assume it is not intentionally so. Lets be honest, the idea of a flesh eating virus, hidden teenage love, and Daniel (Pancakes!) has no horror value in it at all. However, this movie was subliminally funny at times, for example, pancakes, another example, the star was that one kid from Boy Meets World, another example, the main conflict was some kids running away from a virus that eats your skin... and a final example would have to be at the end of the movie when they are shipping out the water... Oh, how i laughed so hard at that final scene... yes, I'm being very sarcastic.Why was this movie even made? Honostly, what in Gods name were they thinking? Did they think that the idea, which seems like a poor Resident Evil plot rip-off, would make for a good movie? If this was indeed the case, they were terribly, terribly wrong.In conclusion, Don't SEE THIS MOVIE. If i wasn't such a jerk i would leave it at that, but i am, and i am also enjoying this too much, it provides me with so much ammo to have dandy ol' time amusing myself. This movie does indeed fill me with horror, the very thought of this movie brings about fits of suicide and violence... Until i realize that, in hell, your torture isn't fire and brimstone, it is watching Cabin Fever, House of the Dead, and Get Rich or Die Trying' looped for the rest of eternity.",Cabin Fever
340,Orific,Something must be wrong...,1,21 September 2006,"It starts like a good old movie a la ""Scream"": a few handsome young people going to a place isolated from the rest of the world, a plot you suspect not to be very smart, but which may at least be entertaining (especially with the help of some ""hoola"" scenes...), and of course lots of gore plus even more ""boo ooh"" scenes (you know: when the sound track tries to startle you by sending some high-pitched notes in your ears).But as it goes on, this film turns out to be less and less entertaining, and more and more of an almost unbearable inanity: the plot crumbles in an incoherent bunch of scenes which get worse every second, the actors seem to lose their conviction at the same rhythm, the scary-to-be scenes end giving you a painful sensation of ridicule, and worse of all, you acquire the conviction that the people that made this... thing MUST have had the intention of making it exactly as insulting for your sensibility and intelligence of spectator, as it is.

With that said, I decided to watch it a second time and give it another chance.

343,bunior,What was the point of this movie again?,3,25 February 2005,"At the video shop, it was a choice between this and 'Feardotcom'. I'd heard some good reports about 'Cabin Fever', some claiming it as one of the best horror movies of 2002, and it had the delectable Jordan Ladd in it, so we went with this.Five friends travel into the wilderness of redneck-America to spend a week of debauchery in a log cabin. After a run in or two with some of the locals, the kids start getting infected with some sort of flesh-eating virus, and the battle for survival begins, with friendships put to the test, a very healthy helping of gore and nudity, heaps of randomness, and possibly the smartest character in a horror movie to date (when his friends get infected with the virus, he grabs a couple of six packs and takes off running).Performance-wise, 'Cabin Fever' is not outstanding, but certainly not terrible. The expletive-littered dialogue is ropey at times but provides a few decent laughs throughout, and when the virus starts taking hold of people, the make-up job is really quite impressive, providing probably the best shocks (and I use that word lightly) in the movie. On a whole it's fairly predictable but not altogether bad. There are some random, usually quite amusing moments - the ""party"" deputy; Dennis, the Karate Kid; the old man in the shop; and director Eli Roth's cameo as stoner Justin (""Yeah, he's a professor..."") - but you're given the distinct impression that these were thrown in purely to flesh out the script to make it feature length, and thus have no real impact on the story. The last five or ten minutes descend into a farce, and the last scene in the shop is pretty unnecessary.It's very bloody, it's mildly amusing, and there's enough nekkidness on show to keep the morons entertained, but other than that it serves no obvious purpose. Just about watchable, thanks to the two gorgeous female leads, and, of course, Dennis.",Cabin Fever

Add a group of fresh university graduates with absolutely no common sense, a stereotypical script, loads of red grape juice thickened up with mono-sodium glutamate flowing out of every orifice, the local hermits, social outcasts with rotting teeth and weird children, a mad German shepherd dog, and the statutory single sex scene with no-show camera angles, and you have an instant turn-off-and-never-watch-again film.

I wish I had missed this one, not because it was scary, but because it was just disgusting and there was no plot behind it.  There's no explanation of what the virus is, all you know is that one guy gets it and everyone else starts to get it, too.  There's no real struggle to stop the virus or to stay alive (you know...PLOT), and it's like they go out of their way to make sure that you hate all the main characters and don't care when they die.  I was hoping for something along the lines of The Ring, where there are plot twists and a freaky cause of all of it, but there's nothing like that.  This is just a gore flick.

346,bitchyrita,"Just okay to watch once, but nothing I would ever see twice.",4,7 May 2009,"""Cabin Fever"" has a plot that is very simple. This is it: A guy cut up a sick infected dead dog. The guy gets infected of course. Then the guy transfers this virus to out-of-towner kids who are coming into town to screw around. The kids then die off one by one with horrible rashes where their skin peels off.Then the townspeople find out about what happened and instead of calling in help to save the kids or quarantine them, they decide to kill whoever is left alive, and burn the bodies. That's the whole movie pretty much.The beginning with the dead dog carcass was kind of a disappointment, because it was obvious what would follow. Although this movie has been bashed repeatedly (sometimes fairly, sometimes not fairly), the one thing I think was pretty scary was the scene was this.... When the couple were about to have sex in bed and he's touching the girl's thigh. It is bloody and then you realize she's been infected down there. That was gross.Overall, this was not a bad movie despite being a little too much on silly side. There were a few good twists that made it worthwhile. The twist at the end was also not bad, and was unexpected. The big problem is that the characters are not likable and you don't care if they get infected or not.",Cabin Fever

One could conceder this partly a unique idea as we haven't seen too many horror films that actually have a disease as the ""villain/menace"".This movie is most importantly stylish. The camera work and editing is in fact outstanding and i can see Roth has an eye for this kind of things. The eerie atmosphere is cleverly created with slightly moving camera and fantastic score in the background.

There's only one problem...This film isn't entertaining.This type of slash/gore film should not be striving for anything more than a creepy, scary time at the movies. It should be fun and self referring. It should have people laughing at the moron characters that can't seem to get away. It should never take itself too seriously, or think for a second that the film might be saying something more than it really is. This is Cabin Fever's problem. There is a time where everyone has finally seen all the blood and guts they can handle, and there is really nothing left in the script but badly written characters, a predictable and boring plot line, and gallons of fake blood to clean up.This film attempts homage to the old slasher flicks of the 70's and 80's, but really only reminds us how we wasted our time watching them.

356,13fan,One of the best of 2002,10,21 May 2004,"Cabin Fever was not the best horror film of all time or anything BUT it was one of the best of 2002. It had the same formula of movies like Friday The 13th, kids going out to the cabin for some ""fun"" and getting knocked off one by one. The only difference here is that instead of a homicidal maniac it's a flesh eating virus. Now I am a Jason fan 100% I like to have a villain to root for, but I was really pleased with the way this film was told. It was scary and funny. Nice combination for a horror film that does not want to take itself too serious. The acting I will admit was not Oscar material but in my opinion it fit the movie. Cabin Fever has its moments that really freak you out a good example of this is when the blonde girl catches the virus and all her friends as well as her boyfriend put her in a shed away from them, they fear they'll catch the virus. But it shows how in extreme circumstances people will turn on the people they love. I gave Cabin Fever a 10 because it did what it was supposed to do.

I know, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but some people are fu*kin idiots. Sure this film wasn't ""scary"", but really- be honest with yourself, is any movie since the 80's scared you that much? I mean, Honestly. You may jump a few times, but you are not scared, and if you watched a horror movie with no jump scares, the scares are on account of ""shock"", and those are rarely any good. There are few filmmakers that can use this horror technique without immediately going into cliché category. Takashi Miike is one of the few lasting filmmakers that can still disturb me with his visuals, and its a shame he is not more known in the states. The scream/Friday the 13th/Halloween franchises are a joke, they are just keeping those films going because stupid teenagers (not all of them, I will admit... but most of them) keep fu*kin paying to see them. Cabin Fever is one of the few movies that tips it's hat to the old horror movies of the 70's-8o's without completely giving up all hope for a plot. This movie was meant to be scary, but not terrifying. I mean, you are a fu*kin lier if you tell me that you don't find the concept of a skin eating virus the least bit scary. And this whole ""the characters act like psychopaths, and no one would actually act like that when put in that situation"" argument is bullshit. Of course they would act like that! People are fu*kin selfish, man! You would do the exact same thing when put in that situation. The scary killer is not the flesh eating virus, but the teenagers themselves. In fact, looking back, I don't think one person died from the flesh eating virus in the film. All in all, I think this was a great horror film in comparison to the sh*t we are subject to on a daily basis. Eli Roth IS the future of the horror genre. That is inevitable. Lets just hope he doesn't fu*k it up more, which I highly doubt. Hostel looks excellent. In conclusion, I would just like to say, no- Cabin Fever was not horrifying, nor was it a classic.

Some of the stuff is more subtle or original and it might take a second or third viewing to fully appreciate certain parts. Most of the movie had a very cool and original look and feel that I liked very much.  The comedy of the film worked very well for me too.  There were a few moments that were a little too disturbing for my taste but most of the movie was right on. I will be very excited to see what this director does next.

After using this site for many years to check out whether a film was worth watching or to challenge my views on it I sat down to watch Cabin Fever.90 minutes later and I think I would rather stick pins in my eyes than watch this again. Yes I did expect it to be bad from reading the reviews but not THAT bad.This film is so bad that it has inspired me to register with IMDb so that I can post my first ever score and comment. If I stop just one person from watching the film, then my life has not been in vain...Oh yeh, about the movie: The characters were so unlikeable that I was glad when they all died. There was no tension, no build up, nothing except ludicrous (why are they doing that) situations. What was the deal with the dog eating people, why didn't he die?

I first saw it when it was released in theaters and HATED it, avoiding it and its sequels like the plague depicted therein. Tonight, 13 years after its release, I decided to give it another go.And I still just DO NOT get the appeal. Unlikable characters who garner no sympathy from me, intentionally weird supporting characters who seem to serve no real purpose other than to be inexplicably weird, and a plodding pointless story that has no real mystery to be explained or suspense as to what might happen. It reminds me of something a student might put together in an attempt to make a sloppy, unappealing homage to true pioneers of the strange in film like Lynch, Cronenberg, or even Tarantino. The difference is that those three (and others I'm not going to take the time to list) had a POINT to the oddities and strange, obnoxious weirdos they wrote and put out there for consumption.

379,squaggle,I'm hot for this one.,9,25 July 2003,"As far as I'm concerned, watching a Horror film is one thing. Rewatching is another. The Horror's I enjoy rewatching are normally blood-soaked rhapsodies full of black humour and snide references to everything under the sun. This is one of those films and I will gladly rewatch this film any day.Beginning with a simple enough premise of 'woodsman gets infected with virus, begins to infect a cabinful of good-looking teenagers partying in the woods,' this film spirals out of the normal cliches and conventions: making an original movie whilst still giving a wink and a nudge to Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead et. al. Within thirty minutes of the beautiful title sequence, people are shaving skin off themselves, firing BB gun pellets at squirrels, drinking beer all holiday, quarantening each other in shacks, and killing a disease-ridden hobo. I mention such specific things because this is a film that does not 'broaden' things over with large Spielbergian brushstrokes: every character has a life of their own and you will walk away discussing the old Shirley Temple bottles in the bottlestore or a rung of a ladder breaking instead of the artful references to your favourite movies.A good Horror should have original kills. Check. A good Horror should make people laugh whilst making them jump out of their seats. Check. A good Horror shouldn't give away its punchlines or sporadic murders early. Check. A good Horror should always feature a badly written review from a gobsmacked 17 year old who can't figure out how to describe the fun he just had watching this movie and meeting the director afterwards at the Wellington International Film Festival.

381,bort13,Excellent horror flick -- woefully underrated,9,5 January 2004,"Spoilers contained within.I'm aghast at the comments here, I adore this movie.  I think there were a bunch of folks who went in with expectations that went unfulfilled. Perhaps viewers don't like their expectations being messed with -- I certainly do. A film that looks shallow at first glance but has good depth is always welcome.  I can't believe that other viewers didn't see the thought that went into this well-made film that I did.It being way to early to tell, I won't gush over Eli Roth's genius or anything, but he is a student of horror.  His script is a horror script and not intended to be particulary scholarly or thought-provoking.  It's uncomplicated and serves to move the plot along, it's not the focal point. It also guides the viewer into perceiving who the characters are and establishes the necessary fatal character flaws that get everyone killed. The plot, as well, is horror-uncomplicated: after the setup, everybody run from the menace, we're all going to die.It's Roth's juxtaposition of menaces that makes this movie fabulous.  The virus is scary enough, but what about the rampaging hillbillies or incompetent police?  How about a drifter's mad dog growling at the perimeter as they fix the broken truck?  Tainted water passed around by characters, blissfully unaware?  Even an over-the-top horror tribute to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre which turns out to be nothing but a fireside ghost story.  It is in the combination of threats and the innocent characters' confusion that the real horror begins to shine through, and the audiences fear starts growing.Then there's the gore -- truly horrifying gore in shocking clarity. Scenes are often established with enough preamble to encourage the viewer to anticipate the blood; when it comes, it roars past your expectations and sends you into tense discomfort.  Best makeup effects of 2003, truly awful to behold. [An aside: one viewer I recommended it to vomited after the shower scene. Granted, he was a bit hung over, but it serves as example: this film is not for the weak of stomach.]The love interest between the main character and his longtime friend at first glance seems banal, overdone.  But the cinematic shots that set it up and the nearly-consummated romance undone by blood help increase the romance's potency.  The stupendous review montage at the end of the film sends the beautiful blonde offscreen in horror glory.  Without the jaded impression the viewer gets of the initial romance, the shock at the end has nowhere near the force.In what I see as a tribute to Blair Witch Project, the characters all begin to turn on one another, which helps prompt audience anxiety.  There are several particularly effective scenes as their friendship decays into survival instinct.  As the turmoil increases and the frienship decays, there are several cathartic moments where individuals realize the shaky base of their relationship in the first place.And, of course, there's ""PANCAKES....  PANCAKES"".  Good old Dennis, I laughed and laughed.  Truly great horror films are interspersed with grim humor.  Cabin Fever is exceptionally funny in parts.  Without this, the ride never lets up for the viewer and a constantly, ever-increasing fear factor becomes numbing.  This film makes sure to pull the viewer up for ""air"" with laughter, before plunging you back into the bucket of gore for more fear.At some length, let me sum up by saying this is worth a look if you like horror.  Do not be swayed by the nearly universal antipathy here, many of these bad reviews may stem from offended sensibilities.  Oh, and there's a coda at the end of the credits.",Cabin Fever
382,Mordimah,Witness the Roth of Eli,9,30 July 2003,"I was lucky enough to see Cabin Fever at a screening in Sydney where there was a Q&A session with director Eli Roth after the viewing.The film itself seemed to have many homages to the classic horror movies of the 70s/80s, which was reassuring. This director knows his film history, and knows how to share that knowledge without ever going overboard.Cabin Fever is relentlessly gory. And considering 'the killer' in this case is a flesh eating virus, it makes the film all the more entertaining and keeps your hands hovering over your eyes- with the occasional peek.There is just enough humor without going overboard- mainly coming from ""the jock"", who likes to shoot squirrels, because 'they're gay'.As for the discussion after the film, Eli came across as a down-to-earth person who knows his stuff.

384,mvoyer,70's Horror?,5,16 September 2003,"When I think of 70's horror, I think The Exorcist, Texas Chainsaw..., Last House on the Left, Halloween.  Eli Roth has been quoted as saying he was upset that films like Wrong Turn were improperly sold as tributes to 70's exploitation horror.  Well, he can now be upset that his own film Cabin Fever inexplicably falls into the same category as Wrong Turn...false advertising.  This is the same disposable horror garbage as just about every other ""new"" horror film to come out lately (sans 28 Days Later).  I'm amazed it was hyped like this.  Cabin Fever isn't even a horror movie.  It's a comedy ala Meatballs with some blood thrown in to make it more marketable. If I knew I was going in to watch some more stupid characters that I don't care about get more stupid as the ""plot"" rolls along, maybe I wouldn't be so hard on this movie.  But with the way this baby has been talked-up, along with Roth's off-the-mark comments everywhere I look, I can't stomach it. And, unfortunately, that's got nothing to do with the ""gore"", which is pretty tame for a film that is supposed to follow in the footsteps of Evil Dead.Whatever.  I know.  I should put up or shut up.  But when you wait over a year and a half to see a ""real"" horror movie and all you get is Cabin Fever, you're allowed to be a little more than just disappointed.  Had Roth taken his idea (which was a good one) seriously and not tried to ham it up so much with inane bits, it could have been a success.

The dialogue consisted of simply curse words and the characters were immature dirt bags that I wanted to see get sick. They constantly over reacted and were prone to violence that made no sense. They fit every cliché in the book all they did was curse drink and have sex. It was terrible and I am a big fan of horror movies. This movie was a terrible b film that the studios decided to pick up and market and sucker us into seeing it. The studio knew it was terrible but was able to sucker some of us into the theaters and made some nice money on it. Do not give them the satisfaction save your money and go rent a nightmare on elm street flick. This movie is simply deplorable. Also every horror movie now portrays people from the south as crazy old hicks who carry shotguns and hate outsiders. I would think this stereotyping is really getting to the people of the south.

394,Wisedog,"Point made, and well done at that",9,24 January 2004,"Cabin Fever has been given some pretty poor reviews by a lot of people who are watching it to be scared, sickened, and shocked. I sat down to watch it very skeptically, not a fan of horror movies, or the grotesque in general. But Cabin Fever proved itself to be more then meets the eye.First, let's get the essential stuff out of the way. The characters were well done, even though some may not take to them. Anyone who's been through college in the past 5-10 years can tell you the depictions are (unfortunately) quite accurate. The cinematography was great, and gave the movie an appropriate feel.Now on to the important stuff. The movie, marketed and filmed as a horror film, is really about the human condition. Of course, the premise is simple. Kids in the woods. Car broken down. Strange Disease. But what's really brilliant is how Writer/Director Eli Roth turns this setup for a white-bread film disaster into an excellent movie.The themes are obvious to anyone who's watching it for more then blood and boobs. Canadian-made, I began to think that Roth was trying to tell Americans something. Perhaps it's because I agree with him that I catch them so easy, but the point is well made, and the message is well needed today. I'd rather not give away the vehicles Roth employs, and leave it to the viewer to see for himself. Of course, the point-to-grotesque ratio wasn't quite in balance, but I suppose, had it been done tastefully, it would have defeated Roth's entire point.In short, this was a great movie, with a lot of thrills, but to be fair, I'm giving Roth the benefit of the doubt on his characters and plot. To really appreciate this as more than a horror film, be looking for more then a thriller when you see it. Hopefully, you'll be more than pleased.",Cabin Fever
395,jzac79,Not as good as I expected,5,28 January 2006,"Cabin Fever by nouveau writer/director Eli Roth is the story of five college kids (three male, two female) who, after finishing their final exams, go off into the woods to a cabin where they'll spend a nice holiday of drinking, sex, and the usual stuff college kids do. Instead of finding the perfect way to top off the end of school, one of them finds a hermit man in the woods with some kind of serious disease. Let me let you in on a little secret: it's NOT SARS! You can guess where it goes from here. This film started off fairly promising, but in the end the lack of real character development really hurt what was potentially an interesting idea. You don't really care for characters who are all clichés of what we've seen in too many other teen horror flicks. There was a good opportunity with the lead male and his love interest for the writers to develop that relationship so we could understand it more and thus feel sympathy for both of them. But, it never happened. As for the rest of the characters, what little we get to know about them only reveals they are pretty shallow and one-dimensional. Thus, making them pretty cliché-like.It's very similar to other far better films such as: ""The Thing"" (1982), ""28 days later"" (2002), and ""The Evil Dead"" (1981). What made these films work was dark humor, which this film has shades of, character development, and effective creepiness and scares, which ""The Evil Dead"" has in spades compared to this one. ""The Evil Dead"" is given homage to in the end credits here. Out of these three ""Cabin Fever"" is most similar to ""28 days later."" What that film has that really makes it stand out from this one is two dimensional and realistic characters who are actually smart (a rarity in horror films). Instead of creating two-dimensional characters the director here would rather gives these characters every opportunity to have sex. This film does have a dark humor type ending that works okay. And it manages to be kind of creepy in some places. But, as I said before, you don't really care that much about the characters so it doesn't matter who dies and how they die. It did have the potential to have some pretty interesting psychological warfare going on with the characters alienating potentially ""sick"" friends and thus echoing how paranoid and cruel mankind can be towards one another. But, it didn't manage to pull that off as well as other films have in the past, namely ""The Thing."" Some places in the film did manage to be pretty humorous and so it succeeded at times in that respect. Overall, the film is mildly entertaining and it's a decent first film for Eli Roth. I just hope that his new film, which is produced by Tarrantino, is better. The ""fake shemp"" used in the end credits is an obvious reference to Sam Raimi. This film even though it tries comes nowhere close to achieving what Raimi did with ""The Evil Dead."" He pulled that off for a measly $150,000. And so, referencing Mr. Raimi seems like a cheap way to put yourself in the same category as he is. The bottom line is: this is a decent horror film that is worth seeing, but don't let your expectations run too high. James Sutherland.",Cabin Fever

The movie is complete garbage, and I'm not sure if it was meant to be a spoof on horror flicks or a comedy. ""What???"" must have slipped out of my mouth over a dozen times in the film. There's this one scene where a crazy little kid bites one of the characters and starts to do kung-fu kicks and crap. All of this is followed up by a quote about ""pancakes."" 'Sean' from Boy Meets World was in the film, and that was kind of funny (plus the one actress was pretty hot) but this film really sucked. It wasn't scary, it wasn't creepy, and it wasn't really that funny either. Stay as far away as possible from CABIN FEVER...what a horrible movie.",Cabin Fever

(Finally, a tribute to old-school horror!)",6,9 January 2003,"Put simply, it's about FREAKIN' TIME.I had just about given up on the horror genre -- too many years of ""Jason XXVIII"" and too many teen soundtrack vehicles had come and gone for me to pay attention. I can list on one hand the horror films that ACTUALLY scared me: The ORIGINAL Friday the 13th, the ORIGINAL Halloween, the ORIGINAL Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc. -- see a pattern here?Hollywood had forgotten a simple lesson: LESS IS MORE. You DON'T need a $45 million budget, half an hour of CGI, and a soundtrack featuring MTV's Buzz Bin / TRL to make a decent horror film. Whatever happened to woods? Whatever happened to country folk and stillwater ponds? A big THANK YOU goes out to Mr. Eli Roth for giving today's X-Box brats a healthy dose of what they'd been missing for years: old-school horror.

402,huppmam,Cheap but effective. Everything that makes a cult classic.,10,13 September 2003,"From the very start, 'Cabin Fever' promises to be a formulaic horror film for moviegoers that like to be surprised, but not too surprised. No attempt was made to identify the main characters, five young adults celebrating the close of their college career. All of the characters are exactly what they appear to be, with very few exceptions. The title spells out the premise pretty well. These five young adults rent a cabin and run into a diseased man from the woods. The double entendre serves the film well, as the plot is the film's greatest asset. It deals with Xenophobia on many levels. The unique angle is that the real scare revolves around what it would be like to be the subject of xenophobia, especially if the people who were afraid of you were people you needed if you were going to survive. The illness serves up plenty of gore. The actors believably communicate the fear of being fatally ill. Less believable, but still effective, is their portayal of people who want to avoid getting ill at any cost. All I will say is this: Cabin Fever, catch it!",Cabin Fever

406,Kultek,splatter splatter gratuitous splatter,4,3 August 2003,"Just saw this film at MIFF, and I've got to say I'm disappointed.  Sure we laughed, we jumped, but we left unimpressed.Eli Roth has done a very good job of putting together a great college death trip, but it is far from horror.  There is some gruesomeness, one or two shock scenes (but I'll get to that), but very little in the way of horror... I mean what is so scary about watching some dumb US college kids klutz around as they wait to die of a flesh eating virus.The humour was very hit & miss, some of the subtle ironies (ie the main character unwittingly giving his lover virally infected water) were fantastic, but most of it seemed over played for gratuitous yuks.But the whole thing smacked of Eli Roth's ego, and a sense that he was trying to prove that he is cleverer than the audience.  There are two moments that triggered this thought, for me:1. The whole town turning from 'inbreds' to jovial country folk is a bit off key.  OK, the whole thing is a joke, and played purely for laughs, and without any horror apart from, again, the subtle irony of simple folk quaffing deadly lemonade.  I can't help but feel this was thrown in so Eli could go ""betcha didn't see that coming"".2. The one jump-out-of-the-seat moment in the film is the introduction of Eli Roth's cameo.  You are expecting to see the infected hobo, but no, we have Eli turning up with a bag of dope.  Yup the scene was mildly funny, but completely out of touch with the rest of the film.  In fact, completely unnecessary in the whole film.  Why not have a drunken grizzly bear, or a swarm of squirrels seeking revenge.  It seems that Eli did this to make his own appearance more memorable in the whole film.I wanted to like this film, and there were moments that I was laughing with the crowd, but too many moments where I laughed at the film and without the crowd.  And it wasn't the gore that put me off, I saw this a day after seeing ""May"" another, and far better, Lions Gate release.",Cabin Fever

It's a great B movie, but the acting was excruciating.  The whole begining of the movie was horrendus, there must of been 4 or 5 different songs crammed into the first 5 minutes of the movie.  And the ""grim"" guy was absolutley pointless, he came out of no where.  The cast was just wrong I think, it seemed like they were just reading lines, espeically the 2 girls and the dumb friend with the rifle.

Im not lying. It was that lousy. A group of college students go camping in a cabin to celebrate the end of final exams. Then they meet some sick hobo who infects them all with a flesh eating virus. Don't get confused, it may sound like a good movie but it isn't. The director tried to hard to make it scary but just adding a lot of blood and a few gory scenes. They tried to hard. Simple as that.

410,unrealday,Strangely funny...,6,21 April 2008,"When I first watched Cabin Fever I was totally in to that sort of movie.. But when i started to watch it it started to give me a weird feeling, like this is pretty scary yet strangely funny.. Surprisingly the acting was pretty good save for the overabundance of F this F that F you's and so on.. I sort of like how it was made with that psychotic sort of sense of mind, maybe it was the extremely Dark Humor. Personally i loved the very end when the dude who went into hiding returns only to find all his friends dead. He then gives himself a wave of gratitude before walking out the back door and getting shot up by the Homicidal police force..Another personal favorite is the hippie cop... Overall however the movie is crap. It was cheaply made, which is very obvious right from the beginning, and the language is enough to shut it off alone.

The technical aspects are fine; the acting is decent and the photography is very good.  However, all the gore in the world can't make an interesting and engaging film.  I don't need likable characters, just semi-believable ones.  And I'm even fine with a movie disregarding plot for the sake of cool visuals and ambiance, but this just rambles.

Awful performances, no suspense (at the 40 minute point, I'm STILL waiting for something, ANYthing scary to happen...), and a script that's bad beyond belief...there's a review I read that refers to the 'rifle joke' at the general store, and how the first part of the joke might have been funny, if not curious, on it's on...but to bring closure, and 'explain' the joke the way he does...and as THE LAST SCENE...??  It almost made me wish I had seen it in a theater, so I could have boo'd even louder then I had originally intended on booing it, BEFORE that final scene!!Yeah, it's a first film, but it's pretty clear: Eli Roth is a hack.  He may talk a good game in interviews and he's a protege to a genius, David Lynch, but he's a hack all the same. What's worse, is that with all the clamor to praise this piece of garbage, he seems to believe his own hype.  Like that other horror-film hack WS Anderson, Roth is utterly clueless in how to establish and manipulate tone, let alone go back and forth between horror and dark comedy.  For that, go back and watch Evil Dead or Dead-Alive...Cabin Fever is dismally boring, gutless, and most unforgiveable, excrutiatingly full of itself.",Cabin Fever
413,chocho-10,What was that???,2,25 August 2008,"I like horror movies and when I heard about this movie first I was very excited. A film without an original killer but with a flash-eater virus!? Jeeez, that's sounds crazy! The idea is quite original and might be the base of an extremely powerful movie. But in the real life, it all goes wrong...... for the first, the plot is just stupid. The first murder in the story (the homeless guy's burning) doesn't even make any sense. Why do they kill that? But the most ridiculous part is still the end. The villagers are starting a manhunt against the ill ones, and kill them with no reason. Why don't they just call help? Like the ambulance or something? Senseless, again. And if we are here, then I must reply on the characters too. They are so unsympathetic that I've never seen before. There was no one who I could like or sorry in the whole movie! Why is it like that? The creators wanted to show us the today's youth's sins, or what? And why are so much nudity scenes? Oh God... this is just bad.I mentioned the ending before, but the real last scene was just ruins more. They wanted to ride the X-files ""open ended"" style but it just doesn't work as well. It only makes the movie more worse...I don't even know why I gave 2 points... Perhaps because the camera handing is not so bad...Chocho",Cabin Fever
414,frankmilne,A flick about human stupidity and urban fear of the contry folk,3,20 September 2003,"Today I took in a double feature of first run films. Jeepers Creepers 2 and Cabin fever. I chose to watch JC2 because I was ""saving the best for last"". I had heard a TON of good things about the film Cabin Fever and was actually looking forward to seeing it. I often agree with the reviews in the NY Times (though not always) and there were several other reviews comparing it to that of Evil Dead 2, etc... In the end I found myself curious as to what movie they were watching.*** The following is to discuss plot elements within the movie and does contain spoilers ***I like a good horror flick. No, wait.. I LOVE a good horror flick. But the probability of finding a good one is growing more and more dismal. What writers/directors/producers seem to forget is the fact that it's not the blood and gore, though fun and cool in and of itself, which scares people. It's the ability to relate to the main characters then feel for them as they face the horrors presented in the course of the films. To this end I believe Eli Roth started off quite well. I went to college. While there I went on various road outings with my friends. Camping, Spring Break, Mardi Gras, etc... Yes at this point I can relate. I imagine most other people can to since I am not the single target audience on the United States of America. Where things began to go wrong for me was when the entire group was approached by the first infected man. Not a one of them had a rational thought. Now of course in the heat of the moment they all could have had a group panic that resulted the way it did. Fine. But then the movie proceeds with each main character making a series of idiotic decisions which can only be explained away as methods to keep the plot moving.For example, if my friends were in danger I would not hesitate to walk 5 miles, 10 miles, even 100 miles at night down a country road to find any sort of help what so ever. But the actors in this film walk to a house in broad daylight, find it empty and decide to go back to the cabin to drink beer. Also upon finding that their friend is infected with a serious disease decide to stick her in a shed then wait till morning to seek help. Hello, start walking someone! So yes there was the plot element of the mad dog that might have been placed there to keep them in the house or something. Give me a break. Also if they are so afraid to catch what the blond chick had why didn't they quarantine her in the room she had already bled in so much? Why move her to a shed? It's not like they are going to sleep in that bed. It wasn't gallows humor, it was just dumb. Also after being in the shed for more than a day instead of hitting the pavement during daytime and walking to the nearest town to find help, the love interest of the blond and some other chick decide to have sex. These events and the events similar lead me to one conclusion. Eli Roth made a film portraying humans in general as being selfish.Should I disagree? Should I impose upon Roth's vision of general natural human selfishness by saying at least one person should have been selfless and tried to help their comrade? The answer is no. As an artistic vision if the Writer/Director wishes to deliver a certain message then so be it. That's what art is all about right? But then other problems arise in the course of this film that go beyond artistic license and enter the realm of stupidity. Eli Roth also wishes to add an element of urban fear of the rural folk. By rural folk I don't only mean the hillbillies that run the local shop and teach their young retarded children Wu-Shu Kung fu, but also the law enforcement agencies. When the law learns of the disease the put out a radio call to shoot anyone they see infected on sight. Ummm, yeah. Then when they actually have one at the hospital the local physician suggest they take him to a bigger hospital, where the sheriff decides it'd be better to have the infected person killed. Ummm, right. What about the Centers For Disease control in Atlanta? EVERY law enforcement agency in America knows about this. EVERY hospital big or small knows about this. If an infectious disease breaks out they leap at the freaking phone in an effort to get it off their hands and get the hell out of dodge. It wasn't even mentioned and explained away in the film. It's just stupid stupid stupid. Stupid. Did I say stupid? It was ignored to create the silly irony at the end of the film. I don't know what's more goofy about that ending. The fact that the body was bleeding out into the river which would then contaminate the lemonade... or that those dumb kids found it easier to fill a 9 gallon Gatorade cooler with river water than just run tap water into it! How do you make lemonade from river water with leaves and fish and water moccasins and crap? What is this? Funny?Funny is the noise I made when the black people finally showed up. Actually no I'm not even going to touch that. That was just an ill-conceived disaster.Sorry if there are allot of type errors in this. I wrote it quickly and I'm fairly sure that my 8th grade English teacher would berate me for not having a driving focus through out this commentary. I suppose this is just my general disappointment with the film. What surprised me after my little movie marathon was that I found I disliked JC2 allot. But I expected to.

They play on political correctness, our unhealthy fear of viruses, everything.

418,3dollarbill,Nothing Like I Expected And I Wouldn't Have Wanted It Any Other Way,9,12 September 2003,"I had been waiting about 2 years to see this movie. I remember reading about it when it was in pre-production and thinking it seemed like a good idea. It was filmed right outside of the city I live in so that made me want to see it even more. I finally saw it tonight and it was absolutely NOTHING like I expected...it was better. I had heard it was very scary and very gross. Both are true. Being an avid horror film fan, I have seen so many scary movies that they don't really scare me anymore. I simply watch them because I love them. However, several times during this movie I did jump. If a movie can make someone who has seen EVERY horror movie jump, it has to be good, right? It also had some very gory scenes but, to be honest, I found the scenes that only implied the gore rather than actually show it to be MUCH more disturbing...sort of the old ""what you don't see is worse than what you do see"" concept. What I was not expecting was how truly outrageous and off-the-wall this film was. On more than one occasion I was left with mumbling ""what the f*** was THAT??!"" I guess this really SHOULDN'T surprise me because David Lynch was involved with the making of this film and let's face it: ALL of his own movies tend to leave you scratching your head...to say the least! The comedy was also an unexpected, yet welcome surprise. It gave it a sort of ""Evil Dead 2"" feel. I feel duty-bound to add here that contrary to the rumours this film is not really ANYTHING like the first ""Evil Dead"" unless you consider that both films take place in a cabin in the woods (and if that is the only reason for comparison then you might as well say that ""Evil Dead"" was similar to that god-awful waste of celluloid with Morty the giant puppet called ""The Fear""). Several of the cast and crew were at the theatre promoting the film (since it was filmed here). It was fun to talk with them and then see them running around covered in blood on screen. I think Cerina Vincent may well have a promising career ahead of her. Overall, my friends and I decided that we may very well have NEVER seen a movie quite like this but we truly loved it. The whole theatre was laughing one second and screaming the next. I highly recommend this film so go see it!

420,njmeyers,Doesn't live up to the hype,4,15 September 2003,"I had very high hopes for this movie. Maybe that lead to my opinion of the movie when it was over. First of all this movie should not be mention in the same breath as The Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw, etc. It is an ok low budget horror movie at best.With that said there are a couple of things I did enjoy about Cabin Fever. I thought the acting of the five main people was pretty good for this type of movie. The premise was great, it was refreshing not to have teens running from masked killers with knives. I really liked the fact the movie did not tell you how the virus came about of where it came from. I think it is way better if you're in the dark having to guess about.However, I did not care for the script at all. I thought most of the dialouge seemed forced and mechanical. Also for all the ""hype"" about how much gore this movie had, I was greatly disappointed. I was hoping for Dead Alive gore and this movie did not deliver anything close to that at all. The worst thing about the movie was the secondary actors. Except for the guy who played the general store owner they were some of the worst actors ever filmed.In the end this is a good movie to rent if you've already seen Halloween, Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw, Zombie, 28 Days Later, Dead Alive, Nightmare on Elm Street, John Carpenter's The Thing, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Alien, American Werewolf in London, Dog Soldiers & The Blair Witch Project a hundred times...",Cabin Fever

Just some contagious flesh eating virus.  Ooooo...  Cover my eyes, I can't watch.There are some ethical, samaritan implications to the characters in the movie, which is probably why the critics dug this movie.

429,nat365,how was this scary again?,1,11 July 2005,"This movie was absolutely terrible. I am a movie lover, and I have seen hundreds of films, and this is the only one I can truly say was awful. The virus thing has been done well before, but this was not done well. You knew that it was only a matter of time before they all had the virus. There was no loophole, no way they could avoid it. Therefore, the suspense lay in waiting to see how they realised it, and how gruesome it was.***** SPOILERS *****Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of gruesome killings, but not this. I mean, come on? You're watching her shave her legs. Watching her shave her legs. You know that the razor's going to take off her flesh. You know it's going to happen. She's still shaving normally.... AAAAH... not. Everything was done for gore and shock factor, and not one thing gave me a real scare.However, there was one thing that I did enjoy, and that was the ending. The fact that the guys who simply killed the remaining kids, rather than trying to help them, then dumped the bodies - (very carelessly, I might add. They could have got the clever ones, who realised that dumping a contagious body in a source for drinking water is a no-no, but instead, they get the stupid ones to dump the body) - will now get the disease, and it will spread everywhere, is a very ironic, funny and clever ending.However, it's the only ironic, funny and clever thing in this whole movie. I may also have seen it as the best bit because the movie did, in fact, end. My advice, unless you are a fan of gratuitous gore, very little plot, and no suspense (apart from waiting to see how the next oozing bloody wound will manifest itself) then avoid it. Or just watch the last fifteen minutes. You'll get the overall point of the movie, and the best bit, all in one.",Cabin Fever
430,ReelSplatter,An unfairly judged cult flick,8,14 October 2005,"This film has been unfairly judged! It is in fact a very good 80's style, Splatter, B-movie. It shys away from the self referencing humor plague that Scream started and succeeds in being a very strange splatter/comedy. Several reviews have been posted that say the characters are unlikable and do illogical things through the course of the movie. The characters are very good representations of the youth of the late 90's. The hunting squirrels joke is a perfect example. When asked why he is hunting the squirrels, the character replies, ""Cause their gay"". How many times have you heard a teen respond to a question in such a manner? Eli Roth has captured very well the essence of of being a teenager in this very cynical society.The actions the characters take are, in context, very believable. Ask yourself, if you were in a situation where you had to deal with the very likely possibility of becoming infected with a horrible flesh-eating disease, would you be the first to lend a helping hand to the infected? Another thing that has been trashed by many reviews is the strange sense of humor the film has. The pancakes scene in particular. The humor in the film is the strange sort you would more likely find in a Troma film (not the sex/toilet variety, though)While it's not for everyone, the sense of fun the movie has about itself is more suited to hardcore B-movie fans than mainstream audiences. Eli Roth hearkens back to a time when movies weren't always about psychological thrills,bad twist endings, and pretentious artistic ""meanings"", when they were about fun. It's a great movie to sit around with some friends and watch. So please, don't judge it so harshly, just because it's a movie to be taken straight with no shocking hidden meanings or twists. Hopefully this film will find it's audience with the cult movie crowd. Highly recommended to anyone with a love of B-Movie cinema.",Cabin Fever

The story begins, much as many others, featuring teens in the woods, so we already know this isn't going to touch on anything new. But, very soon, the action, and gore, become secondary, as the characters go out of their way to do the most ridiculous, and unrealistic, things. Of course, this being a horror film (or at least attempting to be one), the unrealistic is common. However, films such as ""Evil Dead"" and especially the recent update of ""Dawn of the Dead"", have proved how well a film with an initially clichéd storyline, can be woven into a classic. Unfortunately this film has not, opting instead to go with cheap shocks, mundane special effects, and incredibly wooden acting.",Cabin Fever
434,sbergstrom1,"Please, Don't Take This Film Seriously",5,5 January 2006,"Eli Roth is shaping up to be the Kevin Smith of horror films.Mr. Roth, an admitted fan of the genre since he was 8, has shaped his passion for gore flicks into Cabin Fever, a lopsided tribute to the senseless violence and campy thrills of the horror movies of the 70s and 80s.Cabin Fever is his first attempt at a mainstream film. Note: FIRST ATTEMPT.There's nothing in this film that sets one up to believe that this is a serious attempt at horror. In fact, each character is a staple of the horror community. Horny couple? Check. Drunk ignorant party-animal? Check. Clean-cut All-American Boy (Rider Strong, from Boy Meets World)? Check. All-American Boy's secret love interest? Check. Lots of bizarre in-bred rural-types? Checkity-check-check-check.Roth shares his love of bad horror with us via Cabin Fever. All he really needed was the three B's (beer, blood, and breasts), and he delivered in spades. Except for that third one. There wasn't enough of that. Bad Eli. No cookie.Cabin Fever is your basic toss-back-a-few-beers-and-enjoy-the-ride type of film. It only requires enough cognitive function to operate a DVD player. If you're looking for depth, extensive character development, and well-written drama, you're looking in the wrong section of the video rental store.This is also very NOT for the family. As with Kevin Smith, the language is quite riddled with expletives. If it's ever edited to air on network TV, expect it to run about an hour shorter. Of course, Mr. Roth, ever thoughtful of his audience, does include a ""family version"" of the film on the DVD. It's a must-watch. It's also quick.This film is a tribute to cheese. 100% Grade-A American cheese, to be precise. While I'm certain that Eli Roth has a classic in horror within him, just waiting to erupt, I'm equally certain that he didn't intend this to be it. Just be patient.",Cabin Fever
435,mike_deprado,5 star nonsense - 1 star movie,1,21 April 2006,"OK let's get right to the point. We have five recent college grads (must have majored in the F word) going out on a weekend camping trip. They run into someone who is in need of help, but instead of trying to assist him, they decide to set him on fire instead. Nice bunch of people. Next some of them start go get sick - must be something in the water at the cabin they are staying at. However the neighbors seem to be OK. Oh well, when things start getting really bad, they lock up one their companions instead of getting help (try the neighbor by the way). Some locals don't take a liking to them. They chase one on a high speed romp through the woods for many miles, until the truck breaks down. Somehow ten minutes later he shows up at the cabin (how he could find it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). Another of the brain surgeon type at the cabin realizes something is amiss so he hides out in a cave to let this blow over. He then decides the next day to return to the cabin believing it must be some type of shrine. He is giddy with relief that he survived (he must have thought it was a 24 hour bug). Unfortuneatley he is met by some not so friendly police officers. Another couple decide to have sex while the flesh eating bug is working its magic, and then the women realizes she needs to shave her legs (taking a lot of the diseased skin with shaving cream). Anyway you get the idea. Nothing makes sense here. These are five people I would not want to be friends with. I was rooting for the flesh eating bacteria.

The only redeeming part of the entire movie was when the credits rolled at the end.With no plot, a let-down at every turn, and acting that was itself a joke, Cabin Fever was nothing more than a studio's attempt at seeing how many people it could sucker into the theater on opening weekend.

442,serpentraptor,cabin fever was absolute sh**!,3,1 September 2006,"yes, my summary says it all! When i decided to watch it, it was because of all the hype and reviews 'terrifying!' said one review. well whoever said that must p*** himself when someone says 'boo', cos cabin fever was one of the worst films i have ever seen. the other comments of this film in this forum have said it's a copy of other horror movies, it's badly done, and it ruined it's potential with unrealistic scenes and weak characters- well guess what? I agree! i sat down expecting a scary disturbing film- what did i get- a load of sh**, that's what. the concept is quite scary (some teenagers in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, being killed off by a flesh eating virus) but it was handled really badly. the films humour is NOT humorous, and worse, it's inappropriate. also, the characters keep making stupid irrational actions, which are unrealistic even if your in a panic. i kept thinking about what it would have been like done well, and it makes me feel disappointed. this Eli Roth needs shooting. 'hostel' a newer horror movie by Eli Roth, again, like cabin fever, looked great, but i'm told it's sh** (i'll have to see it myself). so it seems Eli Roth makes up (or steals) brill horror ideas and then makes a mockery of them. i wish i'd been given the chance to make cabin fever. however, there was one bit that i liked. it's the bit when that blond women is making love to that guy (the more friendly couple out of the teens)and there's that really euphoric sweet music, and then... well i won't spoil it, but it's quite horrific, and it did make me feel quite sad, because they had a closer relationship than the brunette woman and the other guy. and there's the bit with the woman who looks like a skeleton cos of the virus- that was sort of horrific. the ending had quite a good twist, but it was done poorly, which made it absolutely rubbish. see for fun, not to be scared. guess i'll have to carry on my fruitless search to find a 'SCARY' horror film...",Cabin Fever

There are so many scenes in this movie that makes one just stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew just stopped caring at some point.

Its the story of 5 friends who go camping in the woods after finals and they catch this flesh eating virus that kills them.

448,lisa_trevor_protoge,I Was Scared of THIS?!?!?!,3,28 July 2008,"So, when I first heard of Cabin Fever, it had just come out on DVD, and my idiot neighbor described the plot to me. Being a nine-year old hypochondriac, I was absolutely terrified and refused to shower for weeks. The plot line of the movie continued to haunt me throughout the years. Fast forward to October '07. I was watching 30 Scarier Movie Moments on Bravo, when they proceeded to discuss the scene in which Marcy shaves the diseased skin off of her legs. I flipped out, turned off the TV, and called my boyfriend, at the time, sobbing. I'm not usually scared of things, but the reminder of my 9 year old trauma managed to do so. Being a slight sadist and a mass opportunist, he, of course, made me watch the movie when it came on Sci-Fi a week later.Upon seeing the movie, I laughed like a brain dead hyena, and felt undeniably stupid. I had, up until then, never seen anything so ridiculous. Cabin Fever is chock full of terrible, stolen horror movie gimmicks, useless characters, interchangeable comments, plot holes galore, and predictable, unneeded plot twists, giving you the feeling almost of a Family Guy spoof. It ranked up there with Friday the 13th in the unintelligent-to-the-point-of-vomit-horny teen-meets-machete category. The only moment in which the movie felt scary is the opening credits, where the sound of flies buzzing as the background color changes from parchment white to a bloody red, imitating the virus at work. The horror in that, and that scene alone, is infallible. Yet, the rest of the movie's ill-combined efforts to shock, disturb, humor, and arouse the audience fall flatter than the beloved pancakes of the redneck Karate Kid. For me, some of the king making scenes of Cabin Fever have to be when Paul and Marcy infect each other, almost deliberately, by sleeping together, accompanied by the ingenious line ""You just want to grab the person next to you and ****, since you know you're gonna die anyway,"" and when an infected, well- shaved Marcy is torn apart afterward by a hungry dog for idiotically running away from the cabin two feet away towards a LOCKED shed to escape. And then, if that isn't enough, the dog tore her to shreds, leaving a foot intact. Last I checked, dogs were incapable of eating my skeletal system. Unrealistic, obvious, and just plain stupid.All in all, Cabin Fever is a worthless piece of garbage that is funny for all the wrong reasons. But if you're a masochist like me, you might enjoy the obvious deaths these stupid college kids endure every time you pop in the DVD. Seriously, it's funnier than Scary Movie could hope to achieve, folks. And yet they're actually trying to scare you.",Cabin Fever
449,c-lake4,The WORST movie I've ever seen in my entire life!,1,27 December 2008,"I've rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on DVD without reading any reviews about it. So, after 15 minutes of watching I've noticed that something is wrong with this movie; it's TERRIBLE! I mean, in the trailers it looked scary and serious!I think that Eli Roth (Mr. Director) thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid, the movie would be funny...(So stupid, it's funny...? WRONG!) He should watch and learn from better horror-comedies such as:""Fright Night"", ""The Lost Boys"" and ""The Return Of the Living Dead""! Those are funny!""Cabin Fever"" is THE reason why I registered to www.IMDb.com so I can release my thoughts of discontent about it.I've decided to watch the movie a second time >AAARGH!< and make notes for my partial ""review"" to show how foolish the movie is. ""Resident Evil"" (horror) or ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" (comedy) I can watch over and over again and still enjoy! But this...!How bad can a script and a director be??? This bad. Here are the awful scenes in chronological order:In the early scenes we see Henry, who doesn't realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead-glazed stare is dead!The movie doesn't explain anything about the blonde long-haired kid who like to bite people.And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question (""What's wrong with the woods?"") is ""nothing"". The script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for ""suspense"".Then the ""smartest"" of the 5-pack, Bert, almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire. He meets now-infected Henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the ""F-word"". Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks awfully ill. Bert:""Don't make me shoot you!"" (he forgets to add: ""...with my BB gun!"")Bert heads back to the cabin but how about that? He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex, but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk! Marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire Bert had started earlier (A moment of clarity for a change?) Bert doesn't mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gun.Later, as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire, another weirdo shows up with his dog. (Maybe that's what the warning about the woods is all about? It's filled with weirdos...and their dogs!?) They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis. (Their brains are completely intoxicated! No wonder why they are all so DUMB!) This is the last time we'll see this forgettable character...alive!Henry shows up at their cabin, (NOTE: He was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin!!!) looking worse, almost like a zombie, covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor. But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker. He gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition. Henry almost seems smart enough to drive the Hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard, seats and windows. The Fantastic Five come out running, armed with: a BB Gun, a knife, a baseball bat (*huh? Ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods???), a poker, and a (insecticide?) spray-can, ready to combat the single, unarmed and terribly sick man. (clever script!) Bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his BB Gun, which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth. ""What else am I supposed to do?"" Bert yells in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck's windows instead. Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say: ""He's coming towards us!"" (Thanks for the info, dumb broads, I can see that! But I don't think he wants to do you any harm!) Marcy sprays in his eyes, making Henry yelp! And our ""hero"" Paul touches Henry's arm with a burning log from the campfire, which they recklessly left burning while they were INSIDE the cabin! (Where has all that wisdom gone? I guess the cannabis had started to take its toll!:-) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away, screaming.The following day, Bert and Jeff head out for a mechanic. And Marcy decides to ""go for help"" all by herself, in the woods, as Paul stays behind with Karen...Doesn't that sound idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already ""going for help""!I skip my comments now to how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where she's going!? Anyway, she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and, like in most horror movies, walks inside the cabin saying:""Hello? Is anyone there?"" Bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her (and me at first). And along comes Jeff, as well. How did THEY get here!? Did they swim across the river??? Do you see how brainless the script is!?Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin. He somehow doesn't notice the blood on their truck. This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the DVD out. (Before I take my own eyes out!...Now, THAT's funny!)If you liked this movie, do yourself a favor and watch ""Fright Night"", ""The Lost Boys"", or ""The Return of The Living Dead"".

Listen to the commentary of the director, it is hilarious! I don't know if he realizes it but the line stroke after stroke in the shaving of the legs scene in commentary is intentionally or not, funny as hell. I have always been a horror movie fan, as is the director, Obvious upon viewing. This director is destined to great things and well deserved. This is only my second review, I only write when I feel strongly upon a subject. This film needs more than one viewing to appreciate it, the not in your face underlining humor! I wish the director much luck in the future, he didn't quit. I wish I had it in me to have followed my dreams like the director has (I think at 41 it is to late, to start over) .

I think I heard some people toss their cookies in the theatre :) The special effects and atmosphere redeem any fault to the plot (Where did the virus/bacteria/plague come from, what's the story behind the hillbillies/strange child, there was more potential here) Also the acting held up for the whole cast, compared to half the other teen-horror movies around.

Both are about remote locations and extreme cases of violence and murder.  The thing that I find most simliar is the tone and style in which the murder is presented.  The movies also show what happens when normal people meet extreme situations. The music is also very simliar as it is almost ticking away at disaster. The movie also does what few movies of quality have the gonads to do, they end the movie without a point being made.  Movies are meant to entertain while some do educate or provoke discusion some just have no point and were never meant too.  The only meaning I see from  both movies is that when we are in stressful situations it cause us to do the wrong thing.",Cabin Fever

There are countless tributes to older horror films, and it brings back a certain light heartedness and fun to horror films that have been absent for years. The gore factor is unbelievably superior to any film in the past 5 years. The important thing to remember though is that this movie was not made to compete with other films for best picture. The director (whose appearance in the film should clue you in that hes not taking too much serious ) is not making a film to bend your mind or scare you more than any other film, he is just trying to make you have some fun. Which many of you obviously never do considering your opinions on this movie. Just remember the film is called Cabin Fever and it has a member from Boy Meets World in it.

These things are only there as an attempt to compensate for a shallow, pointless movie.

It is as if people try to find something good about this movie in case they have missed something that 'industry types' saw. Do not be fooled by the bidding frenzy; this is crap. David Lynch took his name off because it was crap not the lame story that it would negatively impact on the director. I can only hope that the pairing of Donnie Darko director, Richard Kelly, for Eli Roth's next project can inject intelligence into this childish mind. Roth claimed he was trying to inject life back into the old slashers but he has only put the genre back two decades while the Japanese and Koreans rush ahead with intelligence, humour and vigour. And he needs to get out more if he thinks there is no sex in horror movies. His sense of self importance is so appalling that suggesting his movie has any merit is akin to suggesting PeeWee Herman is a great comic.

I suppose the film lost all hope when *****SPOILER***** the main male character turned ""postal"" and seemed to stop worrying about who he killed next.

474,SleepingGiant99,Could have been much better,4,31 December 2005,"This film in my eyes when I watched the first time I was ticked about wasting time on it. I went back and forth form liking it to hating it and back and forth. For me that was the rise and fall of it what's worse is when I got done with the movie in the first place and I knew I didn't like it I wasn't positive on all the reasons why. Then in an effort to either to understand why I didn't like it or try to like it I watched it a couple more times. Now I can tolerate it, but I have some serious issues with it.This movie seemed like the kind of film that wanted to strike a cord with us that this could really happen. But the film is bogged down by moments of unrealism or drastic stupidity on the part of the characters in the film. The gore and the subject matter were great and not ever really explored in the film and the paranoia in the film is almost indicative of ""The Thing"" and for some of the smarter characters you genuinely feel sorry for all the stuff that they go though but for those good things there was a bunch of things which brought the film down for me.The biggest of it is that the characters are stupid and the main characters only together seem to have a full brain between them. They seem to do the dumbest crap in trying to survive this or cope with this, why I can only speculate. Examples are this (spoiler alert); if there is a flesh eating virus would you shave your legs? No one would this was added just to add gore, I like gore but not for stupid reasons or the sake of adding it. If there's a flesh eating virus around and you find a body rotting in a lake would you climb down a splintering ladder to get a closer look? I would have accepted the idea he got the disease randomly better then this, until this moment I thought this character was smart and worth surviving. If you have a flesh eating virus would you AIM for people to vomit contaminated blood on? And NO DOCTOR in any hospital (I would have bought a local doctor), have let a contaminated patient to be gotten rid of, EVERYONE in the medical field knows about the CDC. Those are just some of the examples of unrealistic stupidity, or things done for stupid reasons for the sake of other reasons. Some stuff was just too stupid for thought; ""Pancakes!"", Harmonica (stupid, unrealistic and sadly done to make us laugh during a truly messed up (in an almost cool way) scene.I wasn't sure if I was watching a horror, comedy or spoof; but it didn't balance in the slightest. The only reason I give this a 4 is for the subject, gore and cool partsand I final thought on it, I wonder if Jordan Ladd was the only character with a brain and never got to use it, because the characters seemed doomed from the start.

The script was unimaginative and pointless, and the insertion of the occasional porno scenes only served to make this movie worse. The movie rating system is really lacks something to be desired, and I am getting tired of renting movies that don't mention nudity in the ratings for my family to watch only to find that it is a sex fest and a waste of money. I couldn't tell if the movie was about porn, diseases, or how people in backwoods small towns are morons. Adding nudity and sex scenes to a movie implies that the writer has no imagination or adequate intelligence to write a complete script. I was so bored with the movie that I fast forwarded through most of it just to get to the end to see who would survive. The only part of the movie that I did find somewhat entertaining was the gore.

His admiration of former employer David Lynch is apparent in Roth's eerie mise en' scene and kooky camera work. I have to recommend watching the film more than once, and if possible, getting your hands on the DVD version with featurette and director's commentary. Roth (who is only 32) provides a witty and entertaining insight into his warped world. Look out for the 'finger-bang misfire', 'Jake the dog' and 'the shaving' segment.Roth's script is funny in itself. The lead characters aren't particularly likeable, (who is nowadays?) but appearances from quirky minor characters make up for it. Look out for Dennis the Kung Fu kid, The partying cop and the quirky townsfolk. Also watch out for Roth who plays 'Grim' in a cool cameo. The blood and gore factor is enough to satisfy even the most seasoned horror fan - It is amazing what can be done with a bit of syrup, some KY jelly and food dye.What makes this film enjoyable, on repeat screenings, is that it becomes evident that no-one takes it too seriously. It isn't afraid to poke a little fun at itself. Horror is Roth's passion. His love, and his enthusiasm appears to rub off on the rest of the cast and crew. There is no wanky pretentiousness about it, you rent a film like 'Cabin Fever', and you aren't expecting 'art' - Roth has no illusions about this, and it's is incredibly refreshing.You won't enjoy this film if you are squeamish, or don't enjoy horror in general. It *is* violent, it *is* in you face and it sure as hell will make you cringe at least once. But if horror is your scene crack open some beers, turn the lights down and watch it with some friends.

There is no point to this film, and I don't mean to say I expected meaning or much merit from this genre, I mean it really had no point- it started with nothing and ended with nothing. There is no horror to speak of, no enemy, you basically wait for each character to start throwin up blood and then croak- some in more gruesome ways than others, but always without any point. The acting was fine, in that it didn't make the movie any worse. There is a high level of gratuity and ""oh this would look cool"" nonsense (ie the guy in the bunny suit at the hospital).

Cabin Fever does a superb job of going back to the old school with a very minimal budget Eli Roth manages to achieve a film that is sickly disturbing with a good plot and interesting characters. just goes to show what you can do with the simple necessities: a good director, a relatively unknown cast and simple special effects, a great film well worth watching!",Cabin Fever

491,haldur_ithilian,One of the Worst Movies Ever!,3,19 March 2005,"I stand beside my opinion that ""Cabin Fever"" is by far one of the most horrible excuses for cinematic entertainment since ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" or ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"". ""Why?"" your active little minds may ask. I have listed my reasons below and they are threefold (directly related to my rating, too!)Reason 1: The characters. Okay, I know this movie was never meant to be Oscar caliber or even ""cult flick"" caliber but come on! What were they thinking? If you're unsure of what I mean here, listen to the dialog (especially that of the stoner cop who goes on for 10 minutes about partying) and above all, be able to stop the gastric up-flow that may occur when you finish the flick!Reason 2: The camera-work.I could have filmed something better when I was in diapers. They must have handed the cam to some drunkard from Nova Scotia, 'cause the cinematography was cathartic, clumsy, and above all AWFUL!(note, this is my only praise for the film) Reason 3: The old man at the store.This cat was funny, not quite as much as the story itself, but entertaining nonetheless. He provided some much-needed comic relief which was really a shame because he was only at the beginning and end of the film. So there you have it! I don't care if I ever see this movie ever again but I might have to add it to my collection just for squirts and giggles.",Cabin Fever
492,rinbrown47,worst movie ever...,1,18 April 2005,"It's now 2 in the morning and i can't sleep due to being baffled by such a terrible movie. there is absolutely zero plot, no point or underlying theme, just tons and tons of unnecessary blood. Parts in the movie that made no sense what-so-ever.. 1.) The part where the kid sitting on the bench (Dennis) that looks like a a girl, starts screaming for pancakes then proceeds to Hung Du all the way to Bert, who then proceeds to bite his hand with no resistance from Bert at all... 2.) What was in the box that the fat inbred was carrying around? before he was brutally murdered by taking a screwdriver though the brain... 3.) Why do they insist on drinking out of the reservoir that is contaminated with God knows what, as well as some flesh eating disease? 4.) what was the deal with the random black guys at the end of the movie? 5.) how does someone not notice a chunk of skin in the bottom of the water glass before drinking it? 6.) how did the X-Games stoner die? and why is he ripped in half? 7.) where do they take ""Boy Meets World kid"" at the end of the movie? 8.) what was the point of the lady chopping the pig up? 9.) what was going with the naked lady in the bed when the hick told boy meets world kid to get off his property? 10.) why were the kids at the end getting water from that gross excuse of a reservoir? 11.) why did they build up a relationship with boy meets world kid and hot blonde only to have her face eaten away then her insides eaten by a dog, then getting beaten to death by boy meets world kid for about 3 minutes when all it would have taken was one hit to the face? and then later the dog's owner found in a cave torn in half?i could go on forever, but i choose not to. my point is that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, i feel dumber for having watched it. how can a production studio pat money for this? you know a movie is bad when it ends and you have no idea what just happened for the last hour and a half. this caused me physical pain to watch and i only hope for humanity that this movie is retrieved by everyone who owns it and promptly burned until there is nothing left. i wish i would have gone to bed instead of watch that horrible excuse of a movie. that is my rant, thank you for reading and good night, finally...",Cabin Fever

If you love the evil dead films then you'll know what to expect.The film starts out like any other teen horror film. Bunch of annoying kids going on a trip(i didn't want to watch any more at this point as i though i knew what was going to happen). As not to spoil it i won't say too much but the film takes an abrupt turn and messes around with the protagonists in all manner of insane situations. This is not a horror film it is a comedy horror.

For a start, the acting is no good, unreal, without attitude and so bad it's not even funny. The story comes without structure, totally predictable, the writing is very unnatural, the characters act in a very incoherent way, there's a lot of make-up involved pretending to gross out the audience but that can't save a bad movie. Like always, there are some good things: like the weirdness of characters or some scenes that are unexplainable but funny. But 2 or 3 good elements can't help 100 mistakes. I think Cabin Fever wants to be a bizarre horror movie, but it's not bizarre, just stupid. Nudity, sex, violence, blood and diseases, the magic ingredients for a boring movie....oh! and don't forget the furious dog, that's the climax. I read other comments of people who found it great; I respect all opinions, but, my advise, you'll get more fun, learn more and have a better time taking the fleas of your dog... trust me.",Cabin Fever
498,count_skogg,Comedy/Horror with Great Randomness,6,22 March 2006,"I actually found Cabin Fever quite amusing after I realised it wasn't going to be a scary horror movie. I guess it is occasionally frightening, in that way you expect from this genre, in semi-darkened scenes with that eerie music. It does remind me of the ""Evil Dead"" movies in terms of over-the-top gore, but I was still hoping for more of that somehow. Similar premise to the first Evil Dead movie too, in a way - a bunch of college kids go stay in a cabin in the woods somewhere remote and bad stuff begins to happen.I was expecting to be blown away by it and so was initially disappointed, but on coming back to it - to particular amusing scenes - I get dragged back into watching it, it's somehow very addictive. I've forced a few people to watch a couple of my favourite parts of this movie, and they've generally cringed and laughed and probably wondered what the attraction is... It is very stupid at times, but that's becoming a plus for me.I really like the occasional random stuff and the strange dialogue at times. The characters might not have been very well developed, but they work well enough for me in this film. And there are moments of shocking gore, which is really what I was after in the first place. It seems to have been very well made - well much greater quality than Evil Dead #1 and Bad Taste - which was all I was hoping for. I'd give it 6.5 if I could.",Cabin Fever

They're there for the directors disposal ( literally and otherwise ! ) in various gruesome but funny scenes one after the other. In some ways it is more subversive than Evil Dead in that we are almost on the side of the flesh eating virus and the locals. Po-faced critics attack scenes as ""ridiculous"" or ""that undercut the horror"" - it's obvious that they don't get it what this film's about !

You feel no sympathy (or for that matter any morbid feeling) for the characters. The acting was so terrible that I was just simply waiting and hoping for the God-awful thing to end.Secondly, there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever. Can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming ""PANCAKES!!!"" at the top of his lungs while going into Jackie Chan moves I've never seen before, and even further biting the guy who has the virus?

Talk about a movie that doesn't go anywhere.  It just bounces around here and there, with no real direction, particularly in the latter half of the movie.  It seems like some scenes were just randomly drawn out of a hat and stuck in there.  It was not scary, nor was it funny.  It was gory, I will give it that, but so what?

Whereas it seems that some could view this as a trashy exploitation of pop culture others value its pure brilliance. Driven by its powerful cast the film mirrors slashers of old. Cabin Fever relies on the viewer for its main source of terror. It is within the viewers reaction where the films tension regins. The identification with set killer as well as protagonist sets Cabin Fever as a memorable part of slasher film history. The only complaint may be Roths constant gore at times takes away from the true terror. Regardless this film is definitely worth watching and must be taken for what it is.,Cabin Fever

The story, performances, and effects present a unique patchwork of paranoia, fear, hopelessness and isolation.If your brain absolutely needs each and every movie you see to follow a strict formula so as to not challenge your ritalin addled, ADD mind - stay home and watch football or ""scream 12"" or ""I know what you did last friday in the ring"".  You will probably focus on the fact that the ""killer"" is not a conscious being, or the odd humor and characters that the director throws in here and there and then, unable to handle any departures from the cookie cutter world of entertainment you've been weened on, begin to whine and complain that this is the worst movie ever.",Cabin Fever

518,antisocial_crazy_dude,"A ""Feverishly"" Overated Flick",4,12 November 2003,"The Main jist of ""Cabin Fever"" is actually pretty clever. Each of the five college kids has some sort of negative issue that consumes them. It does the whole immorality thing from ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th."" This suggests that each of them is being punished for their misdeeds. For example, Jordon Ladd's character Karen has drug problems. Her best friend Marcy is very open with her sexuality (tramp), and another guy, Bert is an alcoholic. So since they committed these crimes, Eli Roth (writer/director) is punishing them in the woods. Slowly they are getting killed off by a flesh-eating bacteria that has infested itself in the area. Looking at some of the actually reviews of the film, everyone is optomistic and astounded at ""Cabin Fever."" But looking at some of the comments other IMDB users had, I realise that they DESPISED the movie with an apparent passion! After watching it and reading everyone's ideas, I think they both have an accurate idea of what it's about- to an extent.Yes- It was unnecessarily gory. Yes- It goes back to our roots of horror in the 80's. Yes- The acting is frightfully corny to a comical extent. AND Yes- This movie perfectly describes how humans react in situations like this, according to instinct. Okay? Still, I give it a 4/10, because the ending bothered me to death. I can't understand what Roth was thinking when he allowed that on screen. His attempts at comic relief feel embarassed in his movie- AND they should be. ""Cabin Fever"" was still a nice try at reviving old 80's horror flicks. I think some of the critics were looking for something that simply wasn't there- some kind of meaningful symbolism. I also think that the IMDB users are mostly cynical and don't understand what this movie is supposed to be saying. They are so thrown off by some of Eli Roth's bizaare sequences that it has ruined their movie experience. I do suggest you wait until video when watching ""Cabin Fever"" and don't expect much.

Heck, if they were only stereotypes, there would at least be somebody to care about in some way. The characters were scripted in way that makes them totally unbelievable. There is no motivation for them to do the things they do. No one of the five people really cares that they torched a sick man. They dump their sick friend in the shed and wait for the night and half a day to start getting medical help, and abandon these tries pretty soon.

Its actually pretty despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this film. There is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film unless you love Eli Roth, even that did not make me like this film.

It would be a ten, and a horror classic, if there wasn't a smattering of screenplay thuds from trying too hard. These broke the trance of beleivability so crucial to the horror experience.

529,davesheps,Everything a B-Movie should be,8,8 March 2005,"CONTAINS SPOILERS Nothing beats a really well made b-movie, but unfortunately, films with its tongue firmly planted in its cheek always seem to get slated on IMDb. Starship Troopers gets 6.7, Cabin Fever gets 5.1, and it's a real shame that people just don't get it.This is NOT a proper horror film; it is a proper b-movie and should be judged on that. This film has no pretensions - it is not trying to be Godfather II. This wasn't made to scare, it was made to be laughed at and enjoyed. And it's pretty hard not to enjoy this film - all the elements of a good b-movie are there: backward red-necks, pretty teens, gratuitous sex scene, lots of gore, an isolated cabin etc.There is a great supporting cast providing laughs all the way through, not least from Eli Roth's cameo and, of course, the rednecks. Add to that some very memorable scenes (the leg shaving) and some superb photography and you have a winner.Sure, there are plot holes (the disease is never explained), but this film does not for one moment take itself seriously enough to care. If you feel unfulfilled because you need to know, then you really should be watching something else.Once again, this is a tongue-in-cheek teen b-movie that is pure entertainment. If you are after a cathartic experience or genuine scares, you are not going to find it here. But for 90 minutes of fun, there's not much better. This film does exactly what it intended to do, and should be praised for it.8/10",Cabin Fever
530,Sizzle007,What's up with this movie?,1,22 September 2003,"I wasted 5.75 to see this crappy movie so I just want to know a few things:What was the point of the dog being split in half at the beginning of the movie, the disease had nothing to do with being split in half.What was the point of dragging Karen into the shed, she already totally infected her room, they could have just locked her in there where she would have been safer.Why would the Hermit be running around the forest asking strangers to help him when he could have just asked his relative, the hog lady, to take him to the hospital?Why didn't any of the characters bother to walk into town to get help when things started getting bad, are they all really that lazy?Even if Paul was threatened by the guy w/ the shotgun for peeping on his wife, Paul could have just sent Jeff or Bert back to the house to ask for help. the girl he loves is deteriorating.What was the point of the box?Why did Jeff go back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was getting infected, if he was that big of a jerk to leave in the first place wouldn't he have just gone back home?If the police went to all the trouble of gathering up the kids and burning them on the fire pit, why did they throw Paul halfway into the river, it wasn't even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated.Who makes lemonade out of river water, that crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it.

531,rustedangel,Disappointing...,6,14 September 2003,"CABIN FEVER REVIEW - SEPTEMBER 13, 2003 ---------------------------------------------------------------Sad as it may sound, I was really looking forward to Cabin Fever. The trailer looked good. Overall opinions and reviews of the film were generally positive. The Toronto International Film Festival marked it as a highlight, some claiming it to be the best film present. So what went wrong?One thing I think we can all be assured of (if not all, then just me) was the growing hype around the film. At least that's what I felt in the weeks leading up to its release. I was generally excited to see Cabin Fever. The film starts out good, and goes along at a good pace, but never really gets any kind of build up to something satisfying. No parts scared me, and very few were startling. In fact, the only scene that really got me was the image of Karen missing her lips. And that's just a general thing I have against people with no lips. That will always bug me.To say Cabin Fever was down right bad is unfair. While the events that happened depicted gore and violence, in certain scenes (like when Bert gets his head blown off) it seems to be scaled back. And by scaled back I'll present an example. Jeff finds Bert on the floor, dead, with his head (assumingly) blown apart. However, we never get to fully see the headless body because a chair is in the way. Nit picking, yes I know, but with a balls out horror flick, I was expecting it to be, well, balls out. Which it wasn't.The two scenes towards the end (with the pancake kid and rabbit headed doctor), not to mention the ending itself, make you wonder if this film was even constructed as one single film. Or in fact had ideas and scenes sewn together from other failed script attempts. This idea is very present, specifically during the ending credits where `the ending credits' are divided up based on the scenes in the film. Not to mention the detail that is put into the campfire stories that are told. To Eli's credit though, I would have to say this was a great attempt in the right direction. Even though it misfired on so many occasions.That said, after the film had finished, I wanted to like it. I really did, but something was holding me back. I was undecided the entire ride home from the theatre. Alas, after much thought I would have to look down on the film. And mainly because I felt the story never materialized the dread the title Cabin Fever is supposed to make you feel.Two films I find dreadful, creepy, and just down right scary are the `Blair Witch Project' and `Session 9'. Despite the flaws both films house, people reading this might be able to pick a part, those are the two films that do it for me every time.(I included the last part as insight to readers to get an idea of my tastes in horror.)",Cabin Fever
532,cynthia1113,Very Bad,1,7 February 2004,"About as clever as a train-wreck.  Trite, obvious, and predictable. Roth takes every horror-slasher film considered a classic, puts them in a blender, drinks it up, then vomits it out on film.  This is supposed to be paying homage?  This movie was a tired retread without any of the redeeming qualities of the original films it was attempting to mimic.

The gore and gratuitous violence is no where near clever enough to pull off. The acting, with the exception of the lead was less then poor.

I watched all the way to the end and was never satisfied with an answer. The acting was poor, actually atrocious; the plot was incredibly bad; the continuity was unexpectedly poor; the special effects were laughable. I'm not sure why breaking the windows in a truck would result in later being unable to start the vehicle. Why was there so much blood on the outside of the truck when the guy expelled most of the blood on the inside. When did the kids get to him with an accelerant? He couldn't have gone up in flames that way without some help. And why some of the victims contracted the disease a few minutes after exposure, while others were unaffected and the locals seemed not to have any symptoms. What happened to Grim and why did his dog come back alone? Why wasn't the dog infected? These are only a few questions - I could come up with many more, but I'll leave those to other ranters.I wish I could give this ""film"" a vote of negative 10! Granted, I don't usually watch flicks in the horror genre, but the few I've seen had at least some staying power. I just don't know why I wasted the time to watch this to the end. I guess I kept hoping to find out why the critic gave it such a high rating. I think my suspicions are now verified - there is only one critic working for my cable company!",Cabin Fever

I would so embarrassed to have my name attached to this movie in any aspect.I'm sorry, but this movie was HORRIBLE. The plot line was week at best. The story was driven by 5 characters you could care less about. At one point a new character was introduced. There was no real reason to introduce this character. Then to add insult to injury-we don't see this character for like 20mins, then he ends up dead. Who cares..I understand that story lines are recycled now adays. But at least add some imagination and creativity. Traditional horror films should contain some scary moments or at least be fun and entertaining. Cabin Fever was neither.

The rate of infection varied widely among the people which made it less believeable. You just felt you spent the whole film trying to get in the ""groove"" of the movie, only to be constantly side-tracked on already presented facts.

539,joshuatrees,I'm going to try to be as nice as possible...,1,26 January 2004,"My friends and I spent an afternoon watching this movie (and the DVD extras) and were in a constant state of awe. Initially we expected the worst, but were horrified, shocked and appalled throughout, wondering how in the world anyone would let a movie as horrible as this be created, spawned, forged from the dregs of Satan's vomit. In scene after scene we see unrelated nonsense and random crap that appears to have been thrown together over a three-day weekend of shooting and production. Director Eli Roth tries and tries, but consistently misses the mark-totally misses-in making a Lynch-esque horror movie. At least in David Lynch movies there is some sense made of the weirdness and a connection-somehow-developed between the scenes. This movie had none of that. The acting was horrible, the dialogue was much worse and the plot was about as solid and developed as a morning bowel movement after a night of spicy burritos and cheap beer.Apparently Mr. Roth hoped to `pay homage' to horror movies past, and I noted the `connections.' But if Sam Raimi, Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper were dead they'd be rolling in their graves. Well, maybe not Tobe Hooper.The best part of this movie experience, however, was watching the behind the scenes/making of the movie from the DVD extras. Wow. Do they really think they did something good here? Are the actors really proud of their `work'? They spend 20 minutes kissing each other's butts probably because they know nobody else will. I rated this movie an awkward `1' wishing I could have gone lower.not necessarily a 0, but certainly <1. The only.ONLY.saving grace in this debacle was the gratuitous and repeated sight of Cerina Vincent's lovely breasts.

The gore isn't that great, I mean come on its rated R you can only go so far with a rated R movie, the few ""gory"" scenes that were seen were very quick and most of the time we got the old ""close up to the actors face looking horrified and 'scared"" look. hopefully there will be a Directors Cut with more and more blood and gore.

Even with the flesh eating virus running rampant, one couple still has time for a hop in the sack (by the way the best part of the movie though).  I found myself rooting for the virus since all the characters were so easy to dislike.  Not worth commenting anymore.  In the end everyone got what they deserved.  They even left open the chance of a sequel.  Where have all the good horror flicks gone???  This makes a lot of movies look like Gone with the Wind in comparison.",Cabin Fever

Fred Krueger kills everyone but its still a good film.the nerd (Paul)kills a lot of people in the movie like when he puts the stick through tommy which i think is a reference to Dracula by putting a stake through his heart.one thing i don't like is this scene it just shows Paul holding the stick putting it into tommy it doesn't show like it going in him.but i like all the deaths like eaten alive by a vicious dog screwdriver in the ear is my favorite so the deaths are a step in the right direction,Cabin Fever

It wasnt scary, but was bloody . .  the flesh eating virus turns skin into a bloody mess and the victims throw up blood everywhere.  The plot was pretty predictable . .5 college kids in a cabin in the woods . .man with virus comes to them for help, they shoot him and set him on fire, he runs off into the woods, eventually the kids start getting sick.

I knew it probably would be going into the theater because its about a flesh eating virus and I had a feeling the director wouldnt hold anything back.When I first saw the commercials, I thought it was going to be terrible on the sole fact that Sean was going to be in it. But after a while i was sitting there and I was like ""wait, this actually looks pretty bad assed"" and it was.A lot of people are going to be crap ass nay-sayers and player hate on it. That happens with every horror movie. They will say ""the characters should have done blah blah"" or ""if i made the movie it would have been wikid good. i am wikid good at re-writing other people's movies"" Yeah, the characters make some bad decisions. But thats what characters in horror movies do. You cant watch it from a 3rd person perspective and say you have all the answers of what should be done. Life doesnt work that way.One problem some might have with Cabin Fever is that it gets so graphic and nasty that it is a little hard to watch. Although I enjoyed the movie, by the time I left my stomach felt queesy and I couldnt get some of the most disturbing images of the film out of my head for about a full 24 hours.It has good cinematography, wonderfully disgusting skin rotting away effects, and cool direction and i liked it.Was it an awesome movie? naw. Was it good? yeah. I would rank it after Identity and 28 Days Later but definitely before Freddy VS Jason or Wrong Turn.If you're reading this, than you have probably have just read or are about to read a lot of negative reviews.

553,ludling,A failure on nearly every level,2,14 September 2003,"_Cabin Fever_ is marketed as a horror movie, but it's more than that. It's also part homage (and to some extent, parody), part dark comedy, and part character study. Unfortunately, it not only fails as a whole, it fails on each of these smaller parts as well. Fans of older gorefests will enjoy the Where's Waldo aspect of the film, as the audience is pelted with obvious homage after obvious homage. The writer-director is clearly fascinated with the genre, and the movie suffers from his heavy dependence on and borrowing of the past, because Roth has added nothing innovative of his own.The pacing is completely wrong for a horror movie. The immediate cause of the threat is revealed very early to the audience, and we have to wait in frustration as the bumbling cast manages to botch every effort to save themselves from the unknown. By the time they find out what's going on, it's too late to do anything about it. The characters have wasted their time, and unfortunately, so has the audience.The film dabbles in the surreal, but not the good kind. This is the self-aware ""I'm so cool for being weird"" surrealism that laces the Faulkner-inspired poetry that litters notebooks in every American high school. My mother is a fish, my mother is a pancake.Except for one or two notable scenes, the gore is rather bland, nothing particularly cringe-worthy or imaginative; you get far more blood, dismemberment, and decapitation in _Freddy vs. Jason_. There are a few cheap scares (an accepted staple of the genre), but any genuine suspense or tension the movie manages to generate is completely lost by the bad pacing, the poorly-timed comedy, the somewhat odd musical choices, the absurd supporting characters stolen from David Lynch's trash can, and the idiotic, unbelievable, and inconsistent main characters who you keep hoping will just die already.On the plus side, the acting is more than passable, and in fact, better than can be found in similar movies. In particular, the shopkeeper's swishy Appalachian twang rang true to this Southerner's ears, though I thought this was set in Texas.If you're looking for a good horror movie on the big screen, skip _Cabin Fever_ and go see _Alien_ when it's re-released. If on the other hand, you applaud weirdness for the sake of weirdness and playing ""Name That Homage"", you might actually like _Cabin Fever_ for its self-congratulatory randomness.",Cabin Fever
554,Rufus_McNasty,Bad Movie? You're Soaking In It.,2,16 September 2003,"Something i've noticed over the past decade or more (and these days most of all)is the horror film maker's attempt to include too many elements of the action and comedy genres in an attempt to appeal to a bigger audience.  If I want a comedy, I'll go see a comedy.  I don't mind a little comic relief and I love dark humor when it is done in a subtle and meaningful manner.  I like a horror film that just beats the living hell outta me.  I want to come out of the theater truly shaken and effected.  Cabin Fever is played too much for laughs and the jokes just aren't that funny.  Just kinda stupid and pointless.  I found myself too often annoyed at characters like Party Cop, Grim and The Karate Kid who just had nothing to do with anything.  I've not seen as pointless a character as Grim since a real turd of a movie called Scared Stiff.  He's there to supply a crazy dog and a dead body to stumble over at the end of the movie.  I keep hearing that horror audiences want the humor these days and it is fairly apparent that this is true but if this is what they want, then aren't they missing the point of a horror movie?  I dunno.  I give this thing good marks for it's excellent and effective gore make-up and the little bit of tension that it did have, but too many things about it made no sense and didn't need to be there.  I've never walked out on a movie in my life.  No matter how bad it was.  But I came damn close with this one.  The last 10 or 15 minutes were pretty hard to sit through. Just got more and more ridiculous.  I find myself wondering about the rabbit suit guy in the hospital.  Was this a clumsy attempt at a metaphor for the guy in the beginning of the movie who was apparently hunting rabbits?  Was his dog supposed to have gotten the virus from eating an infected rabbit? Wasn't really made clear, so the rabbit suit guy seemed rather pointless. Just got another ""huh?"" outta me.  Maybe the rabbit escaped from an animal research lab up-river from the cabin, huh?  There.  I'll just fill in all the holes with my own story.  Then maybe this film won't hurt so much. Matter of fact, watching this thing actually gave me a head-ache that lasted 6 hours. Only 2 aleve got rid of this movies residue.  So...to sum up...too many stupid jokes.  Not scary enough.  And just bad film making in general. There.  I feel better.And please, this is not a forum for opinions of opinions. Reviews are nothing but someones opinion.  That's from you and me on up to Mr. Ebert. One man's trash is another man's treasure.  It's all subjective, guys.  No need to take it personally if someone doesn't like the movie you liked.

There was no suspense it was JUST A DISEASE, one that didn't shock me by the gore nor make me squirm at the situations.  I did however enjoy the humour in the movie intentional and otherwise.  Afterwards I felt as if Roth had kept us seated for 90 minutes just for the gun gag at the end which was set up at the beginning and everything in between was just a self-indulgent homage his favourite films.To say that this is up there with the best is very off the mark, it was neither scary nor thrilling.  Yes there was lots of gore and blood but that does not make a good horror flick if there are no intentions to keep your audience on the edge of your seat, which my friends and I certainly were not.  My only good thing to say of this movie is reading the reviews after I watched it which did remind me of some good moments in the film I had forgotten due to the rest being pretty dull and boring.",Cabin Fever
558,mhj75,Can you take a joke?,3,13 October 2003,"The problem with this movie is that it wasn't scary enough to be a horror film and wasn't funny enough to be a comedy.Director Eli Roth consistently sets up workable horror premises and at times creates a tense and unnerving atmosphere, but then he'll pop a joke in, either surreal or aimed at debunking the conventions of the horror genre. Time after time I was left wondering whether I'd seen a promising horror scene ruined by casual directing or whether I'd seen a very poor attempt at a postmodern gag.However, if I'd have known that this was a camp, kitsch cult movie I would have liked it an awful lot more than I did, because I was constantly waiting to be scared. The only horror element this movie really delivers are the endless shots of dismembered bodies, blood, gore, decaying flesh, people vomiting blood all over each other etc. But oddly these scenes aren't really all that kitsch - I found them as funny as the endless succession of murders in City Of God or the relentless intensity of the first half hour of Saving Private Ryan. i.e. not funny at all, just mildly disturbing and unpleasant.
There's plenty of gore, but every bit of psychological tension is scuppered by the director - either deliberately or by accident. After sitting through the movie, talking to plenty of people about it and reading all the comments on iMDb, I'm still not sure which he was trying to achieve.",Cabin Fever

The whole rotting to death thing could have been avoided if that group of ass-clowns had any sense. I mean, if I ever contract some horrible flesh eating virus, I hope that my friends would not think that the best thing to do would be to lock me up in the wood shed and leave me to either rot away or be eaten by a psychotic dog. Then beat me with a shovel instead of shooting me to put me out of my misery. Also, they only tried once to get a signal on their cell and made no real effort to get to town because the truck wouldn't start. Getting help just didn't seem like a huge priority.

I will not be considering any other movies on that list for viewing. This was essentially a movie about a severe case of the flu. One of my pet peeves about a bad movie is what the characters do in unusual circumstances that NORMAL people in the exact same situation would not do. In this movie there are many, many instances where I found myself laughing at the absurdity of the main characters choices when other clear and OBVIOUS choices were available to them. But then the characters lack of common sense is perfect for a movie of this sort since it serves the purpose of advancing the mindless script. One such example found a woman riddled with the ""Cabin Fever"" shaving her not so pretty ""Cabin Fever"" legs. Another had two of the main characters ""making out"" while one of their friends was under quarantine, deteriorating in a shed from the cabin ""bug"". Nice, huh? Another thing I found irritating was the predictability throughout the movie. On a few occasions I was calling out the outcome before it even happened to the point that my son, who was watching it with me, kept insisting that I had seen the movie before. I had to assure him that Dad was having the hardest time watching it right then and there let alone having sat through it once before. This movie is easily one of the worst horror films (or any other genre for that matter) that I have ever seen. I could have done better.

It is a high-grade B movie that was made in the spirit of ""2000 Maniacs.""  The randomness of supporting cast is just that, meant to be something random.  Made to make you say-WTF?Because it was meant to be a shlocky gore-fest, and clearly an homage to so many great 70's horror films, I give it a ten.  Yes, people I said a ten.

565,stewsday2,A couple of reasons why this bird don't fly!,6,23 February 2004,"I guess it didn't meet my expectations.  I think Eli Roth is more capable than this movie... I think Rider is above it too.  Though the director wanted to pay homage to the late 70s and 80s horror films, they produced a gore flick instead.  I'm not going to mince words... as much as I like the cast and all, the movie's main drawback was in its plot. Simply put, if you want to make a good horror movie, follow the rules of the game.  The closest movie that works in the paradigm is John Carpenter's The Thing.  In the Thing you are studying something extraterrestrial which is borderline supernatural and you learn about its motives, wants and needs. Cabin Fever's phage is organic, and causes its victim's flesh to become putty and fall off... there is no knowledge gained, so its just plane ol' flat.  Its a gore flick relying mainly on bloodsyrup/mix, and it misses horror completely. I recommend the book The Philosophy of Horror for this director.  I think it will benefit him in identifying what it is that makes horror movies work beyond gore.  Eli Roth, uses a flesh eating phage as his ""monster"" that quickly eats away his unwilling and unmotivated victims.  There is no mystery as to who is infected or what the outcome will be. Roth doesn't do an effective job of turning his group against each other and breaking their trust. IMHO, There is very little motivation for the characters to do the things they do, or feel the way they do... a girl gets eaten by this thing and I'm left flat, because there is really nothing I feel about wanting her character to stay alive, the relationship hasn't been identified as something worth saving. Now, if Rider's character, Paul, was able to resist the virus because of interferon produced from the bite he received on the onset of the film... an immunity from a competing organism that counteracted the phage, then you might have something: a story about one guy trying to keep his group together and his film alive. Again... Roth needs to do more R&D on the script end before bringing it into production.",Cabin Fever
566,boomer-27,Give it a miss,1,6 May 2004,"Although I would never recommend anyone not to watch a film as everyone will have their own tastes, I do wonder what Cabin Fever has to offer anyone. The storyline is wafer thin and barely entertaining and it simply is neither scary. There is a mere one scene in the entire film you may at least give it some credit for but it's simply cringe worthy and not scary.
Towards the end I found this film bordering on comical and when the credits rolled all I could think was what a waste of time and money. The film provides nothing that virtually every other modern day horror film doesn't do 10 times better. Simply put this comes bottom of my pile at the moment when it comes to my choice in films and it will take some beating to lift it from that position.",Cabin Fever
567,LuvMyStinkyAss,Puke-worthy (Literally),4,16 March 2005,"This movie actually had an okay plot...really. It did. But this movie also soaked up all the blood and gore it could get. Such being the bowling scene where Paul is sitting around the camp fire with his friends, telling the tale of an old crime that went on at a bowling alley he and his dad went to. Now, come on. I was already a little nauseous from seeing so much blood BEFORE this. Was that scene REALLY necessary? I swear, halfway through the movie, I had to pause it because I thought I was going to vomit. So if you are looking for a really graphic sex scene or so much blood that you think it could fill the ocean, I recommend this movie for you.

My friend and I happened to see it on the same day and talked about it for an entire month, if not longer! Whenever we passed each other in the hallway, we would yell out PANCAKES, and just got used to the weird looks. We even thought of naming a band Don't Sit Next to Dennis. How great would that be!Anyway, I haven't even really talked about the movie much. The gore is absolutely fantastic. It was overdone so realistically... But if you think about it, what would it look like to see all of your skin fall off and your body basically decay from the inside out? Whatever you do, don't shave when you're in that situation (how stupid was that?) But besides the sickeningly awesome effects, this movie is hilarious. There are crazy hillbillies, a disturbed child that can do karate, and a random guy in a bunny suit. What more could you want. I bet you didn't even know that you wanted it. : )If you want to be grossed out and laughing for days, you'll love this movie.

Now I'm not a medical expert, but I would assume the virus wouldn't spread that fast, but it's a movie you have to pull some strings. I thought Rider Strong did a great job with his role especially how his character changes throughout the movie and after recently having watched Grind I thought Joey Kern did a great job too playing a very different character. Now no movie is obviously perfect and the movie does have certain flaws, but I really thought it came together nicely and kudos to Eli Roth for a new approach. To sum it up I'd say it's at least worth a rental especially if you're into the genre and I suggest you approach the movie with not great expectations which seemed to happen after all the praise the movie got which left many people disappointed because when they saw it they were expecting a perfect movie.

'Cabin Fever' has been one of my favorite horror movies ever since it came out, and I think Eli Roth is a great writer and director. It amazes me that people go into watching ANY horror film expecting good acting. That is not what they're about. Go watch 'The Shawshank Redemption' or 'The Godfather' if you want to see first-rate acting and writing.Horror films are supposed to scare you, gross you out, and be nothing more than pure fun, and that's exactly what 'Cabin Fever' is. I think the humor in Cabin Fever is what puts a lot of people off. People aren't used to seeing funny horror films, so when they do see one they automatically think it's weird and stupid. 'Cabin Fever' is hilarious from beginning to end, and it's completely gross and over the top.All of the best horror films I've ever seen got bad ratings thanks to people who watch them and don't even like horror films in the first place.

The whole mullet kid/making fun of hillbillies part is totally cliché, the horror story gathering momentum is just uninteresting and without suspense or even shock. The rudimentary love story was completely useless and ineffective, as was the hermit with his dog, the young cop etc...What did the writer/director think when he made up the local residents around the lake. What was the point in finding out who the hermit was? Or what about the pig slaughtering lady? No point in that! This movie leaves so many loose ends, as it leads to nowhere.

You also never find out what the ""party man"" deputy does with the kid from the hospital at the end, either. You assume he's going to kill him, but... I was also really curious about what was in ""the kit"" that the hillbillies brought with them when they went after the kids in the cabin.

The movie's shire simplicity and originality set It aside from the rest of the old cliché horror films and made out to be an enjoyable one-watch flick.The low-budget is recognisable when it comes to the special effects and the cast but the original script made a decent change from all them brutal slasher movies set in the woods. The basic premise of the film is about a group of college kids who decide to travel to a isolated cabin to get drunk and high, nothing special there. But when they start to get infected with an unusual flesh eating disease the group turn on each other and it becomes a battle to survive.I wasn't expecting much from the film but considering the low-budget and quality of filming I was pleasantly surprised.

584,eolsen-3,Amazing rehash of the horror genre,10,13 June 2005,"I cant believe all of you morons writing a review for a genre you obviously don't understand. Cabin Fever is great on all accounts. In an era where Hollywood is trying to capitalize on everything and ruining the Horror genre (aka Texas Chainsaw remake, Freddy vs. Jason, etc,), CF totally gives its nods to classic genre defining films and directors (Romero, Hooper, Craven, Jackson, to mention a few). The key era of Horror in my opinion, and most other Horror enthusiasts, was the 70s and 80s (low budget B movies to be exact). Where do you think such amazing directors of Hollywood got their start? Peter Jackson- from ""Bad Taste"" and ""Dead Alive"" to ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and Sam Raimi- from ""Evil Dead"" to ""Spiderman."" Why remake classic movies into some horrible high budget blockbuster (Texas Chainsaw, Amityville Horror, etc.) when you can just remake the genre in a way? Everything is all about being retro these days. Musically for example, the whole ""garage rock"" movement is being regurgitated through the likes of horrible bands like the White Stripes and the Strokes trying to be a new version of the Stooges. At least Eli Roth (director of Cabin Fever) knows where he is coming from. Cabin Fever is for the true fans of B Horror. If you respect movies like Zombie, Basketcase, Maniac, Night/Day/Dawn of the (Living) Dead, then Cabin Fever will be your new favorite. I was honestly skeptical about seeing the movie after new mainstream horror movies, but buying Cabin Fever was the right choice. Humor and gore make horror. No matter what you say. Cabin Fever is hilarious and gory enough for horror lovers.

587,ccallway,"Response to the ""last 30min went to pot"" guy...",10,11 April 2006,"As a response to the guy who complained the ""last 30min went to pot.""...Dude, you just didn't get it.Eli Roth even points out in the DVD features that such things as: the deer through the windshield, Winston, the bunny suit, etc... Were put in because if they didn't have the audience at the 3/4 mark, who the *#&$ cared? Those of us who WERE with the filmmakers by 3/4 through, nearly died laughing. Oh horror-comedies, why are you so great? Sigh!----------------- And not to beat the issue to death, but *grabbing beating stick*, if a flesh eating hobo-disease, and shooting squirrels ('cause they're gay), and...uh...DENNIS didn't strike you as ""over the top"" but a guy hitting a deer (albeit a ridiculously fake ones with lovely kicking feet!) with his car did...well...good luck to you sir! You'll need it!",Cabin Fever
588,sugarpumpkin,So incredibly stupid...,7,11 July 2007,"I have a habit of loving films that are so dumb and so terrible that I should feel ashamed that I love them. Cabin Fever is one of those films. The gore (which I was expecting a lot more of, having seen Hostel) didn't scare me one bit, and I'm easily freaked out by horror standards. The characters were all idiots, except the whiny blonde guy Jeff, who actually did an incredibly smart (although somewhat gutless) thing by running away from the rest of the gang and NOT drinking the water. (I'll admit, I was actually pretty annoyed that he died eventually, if only because I had a slightly twisted little crush on him.) If they'd all just stayed away from each other and drank beer ... well, there wouldn't have been a film, but it was the one thing that made the most sense in a pretty much senseless film. I wouldn't recommend anyone watch this film - unless I knew them well enough to know they wouldn't want to harm me for making them waste 90 minutes of their life. But I love it, because it's just SO BAD. In fact, if they made it better in any way at all, I would have just been bored. So, don't watch Cabin Fever. And if you do, make sure your expectations are very low, and you don't have something you could be doing for the length of the film - you'll only wish you'd been doing it.",Cabin Fever
589,demented_surfer_babe,Ridiculous.Yet Funny.,7,6 May 2006,"When i first picked up this film i definitely wasn't expecting what i got, from what other people have told me and the words 'TERRIFYING' on the front cover.Though it is one of THE worst horror movies i have ever seen, it was surprisingly funny(Apart from the annoying brunette who decided after nearly all her friends had died that it was the right time to shave her legs, because you know a girls gotta look good) Funniest moment was def. Dennis (Creepy Boy who looks like a girl) with the whole pancakes panCAKES PANCAKES !And then the little matrix routine before he decided that what he had just tucked into wasn't actually a gigantic pancake.Also Paul (One of the main characters) who started off as a normal pathetic young man and ended up as a person who enjoyed poking dead bodies with sticks,turning them over,looking disgusted and then hitting them over the head with a shovel of some sort.Would recommend if you have an odd sense of humour.",Cabin Fever
590,Pixie_juice,Dreadful - Why was this film unleashed on good people?!?,1,13 January 2006,"I really don't know where to begin. I had wanted to see this film for ages before I actually saw it as I am a horror film freak & am really into the contemporary teen slasher films, you know, Wrong Turn, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc, (as well as more traditional horror movies! Can't beat The Fog, The Haunting, The Wicker Man, & all those other amazing films!). So, my expectations were high....Words cannot describe how crap this film is, they really can't. The plot is terrible, atrocious acting, lacking in any kind of resolution or conclusion at the end, just plain b****cks. I remember sitting there watching it, thinking I was watching a film that was made purely as a joke. I couldn't believe that somebody actually thought it was a good idea & a good result. When it was over, I was expecting the film to suddenly start again, with a ""proper"" story, & that what I'd just seen would prove to have been one big nasty trick & I would soon be presented with the ""real"" thing. Realising it was indeed over, I thought ""What the hell did I do to deserve that?"" Please, I beg, do not waste your time or your money on this pile of dog turd. In fact, I do urge all people to see it just so they can grasp how bad it is!",Cabin Fever
591,mr_craigyboy,Wow! This Is Unbelievably Bad!,3,8 July 2007,"Truly one of the most dire films I've ever sat through. I've never actually taken the time to write one of these but felt compelled to after witnessing this affront to film-making and feel somewhat aggrieved to be wasting my time on such a piece of turd to be honest. There were so many parts that infuriated me with their complete randomness and lack of sense (e.g. when would the police force ever shoot people with infectious diseases? When would hospitals ever through out such people for lack of a cure? Why was the guy who spotted him spying on his wife wandering around outside in his dressing gown whilst carrying a gun as she rolled around on the bed?). Also, the characterisation - as we've almost come to expect in such films - was awful (e.g. the way the blonde guy - I don't remember his frickin name and don't give a toss anyway - completely turned against his girlfriend and ran off to leave her) and I ended up wanting them all to meet grisly ends! The production was horribly disjointed and the cinematography nothing to write home about.",Cabin Fever
592,drhelton,Eli Roth...you are NOT Sam Raimi!,2,4 January 2006,"This is one of the few movies that made me want my $7 back.I'm not some cynical film snob who always tears apart movies. I just expect to be entertained when I go to a movie. And especially, I expect to be scared, or at least grossed-out, when I see a horror movie.Sure, the actors weren't so great and it looked cheap, but it's a low-budget, B horror movie, so those are easily understandable.What I really, absolutely HATE about this movie is how much better it might've been if Eli Roth had suddenly decided he was going to remake ""Evil Dead 2."" Unlike Sam Raimi (the director of ""Evil Dead 2,"" but I'm sure most you reading this already know that), Eli Roth CANNOT interject comedy into his work and still maintain the suspense and dread of a good horror film. In fact, most every single scene that might've actually been legitimately scary was completely marred by Roth's schlock attempts at comic relief. Every time, it was a complete mood killer and felt totally out of place.And the absolute worst part, the part that actually made me turn to my date (and her towards me) in the theatre and say, ""What the F*CK!?!?!?"" was the ending when the redneck store owner (who you think for a minute is about to shoot a couple of black people who've come into his store), suddenly starts pounding fists with them and talking in ebonics. Even remembering it makes me say, ""What the F*CK!?!?!?"" Do yourself a favor and just rent ""Evil Dead 2"" and skip this pale (and I mean ghost-white pale) imitation. Make those 2 hours actually be good for something.",Cabin Fever

594,moonlitdolphin,so-so movie,3,2 September 2006,"I bought this movie, I remembered the trailer and thought it was going to be a really good movie. It looked like it was going to be really scary.In my opinion, it really wasn't that good a movie. They used a lot of foul language that served no purpose whatsoever, and the gratuitous scenes were pointless, with no connection to the plot at all.It was gory and disgusting, and not really scary. I mean, the idea of getting a disease like that was scary, but the way they played the characters, they were just so unlikable that you couldn't get scared because you didn't like any of them really.I think this movie is worth it if you can catch it on TV, or if it's on HBO and you already pay for it, but to rent or buy it, I don't really think it was worth the money.",Cabin Fever

596,mnevara,Not very good. Bad writing. Bad Directing. Bad Acting (by the guys).,3,16 February 2006,"OK, so I just saw this movie on cable tonight Feb. 16, 2006 and I have to say it was pretty bad.In fact the only reason I watched it and kept watching it was because it had two good looking girls in it. After they were dead I had no interest to further watch the rest of the movie -even though I did because nothing else was on TV at the moment.It also kept dragging on when it should have ended and it contained some strange scenes that didn't make any sense to the story but yet someone felt they should be in the final cut for humor.That's bad film-making, leave your 'little darlings' on the cutting table, or in modern terms on the hard drive. Include the nonsensical crap on the DVD for the 'dropped scenes' or the 'Directors cut' or whatever the hell you want to call it, but keep them out of the story.Yes I'm talking about the weirdo kung fu monkey kid who repeatedly screamed 'pan cakes!!!' and bit bad actor #1's fingers. The writing was bad, predictable and stale.Obviously this thing had a micro budget or no budget so the writer had to make do with basically nothing but the single location (the cabin) and the out doors. Even still there are great movies that take place in basically one location but of course they had good writers and good actors.I also don't know why this movie had an R rating, I was really disappointed with it, it should have been PG 13.The male leads acted too much like stereotypical morons and they did a fairly poor job of it, none of them showed any decent acting ability except maybe the guy who played the 'wuss', and he just so so but that could have been bad writing as well.Whether this was due to bad directing or just bad acting is hard to say and us viewers don't really care who's to blame.The two lead girls did a respectable job, especially the cute blond ( even though she didn't get naked which of course every guy wants to see ) .It was pretty retarded (for lack of a better term) that the girls die so early in the movie and it would have been nice if one of the girls (I prefer the blond) had survived.No one cares if wussy boy in the stream is alive (or dead).The filmmakers obviously wanted to keep the door open for a possible sequel in the event this thing made some money.Best thing about this movie:The casting of the two girls, especially the blond.The next best thing about this movie:Nothing.Recommendation:If you're under 18 and it comes on cable you MIGHT enjoy it, but more likely you'll just be disappointed when the girls don't really show much and nothing interesting happens.If you feel like discussing any of these comments or this movie please email me at Yahoo.com.

597,meowcatwoman,Fantastic Campy B-Movie Classic!,9,28 May 2006,"I heard horrible reviews about Cabin Fever, but since I love ""bad"" horror movies I borrowed it from a friend and I'm so glad I did! It's a brilliant, hilarious, gory, ridiculous, fun, scary ride.Some of my favorite high points: *Pancakes! The slow motion tae kwon do was awesome.*Paul (Shawn Hunter!)going all nuts and beating Karen to death. He must like poking bodies with sticks (like the body in the water as he clung off the obviously rotten ladder).*What's in the box?!? *Deputy Party Man *Leg shaving scene (sooo gnarly) followed by ""eaten-by-dogs"" scene.Genius! I can't wait to see it again!",Cabin Fever
598,david-forbes1,'Porky's' with gore,1,2 August 2006,"'Cabin Fever' is possibly the worst horror film made in over a decade.Apparently the director, Eli Roth, has worked with David Lynch but I suspect he was merely cleaning the great man's pool as he displays no sign of talent whatsoever.Ripping off huge chunks of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'The Evil Dead' and John Carpenter's 'The Thing' Roth shows some taste in his source material but no knowledge of how to put these elements together.Five - yes, five - supposedly 'sexy' but actually geeky young people go into the woods for some sex or something. Approached by a tramp with a sub-X-Files looking disease they set him on fire for some reason - but not before one of their own number is contaminated. Thereafter there's a lot of shouting, the worst bit of Kung Fu you can imagine and attempts at humour that fall like a horse down a lift-shaft. At one point one of the girls decides to take a bath and shave her legs despite having a skin rotting disease as if someone has just reminded Roth that he has promised the audience some tits but had not yet delivered.The effects are shoddy, the 'acting' atrocious and the attempts at tasteless merely puerile. In the Director's commentary - one of 4 commentary tracks on the DVD - Roth repeatedly describes other directors as pussies and boasts of his own achievements like a cross between Quentin Tarantino and David Brent.Imagine 'Porky's' or 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men' with fake-looking gore and you will still be overestimating this garbage.It's embarrassing beyond belief.",Cabin Fever
