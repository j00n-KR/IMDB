0,SnoopyStyle,too many things,5,6 September 2019,"Young women go missing in Minnesota. A serial killer is hunting. Michael Cooper (Ben Kingsley) is a retired judge who turned vigilante after the murder of his family. He uses his protégé Lara as bait to catch sex offenders. Marshall (Henry Cavill) is a world-weary sex crime investigator. He struggles to stay connected to his young daughter. Rachel (Alexandra Daddario) is the new investigator for the unit. Lara gets caught up by serial killer Simon (Brendan Fletcher).There is a lot going on. It's too many things. I appreciate many of them on their own. It gets to be chaotic when they're all jammed into one movie. Also there are many incidences of bad writing. For example, Simon is being transported in a convoy of vehicles. Yet when that car goes off the road, the other cars are nowhere to be found. This type of bad writing happens again and again. This has to be blamed on writer/director newcomer David Raymond. He could still be a solid TV director. Ben Kingsley with Lara as a vigilante team could be interesting on their own. Certainly, Kingsley would be a great leading anti-hero. On the other hand, I'm still unconvinced by Cavill's acting. His side would be a functional police crime drama by itself. They have Brendan Fletcher doing his version of Edward Norton in Primal Fear. Again by himself, it could be an intriguing performance. Piled on top of each other, all the elements get into the way. This is unnecessarily multi-layered.",Night Hunter
1,nogodnomasters,There's no safety on that,7,10 September 2019,"In Minnesota, where the sun never shines, a man is abducting and killing women. There is a detective (Henry Cavill) on the job. Also, a retired judge (Ben Kingsley) working as a vigilante is after predators making Chris Hansen look like a sissy with his gelding technique. And he doesn't write bad checks. Their paths cross as they catch the man who has been abducting girls for years. However simple Simon (Brendan Fletcher) has the mind of a child. How could he do it? Multiple personalities? Network?This was an interesting story. Not the twist I expected. The film opens with the proverbial girl in panties, running at full tilt, being chased by a big guy walking and she can't get away. You might want to ignore the teaser.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity",Night Hunter
2,kosmasp,Hunting,9,28 February 2021,"The cast of this movie is ... exceptional. And that is putting it mildly. It also feels like it has the plots of two different movies - and by combining them putting all sorts of hunters against each other. One may say there are more than you could possibly deal with (no pun intended). Sir Ben Kingsley and Tucci in one movie - that's a treat. Even if they don't really have that many scenes together.But apart from the cast, the story is also more than intriguing. As you can tell by my rating and obviously since you have bothered to read why I thought so. So if you dig those two stories being combined and if you can stomach not just the violence depicted (physically and psychologically), but also how disturbing and therefor powerful the villain of the story is ... that is more a head thing.On a side note, because I've read this here and in other similar movies or stories: Daddario looks way too beautiful for the character she is portraying? That is quite the demeaning thing to say! Borderline sexist and really completely wrong. Try to refrain from shaming in any form if possible - this would be one of those cases. Her role or character may have other qualities/quirks you may have issues with - that's a different story. That always boils down to, do you believe character motivation and how much can you take if you think someone is doing something wrong ... but is she really? I was disagreeing with her methods and her drive to find out more at first too ... I did change my mind while the story unfolded",Night Hunter
3,Sleepin_Dragon,Decent enough.,6,17 April 2020,"It's not a bad thriller, it starts off well, has a decent enough ending, but the middle of the film is somehow slightly confusing. You will need to concentrate, otherwise the narrative will pass you by.The twist was unexpected, but how many times can that particular twist be used, it's like a get out of jail free card.Elevated by Henry Cavill, and well supported by Ben Kingsley. Cavill is a hugely charismatic actor, with a very definite presence, I wonder if it would have been as good without him, I doubt it.It's not a wow, but it's a solid watch. 6/10.",Night Hunter
4,phd_travel,A murky and improbable mess,2,7 October 2019,How did such a badly written and directed movie get made let alone attract such a top notch cast? I know actors have to take roles when they can get them but this is so bad. The story tries to be shocking but just seems stupid.Don't bother with this one even if it's got Alexandra Daddario and Superman.,Night Hunter
5,deloudelouvain,"How can you think this is a bad movie, it's the opposite, I really liked it.",8,16 January 2020,"Nomis or Night Hunter, call it whatever you want, I liked it a lot. I don't get why you would have two different titles for a movie, it's not the first time that I came across that, and I always wonder why they do that, what's the point? What I don't get either is that there are people that thought this movie was terrible. Terribly good yes! I love movies where there is a lot of mystery, the kind where you try to figure out what's going on, who did what and so on. Nomis has it all, it's the kind of movie where you constantly think you know what happened or what will happen, only to discover you're completely wrong at the end. I really thought I had this one figured out so the twists and turns in this one were really good, much better than a ""normal"" good movie. The cast did a good job playing their characters, especially Brendan Fletcher and Henry Cavill. If you like psychopath crime stories with a twist just watch this one. Don't listen to the negative reviews, they have no clue what they are talking or writing about.",Night Hunter
6,Lejink,Hunt the hunters,3,10 August 2019,"A confusing, contrived and ultimately uninvolving would-be thriller centring on an apparent long-term serial abducter and killer of young women. It starts off with his latest victim attempting escape in the freezing dead of night, only to end herself when he catches her up. Next, we're introduced to a pretty young girl honey-trapping a convicted rapist now out of jail, her accomplice and the calculating brains of the operation being an elderly former judge with money and clout enough to extract full retribution for the helpless perpetrator's victims by castrating him, clearing out his bank account to share the proceeds with the victims and have him sign a full waiver statement for what's happened to him.Henry Cavill is the rather unlikely man-mountain cop, all grizzled and mussed up, out to catch the serial killer, who runs into the afore-mentioned vigilante Ben Kingsley and his ward who then promptly turn their attention to the same killer. We've already seen that Henry, a separated dad, is worried about his own teenage daughter and who she might be hooking up with online but when he and his former girlfriend, a former detective turned profiler get who they think is their man, a strange game of psychological cat-and-mouse between they and defendant Brendan Mitchell ensues especially when it seems he has multiple personality disorder.In fact the solution to the bad guy's M.O. is a lot simpler than that if still highly contrived and after a ""Se7en""-type break-out, our crazed killer kidnaps Kingsley's adopted daughter and the profiler setting up a climax which ensues on a thin ice-rink when Cavill finally catches them up.With much of the action shot in darkness and also poorly recorded dialogue I struggled to make out, never mind join the plot dots in this formulaic would-be chiller. Cavill's English accent chimes in as regularly as Big Ben and he otherwise never seems comfortable in his role while Kingsley is hardly stretched in support. I found the direction haphazard and disjointed, a typical complaint of mine against modern-day Hollywood thriller movies.Derivative and difficult to follow I just couldn't get into it and in truth wished I'd hunted out another movie instead this particular night.",Night Hunter
7,westsideschl,Spot On for All the Basics,8,23 October 2019,"1. Creative, not seen before storyline, take on what would have been the standard serial killer of young women plot.
2. Acting was disturbingly offbeat, and spot on.
3. Interesting unique roles especially the vigilante assemblage/posse.
4. Dialogue at times intelligent; at times unexpected.
5. Sets; props; location, particularly the seldom seen Manitoba angle, were all no-nonsense edgy.
6. Twisty denouement - got me.",Night Hunter
8,851222,Highly forgettable and very average at best,5,14 September 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.Given the well know faces on a screen, ""Night Hunter"" (2018) had way more potential then it actually turned out to be. Plot was maybe to big to put it into one movie and script wasn't the best either. Main villain was not very good in my opinion either - i just did not like the guy who was playing it, nothing personal.Overall, ""Night Hunter"" isn't terrible, but its not a good movie either. Its highly forgettable thriller that i think aimed to high with its plot, and eventually it lead to nowhere.",Night Hunter
9,ops-52535,"well it wasnt that bad,",8,11 August 2019,"After all, considering an incoherent start with quite a few plotholes and some main figures that just looks and says nothing and does nothing. the introduction of characters are to say it mild poor. but as a relieve to you all, this nutball haystack thrilkler in the dark, it starts to incline in the second half and keeps you on the brink until the end.the grumpy old man gives an 8, due to a nice filming job, and with a nice score.",Night Hunter
10,Rodrigo_Amaro,A Lousy Thriller,2,11 October 2021,"""Night Hunter"" is a film that starts off so well it's amazing how lost and dreadful it becomes after the story takes off with its crazy twists and turns.Had it been focused on the ant-hero of the story then we'd have a much better film than we got. This is a very frustrating film that kill all possible
expectations, leaves viewers alienated and confused with a story without many thrills and very empty in its core. Don't be fooled with the casting of great
actors like Stanley Tucci and Ben Kingsley or great presences such as Alexandra Daddario and Henry Cavill...I guess they're just there to fill space in the
void of not getting anything done, it happens sometimes when actors schedule opens and there's no big projects to do in between spaces.Here's the story of two detectives (Cavill and Daddario) on the pursuit of a women's serial killer on the loose, and paralel to their investigation
there's also a retired judge (Kingsley) who uses of a woman acting as a bait to catch sexual predators and when she gets taken by the dangerous man,
they join forces to find the man going on different assignments running against the clock. It all gets troubled when Simon (Brendan Fletcher) is arrested,
a psychologic disaster who's considered suspect of the crimes but evidences show that he might have a co-conspirator acting outisde of the prison, and now
everybody's after this mysterious person.I wished the film had the focus on Kingsley character then later on it could evolve with the cops going after him, and not the sequences of facts we got when
he gets aprehended way earlier and nothing goes on his favor (at times). The vigilante was awesome and more heroic than the police force. I cared a lot about this
character.What ruins the movie it's the excessive drama revolving on Cavill's character personal drama with his ex-wife and his daughter; or the many excessive blurry
parts of the story with twists and turns that don't thrill the viewer just make them bored or irritated. The more it got complicated the more I hated this film.The script wasn't getting better when complicated things, it wasn't so inovative, it was just a first-time director and screenwriter trying to throw many
devices into one plot thinking he's creating the most intelligent thriller of the current time. It was painful to see the macho detective of Cavill being
obnoxious and not doing things by the book, just throwing punches and wild acts of menace; neither was the other police force members trying to solve the
cast were brilliant in their acts - ok the girl was doing her job nicely, making of profile of Simon and trying to uncover things; while poor captain Tucci
was there to create an air of suspicion that for most of the time we suspect he's the other killer when in fact he's not.I was not impressed by this movie, I wasn't moved by it thanks to the countless cliches thrown. And here's a story that could bring some dramatic relevance
about kidnappings of young girls and how the police always try to solve their kidnapping and solve the case before time runs out. Has to be one of the
weakest films I've ever seen and not even its minor good scenes help make the case for such a waste of time. 2/10.",Night Hunter
11,cruise01,Horrible and dumb.,2,17 October 2019,"Night Hunter (1 out of 5 stars).Night Hunter is a terrible psychological thriller that is filled with dumb characters, boring script, and dull direction. The film follows a group of detectives who are trying to track down a killer who has been kidnapping teenage girls. And than there is a vigilante played by Ben Kingsley who is using one of his own girl has bait so he can handle the suspect his own way.The plot is filled with holes. Incoherent. Without giving away any spoilers. There is a twist which is boring. The characters make stupid decisions and they are detectives who make the worst decisions.The film has a great cast. But they are terrible with a bad script that does not give them much depth. There is Henry Cavill, Ben Kingsley, Alexandra Daddario, Nathan Fillon, and Stanley Tucci. But there characters are all forgettable.Overall, Night Hunter is one of the worst films with a terrible direction, plot hole story, and the script makes every character making stupid decisions.",Night Hunter
12,Fella_shibby,Engaging n suspenseful uptil the revelation.,6,28 August 2019,"Brendan Fletcher's acting is the highlight.
Similar like Aamir Khan's from Dhoom 3.
The cat n mouse game between the inmate n the cops is thrilling like Law Abiding Citizen.
The film is about a person (Fletcher) held in police detention for the abduction n murders of several girls.
He is caught with the help of a vigilante (Kingsley), who sterilises pedophiles n rapists. They shud have focused more on the character of Ben Kingsley.
The film has shades of Dhoom 3, Primal Fear, Law Abiding Citizen, etc.
Alexandra Daddario looked way too beautiful to be a cop/profiler.",Night Hunter
13,arfdawg-1,Tedious,2,12 August 2019,This movie is so freaking slow and plodding it is nearly unwatchable.They stretched out a 45 minute film into 90 minutes and it shows.The acting is a B- and the storyline is a CDirection gets a C+The acting is a B-Ben Kingsley must need the money.,Night Hunter
14,jtindahouse,Great cast and a fast twisty thriller make for a great watch,9,13 August 2019,"I can't help feeling the title 'Night Hunter' somewhat misrepresents this movie. It's not inaccurate, it just implies a different movie. It implies more of a slasher film which this is far from being. The alternative title was 'Nomis'. I like that one, however it makes it sound like a foreign film to me, which is why I suspect they went with it. The bottom line is that I hope the title doesn't put people off seeing it because this is a very good film.Firstly, what a cast! For a run of the mill thriller this is close to as good as it gets. The entire cast are fantastic but to have Henry Cavill driving your movie in particular is just a wonderful addition. The thing with this movie is there are some moments where you certainly have to suspend belief. You find yourself asking would that ever be the actual police procedure in real life? But the thing is the movie is so twisty and fun and is moving at such a great pace that you simply don't care.This really wasn't the movie I was expecting to get going in, but I'm so glad it's the one I got. It had everything I love in a thriller. It also was not afraid to get very dark in certain scenes. There was no holding back in that regard. I had a great time with 'Night Hunter' and I would strongly advise you give it a watch if you haven't already.",Night Hunter
15,kwenchow,Is this really an action film? Slow like hell! Talking entire film! Bored to freaking death!,1,26 August 2019,"This film start with an unknown girl chase by a mystery man and she eventually fell down from a bridge and hit a truck scene! As turnout, this film is about solving the mystery of who is the mastermind of a bunch of female been restrain and torture! Entire film full of boring conversation! Slow like hell! Most intense scene is, the main actor ""Marshall"" raid into a place and a guy on a wheelchair kill himself! Big spoiler ahead! The mastermind actually is the twin brother of ""Simon"" that captured at the beginning of the film! Both of them become psychopath after abuse by their father! At the end, Marshall saving another female police in the film ""Rachel"" from the torture of both of the twins! Marshall catch one of the twin and ask another twin exchange Rachel with him! Both of the twins fell into the ice lake and died after fail to racing up to the surface! At the very end, Marshall drive away a car with his daughter and Rachel! That's it!

16,henry8-3,Night Hunter,3,16 June 2020,"Following the arrest of a man who had been holding and killing girls, Cavill investigates why things seem to continue. He is supported by 'insightful' vigilante Kingsley.There are some goodish bits in this, but the plot is just too ridiculous and convoluted to be remotely convincing.",Night Hunter
17,dar0417,Why Ben Kingley?,3,23 September 2019,Sometimes this film gets interesting other times its just bad.,Night Hunter
18,jimbo-53-186511,Sluggish,4,15 June 2020,"When a small team of police officers and a vigilante team up to capture and arrest a man who has been carrying out a series of abductions and murders on women over a number of years they believe that they have now put an end to his crime spree. Little do they know however that arresting him is only the beginning...I quite liked the premise and have to admit that there is an element of tension involved (particularly when you learn that the crimes are continuing even when our antagonist is locked up). Despite the cast doing their best, Night Hunter just isn't a consistently thrilling or exciting film...I found the film very slow (despite its modest 98 minute runtime) and I also found the narrative a little scattershot and unfocused. There is some exposition involving Kingsley's character and his vigilante antics, but as a character he isn't explored all that way (which is a disappointment as he is quite interesting). Naturally the main hook with this film is discovering who is helping our antagonist (it's a guessable twist, but it may surprise some).Director David Raymond occasionally injects some grit in to the film (although most of this is witnessed when the police are interrogating the suspect). Outside of this though the narrative lacks any real spark and plods along in a fairly pedestrian manner. On occasions the film cuts back to Marshall's home-life which are jarring and never feel entirely necessary.Still the cast can't be faulted and sell this film as best they can; perhaps the biggest surprise was Alexandra Daddario (an actress who I felt got by more on her looks than anything else in the past). Here she's actually very good and for once didn't have to bear any skin for me to take notice of her.Night Hunter has bursts of momentum and the odd good scene here and there, but for me this is not enough of a return on an investment of nearly 100 minutes of my life.",Night Hunter
19,Pairic,Vigilante & Detective Work Together.,7,11 April 2020,"Night Hunter: Detective Henry Cavill teams up with vigilante Ben KIngsley to solve the mystery of a serial killer who abducts and deafens women before killing them. Thanks to Kingsley they have rescued captives and captured a suspect but the prisoner, Brendan Fletcher, appears to be mentally disabled. Someone is striking from the outside with carbombs, kidnappings and lethal booby-traps . Perhaps a tad convoluted with many twists and a major plot reveal. Some good scenes of a basement dungeon with Christmas songs playing, gunbattles in a dimly lit warehouse. The tension builds as profiler Alexandara Daddario trys to get Fletcher to talk. Writer/Director David Raymond delivers a satisfying if over-complicated thriller. 7/10. On Netflix.",Night Hunter
20,omendata,Haphazard editing spoils what could have been a really good thriller!,6,11 August 2019,"The other reviewers pretty much have it spot on , its bad editing and disjointed flow make this a bit of a nightmare to watch and maintain interest.Good acting but Cavill was miscast, Keanu Reeves or anyone else should have been the main character , he just seemed out of place.It is not an awful film and could have been good but instead just above average 6/10.",Night Hunter
21,leftbanker-1,Way Too Many Things Going On in this Mess,1,15 August 2019,"This was so confusing as they tried to put way too many pots on the burner. It begins with the cop who is separated from his wife and estranged form his daughter. He brings his adolescent kid to his house and he has gruesome crime scene photos on the wall. Is this supposed to be some sort of parenting technique?And why does he have a non-American accent? Ditto with Ben Kinsley. He's a former judge and he's English? I don't get it. Either get American actors or have these people learn to speak with an American accent. Then there's another policewoman who is also British. WTF? Is this a small Midwest police department or Interpol? The potpourri of accents added to the general confusion.The Rachael character Was thoroughly annoying. She acted like the psycho was an abused toddler she needed to cuddle.And then it got really, really stupid.The police are going to allow a defendant to face a mob? Just completely freaking stupid.And then it got stupider, stupid like ""Are you kidding?"" stupid.",Night Hunter

24,reddiemurf81,Solid performance,7,4 December 2019,"While this movie won't be winning any awards, it's very good.
Cavill puts on a good performance as a bitter cop and father.
D'Addario's portrayal shows her flexing her dramatic wings a bit (she's more than just good,,, well, GREAT looks).
Kingsley,,, well,, it's Ben Kingsley. Even in his bad movies he's great.
Fletcher never ceases to amaze (see his performances in Supernatural, Arrow, etc), and really brings it in this one.
Tucci and Fillion, imo,, were really under-utilized in this picture,, but who knows,, they may have only had a few days off and needed the extra check.
So, watch it.",Night Hunter
25,spookyrat1,Everything But the Kitchen Sink!,5,8 March 2021,"For a 95 minute cops chase serial killer film, this one has it all. Murders, suicides, kidnapped and enslaved women and kids, unauthorised medical procedures, vigilantes, gruff, monosyllabic cops, dumb cops, profilers, a seemingly very unhinged villain and the twist that the production hopes that you don't see coming (But many will, because folks, it's been done before in more than one film of this type.).And that's the trouble with writer/director David Raymond's debut feature Night Hunter. It's tried to include too many generic touchpoints, at the expense of character development and fluid, believable story - telling. His talented cast is just completely wasted. Henry Cavill lumbers unsmilingly around. We're never quite sure why. He does get to use his normal British accent for once, though it might have been nice to (even briefly) know why an Englishman is a Minnesota detective. Alexandra Daddario plays a profiler, who never seems to profile or offer any psychological perspectives. It's more like she's acting as an over - aged baby - sitter. Ben Kingsley gets quite a bit of screen time, as a retired judge channelling Dirty Harry. The wonderful Stanley Tucci is just totally wasted, as a police chief with anger management issues. He has some appalling lines of dialogue to deliver. And Nathan Fillion's role is little more than a couple of walk - ons as a pretty unimportant minor character. Seriously anyone could have done it.Other reviewers here, point out the editing deficiencies and I'm not going to argue with them. This is the type of movie, where most of the cops just appear to be cannon fodder for the villains and never seem to adjust their game plan. Only Stanley Tucci back at the station complains about the mounting human resource toll. We're supposed to deduce that Cavill's and Daddario's characters, have had a past relationship, by the way they grimace at one another. Heaven forbid they actually exchange some extended conversation, in the same way, Cavill's Marshall, says virtually nothing to his estranged wife.Director Raymond's choices and story never allow the talented cast to showcase their true abilities. Contrarily, there's almost a perverse fun to be had, watching them struggle mightily in a collective cinematic attempt to make a series of silk purses out of decidedly sows' ears. Ultimately, just like the film's soggy climax on a frozen river, Night Hunter sinks unsurprisingly under its own weight.",Night Hunter
26,PsychoBeard666,What a waste,6,2 February 2021,"This could've been excellent and at times it showed potential, but there were elements that were too far-fetched, tenuous threads barely holding the plot together and moments that were in desperate need of being fleshed out.What a waste of a brilliant cast!",Night Hunter

They just seemed detached and were just going through the motions for the paycheck. Plus, the story wasn't that great to begin with, so I suppose they had to make do with what they were given. The young Canadian actor I'd never heard of before, Brendan Fletcher, did a good job as the weird guy. It reminded me of the first time I saw Ed Norton in his first film, Primal Fear. He was really believable in that movie, so much so that he was even nominated for an Academy Award for it. I really thought Ed Norton was mentally challenged in real life, like Giovanni Ribisi in The Other Sister. This movie is really a '5'. The additional point was for Fletcher.",Night Hunter
28,Neptune165,worst story ever,1,1 September 2019,"Good actors to cover the worst story. What's with Ben Kingsley accepting every script he's given. Do yourself a favor never see this movie... The script was awful and absurdly unbelievable. Could have been so much better. Maybe if they showed more of the tech involved and how the bad guy knew so much about the police. They can write a decent script, but they choose to rely on the easy cliché. Henry cavill A handsome guy with great body and 0 talent. Some of the dialogue and characters were corny. The cast is lacking, the scene in the interrogation room looked so fake! Cast is an issue, music no prob with. And split personality!! Really! the ending just doesn't make sense....there were only a few cops chasing two dangerous killer wheres the others? Direction is awful! Who lets an amateur guy to direct a movie with so many good actors? was all the budget just spent on the actors? This film is The most over the top of the worst I have ever seen Terrible.

29,nicholls905-280-546911,Mixed bag,4,3 November 2019,"Starts off promising, but the final third suffers from the pacing and over plotting. The cast is quite good and appear as though they are enjoying the film. The issue is the characters lack true depth and the filmmaker throws a lot familiar actors into their roles. The filmmaker needed to drop some of the twists to ensure the pacing matched the material. The cat and mouse aspect was interesting for the start, but the slow burning pace kills the momentum. I believe they attempted to jam too much of everything into this film.",Night Hunter

Henry Cavill is not just a face, he is an amazing actor, Ben Kingsley is awesome too, his scenes are so touching and Brendan Fletcher an actor mainly known for his roles in horror films, his character as Simon is perfect, his performance is great and deep.

34,danielmanson,It's not bad. Just has some flaws,6,25 April 2020,"My main issue with this is that first half of the film was great, really fished me in. But the second half just fell apart in my opinion. It had some good twists in there, so it wasn't a complete failure, but it just left a few too many unanswered questions.
The characters made way too many weird decisions, which in real life you just wouldn't do.Don't get me wrong it was a good watch. It's a forgettable one, but it's worth giving a go. Acting is good and there is a good amount of redeeming qualities. Not as low as a lot of reviews are suggesting",Night Hunter
35,J_Batek_II,"Generic, But Interesting. Not As Predictable As It Might Seem.",5,14 October 2020,"I spent most of the movie thinking I had figured out the mystery in the first 20 minutes or so. It turned out, there was a little more to the plot than I had assumed. So, I figured out about 50% of the mystery in the first 20 minutes or so....The fact that the script wasn't entirely predictable does not necessarily mean that this was a good film. Everything here has been done before, and has been done better. If 'Primal Fear' (1996) had a baby with 'Law & Order SVU', the result would be a movie like this one, but with better parents. Alexandra Daddario was fun to watch. But, I would also enjoy watching her cook pasta, and the pasta wouldn't have so much implied sex abuse.Yeah, I'm never gonna watch this movie again.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

36,drpainters,Well that sucked,4,19 August 2019,"Don't waste your time like the actors of this movie did by being in it. Story just doesn't flow properly , bunch of random actors pop up but none are really used well. Unfortunate waste of talent.Spoilersat no point does Cavill fly in to save the day.",Night Hunter
37,whitemanfromtowne,What a mess.,2,16 August 2019,"The only part in the film I want to address is why would a law enforcement officer help let a serial rapist escape from a holding cell, because his baby was abducted and second the story doesn't even address it? WTF? Overall a very incoherent mess of a film. Another depiction of how inept law enforcement really is. A very poorly written story",Night Hunter
38,fluffchop,"Unsettling, Gritty and Dank.",4,25 October 2021,"How do they not throw Ben Kingsley's character in jail for castrating people? Seriously how the hell does that fly? It makes no sense whatsoever. The weather is horrible with snow and ice and bleakness everywhere. It adds to the mood of the movie which is almost depressing for the most part. The bad guy was weak with no motivation other than something to do with their mother. A lot of weak writing and too much plot confusion to really drive any one point home. It's got overlapping multiple plots without much clarity of delivery on any one of them. Like the cop with the ex wife and daughter who is posting things online. The new chick who somehow seems to be a psychiatrist and knows the guy shows signs of schizophrenia because he has multiple personalities which has nothing to do with the disorder. The stupid captain who says kill them and generally acts like a dick the whole time. He's a pointless character that they didn't need at all. There's too much going on and none of it is covered in any detail. Why did someone break into his house? It was never explained. It's a really unsettling movie because there is no flow of energy from tension to release. There is no flow to it at all, it just stays at an uneasy state the whole time which is ultimately really annoying. It's got some poor writing, no character development, no explanation of plot points. It's just goes along like bleak turd of a movie. Why do they march the suspect out to the crowd outside? So much about the film is just quite stupid when you think about it.",Night Hunter
39,willandcharlenebrown,Don't trust the ratings on this one. Very good movie,7,5 February 2020,I normally don't disagree with my IMDB family consensus but this was a good movie. Had potential to even be 8 but I will go with 7 due to a few minor flaws in the script writing. Primarily the psychologist looking 18 years old.,Night Hunter
40,ferdmalenfant,I really enjoyed it!,8,15 September 2019,"No one pays me for ratings and I can tell you that I rarely find these little gems. The acting is very solid all around. The plot is just twisted enough but not confusing and keeps you wondering right up to the end. This is definitely a ""Thriller"" worthy of the label.",Night Hunter

42,movieman6-413-929510,Starting director assembles his first film too chaotic.,3,31 August 2019,"Night Hunter is een nieuwe thriller geregisseerd, geschreven en deels geproduceerd door David Raymond. Dit is pas de eerste film die hij heeft geregisseerd.In de film zit de getraumatiseerde politieagent Marshall (Henry Cavill) achter een seriemoordenaar aan. Tijdens zijn zoektocht naar de seriemoordenaar komt hij de oude rechter Cooper (Ben Kingsley) en zijn jonge helper Lara (Eliana Jones) tegen. Cooper probeert op zijn eigen manier voor gerechtigheid te zorgen door criminelen met de harde hand aan te pakken.
Als ze op de plaats delict een verdachte genaamd Simon (Brendan Fletcher) oppakken, denken ze dat hij samenwerkt met anderen.
Tijdens zijn verhoor met agente Rachel (Alexandra Daddario) raakt ze ervan overtuigd dat Simon aan een meervoudige persoonlijkheidsstoornis lijdt. Terwijl Marshall en Cooper onderzoeken of Simon criminele partners heeft, probeert Rachel te bewijzen dat hij een meervoudige persoonlijkheidsstoornis heeft.Dat deze film pas de eerste echte film is die David Raymond geregisseerd en geschreven heeft, valt helaas wel aan de film terug te zien. Hij heeft de film namelijk wat te chaotisch in elkaar gezet met drie personages die allemaal hun eigen misdaad theorie proberen te bewijzen aan de rest van de politie. Zo spelen er eigenlijk drie verschillende verhalen door elkaar heen, waardoor de films soms wat onduidelijk valt te volgen. De film is verder ook rommelig in elkaar gezet, want de scenes van de verschillende verhalen lopen chaotisch door elkaar heen.De film heeft een goede cast met acteurs als Ben Kingsley en Stanley Tucci, maar door het slecht uitgewerkte script van de film kunnen de acteurs er ook niet veel beters van maken. Er wordt bijvoorbeeld niet duidelijk uitgelegd waarom Henry Cavill zijn personage nou getraumatiseerd is. Brendan Fletcher zijn personage zou slim moeten zijn, omdat hij al zijn misdaden voor een lange tijd kon plegen zonder opgepakt te worden, maar op het eind van de film maakt zijn personage ineens vele domme beslissingen die ingaan tegen hoe zijn personage in het begin werd neer gezet.",Night Hunter
43,ritera1,Poor production of a good script.,7,20 March 2021,"Not great, but better than most in this genre.Some good actors working with good parts. Brendan Fletcher had plenty to dive into and did well as the baddie. Would imagine some would say he was overacting, but walked the line. Very energetic. A large portion of his dialogue was muddled but strangely didn't distract from the performance.Cavill did well as a brooding hero and Kingsley and Tucci are great just standing there in anything. Daddario was not spectacular but turned in a decent performance, especially when she was vamping in the interview. Would err on the side of her eventually shining in the right part. She has an Achille's heel as her beauty is very distracting and works against her credibility as an actress.Moved quick and established story succinctly. Understood the characters, by and large. (A major distraction was Cavill's and Kingsley's British accents. I wasn't even sure what Cavill's cop partner's accent was, but add it to the pile. Filmed in Canada but did it take place there? Are Brits in Canada in public service common? Very odd. We all know that Cavill can do an American accent, but don't recall Kingsley ever doing one.)Story took a different direction as it started at the end of this killer's run. Well, didn't turn out like that but was an interesting place to start. A few plot points vague when it came to the computer stuff, the VHS tapes and ultimately the tracker on the bear. (Separating those parts showed the twins' location...how?).Not exploring obvious investigative elements earlier was obvious, like ownership of the textile factory and the house they were in was never mentioned.No idea why the mother's rapist would have been redacted in court documents.What was that ball on Cavill's truck when he visited the textile factory?Did fall for the father being force fed in a few shots which distracted from the ALMOST comical surprise of the twins. But worked. Did recall the next day the few hints of such that were given.The ending was phrased like there was some master plan to get them to fall through the ice. Was a long shot.Putting the gun in the hands of Daddario was strange.Why didn't the twins just keep running? Why weren't the twins armed all along?The final scene where Cavill said Daddario saved his life was strange. She didn't.Including an unseen husband for her was clutter.Yes, I felt early on that Cavill and her had an affair but seemed shelved 'til the end.Very poor production values and felt like a rushed shoot. Being that this is Director David Raymond's first feature, don't know if it suffered from his lack of talent or him being hamstrung due to budget and timeline. His script was above average, by and large, as I opened with. Could have been longer to flesh-out character a bit more. (The crowd scene was poor as I didn't see any TV cameras, just a boom mic.)Probably better movies to see but that's because competition is fierce. Although not a waste of time.",Night Hunter
44,bangel3322,Never really took off,4,30 September 2019,"This film has an interesting premise and some really good ideas but unfortunately it never really went anywhere. It was a bit all over the place with a lot of plot holes. It's like the cops all figured everything out and forgot to tell us the rest. A shame because I thought Henry Cavill was really good in this and the film had potential. And by the way, I'm not impressed that they cast someone as brilliant as Nathan Fillion only to kill him off so quickly.",Night Hunter
45,elliotte2,"Great potential, waste of talent",4,15 January 2020,"This really could have been a good movie however the editing/directing is all over the place. Movie jumped from scene to scene without any correlation or flow, too often I was trying ot figure out where they were at and why. In the climax I barely know who was doing what. It is almost like the movie had a different story and was changed halfway and rearranged the scenes to fit the new narrative.Also, people with multiple psych degrees should not look like they are 21 years old and just stepped out of a Victoria Secret catalog.",Night Hunter
46,rlaine,"Such a mess of a movie, bad in so many ways",3,13 April 2021,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a while seriously. If you ""just watch movies"" you may find this passable pastime, but if you like me expect a bit more of your movie time, you better pass this one. There is no point, focus or proper structure at all. There are way too many characters and none of them is fleshed out properly. They could've dropped the character played by Henry Cavill completely (as well as Tucci) and the movie would've probably have been a lot better and focused. The Rachel (Daddario) character would've been enough. Henry Cavill gives probably the stalest performance I've seen in a good while, but the script is not on his side either. Even the Kingsley character doesn't quite fit in.Brendan Fletcher gives a pretty impressive performance tho, but it doesn't make up much as the character/story is so confusing. The whole script is confusing with editing that jumps from one thing to another with seemingly no direction at all. I don't know if a lot of scenes were left out, but a lot of stuff happens out of nowhere.Somewhat atmospheric, but a complete mess of a movie and nothing to grab into really, very uninvolving. Thumbs down.",Night Hunter
47,bpilato-08111,Not bad but I've seen it before,7,26 February 2021,"The plot had some interesting points I can appreciate the entire going after creeps thing, but the entire twin thing I have seen before. There was some cheesiness at times, like shooting the ice 10 times and it doesn't break but walking across it does ?? Come on. Nothing mind blowing here but a decent thriller",Night Hunter
48,confidential-67897,Waste of a talented cast,4,10 August 2019,"Terrible directing and even worse editing, almost like it was their first job after college.

49,elgrampo77,Kind of ok,6,6 December 2019,Some really serious plot holes and unbelievably stupid acting by police (e.g. are you really deploying only 2 police cars and a detective to a crime scene where a mass murderer is holding hostage young woman AND a police officer??) offset by a couple of nice twists and of course King Ben who makes every movie at least 2-3 stars better....,Night Hunter
50,strupar-66747,Too confusing,1,19 September 2019,The story makes no sense. The actors are terrible at acting and the sound was bad. It felt like a high school movie.,Night Hunter
51,blrnani,A lot of potential wasted,5,27 December 2020,"This film seemed to be going in a very interesting direction, showing a tragic case of female kidnapping on the one hand and a disillusioned judge setting up molesters for his own brand of personal justice. Unfortunately it all went a bit haywire when the crazy Simons were introduced. The idiocy seems to have been contagious, with the police behaving irrationally too and needlessly exposing themselves to danger towards the end. The talented leads deserved much better.",Night Hunter
52,jdring2007,"doesn't live up to its potential but still very enjoyable, mostly thanks to Henry Cavill, Brendan Fletcher, and some solid suspense",7,27 September 2021,"While heavily flawed, primarily by inconsistent pacing and unnecessary length, this movie offers some great acting, intense emotions, a tight script, and above average suspense. There were surprises to be had, some of which I saw from a mile away, others that blindsided me. Cavill was superb, and had a particularly powerful scene that, although brief, will stay with me. Ben Kingsley and Stanley Tucci were compelling as always, and many of the smaller roles were fulfilled passionately. Brendan Fletcher was particularly impressive, as bad as he was, there was also something to empathize by the end. The progression of the plot was a bit too snaky, and I think it lost a lot of people, being unnecessarily complicated. Nonetheless, a satisfying rental.",Night Hunter
53,Jester222,Somewhere amongst this confusing and disjointed film is a fantastic film trying it's best to get out.,5,22 August 2019,"This film had so much potential. Great cast and the story could have been really good but it ended up a disjointed mess of a film.
Editing is terrible.
Pacing is thrown about chaotically and feels like large chunks of storyline are missing.
Seems like a huge waste of potential.
I managed to watch all of it and there are some very interesting moments. Acting us top notch .....especially the main protagonist who is a very underrated actor.
Kingsley character wasn't fleshed out enough, just hinted on and a wasted character who is seemingly able to get away with serious crimes!?
Maybe there are scenes on a cutting room floor somewhere that would have made this a great thriller but sadly the final result they went with us a mess.
Shame.",Night Hunter

55,nkishudak,Why the bad reviews,8,6 July 2020,"Well nothing new, but not boring either. I have mixed feelings as the ending could've been better. Henry is surprisingly good in his role. Finally brought some real feelings out. Alexandra D is a mediocre actress. She should stuck to modeling. The new Megan Fox :D
Worth to watch this movie, there are small things that bothered me. But in generally it is a good psychological therapy thriller.",Night Hunter
56,Boristhemoggy,Fabulous thriller,7,13 May 2020,"This film is underated imho. It is thrilling and interesting and has a twist you don't see coming. It's well directed and the acting apart from Henry Cavill is top notch. Sadly Cavill let's the whole team down with his utterly unbelievable cop character.
Brendan Fletcher on the other hand who plays the protagonist Simon, is absolutely brilliant. I totally believed in his madness.
This film kept me riveted tonight, excellent stuff so it gets a 7 from me. (Would have been 8.5 if it was not for Henry Cavill)",Night Hunter
57,KoolCatReviews,A tasty main meal was promised but we got a side helping of disappointment,5,23 May 2020,"This movie left me highly dissatisfied. It seems like the main story had some merit but the side plots and ideas present were really poor. I can't fault the overall camera work it was the editing that really got this film in a mess. Confused sub plot and ideas completely detracted from the main story. With this cast and the premise this really should of been an excellent movie but its not, just a confusing mess.",Night Hunter

59,MinistryofDoom,Tries too hard to be Se7en and Silence of The Lambs,5,19 January 2021,"Ah, Night Hunter. Where to start? Well, throughout the course of the film, I found myself bouncing back and forth between thinking that Night Hunter was the best crime thriller since Se7en, to thinking that it was dumber than a bag of marshmallows. I would be astonished if it turned out that the writers of this film weren't inspired by Se7en or Silence of The Lambs. The intensity, style, and plot twists blatantly invoke those films. However, was it an homage or a rip-off? I'm still not quite sure. Night Hunter suffers from alot of problems; it's riddled with plot holes, poor writing, and while some actors did a great job (Cavill, Tucci), others (Daddario) did not and just weren't believable in their roles. When the film finally reaches it's climactic action scenes, and of course the obligatory plot twist, it just falls apart and becomes a convoluted mess. In the end, it really did just feel like a poor man's Se7en. However, for roughly an hour and a half, it'll entertain you if only you'd suspend your disbelief and overlook it's numerous flaws.",Night Hunter
60,asage19,Wow!,10,7 March 2020,"This film is amazing! It's clean, pristine, everything is just perfect - there is no fat on this movie, it's all lean, high quality. Sometimes I was confused by events that didn't seem clearly explained, but at the end of the movie, I appreciated that. It's uncommon for North American films to *not* have a clearly explained plot, where there is very little left to the imagination. In a film as good as this one is, that is in its favour. I was simply taken up and taken away with the story. My faith was repaid. The acting is just great. It's an amazing cast! The plot is tight, the cast is tight, the setting is gorgeous. *Each* actor is wonderful with the role they are given. Like other reviews here, I want to specially mention Brendan Fletcher, who was so good, so believable. Rare quality film.",Night Hunter
61,Jakealope,"Terrible, derivative, sensational & a waste of time",3,12 January 2020,"If you are here, you probably watched it on Amazon lately. It reminds me of a past Amazon offering that dealt with the similar theme of abducted and abused women and had a similar mid sized budget and star studded cast, The Captive. They are both Canadian movies, but at least Ergoyan's Captive was set in Canada not Minneapolis. And his movie avoided the sensationalist murder part with a cardboard psycho baby killer that elicited laughs. I also hated this movie because it reminded me of Law and Order SVU, but w/o the ripped from the headlines faux realism. And it was way longer too.
It had its share of too hoakey even for a movie stuff
6 cops are gassed to death searching the torture, secret prison. Why? Just for more senseless
I like Henry Cavil and hated to see the cardboard possessed and divorced homicide detective character he played. I hated the side angle of his cute relationship with his ex and his daughter, and how his daughter heightened his concern for vulnerable exploited girls.",Night Hunter
62,plasticanimalz,Suspenseful and Entertaining,8,7 December 2019,"I watch and listen to a lot of true crime, and was surprised to find this, given I'd never heard of it. It not only met but exceeded my expectations. It was suspenseful, twisty, and great acting, particularly by the bad guy. Henry Cavill is surprisingly brooding, and did a good job as the cop whose seen too much. Alexandra Daddario...well, she's likable and nice to look at. All around good story, cast, suspense, directing, and kept me glued to my seat. And the opening scene was eerie and really starts the movie off creepy, sucking you in.I was surprised to see the low score and bad or mediocre reviews, as I'd already recommended it to many people who are also true crime and horror fans. I know everyone has their opinion, but there were some that said the script was all over the place and they were confused? At no point was I confused. It was a pretty standard crime storyline. I chalked it up to some people's short attention span and inability to connect things together, 'cause this one wasn't even confusing or that in-depth. It was pretty standard movie. Maybe Avenger movies being nothing but smashing faces and punching has disabled some people's ability to follow a simple story. Who knows.There's some petty comments people made that seemed irrelevant, like about Henry and Alexandra's attractiveness. Have you seen a movie? Watched television? Do you think Jon Snow would be that attractive in real medieval times? And, frankly, without Henry and Alexandra, no one would have clicked on this rental. Some said the writing, directing, and editing are bad? That's awfully specific and it was really well done, so, I can only conclude that some male reviewers are upset by a certain scene which was a little too real for them. Maybe they've done something bad or thought about it and gotten away with it, and the what happens to this character was more than they could handle. Or, maybe just the thought of what happened to him was too disturbing. Interesting, they can watch women get kidnapped, tortured, murdered all day long, but something extreme happens to a guy and suddenly they're all upset. I thought that part of the movie was great, and appreciated the directer/writer introducing something new, that, frankly, was well deserved. I wouldn't have arrested Ben Kingsley either.There are a few tiny holes, but not anything I really thought about while watching it. I just enjoyed, and was surprised to find a crime film where I didn't immediately know the twists.",Night Hunter
63,edicionccq,"Try to stay awake for the ""Night Hunter""",5,24 November 2019,"I don't have to say a lot about this movie. Night Hunter attends an almost decent movie. That's it.
The mystery is good in his concept but the way it develops is slow, not so slow to be chaotic but slow to be boring. The only character that you develop to enjoy is Henry Cavill's. The rest of the characters are so one dimensional that is hard to feel something for them.
The villain remains uninteresting until the last half of the movie.
""Night Hunter"" is a good movie to prove that Henry Cavill is an excellent actor, and also if you want an almost decent story.",Night Hunter

The music was awesome and set the tone of the film, cinematography was great and some scenes have beautiful snowy landscapes.The gorgeous Alexandria Daddario did a very good job as a drama performer, being that we ususally see her in bad comedies and with very little (or none) clothes. I think she should do more drama.
Henry ""Superman"" Cavill was very good at it too and Brendan Fletcher as (the killer Simon - The film is also known as ""Nomis"", simoN backwards) was great.

The idea behind it and the ""twist"" are quite good (if a little obvious) but the execution is very poor.Long periods of boredom followed by hectic scenes that leave you wondering what's going on.There are many plot holes. For instance, there is no way that someone who has effectively committed grievous bodily harm (or whatever the US equivalent is - battery?) would be allowed to walk free from a police station, no matter what their motives (in this case a honey trap for sex offenders).The ending is quite ridiculous and none of the people involved would act the way that they do.Overall it gets a 4 from me.

With the culprit Brendon Fletcher caught at the scene the police have to workout how their curious culprit is continuing to play games with them. In a mystery that doesn't drag due to its 90 mins run time the pace is fast and interesting.

72,just_in_case,A bizarre dumpster fire.,3,18 November 2019,"I find myself legitimately intrigued by how this got made. More so than evaluating the film. It has a bunch of high profile actors, its well funded and the story would be fine if done well. Instead its completely amatuerish and at times non-sensical. Both writing and direction is rough. Sure enough its written and directed by one guy - david raymond. I tried to look him up but found nothing. The production studio has a couple movies in flight, indie films again with big names attached but nothing that would explain who paid all these actors to be in a film made by this person. I find this fascinating. I suspect theres money and favors involved..which would be a better movie than this.tldr: subpar silence of the lambs/se7en clone. Everyone talks like robots except ben kingsley and stanley tucci who seem determined to actor their way through this snoozer. The villain forgot to read the script and instead screams and drools for the run time. I honestly dont know what dondario was supposed to be doing. Cavill clearly doesnt want to be in this

I'll watch anything she's in...even the Baywatch movie, albeit on mute. Anyway, I was pleased to find a decent plot, solid acting from nearly everybody involved (Ben Kingsley still strikes me as a less charismatic Yul Brynner), and dark dazzling photography that reminded me of masterful chiaroscuro paintings. A great equipoise of light and dark. It plays like a nightmare that at odd times is somehow comforting. Grisly moments balanced by Daddario's grace which disrupts the disorder and holds the eye captive for a while as you try to catch your breath. I hope she keeps challenging herself with deeper, more layered and nuanced roles like this one. I'll return to this flick often, maybe not as much as True Detective s1 ep2 Seeing Things, but, yeah, often. Another winner in A.D.'s luminous body of work.",Night Hunter

85,mrrcave,"Good film, setting aside the lead can't act.",7,8 June 2020,"Decent plot and good cast aside from Cavill who as far as I can see ticks someone's box as ""eye candy""; certainly can't act; is wooden ; totally lacking expression aside from flexing muscles and anger.Worth a night's viewing, but does drag on",Night Hunter
86,aeongale,Surprisingly good,7,10 August 2019,"Can't really complain too much about this film. The acting is good, with Brendan Fletcher's being excellent. The directing and pacing are all on point.

87,mujali-48677,Not as bad as some may say,6,31 December 2020,"Although flawed, this movie is not as bad as some reviewers have said it is. Yes there are some plot holes but not every film needs to be a masterpiece, sometimes formulaic and boxes ticked are just fine. The actor who portrays the villain does so very well and creates a very unsettling character. I wasn't really impressed with Henry Cavill, who just seemed lethargic, as if he'd lifted too much at the gym and as a result the whole movie was just too much effort for him. Alexandra Daddario was really good, way more to her than just amazingly blue eyes.",Night Hunter

90,ztigr,Great cast play dumb cops. Do these decisions make sense?,3,27 August 2019,"What a waste of a solid cast. I am becoming so tired of lazy writers using dumb decisions by cops to forward the story line. Barney Fife was a character from Mayberry, not your typical homicide detective in a big city. On that note, here are the truly moronic actions of these cops you might consider for your own screenplay:
1) Never have an ambulance backing up any crime scene
2) Park your car where criminals have easy access to it
3) Have hero visit multiple crime scenes without backup
4) Don't secure a mass murderer during a bomb scare
5) Enter an interrogation room with a suspect that has physical superiority over you, uncuff him and then start prodding him into violence
6a) Despite numerous instances of cops involved with the case being targeted, don't be proactive in protecting families, just continue to react
6b) Prioritize outwitting the media and sneak the criminal out of the back of the building with only a couple of cops as escort.
6c) Make sure all the other cops are nowhere in the vicinity when your transport vehicle does get predictably ambushed, so they cannot respond in time to be of any assistance.
7a) Let your criminals consistently outflank you and get the drop on you when you are pursuing them. Though your criminals have no guns to begin with, they are able to obtain weapons and then systematically shoot every cop within striking distance
7b) and in the one instance you do get the drop on the bad guy with his back turned, allow him to turn around and shoot you dead center before you are able to even get a shot off, this with the guy standing on ice mind you, the sturdiest of footings
8) Have criminals die in the stupidest way possible of their own making, Aren't you clever for thinking of this unique way to do away with them? Bonus moron points for you!
9) Only send a handful of cops to take out the criminals even though they have killed at least 10 cops and dozens of other victims. Because we never see cops overreact in real life do we?
10) Don't really give criminals enough background story to understand why they are the way the are. Leave that to the audience to be bewildered by.Oh bonus: Make sure you really insult the audience by thinking they won't pick up on the foreshadowing that there are 2 brothers until the big reveal. Think M. Night Shymalan writes a screenplay for preschoolers.If you can do that, you too can write a typical cop chases killer screenplay that Hollywood may actually buy.",Night Hunter
91,catschasemice9594,Watch it then forget it,6,14 January 2020,This movie feels like it was rushed or made by inexperienced young film school grads who watched too much Nordic Noir at college. If you are a fan of Joe Nesbo you'll probably find this film passable. Dark depressing scenery with grumpy cops. The script needed editing since it had hunky plot holes. And things that made no sense like much of the Cooper character who seemed to be in another movie. It isn't terrible.

With a cast and a story like this it had potential, but so poorly managed, directed and written. That said, what a great example to show aspiring professionals how difficult it is to make a good film. The details need to be scrutinized carefully and at the very least, cohesive. It's almost like this was a result of a ""speed movie"" contest and the whole crew united to do the best they could in 48 hours.

He is as wooden as a Spanish galleon . The mystery is how did such a gifted actor as Sir Ben Kingsley ever get mixed up in this load of clap trap with its nonsensical storyline masquerading as a twisting thriller . Alfred Hitchcock , the master of the genre , must be spinning in his grave along with Ghandi director Sir Richard Attenborough. There are so many scenes that defy belief and a script that contains so many cliches it becomes almost a comedy . A score of 3 is being generous .",Night Hunter

It's why I decided to watch it, and they did not disappoint.Lots of intertwining, important pieces of information, such that one can figure out the ending before you get to it - but unlike a lot of similar films, I didn't feel like they were holding the important conversations up to the camera so you knew to pay attention to those ones.I'm fond of movies in the dark and the snow, and it does both.

Nothing good ever came out of a film with a lead actor who looks like he puts steroids on his morning cornflakes; just check out anything by Lundgren or Schwartzennegger if you don't believe me.This film does start promisingly though, before descending into formulaic ""Cop With Issues In Race To Find Deranged Serial Killer Before The Heroine Gets It"" nonsense.There are SO many plot holes and unexplained loose ends in this piece of hackneyed garbage it would take me all night to list them, so I won't - this film's already wasted enough of my evening.Ben Kingsley is excellent, of course, and the chap playing the psychotic Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum is good in his dual role, albeit a little over the top.Bluntly this film is nonsensical, and is filled with characters who make even more nonsensical choicesBest avoided.",Night Hunter
106,hydralien-40230,"Solid, dark and thrilling, with somewhat weaker final part",8,30 October 2021,"The acting is amazing - the movie is full of characters, and the actors depict those characters impeccably: from smallest to largest roles they're all distinct, all special, but all believable and not going overboard. One exception would be perhaps Nathan Fillion's role (it's hard to tell why he's in this movie, and the character is not important for the narrative) - and the protagonist's daughter (it's not clear if there's a traumatic history or not, the narrative around here is somewhat missing).The story is engaging, gripping and appropriately dark, although the final part is weaker than the rest of the movie and the ending itself feels somewhat strained and anticlimactic, which is a shame because the rest of the movie is great.Overall it's a solid grim detective thriller, very worth watching.",Night Hunter

109,DreamerX616,Flawed But Watchable,7,24 May 2020,Engrossing enough serial killer thriller but the poorly miscast Cavill as a supposedly 'weathered Lieutenant' clearly didn't ring true here. I mean every scene looked like he'd just left the gym and no amount of ruffling up his hair and letting his beard become all grizzly can take away the fact that the only weathering he'd been through was a walk in the rain without a coat on !!Still there was plenty of fun to be had with Kingsley phoning in the morally ambiguous vigilante and Brendan Fletcher having the time of his life playing with multiple personalities.The plot wasn't always coherent and there were more than a couple of scenes that just seemed to drop into all the characters laps so we could move the story along but all in all not that bad of an effort while we wait for another season of Mindhunter.,Night Hunter

It jumps around with no real connection at times to what's supposed to be happening or we think as viewers what should be.

He does a great job and he can clearly carry a leading dramatic role. Alexandria Daddario is also cutting some acting chops beyond the scream queen roles of her past. Her striking eyes are tough to work past but she too puts in a decent dramatic performance. Of course Stanley Tucci and Ben Kingsley are cinematic gold and the 'villain' is well played by Brendan Fletcher (who you've seen strong performances in The Revenant and Rampage). This movie is a good thriller with decent plot twists and suspenseful moments. It's a less polished than something like Seven or Bone Collector but manages to be quickly paced with car chases, stunts, suspenseful drama and good envogue cinematography.",Night Hunter

This movie needed fewer big name actors, and better work done behind the screen.The writing is somewhat original, but poor. The results of public education no doubt. This movie moves away from the, find the last girl so she doesnt die, that movies like The Cell, did infinitely better, yet this movie still managed to pigeon hole the ONLY 2 females characters at the end, as if we didnt see that coming. Also, the one girl who was simply NOT needed except to provide the writer/directors view of cops, and to make her the not once, but TWICE in the same movie, kidnapping victim!The editing is terrible here, pointless scenes, scenes that dont transition well to the next scene, scenes to long, to short, you name it.Even the big name actors couldnt save this poorly directed film, though they tried.",Night Hunter

I'm confused as to why they are able to get Ben Kingsley, and give him nothing with which to work. Given David Raymonds track record in film, I don't understand why he was handed a stellar cast, and large production. All in all, this was a waste of celluoid, and my time.

The film, of course, does not stand up to criticism in comparison with the best thrillers about the investigation of crimes of serial killers. Due to too many characters, sometimes completely superfluous, and a ragged plot, one gets the feeling that it was originally planned to shoot a mini-series, but as a result all ideas had to be ""crammed"" into the format of a full-length film. I was particularly perplexed by the plot twist with the twin brothers. This idea struck me as both silly and familiar. Then I remembered: there is plagiarism from Dean Koontz's novel ""Whispers"", first of all the fact that the twins, in fact, identify themselves as one whole.

Marshall (Henry Cavill) is investigating the case of a murderer who seems to be retarded but yet adroit killer while he's arrested. Cooper (Ben Kingsley) is also an old man who wants to make the world a better place by his own justice.In the first half an hour of the movie, every scene is vague & I was trying to make sense of them but a little later everything fell into place. There was really nothing innovative about the story as we've seen many popular & successful movies like this before. Also choosing Alexandra Daddario to play Rachel was a huge mistake, it's just too soon for her to play such role.David Raymond seemed to pay more attention on casting than the screenplay & this eventuated this fiasco. He was trying to show the close relationship between Marshall & her daughter in couple of scenes & the way Marshall feels really bad about the victims of harassment among young girls. But still he wasn't successful in it.",Night Hunter

There were cross overs of 'Law abiding citizen' and even smacks of 'Seven'.Its a shame however that the writing got lazy in places, which in turn, opened up some noticeable holes. It jumps and even rushes over its own sub-plots too often to which made them look like plot fillers added in after a proof read.Worth a look.",Night Hunter

With the cast of Henry Cavill, Ben Kingsley, & Alexandra Daddario I was expecting more out of the movie as in wanting more thrill especially as a serial killer film. Brendan Fletcher in my opinion plays a great part and definitely makes the movie better but felt his character could have expanded further to make the movie even better. I guess what I am trying to get to is with the cast of this movie the plot could have been better and expanded more. I was surprised in a good way with certain part of the film.

171,the_rog_2000,Opportunity missed,4,16 April 2020,"A film with a promising storyline, let down by poor acting, lack of any real back story for the characters and very cheap production.It's like they ran out money - only about a dozen actors in the whole film, edited poorly leaving big gaps in explanation, for example:What is the relationship with the lead and his ex?how does the lead know the female police officer/psychiatrist (her role was never really explained)How did the girl acting as bait come to live with the vigilante?how does a former judge turn into a psychotic butcher that castrates his victims?Not completely obscure, but why are the two male leads both British in a back water American town?how did the police force come to be so incompetent that most of them get killed or tricked easily by one man and his brother.why did no professional check the pulse of the baby when they assumed it was dead?why was the female officer allowed into an interview room alone, to uncuff the suspect and tease him by opening her shirt? Ethical and professional violations galore!what is the relationship between the lead and female officer at the end?why wasn't the vigilante arrested for castrating however many victims and using presumably illegal tracking devices?Really felt like the actors couldn't be bothered, and were just biding time to pick up a pay cheque.Not a wholly awful film if you need to waste an hour and a half and aren't expecting high budget drama.Predictable outcome, but aren't they all?!",Night Hunter

Twists and turns with well timed (and not too much) action scenes. Great performances by the always reliable cast of Ben Kingsley, Henry Cavill and Stanley Tucci.

Was it enough to downgrade this from great to bad or at worst mediocre? Absolutely not!!The film had everything; I was on the edge of my seat at some points, I felt for the antagonist that sucked me in and felt almost betrayed when he turned out to be bad, I understood Ben Kingsly's motivations, and when Henry Cavill gave his daughter the reason he sometimes seems cold and distant I was almost moved to tears!Don't get so bogged down with mistakes the movie makes; such as editing, sound, some performance, etc. just like people everyone has flaws. Take it in as a whole or maybe rewatch it, because it was great! Not to mention, it original! It borrows from great cat and mouse thrillers like Silence of the Lambs.

It has a lot of cuts and ends up getting loose, when you can see that the story has great potential. I think a big problem is that in addition to the main story, the film has several other sub-stories that end up not being developed and let the film decay in quality. Anyway, bad choices were made in post-production that takes the film to this very average note, if you want to watch a thriller I would not recommend this one, there are several much better ones.",Night Hunter

The scenes were completely fragmented to the point where the characters were not developed and inconsistent from scene to scene. Not sure if it was the directing or editing or both but it became an incomprehensible mess very quickly. Even the photography was awful...something I don't normally notice but in their attempt to be gritty, it became distracting and destroyed the possibility to become immersed in the story.With a different director and crew, it would have worked, but this just fell apart.",Night Hunter
185,JediColt,*** Spoilers ***Absolutely terrible,2,3 September 2021,"Just a total and complete mess throughout. I love suspense movies and horror movies, and my tolerance is pretty high as it has to be to enjoy those genres. So if I am saying this movie is terrible, trust me. The ""twist"" is obvious from the start, and I don't just mean to the audience, the freakin' killer is pretty much telling the main characters at the very beginning. You can tell Brendan Fletcher is trying to be. Edward Norton in Primal Fear but he fails miserably. It doesn't matter though because we have the most incompetent police force ever. The killer is able to wire bombs to cars right outside the police station, break into everyone's house and kidnap their kids and apparently their procedure in the event of a bomb threat is for everyone to run outside screaming and allow serial killers to just walk right out. The killer escapes from custody twice in a matter of days, they cave to every demand he makes even though he never cooperates in any way, shape or form. The ending is the most laughable part of the entire film as they finally locate them (there's 2 killers) and despite being 2 serial killers who have confessed to about a dozen unsolved murders, they send 2 police officers total on their manhunt, both of whom go on to get ambushed, beaten up and shot with their own guns before somehow bumbling to victory because the killers are total morons. Don't waste your time. This was a top notch cast that was squandered on this film.",Night Hunter

All the women cast looked similar - white with long dark hair & it took me a while to figure out who was who.
Storyline was haphazard, not enough was invested in each character to figure what they was about.
3 characters commited crimes including drugging, castration & assisting a detainee in escaping lawful custody, yet this wasn't addressed.
All in all, a waste of a good story.",Night Hunter

190,apolsexybootie,They could've done more,2,20 September 2019,"The story concept is the same old police killer chase, but as it progress it became more exciting.
What i dont like about it is there is not much of an action to it instead of just pointing gun and flashlight in the dark. Alexandra dadario is not much of a help either but her acting is annoying here.
The movie is promising but i think made in a rush that they didnt put much idea to it.. They said the killer killed 10 girls but how he does it was never shown in the movie.
The ending either doesnt give any justice to all of his victim. How it ends it was so so lame. I was super dissapointed.",Night Hunter

192,gavinmaitland-85580,interesting story but badly put together,6,5 May 2020,"Well, what can I say about this movie...?
This is a really interesting, pulpy thriller that is unfortunately a bit of a mess. Great cast all vying for screen and story time - any one of their story threads would have been interesting - its as if the director couldn't decide who to make the protagonist so he just made them all the protagonist which you can do if you have a long enough movie and the directing chops but it just wasn't well made enough. A pulpy thriller trying to be Heat or Infernal Affairs.
At one point there is a montage scene early on where we are supposed to be seeing what all the characters are doing at the same time and - I swear that they are just adding in extra characters we haven't met yet as that point. During a montage where you are supposed to 'know' those characters already.Nathan Fillion. Why?! Whats the point? I understand the whole thing of getting that bigger star in to confuse the audience but there was no time or story for him for us to care about him. He was a pointless character.The 'twist' is so unbelievably pulpy that it belongs in some old Double Indemnity type movie from the 40s. When I saw it coming I said ""No, they can't be doing this can they?!"" But they did. It's so unbeleiavbly stupid and obvious they could have really only got away with it if the film was more self-consiously a pulp-noir ala Raising Cain but its going for Hard-Edged Thriller instead, so it doesn't work.This feels like there was a good movie somewhere that was probably hacked apart by the studio rather than an incompetent director not knowing what he's doing but then there are some acting and story choices that seem stupid or don't make sense so I don't know what.Almost worth watching just for the train wreck that it is.",Night Hunter

The deux ex machina resolution just adds to the mess.Here is just one of many examples of how they didn't bother consulting a single person on police procedures (especially when it's an important part of the plot.) They evacuate an entire police headquarters because of a mystery package that got delivered ... then the ""highly trained"" detective - without a bomb suit no less - stands right over top of the box, while the guy WITH the bomb suit cuts the too open with a box cutter.

Even the random old dude who hit Ben Kingsleys car. The story was very predictable and the ending felt really lazy. The twin brother 'twist' was stupid. None of the characters felt real but the main character (Henry Cavill) in particular was very emotionless and overall a dumb character. I mean who leaves disturbing crime scene photos on the wall when your daughter comes over, and goes in behind the bomb squad without any protection just because he thinks it's not a bomb? Sure he was right but there was literally nothing to gain by being there. Also, Ben Kingsleys characters should've been in jail for the whole movie.",Night Hunter

Plot holes where there should have been tiny spots of character backstory. Not the main characters for the most part but some of the co-star needed a little more back story. The movie feels very rushed and just assumes you will figure things out on your own. The ending was ok and I think the director shares some of the blame for this mess. Editing was clearly done on an Apple IIe because it looks like Pre-K edited out 1/3 of the story. So watch it if ya got nothing better to do but honesty this one is hit or miss.",Night Hunter

Cooper was my favorite character of the film and his love for his Laura (unofficial daughter.)

Yeah some things, if done differently would have made this better, in my opinion the finale came out of nowhere and was one more clue that wasn't really needed.

224,aaronjudd-44736,An OK episode of NCIS,3,29 August 2019,"When I walked away from this movie I thought it sort of felt like I binged a couple episodes of NCIS... The okay acting, a bad guy who does all the overdone bad guy tropes, a disillusioned cop doing all the disillusioned cop tropes, a lot of far from accurate police work, network beautiful actors, and strange editing decisions. Everything you would expect from a TV cop show.When I saw the star studded cast and new director I thought hey this could be the next ""Prisioners"", and blow me away..... but I mean... It's not bad but... it sure isn't going to be written about for years to come.",Night Hunter

Definitely a must-not-watch.",Night Hunter
226,b-72437,Lose a star for a star perhaps,8,21 August 2019,When I saw the cast I thought it's popcorn and gf round for our usual weekly pot luck program. The film delivered on giving us both a good evening but maybe didn't need 2 big names. Kingsley is going to come through and cavell juggling life and work have his character feeling but I just felt maybe a new actor/actress could have been given a spot in this as one of the leads. Other than that I can't much fault the premis just possible cast selection.,Night Hunter
227,Cima90,Outstanding Movie - great character and storybuilding - psychological masterpiece,10,12 October 2019,"I also don´t understand some low ratings. I assume some just wanted to see so much the ""game with the young girls"".Instead they are getting an exciting psychothriller. The backgroundstory from the main and co-main characters was told scene by scene. And the villian character is simply amazing.Finally a new type of evil - the psychologie is a little bit disturbed but if you watch the whole movie with all character build up - it is not disturbing it´s impressing. Thank you for that kind of art.Reminds me a little bit of the Joker character (R.I.P: Heth!).The movie has entertaining thwists building up to the most satifisying great final battle between good and evil.The ending will give you goosebumps.More in detail would have to much spoiler.Thank you for that incredible movie - better than 0815 Hollywood these days and deserves an kind of oscar - at least I can honor this movie and I give it a MUST SEE!!!!",Night Hunter

232,jeniferrenne,A VERY GOOD MOVIE!!!,8,2 March 2020,I have to firstly say kudos to the director for making such a great film and with great cast in it. Everyone acted so well and strong character portrayed in the film. The subject of the film is so strong and it portrays the actual real life that happens out in the world. The drama and chase was intense and the story progressed as it went and kept you curious on whats about to happen next. Great job and this is a movie not to be missed.,Night Hunter

There's no slow buildup in this movie, you start with action and it just keeps going the entire movie. It was an enjoyable thrill ride the whole time.There are a bunch of pedantic reviews taking about how ""this could never happen"", or ""that could never happen that way"", but honestly, don't all movies require us to to suspend our belief, and embrace a new narrative? I've never seen a superhero movie and said ""OMG, this movie is not real because people can't fly"". Ughhh. Rant over, sorry.If you're a fan of crime/suspense movies, then you will enjoy this.

248,PositiveFilmSdnBhd,A good movie worth watching!!!,8,6 March 2020,This is a good movie with nice twist and turns. The acting is good and the flow keeps u watching. I feel this movie didn't get much the attention needed maybe lack of marketing and so on but its a good story with a great A list cast. Henry playing a a police role and going thru issues within his family and a revenge from an ex judge to protect all the young gals out there from the internet prey. A vert strong message that the society can relate to these days. This is a movie i strongly recommend and it will surely be a worth of your time.,Night Hunter
249,meistermatthias,Wasted Potential,5,6 January 2021,"With Henry Cavill in the lead it's always a bit hit or miss. Unfortunately, for me this movie was a miss.The concept is great, though. A former judge (Kingsley) who castrates sexual predators with the help of a young female, a somewhat bitter cop (Cavill) and two twin brothers (Fletcher) who capture and torture women all cross paths in a cat and mouse game.The movie however is kinda boring, all over the place, characters are not really fleshed out and the editing ruins every tension the story builds up to. The twist, that there were actually two twins doing all the killing surprised me.The actors and actresses were good though, especially Fletcher. Overall a wasted opportunity.",Night Hunter

255,elishebamaslo,Cold but needed less cuts,7,20 August 2019,When I sat down to watch this I was thinking it would be similar to The Snowman starring Fassbender. It started off with that level of merit when I saw the cast as I thought probable watchable yet such a challenge to bring out the best. Kingsley for me gave better than his Ironman Mandarin performance and Cavell is clearly trying to break from his stereotype and focus on dialogue and character portrayal with depth. However I was left a bit wanting in most respects because the storyline just begged for more. Maybe it was too short which meant the editing suffered but it just couldn't maintain my expectation of a great film but a good film none the less.,Night Hunter

271,amskorzeni,Pretty decent story.,8,13 June 2021,"I'm not really a fan of grim, gritty realistic crime dramas. I like fantasy, giant monsters, and superhero films mostly. However, once I started watching this movie, I did get into it. I disagree with other posts about the movie being disjointed or poorly edited. I watched and paid attention the whole time and the story made perfect sense to me. I don't think this is one of the movies you can enjoy while talking on the phone, or doing your laundry, or otherwise being distracted. If you pay attention and are of average intelligence, there shouldn't be any problem understanding and enjoying this movie. I will say I was not impressed with the cops in this movie. They were written to fail for the most part. I suppose in some cities this may be a fair depiction of law enforcement, but too much of what was going on seemed to be in the villain's favor. But that is a nitpick. Nevertheless, I'd recommend the movie. I disliked the language, but other than that it was a reasonable movie. I really fail to understand why movie directors feel the need to put the F-word in their movies so much. True, plenty of people use that word in real life, but the movie could've had that expletive replaced with a family-friendlier word and it wouldn't have detracted from the movie in my opinion. Thankfully, the use of the word wasn't too overwhelming.",Night Hunter

274,Msteelefinley,Greatness that's been castrated...,6,14 August 2021,"As a filmmaker, I could tell this film started out with a great script. And it had a great cast. Even side characters had motivations and side stories and personality (IT team). The dialogue was fun, there were great comedic moments that still felt like they could fit in this gritty story, but then something terrible happened in the edit. It feels like it was supposed to be a full season of an episode show and they must've started shooting that, but either finding hit a snag, or distribution deal came in for a feature instead and people went to work castrating the great potential this story held. I can tell a longer story was scripted and shot, and somebody made some bad calls from there on out. I thoroughly enjoyed what I saw, but felt like somebody was skipping chapters every 12 minutes.Also, why does this Twin Cities-esque police force have a British detective, an Irish Detective, a British man who used to be a Judge, and everyone else with a very neutral American accent (not regional)? I love British actors, but it was confusing having all these actors judge sticking with their own accents.Basically, just pretend you're speed skimming through a TV series and you maybe skimmed too much, but it was still a good show.",Night Hunter

I like to know what I'm getting into, and I genuinely believe that the reviews for this movie lead me to believe this movie wasn't as well done as it was. It was nice to see a lot of these critically acclaimed actors sharing the screen. Henry Cavill, Alexandra Daddario, Sir Ben Kingsley, Stanley Tucci, Nathan Fillion, and of course Brendan Fletcher all played their roles magnificently. I'm glad I stumbled upon this movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great flick.Thank me later,

Sound was awlful. Music was too loud, voices sounded like they were mumbling and I had to turn my bass down to zero for fear of losing my speakers.The protagonists were wearing exactly the same clothes which I thought was pretty unlikely and cheap, but Brendan Fletcher did a good job of it.
Stanly Tucci came and it his bit regardless as he always does.
Henry Caville was miscast.
Ben Kingsly could have been used more but at least he had my fav scene at the begginning when he hits the guy with the bat.A waste of a good cast.",Night Hunter

278,carlos-teran-70,Don't waste your time.,4,21 August 2019,"I tried to be more than fair to this film, given its cast. It has Michael Barrett's excellent photography, the original premise is also quite interesting and there are bits here and there where the writer-director tried to flesh out some characters. In paper, it has an outstanding cast. I loved Brendan Fletcher's performance. Eliana Jones is amazing, stealing all her scenes. And that's about it. Nomis a.k.a. Night Hunter has some of the worst acting I've seen lately. Henry Cavill couldn't be more cliché and honestly he's seems like he's just going by the motions, not even trying to be more than your typical burnt out cop. Alexandra Daddario looks so out of place that I was surprised she wasn't edited out of the movie. Her performance couldn't be more flat, totally coming across as a nuisance in all her scenes. Stanley Tucci, Nathan Fillion and Ben Kingsley seemed only interested in cashing their checks, and that's utterly sad. Alex Lu's score is intrusive, and repetitive. Heck, it even sounds like stock fare from any given music library. It's a very disappointing film and pretty good example of a nice premise going the wrong way. This is David Raymond's first ""real"" film as a director with a ""real"" cast, and I don't know who was financing this bloody mess, but I hope they get at least a third of it. They made a good choice to make it VOD.",Night Hunter

294,stefanbosch,feel offended,5,27 August 2019,"I agree on that other woman's review earlier. She felt offended about the movie. I feel offended too. I do not know where to start or where to begin to describe how bad this movie is. I mean like everything is wrong. Though I must admit it keeps me watching.Everything about the movie itself is ""schizofrenic"" and thus unreal. Like every part. How the heck can the offender (the paranoic schizofrenic madmen walk free all the time and do the things he want to do..they just listen to him all the time and he is playing this ""SAW"" games on the police and everyone else. Normally, if a guy is in this mental state in the Netherlands. No one will ever listen to him ever. Like no one. He is going to be dropped in a mental instution immediatly and does not come out of it. It is called TBS. So they can get help. But what does this movie do. The police is asking him many questions and he gets sicker and sicker and he can do what he want. Even they put themself in danger many times. As if they do not learn from it the first time, they keep making the same errors in the movie. He can even kill other people because of their bad job functions. I mean, every other movie involved with the cops and just FBI kind of things are realy profesional and the cops or FBI is never realy offended. I think they feel offended alot seeing this movie. Because the main actors and protagonist act so badly. Badly in a way they do not do their job good.Everything could have been so much better.Also I do not realy get the plot and the script and story. It is just a bad story aswell.There are many more , much better, thriller movies out there....a looooot more.Not worth your time watching. .Do not watch. I beg.",Night Hunter
295,rsmock-57733,I must have watched a different movie!,10,26 January 2020,"I am by no means a movie critic, or claim to be one. Nor am i criticizing other people's reviews..im just confused by all the bad reviews because i thought this movie was GREAT! It had a great plot! With a ton of holy craps... Up until cavill figures it out i did not know what was gonna happen....it wasnt predictable AT ALL.. i am of course enamored with Henry Cavill but Ben Kingsley was the best... Im just telling you as a person whos hard to please when it comes to movies outside my usual genre (horror/gore) this movie was GREAT!!! Give it a chance😉",Night Hunter
296,traneman,Potential lost in editing and directing,7,15 February 2020,This movie was enjoyable but the editing and directing was horrible. It had so much potential that was wasted by a fast job.,Night Hunter
297,tracksiter,So good in so many ways!,10,10 September 2019,"I hardly write reviews but I had to write one for this movie. When I first saw the trailer I was interested because of all the actors in it esp Ben Kingsley. When the movie was finally released I was surprised it was not in a theater near me. I ordered it on Amazon. I prepared for a failure when I saw other reviews however failure is not how I would describe this movie.Kingsley, Cavill, Tucci, Daddario, Kelly and especially Fletcher did an excellent job. I don't know what other reviewers were watching but I thought these actors/actresses did a good job. I really like Kingsley and Kelly's relationship in the movie. Fletcher as Simon is chilling. Every time he was on screen I get a sense of unease disturbance. I just wanted to turn away but I don't want to. I wanted to see what clues or secrets he might give up.The story isn't that hard to follow but I did watch it twice. The first time I just let the movie take me where ever it wants and it was full of drama surprises and twists. Oh lots of twists. I was not disappointed. The 2nd time I watched it looking for clues to see if I could have guessed what would happen and sure enough there are clues here and there but you have to be looking.Overall I really liked this movie. It grabs you from the start and doesn't ever let go. There are some scenes that are hard to watch not because of the gore but rather the suspense and drama. I don't want to give anything away but I highly recommend this movie. Be prepared to be entertained. It's worth a second watch for sure.Enjoy.",Night Hunter

Who did THAT surprise? The acting is wooden, the story is awful, I bought this on iTunes and want my money back!",Night Hunter
299,iveseentigers,First 30 minutes are very good.,5,8 May 2020,Ben Kingsley and the girl work really well in this film. They're only used well for the first 30 minutes. Henry is also very good for 30 minutes and then the writing is all over the place. The film loses it's flow and starts to have glimmers of a tv movie. The film is too long and sufferes from not having a very messy storyline arc.,Night Hunter

302,bradleyminnssa,8/10 but should have been a TV series!,8,21 September 2019,"Good movie with good cast, really should have had an 8-10 episode series. They could of done so much more with it, delved further into back stories, character histories etc..",Night Hunter
303,rdgriffin-41598,What's all the fuss?,7,3 March 2021,Not an Oscar contender but VERY entertaining! Definitely weak points ... but a well-acted thriller.,Night Hunter
