0,bkoganbing,None of the style of the TV show,6,18 June 2019,"I wish I could have written something better about this film version of the 80s
TV series. Miami Vice which starred Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas
was a truly hip show, a view of the 80s as 77 Sunset Strip was to the late 50s
through the Kennedy years. Don Johnson was quite the fashion style trender
in those years and there was a bit of wit in the show.None of which is present in this film which is a routine police action drama.
Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are a pair of cops going under to try and take down both a drug kingpin Luis Tosar and one mother of all drug shipments
at the same time.Complicating things is Farrell falling for Tosar's wife Li Gong. Talk about
urinating where you eat. He should be facing some disciplinary problems
soon.I'm not sure fans of the show will really get into this.",Miami Vice
1,Leofwine_draca,A distinctly average thriller,5,1 June 2015,"Michael Mann's Miami VICE is an updating of the popular 1980s TV Show, casting Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx as a pair of undercover cops seeking to bring down drug dealers in sun-drenched Floridian locations. The movie even throws in a little sightseeing in Cuba for good measure. Unfortunately, a distinctly average, seen-it-all-before storyline means that this was never going to be anything other than a middling thriller.Mann works hard as director, shooting his film in a colourful, fashionable way (think MANHUNTER) and adding some decent music to the soundtrack. A lot of the film was shot on hand held cameras, which I like; it goes to show that hand held footage need not solely exist in 'found footage' movies, and there's not a shaky-cam in sight, either.Cast-wise, this is a mixed bag. Farrell is acceptable as the smouldering hero, but Foxx is miscast and seems bored with his part. The good news is that he's off-screen for about half the running time. Gong Li is very good as the femme fatale, even if she did learn her lines phonetically, and there are some good if minor performances from Tom Towles (HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER) as a white supremacist, the reliable Ciaran Hinds, and Luis Tosar (SLEEP TIGHT) as a drug baron.",Miami Vice
2,SnoopyStyle,Moody noir from Mann,7,28 September 2014,"While working undercover, Miami-Dade police detectives Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Rico Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) get a frantic call from an old informant Alonzo Stevens (John Hawkes). He tells them that he's been compromised while working for the FBI investigating a huge Colombian drug cartel. FBI agent John Fujima (Ciarán Hinds) is in charge of the Joint Task Force. The duo pose as drug smugglers as they infiltrate the organization. The cartel is using the Aryan Brotherhood for distribution and muscle. Crockett begins a romance with the kingpin's girlfriend/adviser Isabella (Gong Li).Michael Mann hasn't recreated the 80s cheese factor of the original TV series. He has created a moody noir with some violent action thrown in. It's not glossy but it wants to be. Whenever Farrell and Foxx are on the screen together, this movie wants to be a fun flashy action thriller. Mann keeps pulling it back to the hyper-realism that reminds me more of 'Collateral'. It is a lot of shaky cam work and stylized visuals. The story is not the most inventive but it delivers a dark grimy tone. I do wish the dialog could be snappier and not just about the attitude.",Miami Vice
3,claudio_carvalho,Michael Mann: Synonym of Good Action Movie,7,19 January 2007,"When an informer, his family and two FBI agents are killed by an international gang of drug dealers, Detectives James 'Sonny' Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo 'Rico' Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are assigned to work undercover for the FBI in a joint operation to disclose which agency leaked the information to the criminals. They plot a scheme to approach with their team of agents to the manager José Yero (John Ortiz) and later to the drug-lord Arcángel de Jesús Montoya (Luis Tosar). Along the mission, Sonny meets the accountant, investor and mistress of Montoya, Isabella (Gong Li), and after a romantic affair, they fall in love for each other, blurring his professional commitment with his personal feelings.""Miami Vice"" is a good action movie and does not disappoint: having names such as director Michael Mann, and Gong Li, Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell in the cast, a well constructed story, it is a great entertainment. Of course there are the common exaggerations, with efficient police and agencies, the good guys are stronger, faster and more accurate than superman, but in my point of view, this is the reason of being of an action film. The best scene is the shot in the forehead of the bad guy in the trailer, I loved it. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Miami Vice""",Miami Vice
4,jboothmillard,Miami Vice,2,31 August 2009,"Ace Ventura quotes ""Tonight on Miami Vice, Crockett gets the boss some coffee"", that was the only way I knew about a TV series in the 1980's, and of course this was the attempt to bring it to the big screen, from director Michael Mann (Collateral). Basically FBI agents Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are going undercover in an attempt to infiltrate some big drug deals. Unfortunately the plan backfires, and they are not getting anyway with the distractions of Crockett's romance with Isabella (Gong Li) and Tubbs romances with Trudy Joplin (28 Days Later's Naomie Harris). Okay, I'll be honest, I didn't pay that much attention to the plot, so I can't even be sure or care if the description I have given is that accurate. Also starring Luis Tosar as Montoya, Ciarán Hinds as FBI Agent Fujima, Patch Adams' Barry Shabaka Henley as Castillo and Justin Theroux as Zito. I got bored almost immediately, I didn't fully understand what was going on, in fact, I was so bored all the way through I couldn't care less. How I stuck with it is a miracle in fact, maybe it's just my like for actors like Farrell, Foxx and Harris and directors like Mann, well, and knowing why it was two stars out of five from the critics, I see why! Pretty poor!",Miami Vice
5,Tweekums,It is not like the TV show but is still a decent film,7,8 June 2010,"If like me you were a fan of the TV show 'Miami Vice', a show that epitomises cool in the 1980s you are in for a bit of a shock. Don't expect lots of high speed chases in top of the range cars and speed boats, don't expect the humour and don't expect a Jan Hammer sound track. If you can put the series out of your mind however this is a decent cop thriller. After a major multi-agency drugs investigation is tragically blown the FBI agent in charge asks the Miami police to take over as they took no part in the original operation so weren't the source of the leak that ended his operation. The two officers given the case are Crockett and Tubbs; using their contacts they take out the gang's key importers then infiltrate the gang saying they have what it takes to get their product into Florida. After the first run goes well Crockett gets involved with the beautiful Isabella, a business woman high up in the organisation he is investigating. In a sequence that wouldn't have been out of place in the TV show he takes her out for a drink... in Havana. After a night of passion he returns to Miami to organise the second run. This time go wrong; the gang have kidnapped fellow officer Trudy and threaten to kill her if Crockett and Tubbs don't deliver the contraband to a new drop point. This all leads to a dramatic rescue attempt and a thrilling shoot out between the gang and the police.Once I'd got over the fact that this wasn't trying to be like the TV show I found this to be quite enjoyable; Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx were good in the lead roles and Gong Li put in a fine performance as Crockett's love interest Isabella. While the final shoot out was impressive it didn't lead to the capture of the gangs leader which may have been to set up a possible sequel or, as I choose to believe, to show that those high up in the drugs business rarely get caught. Another change from the TV show is the level of violence; while it was considered violent at the time there was rarely any blood shown, that is not the case here, when somebody is shot they look like they have been shot.",Miami Vice
6,ma-cortes,"Cinematic adaptation from classic TV with action, suspense and violence",7,15 October 2007,"This is a story about being undercover, and what happens when you go deep undercover.Particularly if you're doing an operation in a foreign country, where your badge doesn't count and where you can't have SWAT team surveillance you, and people are not in contact, you really are out on the edge. It's the allure of doing that undercover work and what happens to you when you're deep in that role of that fabricated identity. These roles protagonists(Colin Farrell,Jamie Foxx as Sonny Crockett and Tubbs) are filled by real deal. This is a cool film directed by Michael Mann. He tells that his ambitions with a picture like that was to really go exploring into some of diverse areas. It's shot in location Scout, South America. One of the exciting things about Michael Mann is the choosing real location all the time. We're dealing with environment that can often surprise us. Whether it's the light, whether it's dramatic moment with the sky, or some interior or some sort of background action that would not have happened in a controlled backlog situation. Michael gets this slickness, finding places, that, you know , that aren't even on the map.He makes as real as he possibly can. He's all about, why fake it, when you can do it for real? . The cameraman Dion Beebe gets a maximum chromatic saturation. The shooting in these places like Ciudad del Este is incredibly stimulating and exciting.It's a Tri-border area where Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina meet. It's such a unique part of the world. This town have people who are from Middle East, Lebanese and Syrians, a lot of ethnic Chinese and the country speaks Guarani, which is the indigenous language. These people were extras and director got to be pretty determined to get a crew to these places. Also was shot a lot of stuff in the Dominican Republic and in some areas, it took a lot of social engineering to be able to bring a film company in and shoot responsibly and shoot safely. The main shooting is Miami, it's kind of globalized city with a huge population and a lot of money, and lot of people from Haiti, Brazil, Venezuela Columbia. In the movie Miami seems to have elevated itself, up into the most sensual which is up into the air.It's reflected the storm systems, the clouds, the dramatic weather and nature in a very, almost tactile way. Filming in really swank, fantastic places, and the girls are still beautiful(Gong Li, Naomie Harris,Elizabeth Rodriguez) and the cars are still fast but doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the underbelly of Miami.The city is photographed with alluring, it's very attractive, very engaging , sensual and also very dangerous and things that we can see around the images; furthermore an atmospheric music score by John Murphy. The motion picture is well realized by the successful director Michael Mann.",Miami Vice
7,Quinoa1984,a film I admire even as it's lacking,6,28 July 2006,"I think after seeing writer/director Michael Mann's the Insider and Collateral, maybe I expected a little too much from Miami Vice. But then, even as an 80's baby, I've never seen a single episode of the original Don Johnson TV show that Mann was crucially part of. His film adaptation of the show will definitely appeal to his main fans, but as a stand-alone action-packed blockbuster thrill-ride, it does and doesn't deliver. It's hard to explain why a film like this should work better, because it does contain enough grit and intensity to be a step above other knock-off type films with rough, smart, intuitive cops who don't take s*** from no one, and the even more dangerous criminals. But for a film from Mann, who is probably one of only several in Hollywood who can have such an auteur-like status over a production as sprawling and big-time as Miami Vice, there's something that just didn't connect with me like his other films. And it's something that is hard to really say as criticism, but it is a film that is more interesting as a kind of digital action-drama experiment than as a real entertainer. The people on screen might be depicting some kind of close-to-reality type of world where the guns are very real and those on either side don't have overtly tongue-in-cheek jabs at each other. But on the other hand, it's not really that much fun either.Another liability with a film like this, which takes itself seriously enough to try and use the style of its different look and of its two leads, is that the story should be more clear. At the core of this film is a story that was meant, I'd assume, in the vein of the Miami Vice TV show, is more of a B-type story than something big like Mann is aiming for. To compensate, the director's script is so concentrated on keeping to the lines of the tense and narrow (and occasionally clichéd which is good and bad) that a kind of un-reality permeates through the characters and the scenarios. In other words the story is not really as interesting as it thinks it is. Nevertheless, the actors as mentioned do carry themselves enough for their parts, with each understanding their character's lack of characterization left mostly for broad strokes. For example, the sub-plot involving Colin Farrel and his romantic interest (who is also the main drug dealer's beau and business partner), doesn't develop much further than allowing for the stylistic flourishes. They do look terrific together on screen, as repeated Audioslave songs pop up with the near cinema-verite angles Mann imposes. But the script doesn't give them much more to do than provide two-dimensional fodder for later in the film.I guess what I mean to say about Miami Vice, for all of its ambitions to rise above the material and be a kind of fresh take on the crime/cop action genre with drugs and SWAT teams filmed in HD, is not up to par with what Mann is capable of as a filmmaker. His heart is in it, but it's one that doesn't seem to be as interested in going a little deeper into the character's psychologies like in the film's previously mentioned, but more into getting tighter angles and tough hand-held night shots that border on becoming distracting. It's a picture in the end that does deliver what it promises to its viewers- sexy scenes, thrilling gun-fights, tense negotiation type moments, rotten-to-the-bone villains and slick good guys- and will probably be a let down if you look for more underneath the surface/think about it much afterwards...When I look back on it now months later, not really memorable.",Miami Vice
8,edwagreen,Miami Vice-As a Film Not Good or Nice *,3,15 October 2007,"What terrible chemistry between Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx. These 2 guys are horribly miscast in this film. They are constantly mumbling and the background presents a totally boring story that should have been more fascinating. The problem is that there is little to no action before the end of the story.Miss Li Gong, up to her neck in drug trafficking, appears as if she is pain just to be in this film.This is certainly a film where you begin to wonder where the action is act.Miami is far from hot in this frigid film.",Miami Vice
9,sunwarrior13,A Poor Man's Version of TV series,7,30 September 2012,"Miami Vice is a crime drama about two Miami police detectives who go undercover to fight drug trafficking operations. It is an adaptation of the 1980's TV series of the same title that was written, produced, and directed by Michael Mann. The film stars Jamie Foxx as Tubbs and Colin Farrell as Crockett, as well as Chinese actress Gong Li as Isabella.Ricardo Tubbs and Sonny Crockett are two police detectives working undercover in Florida. Tubbs is smart, cool, and resourceful, while Crockett has his own way of doing things, though he stays close enough to the rules to stay out of trouble. Their latest assignment is to get the goods on Arcangel de Jesus Montoya, a local drug kingpin whose men are believed to be responsible for a handful of recent murders. In order to infiltrate Montoya's operation, Tubbs and Crockett pose as powerboat racers willing to use their talents to pilot drug-smuggling ships for the right price. The detectives' ruse works, but as they dig deeper into Montoya's inner circle, they become involved in a dangerous operation that will take them to Haiti and Cuba, where neither the Miami Police Force nor the United States government can help them if things go wrong. Crockett also begins walking a risky path when he begins an affair with Isabella, a woman high up in Montoya's organization.The film adaptation of Miami Vice isn't a particularly accurate translation of the hit TV series considering that both leads - Farrell and Foxx - did not match the charisma of their counterparts in Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas.Aside from that,the story in it is underdeveloped story is well below the standards of Michael Mann's better films like Heat and Collateral despite the fact that the film is visually stunning as the director was able to provide the viewer with stunning images and some intricately choreographed shoot-out scenes.But overall,it is just manages to be a poor man's version of the TV series.",Miami Vice

11,hitchcockthelegend,Vice Vice Baby!,7,29 August 2012,"Miami Vice is written and directed by Michael Mann. It stars Colin Farrell, Jamie Foxx, Gong Li and Luis Tosar. Music is scored by John Murphy and Klaus Badelt and cinematography by Dion Beebe. An adaptation from the TV series of the same name in the 1980s, the film sees Vice Cops Sonny Crockett (Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Foxx) go undercover to try and smash a narcotics smuggling ring.Is this Michael Mann's most divisive film? Perhaps? What we do know is that it ostracised many fans of the TV series it was born out of, whilst simultaneously it flummoxed the casual cops and robbers movie fans who were looking for a Bad Boys type extravaganza. One thing for sure, Mann did it his way and refused to cop out and take any easy option, if he was going to adapt from the TV show he helped make a big success, he was going to put a different spin on it. He was after all a different artist to the producer bloke he was back in the mid to late 1980s, really anyone familiar with his work should have expected a complex, character driven picture with intricacies stitched into the narrative. And so it proved. Gone are the bright colours, pop culture funnies and OTT action sequences so linked forever to Messrs Johnson and Thomas. In is brooding, neo-noir characterisations and a darker colour palette.In truth the plot is simplicity supreme, but the myriad of characters built into the plot is one of the things that makes Miami Vice fascinating. Elsewhere the visuals carry the Mann hallmarks (nobody does night city scapes like him), the filming techniques stylish and the director crowns his story with a stupendous showdown. Coldness of atmosphere is very much favoured by Mann, danger lurks everywhere for Crockett and Tubbs, and undeniably we the audience feel that peril too. But it doesn't all work. The pacing, oddly for a Mann film, is choppy, momentum is lost at critical times, and perversely, by keeping Crocket and Tubbs so deep and focused (they barely interact with each other to any great degree of bondinghood), the audience doesn't really have chance to identify with them. The romantic thread between Crockett and Isabella (Li) doesn't really help the flow of the piece either, especially since Li looks and sounds uncomfortable with much of the dialogue.Yet for all its evident problems, it's a film that pays bigger dividends on revisits, especially if you happen to be a Michael Mann fan any way. Once viewed and digested as to what type of film it is, further viewings become more educational. We can't suck out the exposition and the languid passages still grate on the nerves, but the craft is quality and Miami Vice is always sly, sexy and savvy. 7.5/10",Miami Vice
12,Scarecrow-88,Miami Vice,6,6 December 2006,"Sonny and Crocket(Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx)go undercover to shake down a drug cartel. Their target is José Yero(John Ortiz), but through him they also pursue the real major drug king Arcángel de Jesús Montoya(Luis Tosar). Along the way Sonny begins a torrid love affair with Montoya's partner, Isabella(the lovely and always great Gong Li). Also, they have an Aryan brotherhood, who work with the Latin American drug cartel within the Miami border, to deal with as well.Exotically captured cinematography and technically sound production values(you can just see the money put behind this film)with the vice police voicing elliptical ""cop-speak"" which adds flash to a basically typical ""cops versus drug cartel"" plot that has been worked over in films and television shoot-em ups for decades. Heavily laced with a rock soundtrack, that I liked, but the film seems to be missing that energy and fun the colorful, beloved 80's series had. Too long(to be honest, a lot of Mann's flashy long takes of boats traveling the ocean and high sky-line shots do tend to go on a bit long)and a wee bit pretentious. It says pretty loudly..""Look at me, I'm pretty."" The final shoot-out at the end with the camera-work working through a shaky cam actually worked for me. This film ultimately depends on your tolerance level of self-important camera stylistics which I am able to forgive. But, if I'm honest, the leads did nothing for me and both Farrell and Foxx seem to be sleepwalking through it. Foxx certainly doesn't have that same presence in this film(he seems held down actually)as he did in the much superior Mann vehicle ""Collateral.""",Miami Vice
13,lastliberal,Let's take it to the limit one more time.,8,22 July 2007,"Well, they didn't Michael Mann (The Insider, Collateral, The Aviator) failed to produce the magic on the big screen that he did as producer of the TV series.Colin Farrell (Phone Booth, Daredevil, Minority Report) and Jaime Foxx (Ray, Collateral Jarheal) never seemed to have that chemistry that partners should have.This was all about special effects and car chases and shootings and explosions; and nothing about the characters in the movie.It wasn't a total waste as I had the opportunity to once again see Li Gong, and that's enough to satisfy me.",Miami Vice
14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Not bad,7,8 July 2009,"I have never seen any of the original show, nor do I particularly have any interest in doing so. Thus, I cannot make a single comparison, and I don't really know how this rates, as being a movie remake/version of a TV show. My main reason for watching this is Mann, and his trademark realistic gun-play with actual, recognizable arms is present here. This does, to an extent, feel like a lesser Heat, and it should be obvious to anyone that, of course, De Niro and Pacino were the more memorable lead duo. I don't really have any problem with neither Foxx nor Farrell, they've both delivered performances I enjoy(Ray Charles and Bullseye, respectively, and not on the same level). The plot is involving enough. Pacing is pretty good. The acting is nice. Visually, it's incredible, absolutely gorgeous, and with exquisite level of detail. The cinematography and editing are effective, with hand-held used well. This has language, strong violence and a little sexual content, and there are aspects that some may find disturbing. Not for younger viewers. I recommend this to fans of the people who made it. 7/10",Miami Vice
15,view_and_review,Let the high roller life begin,3,28 May 2008,"Michael Mann missed the mark on this one. From a cinematic stand point, the lighting was dim, the sound was low and it cut from scene to scene too quickly. Plus with the lingo, the jargon, the myriad of accents and abbreviated dialogue I could barely follow what was being said. I'm not a cop and I'm not a drug dealer so a lot of the jargon went right over my head. Here is a tip for the future Mr. Mann: don't assume that your audience knows about special ops, drug cartels, and being a narc. Either use layman terms or explain the jargon.Granted I was young when the Miami Vice t.v. show was on the air so maybe I'm not as clued in as I should be, but this movie sucked. It was Heat/Scarface/Bad Boys and every other drug/narc movie rolled into one with the extreme in money and high life. I couldn't take the movie seriously at all for as serious as it tried so hard to be. It was just too over the top. Here you have some Miami police officers taking down an international drug ring... give me a break. And I must mention the Asian woman that was a cold, calculated, business savvy person until she meets Sonny Crockett. Who could have guessed that one? Nope, never seen that one before.Besides the afore-mentioned, Colin Farrel and Jamie Foxx just didn't click on screen. They did not make a good tandem at all. Partnerships don't work when both characters are identical in their attitude and personality anyway. This was just a hyper-imaginative rendition of the drug world and the Narc world alike. Only IF one single city had such resources and cunningness to pull off stunts such as this movie, we would never see drugs.",Miami Vice
16,george.schmidt,"Not your father's Miami VICE, pal! Disappointing and zip chemistry between Farrell & Foxx",5,14 August 2006,"Miami VICE (2006) ** Colin Farrell, Jamie Foxx, Gong Li, Naomie Harris, Ciaran Hinds, Luis Tosar, John Ortiz, Ciaran Hinds, Barry Shabaka Henley, Luis Tosar, Elizabeth Rodriguez Justin Theroux, Domenick Lombardozzi, John Hawkes. Tom Towles. Disappointing and surprisingly dull adaptation of the cult classic '80s TV series with Crockett and Tubbs (Farrell and Foxx with zip chemistry; they are no Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, that's for sure!) embroiled in a sting with the FBI to drop the net on a dangerous drug kingpin and his homicidal cartel with the usual pyrotechiniques which admittedly are pretty violent and cool yet it is only the last third of this lengthy deluge that packs any heat or a decent wallop. Filmmaker Michael Mann  who co-created the original show with Anthony Yerkovich  employs his usual artistry and flair however continues to use the murky hi-def digital video that understandably is to the palette he chose to use for this version (no primary colors and pastels here, pal!) however it is a downer for a city known for its flash and sex appeal. Coming from a die-hard fan of the series I was shockingly upset at how unappealing the big- screen transition failed to connect.",Miami Vice
17,neil-476,So-so crime thriller,6,8 June 2009,"There is nothing wrong with this movie, but there's nothing special about it either. As a hard-as-nails crime thriller about a couple of undercover cops seeking to weed out an informant somewhere within the law enforcement network, it is sufficiently grimy and gritty (albeit I recall the leaking agency being identified, but never the precise source of the leak).But it never engages. Despite feeding us a fair dollop of our two protagonists' love life (and contriving to make us feel sympathetic towards the drug dealing, money laundering woman who Crocket falls for), we never really feel anything for this story on an emotional level.It's not clear why this is. The performances are all vigorous and committed, so maybe it is down to either lack of chemistry of poor writing/direction. Michael Mann's track record indicates that a misfire is unlikely, so perhaps it is simply down to the two leads. Certainly, a bald statement to the effect of ""I support you whatever you're up to"" isn't quite the same as seeing for yourself that these two men have absolute trust in each other. Maybe removing a wrinkle or two from a very wrinkled plot, and substituting a completed operation which showed the relationship between Crockett and Tubbs would have tweaked up the audience's investment in these two characters.Everything is dark and there are times when you're not sure who everyone is. Maybe that reflects what it's like to be in a real-life shoot-out, but I wanted to know whether that bloke over there reaching for his gun was one of theirs or one of ours.Nice to see a couple of Brits doing decent American supporting roles.",Miami Vice
18,evanston_dad,"A Joyless, Arduous Experience",4,31 July 2006,"With ""Miami Vice,"" on-again-off-again director Michael Mann gives us a grim, hateful movie, and large parts of it feel more like an endurance test than a summer entertainment.I don't care whether or not this movie accurately reimagines the original T.V. series for the screen -- I never saw the series and so have nothing to compare this film to except itself. Mann is a good enough director that no movie he directs will ever be bad without at least being interesting, and ""Vice"" is no exception to that rule. He does deserve credit for bringing a unique vision to a tired formula and for resisting the urge to spoon feed his audience summer blockbuster nonsense. ""Miami Vice"" may have many problems, but obviousness is not one of them.In fact, the film is frustratingly vague and opaque. We only know who the good guys are in this movie because they're played by actors we recognize. With a blast of techno music and a writhing female body silhouetted against pulsing neon, the movie just starts in the middle of a scene and is off and away before we know who anybody is or why we should care. This would be fine if we ever learned any more than we can glean from the film's opening few moments, but we don't. We root for Crockett and Tubbs, but only because the movie sticks with them and there's no one else to root for. The only attempt at giving them any backstory or character development comes through the women in their lives, but those parts of the movie feel obligatory, and you can feel Mann aching to get back to the good stuff (meaning the jittery, loud stuff) whenever the film settles into a quiet moment. The camera never stops moving, so everything rushes by in a blur of murky color and extreme close-ups (do we need to see every individual blade of stubble on Colin Farrell's face?) and Mann gives the audience no anchor around which to orient itself. I only know this movie takes place largely in Miami because otherwise the title would be meaningless.At the risk of sounding like a prude, the violence in this movie really bothered me -- or more accurately, the reaction of the audience to the violence in this movie really bothered me. The movie is so relentless and humorless, no one involved seems to be having a good time, and then -- BAM -- someone gets his insides blown out against a wall, we see blood splatter, and the audience cheers. The violent moments are the only thing Mann allows us to feel anything about. The only scene in the film that remotely approaches humor involves a nasty white supremacist getting shot in the head. Sound like a good time to you? ""Miami Vice""'s greatest offense is that it's pointless. Do we need another undercover cop story that does nothing new with the genre? Plots to these films are always formulaic, so if you're not going to distinguish your film through your characters, what's the point of making it? And, I don't know what critics are talking about when they say how great this film looks. The grainy, pixillated digital film may come out stellar on the DVD release, but it looks terrible on a mile-wide multiplex screen.Grade: C",Miami Vice
19,ferguson-6,Let's Take My Car/Boat/Plane,6,30 July 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. Fans of the TV series should temper their expectations. The similarities between the ultra-cool, flashy series and the gritty, grainy, simplistic film are mostly limited to the title, and the character names. It is not a bad film, it would just have to be considered a poor tribute to the series.Director Michael Mann usually either hits (""Heat"", ""Theif"", ""The Insider"" ""Manhunter"") or misses (""Collateral"", ""Last of the Mohicans""). This film is actually somewhere in between. The final shootout is pure fun for any action film fan and of course, these vice detectives have more toys than Batman. Also, the sound is very good (although my theatre had some issues) and no director does the close-up action shots better than Mann. The bad news is that the film is easily 30 minutes too long, the plot is overly simplistic and we don't get very many drug lord scenes. This film needed a more complex script and for goodness sakes, how about a little wit and humor? The series was known for Don Johnson's wise cracking and one liners as he put the bad guys in their place.Colin Farrell as Sonny Crockett throws down a very unusual look. For some reason he looks dirtier and more in need of a shower than he did living off the land in ""The New World"", although his hair is pretty similar. Jamie Foxx is given little to do as Tubbs other than scowl a lot and give Farrell quizzical looks. His best scene is in the trailer when he has the best 10 seconds of action ever recorded on film.Gong Li, who was so terrific and beautiful in ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", is a major disappointment here. The script leads us to believe this hardened drug world leader will just be swept off her feet by Farrell's undercover character and put her life and empire at risk, while showing none of the toughness that allowed her to succeed in crime. A more interesting story line would have had her dictating the terms of this relationship rather than melting in his arms.The overall supporting cast is pretty weak and easily forgettable, but for the most part, I blame the script. The oddest moment of the film occurs in a mobile home when, for some reason, Elizabeth Rodriguez is given one of the coolest scenes in the film while Farrell is left outside ""guarding the perimeter"". Must have been a rehab day.Although there are plenty of cool cars, boats, planes and guns, the action sequences are few and far between. The personal story lines seem very choppy and thrown in because some studio head demanded. The film is choppy, but does have a certain appeal.",Miami Vice
20,gradyharp,But the photography is good.......,4,9 December 2006,"Miami VICE, a film surrounded by rumors and preconceptions and a lot of money, is pretty much a bore - if story is important to you. Michael Mann is a talented director and knows how to move action sequences and capture vistas and light versus darkness, and he can be reliable in creating character interplay. Can be, but in Miami VICE there doesn't seem to be a script to follow...Some of the more exciting actors in the field today were employed to deliver this movie about drug deals, undercover agents, and lots of violence, but they are wooden and seem to be reading their few lines from a TV prompter. There is just no character development to speak of, no camaraderie between Rico and Sonny - factor that made the old TV show watchable. But the cast is sterling: Colin Farrell (who needs a good meaty role before his allure falters), the fine Jamie Foxx (terribly out of his element here), a miscast flat Gong Li (?why?), the excellent Naomie Harris (by far the strongest character in the film), Elizabeth Rodriquez, Justin Theroux, Ciarán Hinds (with an awful southern accent), and a set of new bad guys well chosen in Isaach De Bankolé, John Ortiz, and Luis Tosar. With talent like that you'd think the thing could fly on its own. But despite some really gorgeous photography there just isn't anyone or anything to maintain the viewer's interest for the interminable 214 minutes of run time. One is left with the question 'Wha happened?' Grady Harp",Miami Vice
21,zetes,Mediocre,6,15 January 2007,"Opinions have been all over the map on this film, some calling it a masterpiece, others one of the worst of 2006. I'm pretty much exactly in the middle: I just think it's distinctly mediocre. It's hardly terrible, but I can't for the life of me see anything special about it, either. I really appreciate the low-key style, and it's cool to watch. But then, it feels like that's all it is, cool for the sake of coolness, with a heck of a lot of sexy people posing but not doing anything interesting. The plot is pretty much cliché undercover stuff and the characters and the performances are universally beyond dull, with the one exception of Gong Li, who doesn't exactly deliver one of her better performances, but who is constantly engaging, for her beauty if not for anything else. Colin Farrell (a dead ringer for Billy Ray Cyrus) and Jamie Foxx made me long for Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, something that I never thought I'd hear myself say. I suppose the point is to show these two undercover cops beaten down by their difficult careers, but that doesn't make any sense. They're posing as professional drug smugglers and the like, they should have some sort of personality. Since the film is stretched out to 2 hours and 20 minutes, it feels especially dull. The only thing I'm especially thankful for with Miami Vice is it made me admire the skill of Martin Scorsese. I've complained about his tale of undercover cops (and criminals), The Departed, often enough lately, but that's only because I think people are overrating it. At least there, there were interesting characters in whom I actually had a vested interest. And it was a hell of a lot more fun, to boot. In The Departed, you can see how the undercover work is weighing on Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio. While Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx just stand there, posing sexily.",Miami Vice
22,mm-39,Miami Vice busted,5,8 August 2006,"Miami Vice busted! The bust of the summer! A huge disappointment! Miami Vice, the movie, just like the drug dealers who got caught on the TV show got busted, and this dog is a bust. The film makers dropped every plot outline which made the TV show successful. Miami Vice had no plot outline, just one continuous character development with the character connecting very little with the story. The two protagonists had very little material to work with. What did the Aryian brotherhood have to do with any of the story? How did the leak happen? What did the FBI or the Vice department do? Instead, the viewer sees a very anti-climatic shoot out, with a few gory spots, unless one is used to horror gore. The lack of story has an elongated, and boring sex scene, which tries to compensate as filler. The sex scenes do little for character development, there is no relationship between the characters. One would not even know that Tubes' girlfriend was a hostage at the end. Why would the brotherhood take her as a hostage? The producers miss the point if the viewer wants an elongated sex movie one would rent a more graphic porno. (ie sex whatever part 3) Miami Vice is not even a good rental. My wife thinks they just used the name to promote the movie, and regrettably I was sucked in with the marketing. 5 out of 10. Where did the city of Miami actually appear in the film?",Miami Vice
23,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Miami Vice,5,22 September 2006,"Again we got the short end of the stick, having the movie released under NC-16 with snips, when an M-18 rating would have left the movie intact. And what was cut to satisfy the lower rating, were the sex scenes, as if to say we're all OK with the violence, but too prissy to make love.Written and directed by Michael Mann, who served as one of the executive producers of the original 80s television series starring Don Johnson as Sonny Crockett and Philip Michael Thomas as Rico Tubbs, this is one of the rare recent Hollywood remakes that had someone from the series helm the project. However, the movie version is a mixed bag, and it's not hard to understand why.Mann has built a reputation for solid, intense movies like Heat, The Insider and Collateral, and is deftly able to balance quiet moments with loud action. Miami Vice turned out to be flitting from one end of the spectrum to the other, with the quiet moments being absolutely horrendous, only to be saved by the roar of noisy toys, ranging from the Ferrari F430 Spider on land, the Adam Aircraft A500 in the air (flown only by Foxx cos he got experience from Stealth), and the Donzi speedboats on water, peppered with the authentic symphony of various weapons like the Heckler & Koch G36C and the Benelli M4 Super 90 12-gauge semiautomatic shotgun (this one is a beauty I tell you).While I like to think of it as a sophisticated cops and robbers movie, at times its execution is less than slick, and the storyline just pretty ordinary. It didn't help with its plot loopholes, or credibility issues with its police operations looking very much like what you can find in many Hong Kong movies of the same genre - the calvary only arrives after the heroes have taken out the baddies. The finale was climatic, but it suffered from the usual calvary problem, much akin to the monologues of villains when they have the heroes at their gunsights. What irked me more was perhaps key team members taking five, and unaccounted for during gun battles. It just didn't make much sense.In fact, the entire story arguably didn't make much sense, especially with the villains being so well informed and having access to intel, nor having the story compelling enough to engage the audience the full 135 minutes. Having trust issues is a given for any crime lord, but it probably means one thing - go do the job yourselves and build their own distribution channels. The cat and mouse here really went around and around, and capitalizing on an Asian-Cuban in Isabella (Gong Li) having a thing for white meat, is already a dangerous strategic play.The romance bit between Isabella and Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) is totally unbelievable (yeah right, cos they making moves on each other, y'all), and really slowed down the entire movie. Speaking in bad English just made matters worse for Gong Li (you can't fault her for effort) too, and having them exhibiting their touchy-feely luurve in the den of the lion, is stupid.Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx (as partner Rico Tubbs) lacked the chemistry two undercover buddy partners should possess. Most times they seem like two individuals outdoing each other, though there are moments where one gives up the limelight to the other. The trust between their characters is rarely shown, and amongst themselves, they seem to be challenging each other to outgrowl one liners in gruff tones while oozing machismo behind shades. They got attitude, but they got no soul. Despite being primarily a two-man team, they do have a backup squad straight out of Mission:Impossible, who steals some thunder during times of action.What worked with excellence, is the cool gritty cinematography from the HD cameras, giving this Miami Vice the look of danger and urgency from its jerky motions. Its action is no frills, most of the time being over before you get to see much, and everyone's plain trigger happy, which works - show no mercy, one shot one kill, go for the head style. Gun battles are few and far between, but nonetheless vividly realistic and the complete opposite to the poetic styles of John Woo (fast vs slow motion, matter-of-fact vs deliberate style).Like many scenes in the movie where the weather always threatened to rain with its incessant thunder and lightning over the horizon, the movie had a roaring potential in delivering what the television series could not in terms of spectacle and the ability to punctuate the series' spirit. However, it turned out only to be a slight drizzle, and ended up just Miami without much Vice.P.S. for our print at Grand Cathay, what's up with telling us that the print is copyrighted and certified for exhibition? Is it a UK thing? And no, we can't be bothered with taping the movie from hand-held cameras.",Miami Vice
24,Mr-Fusion,"Mann, what happened?",4,30 December 2011,"This isn't the '80s TV series, at least that was according to the narrative when ""Miami Vice"" came out; no pastels, no Jan Hammer or Don Johnson. But this movie is just the ""Smuggler's Blues"" episode on the big screen, right down to specific plot points. It even recycles some of the lines from the actual show, just distributed among different characters. So . . . it is the show, just without any of the charm. But what's really disappointing is that the movie is just so dull. We've got two lead actors with no chemistry, the rest of the vice unit has no defining traits, and there's just no movement to this thing. Plenty of time spent on dialogue, and not enough on the action (this is a cop movie, dammit). And when the action actually does happen, it's in awkwardly staged shootouts, with no sense of geography; suspension and dramatic tension traded for loud bursts of gunfire in various directions. I never thought I'd walk into a Mann film and see shootouts this awful. And they wouldn't be so bad if we at least had characters to care about or an involving story.This was brutally disappointing.4/10",Miami Vice
25,Smells_Like_Cheese,I can name 5 good movies that could have been made with this budget,3,7 December 2006,"Despite some bad reviews of Miami Vice that I heard from my friends, I decided to check it out anyways, I mean, everyone has different tastes and I didn't know if I would like it or not. I was really young, in fact, a new born, when the series hit it's peak of popularity. But my mom and dad would watch it every once in a while and I remember some reruns when I was a kid and I loved how much of a bright and cool series Miami Vice was. And let's face it, Miami Vice is nothing without shoulder pads, bright colors, cheesy lines, and Don Johnson! I'll explain in a moment why I didn't enjoy Miami Vice and why people should probably stay away from it.Sonny and Ricco, in an updated version(sad, isn't it?) of Miami Vice, with cool cars, cell phones, and sleazy clothing that made Collin Ferrel look like a sleazy child molester, we get involved in their personal lives and now they have to go undercover for a sleazy drug lord, but they get deeper than they thought, especially when Sonny falls for one of the women that they are doing business with. But of course, you can figure out from what I just described where the story is pretty much going.Miami Vice the show was a bright, funny, and witty TV series that everyone loved because of how cheesy it was and how it didn't take itself so seriously, but Miami Vice the movie took the story and made it dark and just wasn't needed. Like I said in the title, there are so many movies out there that deserve a better budget, and this movie somehow because some big name stars are in it, just get bigger salaries. Miami Vice is very confusing and not worth your time, just stick to the fun TV Series, it's nothing with the shoulder pads! 3/10",Miami Vice
26,OllieSuave-007,Painful-Two Hours Twenty Min Wasted!,1,15 December 2006,"This film dragged and was a painful 2 1/2 hours of to sit through. Based on the 1984 TV show, this movie lacks action, humor, emotion, plot and character development.It seemed like that all the actors whispered their lines during the entire movie - you could hardly make out what the cast was saying. As a result, it is difficult to follow the story. Jaime Fox's lack of emotion in how he reacted to his girlfriend's bomb incident just showed how mediocre this film was. The movie jumps from one short scene to the other, making it hard to follow the course of events. If you like ""Miami Vice,"" stick with the show re-runs.

27,Robert_duder,Absolute utter garbage...I can't even to begin to imagine how much trash this is!!,1,31 July 2006,"I adamantly begin by saying that this is probably the worst film I have seen this year...possibly ever. Miami Vice is the definition of the most boring, stupid, poorly written, horribly acted Hollywood crap I have ever seen. I can't even believe that this film knocked Pirates of The Caribbean 2 from it's top spot because to say it doesn't deserve it is the understatement of the century. Miami Vice is absolutely NOTHING like it's original TV Series which supposedly this is a remake of. Director Michael Mann of course had a hand in creation of the original series and yet does nothing to try and capture that original 80's feel. First and foremost Miami Vice does not belong in modern day, it completely embodies the eighties with it's flashy style and neon colors and 2006's Miami Vice is nothing like that at all. Gritty I will give it...in fact Mann's occasional real life/reality show type filming gives it a bit of an edge but it doesn't save this utter disaster. Dark?? Sure but who cares, should it be dark? Not with the title Miami Vice. Violent? Not really...BORING is more like it. Sure a couple people get shot and there is a kidnapping/beating but it's not grotesque or shocking and if you're still awake to watch it, it doesn't change much.Colin Farrell takes the lead as Detective Sonny Crockett. I think I liked Farrell at one point in his career but his conceited, and sarcastically dripping performances are just too much. He only adds a boat load of crap to an already steaming pile of dung. He's a tough guy sure but the supposed romance with leading lady and bad gal Li Gong is useless and the most un-charismatic matching I've ever seen. On top of that the absolutely necessary chemistry between Crockett and his partner Tubbs 100% does not exist. They are completely inadequate together. Oscar Winner Jamie Foxx, who I do believe is an incredible actor completely wastes his talent in this film as Ricardo Tubbs. I don't know what his role is but it doesn't matter because no one is acting...it's just garbage. As mentioned Li Gong plays a mediator between Crocket and Tubbs and the head of a drug smuggling operation they are trying to infiltrate. She is okay but nobody's performance matters in this heap. Luis Tosar, and John Ortiz play the lead bad guys and they also do a decent job and probably could have been decent villains had the entire story and film not blow completely. Ortiz was a decent looking villain but for the most part the writers made him whiny and annoying.If I didn't KNOW that Michael Mann had talent I would say he should be banned from writing another script for the rest of his life. This was without a doubt the least sensible film I have ever seen. I had NO idea what was going on, or didn't care and when the film ended I literally laughed out loud because I had just sat through 2 hours of something that made utterly no sense at all. There is no resolution and save for a single gun battle at the end which was pretty gory there was no action in this film and they spent more time in Columbia than Miami and when they are in Miami you'd never know it because it is ALWAYS night outside. This film should be called...Dark Muddle...then maybe I'd score it a 2 or 3 out of 10 because hey that is what it is but when you slap Miami Vice on it and then come out swingin with this garbage...I don't believe anyone who tells me they actually enjoyed this, or understood it. Steer clear of this one and let Pirates back on top...this is the worst garbage of the year. ZERO/10",Miami Vice
28,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Superficially very fine but very hollow on a more meaningful level,5,2 September 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh In this modern, re-vamped film adaptation of the hit 1980s TV series, Detectives Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) and Crockett (Colin Farrell) are forced to go undercover when a glitch in the system leads to an informant and his family being killed. They infiltrate the drug lords and try to gather as much information as they can to bring them down- but along the way, personal relations and tested loyalties threaten to jeopardize everything they're working on.Not quite before my time but first around when I was very young, the original TV show of Miami Vice was apparently renowned for it's daft story lines and ropey acting. Nevertheless it still gained a huge cult following that kept it widely remembered years after the last series was shown and lead to this flashy but empty adaptation being made. Aiming to put a totally different slant on the original show's light-hearted tone, the film instead projects a grainy, grittier image that sticks with it to the end.I'll have to get used to Michael Mann and his 'high-definition' style of filming, which shouldn't be too difficult. The film has a very slick and stylish presentation, with a cool use of soundtrack that gives it that accomplished music video look through-out. But it's all very hollow. On a more artistic level, the film is sorely lacking. The plot drags on and on. I didn't quite fall asleep but I started to doze and lose concentration during the middle part. And although he has strong co-star appeal with Jamie Foxx, Farrell delivers one of his worst performances ever, showing strained emotion and you can hear his American accent drifting back into Irish at some points.Superficially, then, the film's very enjoyable. But on a more meaningful level, it leaves a fair bit to be desired. **",Miami Vice
29,MLDinTN,Seemed like an extended music video,4,12 July 2007,"This movie reminded me of a music video, it had cool actors, cool clothes, cars, explosions, loud music, and hot girls. Only problem was this was supposed to be a big budget action film directed by a good director. The script was not good; too many scenes of the actors staring out into the ocean. This made the movie too long at over 2 hours.Also, Colin Farrell still sounded like he's from Ireland. He didn't pull off a very good English accent. But he does look good.As for the plot, I still don't understand it. I get the two cops went undercover to smuggle drugs into Miami. And Sonny hooked up with Isabelle who was involved with the drugs, but didn't see her as all that bad. They talked with some other bad guys, but I never learned their names nor cared. The script just wasn't well written.FINAL VERDICT: The TV show has to be better because it couldn't be worse. I'd skip this one.",Miami Vice
30,lesleyharris30,"I've Come to Expect more from Everyone Involved,",5,4 October 2015,"Miami Vice is a very mediocre movie with a poorly developed storyline and a talented cast that sadly couldn't save this. The storyline believes that it is complicated, exciting and original, but it is really nothing different from any other crime film, it fails to differentiate itself and that is probably the weakest aspect of this movie, based on a very successful television series. The cast is definitely the best part, everyone tries their very hardest, Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are both great in it and you can see from the trivia that they went very method for their performances, it's just a shame that these two great actors couldn't have been paired for a better film. It also tends to jump away from its story far too often, there are several scenes that provide no input or character development of any kind, this is fine for comedies, but for drama, particularly crime drama, you would want every scene to be important and to keep the plot moving. Miami Vice is beautifully filmed and well acted, but it sadly isn't enough to save the poor story and mediocre character development, and because of this I couldn't recommend it. Two detectives team up to take on a drugs ring, but one of them finds himself increasingly conflicted. Best Performance: Colin Farrell Worst Performance: Eddie Marsan",Miami Vice

With a scene shot reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan cinematography towards the end, Michael Mann's striking photography and raw footage comes across cleanly along with a crisp soundtrack that rattles and shakes the emotions. Instead of action and gore, this thoughtful crime thriller takes the easy, fun loving television series and turns it into a mystery and serious look at undercover work and the high stakes of drug trafficking. Unlike, Traffic (2000), Michael Mann uses some of the same photographic technique from one of his best movies Manhunter (1986). There are some of the most fascinating cloud shots recorded in a movie, particularly action movie. Likely the greatest weakness in the movie is the convenient ending, typical of American movies. Some of the plot seems too convoluted and a few of the subplots are left hanging. Overall, though, this movie is a nice piece of work that avoids over graphic sex and violence to tell a much more serious, hard hitting crime story. Eight out of Ten Stars.",Miami Vice

The theme of identity and how yours is influenced by (and influences) the people around you is here, and it was also very evident in Manns last two movies, especially Ali. So with the theme there, it's surprising the movie lacks identity, it's almost like it doesn't know what it wants to be, or even what decade it's set in.It's overly complicated, If feels much longer than actually is. At one point I was a bit bored, and was amazed to see it had only been running for 49 minutes. For the first time watching a Mann movie, I wasn't blown away with the performances. Even The Keep had some interesting performances. That said it does have some impressive action set pieces, and it does try, but it just doesn't come together.

33,Floated2,Slow moving and slightly uninteresting,3,26 June 2017,"Miami Vice (2006) starring Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx, portraying their roles of the popular 1980's television series. Farrell takes over playing the role of undercover cop Sonny Crockett, who works with his partner Ricardo Tubbs to dissolve into a South American drug smuggling operation. Well put into the film, and together both characters risk their lives to discover how some blew the cover on a crucial FBI operation. But as they venture deeper and deeper into a jungle of evil, posing as professional smugglers, they run the risk of losing their moral compasses along the way. After a tense meeting with a nervous drug dealer named Jose Yero (John Ortiz), they're taken all the way to an encounter with the cartel's Colombian prince of darkness. The chemistry between Farrell and Foxx isn't as great as it could have been, or perhaps that is how it was meant to be portrayed, as it did not come off as natural and at times forced.Within the film Miami Vice starts off relatively slow but becomes a better film and more entertaining as the films goes on, though with a predictable and typical ending we have seen before. Nothing much stands out in this film as it isn't as stylish or over the top with action as advertised. More so a slow paced drama than an exciting and thrilling action thriller. Containing some confusing and overlong scenes adding noting much. With a very large and unnecessary budget of $135 million with only making $163 million worldwide, we are wondered why this film needed a budget of this large, causing a massive flop, and receiving more negative and disappointing reviews.",Miami Vice
34,johnnyboyz,Vomit inducingly bad; and that's just the dialogue and acting.,3,31 January 2007,"This latest addition to the Hollywood adaptation/remake/cash in sequel craze is probably the defining reason not to even venture down these filmic routes in the first place; this reason is 'Miami Vice'.This really does have to be one of the worst films ever made. This is coming from someone who has seen numerous films of different eras and from different countries; I even study film at degree level at time of writing and I can quite honestly say this has made it into my personal worst list.The film is fast, flash, in your face, doesn't make any sense what-so-ever and is utterly pointless. The accents are as annoying as they are inaudible as the far easterly Asian accent is mixed up with the Hispanic and traditional American accent on numerous occasions; making it impossible to figure out what's going on. Funny, with so many Americans complaining about not being able to understand the English accent in our films, well: right back at you with this one. The story in the opening hour and a bit is ridiculously jumbled, I had no idea what was going on with all it's mumbling accents, fast edits and vomit inducing camera work. It was so bad I came close to switching it off but just as I was about to, a kidnap plot opened up and there was a good shootout with a bit of a race against time but that was far from saving the film.Amongst everything I've said, 75% of the film consisted of two faceless protagonists strutting around acting 'hard' in an orgy of testosterone with laptops and technology doing most of the thinking and working out in a typical detective story involving drugs in a supposed utopia. There isn't a scene that lasts longer than a couple of seconds and the relationship/level of trust two characters manage to build up happens in equally unbelievable time. What started as a drink ends up as full blown trust between two people on opposite sides of an edgy drug deal. This was a pathetic and extremely weak, not to mention the worst character relations attempt I've ever seen in a film, excuse to throw in some sex scenes and have some characters love one another. Shocking.Not only was this bad but the characters and atmosphere as a whole was poor. Not once did I feel excited, not once did I need to use my brain to try and work something out, and not once did I feel like there was some sort of 'feeling' to this film. There is no atmosphere, no suspense and no empathy necessary towards the characters.Miami Vice is certainly one of the worst films I've seen in recent times; in fact, in a long time. Instead of feeling good after the viewing, I felt angry at what I'd just witnessed. Instead of being sad that it ended, I was relieved and instead of being gripped and pulled into the story, I was boerd and disappointed. It may be Michael Mann; but it's not the Michael Mann you know.",Miami Vice
35,Chris Knipp,"Property values high, entertainment value low",6,1 August 2006,"Everybody likes cops and robbers stories. They're more fun when cops go undercover and pretend to be bad guys because bad is, let's face it, just cooler than good. Undercover, things become more teasing, subtler: more rich and complicated. We go over to the dark side, moral issues become more troubling and personal. We may not want to come back; the cops themselves, believably, may not want to. The line is never really clear anyway, as bad-cop movies like Antoine Fuqua's ""Training Day"" or Joe Carnahan's ""Narc"" illustrate. Michael Mann's new movie version of the influential Eighties salt-and-pepper cop team TV series he once produced goes deep into darkness -- but it's never quite the right kind. Mann's version is much more serious than the series, which, though it went to daring new places (for TV, that is) in its subjects, still had a casual, bright side, as symbolized by Crockett's white linen suits and white loafers and pink T-shirts. Unfortunately the movie ""Miami Vice"" is as murky and confusing as it is dark and solemn. And despite visual beauty, it lacks most of the touches that make a crime story good, like interesting characters, intense relationships, and surprising plot twists.Where the Eighties ""Miami Vice"" pair of of Don Johnson as Sonny Crockett and Philip Michael Thomas as Ricardo Tubbs was casual and sporty, Colin Farrell as Crockett and Jamie Foxx as Tubbs are tough and scruffy, all work and no play, more intense, and, on Farrell's part, clearly less at ease. Farrell drops his Irish accent for a slightly indeterminate American one, and everything about him seems uncertain. He's never really fun to watch. Sadly, Foxx, who was so good in ""Ray"" and Mann's ""Collateral,"" though impressive to look at and fluent in spewing the techno-jargon this physically elaborate film revels in, isn't much fun to watch either. Though the story isn't any deeper than something on TV, the movie runs for two hours and twenty-six minutes and cost $125 million. That's a lot of wasted time and wasted money.Though the gross outlines of plot are all too clear, the preponderance of authentically foreign-sounding Latino drug dealers and a Chinese dragon-lady moll (Gong Li) make for a lot of half-comprehensible sentences -- and dialogue that loses its rhythm -- and the minute-to-minute action is frequently foggy. The buddy aspect and any sense of human connectedness it might bring is the first casualty in a story littered with corpses. This Tubbs and Crockett never develop any discernible chemistry. They never get to play together (as in have fun, spend down time), or to play off each other. They go straight to work and aren't even together that much -- despite the fact that the strongest line in the piece, because it's delivered so well, is Tubbs' ""I will never doubt you."" Unfortunately, Farrell as Crockett projects non-stop doubt.The camera obtrusively wanders off with the two men on separate love-fests. Tubbs gets his first in a blaxploitation-style bed-and-shower session with his squeeze Trudy (Naomi Harris) a female co-worker, as if to provide equal time, since Crockett's fling with Isabella (Ms. Gong) becomes a big deal, and the only real complication in the plot. Both sex sequences are so heavy-handedly, self-consciously sensuous they make you squirm.As you'd expect in a film of epic cost, the cop caper has elaborate flourishes, long delays. Our boys are to impersonate drug dealers to replace a blown FBI operation's crew. Why this would work even for a while with drug lords so grand their underling has a crack intelligence-gathering team I never understood. All the drug shipments are epic in size too, involving billions, or at least many millions wholesale. Crockett and Tubbs begin by intercepting a big shipment locally so they can pretend to find it later and give it back free to show their good faith. When they meet the drug kingpin, an oily, bespectacled chap who gives them a very hard time, he turns out to be only the gatekeeper for the big boy. We should have guessed: why, the little guy's condo only cost $4 million. Wait -- whose condo was that?Bad guy number one is a bearded, taller, slightly comatose codger in a nice car, with Gong Li by his side. She and Farrell exchange significant looks. When No. 1 utters the usual clichés (""You'll never see me again after this,"" ""You'll become rich beyond your wildest dreams,"" etc.), the camera pointedly shows us his and Gong Li's diamond-studded watches.Is this all global drug deals -- and a $125 million budget -- get you, a leather-lined limo and $30,000 watches? No, of course not, if little guy's got a $4 million condo. There's more -- a big long castle on a mountain surrounded by spectacular waterfalls -- Xanadu, seen several times from the air (I assumed digitalized -- CGI has crimped the ""wow"" factor of such shots).Gong Li is another casualty of this lovely disaster. She has been exquisite in films by Chen Kaige and Wong Kar Wai. She still has presence here, but she looks plain, flattened, cheapened. Her English voice, and her enunciation, leave much to be desired.Despite heavy breathing in sex scenes and during edgy shootouts (oddly similar-sounding, but each accompanied by appropriate music) there isn't much real tension, other than the moments leading up to the Western-style shootout at the end. Using DV with special processing gorgeously again, Mann is a painter with excessive tinted color, big skies, dazzling urban darkness, ""throbbing nightclub set pieces."" But he could have done so much better. He just did, in ""Collateral,"" where image and scenes were clear and the tension between self-deluding cabbie Foxx and slick sociopath hit man Cruise was subtle and interesting, and actually developed as we went along. This Miami binge was too elaborate a project, and every additional ten million spent was another step away from artistic clarity.",Miami Vice
36,elshikh4,The Vice of Miami Vice !,2,24 July 2007,"At first, I couldn't get it. Was it a matter concerning a director who became crazy about himself, thinking that anything done by him, even if lousy, should be a complete genius? Or was it the business of Hollywood, which makes that kind of usual commercial movies, and this round the mission was done by a known as ""distinct"" director, making only what he was commissioned with; for the money, or for the fun of it?!Let me be well-meaning, and say that director Michael Mann wanted to make a commercial movie, however with a sense of realism. And that would be done by his very own style, which usually consists of slow pace, true violence, matchless soundtrack, with no overacting, flashy explosions, or crazy CGI. In brief, Mann wanted to be the Man to present the same goods in another framing. However, did he succeed, in any of that??As the movie's writer, he picked a learned by heart story: Boy meets gang undercover. Boy loves girl of the gang. Boy must destroy the gang, so his love. Boy does the right thing, and loses something; his love, or his job. Yes, we've watched that hundreds of times, and Mr. Mann picked all of it without adding even a bit more!Well, it doesn't end there. Because Mann's style produced eventually such a painful experience. I attended in a theater, and I remember how the audience was shocked, real angry, and very regretful. Simply, they went to have fun, though found Mann making a ""Novo"" thriller cinema, with no fun of any kind!For instance, in his 1995 movie (Heat), Mann picked a story which was also based on TV show, also just the very same cat & mouse chase, nevertheless done quite a movie out of it, with studying and detailing all the characters, events, and backgrounds, having the experience of 2 acting icons in a captivating thriller / drama. But the vice of (Miami Vice - 2006) was that he concerned only about the STYLE.There is no new designing, it's only the framing. No depth, just surface. The movie is loaded with style that led to ruthless bore and huge emptiness; if not ruthless and huge pedantry as well. Look at Li Gong. She's a great actress who we didn't see any of her greatness here. Because there wasn't much of a role. Rather, there wasn't much of a movie to entertain, or anything to contemplate in the first place. So this time, even the makers of the good old WHAM BAM SLAM action flicks--did their jobs better than you Mr. Mann!Not to mention that Mann did it in the wrong place too. (Miami Vice 1984: 1990) was a hit show, which had countless fans all over the world, who expected another movie based on a lovable show, such as (Mission Impossible), or (Charlie's angels), or anything of what we used to have in the 2000s as nice entertainment, or nice trash. Or maybe something better than this or that. But what Mann truly made was a big, BIG, disappointment!So what was the final result? I'll tell you: A repeated story that was too dull to follow, and too predictable to watch. Some sickening violence. Tons of bore. And the disgustingly compulsory, abjectly commercial sex and nudity! For once, ask yourself: Why there has to be sex and nudity in every movie? And why every actor and actress accept to bare themselves without objecting?! Anyway, this is very repugnant, intolerable, and ridiculous movie; whether you look at it as an action flick, or as a film about an impossible love story. It seems like a body without a soul, not too much ado about too much nothing, and not a bright photo; it's just a photo!All in all, if you want to watch some nice cinematography, and some of Colin Farrell, Jamie Foxx, and Li Gong being on screen, then watch (Miami Vice - 2006). However, if you're a fan of the original show, or not, thinks that Michael Mann is great, or not, believes that he did it for art, or not--I'm sure that you'll going to hate this movie along with Michael Mann too!",Miami Vice

These characters in this movie were very one dimensional. And the way it was filmed, it looked more like a documentary then a movie. And the plot was hard to get into, it kept dragging itself out, to the point were I just fell asleep through the middle part of it. I liked the other Michael Mann film Collateral at least the characters were more interesting, and that plot was not dragged out.

It improves nothing but the special effects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles the fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it.Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original.",Miami Vice
39,MaxBorg89,Mann's men are back in town!,9,14 August 2006,"Over the years, Miami has been the set of many television hits, most recently Nip/Tuck and of course CSI:Miami. The most popular show remains Miami Vice, which started breaking the barriers between big and small screen. Now, thanks to writer/director Michael Mann (who produced the series back in the '80s), Miami Vice receives the Hollywood treatment. However, that doesn't mean the movie is a ridiculous remake (Charlie's Angels) or a funny, if inspired, homage (Starsky & Hutch). This is a dark, strong, ferociously adult blockbuster, which doesn't flinch for a second from letting us know it's some ugly territory we're visiting.In terms of style, Mann nails it from the beginning, with a beautiful opening sequence set in a disco (fans of Collateral will be happy). It is here that we first meet the film's protagonists, ""Sonny"" Crockett (Colin Farrell) and ""Rico"" Tubbs, who are supposed to lead a minor drug-bust operation. That is, until they receive a phone call from an informer (Deadwood's John Hawkes), who tells them he messed up, then kills himself. At this point, the FBI (represented by Ciaran Hinds' strict, unpleasant handler) decide to hire the two police officers to infiltrate a powerful organization that uses Miami as a transition point to bring in drugs from South America.Saying exactly who does what inside the organization is a waste of time for two reasons: a) roles can change depending on the circumstances; b) it doesn't really matter. The important thing is our heroes' assignment gets increasingly more complex and dangerous, as Tubbs realizes his girlfriend might get killed and Crockett decides to spice things up a little by seducing the bad guy's mistress, Isabella (Gong Li, in her most convincing English-speaking part). Business as usual, then? Don't think so.Looking back on Mann's CV, Miami Vice can be considered a perfect companion piece to Heat and Collateral, having inherited the latter's looks and the former's pacing (the really seminal events occur only in the last part of the movie). What it also has picked from both, and dramatically increased, is an everlasting ambiguity. One of the reasons Crockett and Tubbs infiltrate the drug world is the presence of a mole, hence the inevitable question: who is trustworthy?Furthermore, the two protagonists' behavior is an example of ambivalence at its best: Tubbs and Crockett know the law, yet they're not unwilling to break it if such a thing is required. Crockett, in particular, played by a sublime Farrell (it's his best performance since Phone Booth), is a rebel who irreversibly crosses the line with Isabella: he knows it's wrong, and so does she (and that's probably not the only thing she knows), but there they are, regardless of the consequences. It's a relationship that perfectly symbolizes the duplicitous nature of the world we live in, and in this specific case the city where the events unfold.Because of the conspicuous ambiguity, Miami Vice doesn't have a proper ending. In fact, it almost feels as if we're watching the first episode of a new season of the TV show. Now, given the director, the chances of a sequel being made are extremely thin. But what we have seen for two hours remains pure Mann: artful, exciting and undeniably gripping. And that's exactly what we asked for.",Miami Vice
40,Fluke_Skywalker,'Vice' in name only,5,10 September 2013,"The original series is my favorite show of all-time, but I was so profoundly disappointed with Michael Mann's film adaptation that I blocked it out and swore never to watch it again. I broke my oath this morning. Look, I know it's not the 80s any more, so I'm not going to complain about its lack of neon colored suits and Jan Hammer music. It doesn't have to be true to the series that inspired it to be a good movie in its own right. But it does have to have a compelling plot (which it lacks) and chemistry between its leads (which it definitely lacks). The action is dull, the characters are flat and lack personality and the story is utterly generic. Mann is a very good filmmaker, and this should've been right in his wheelhouse.

42,dwpollar,"Emotionally bland, but technically well-made re-imagining...",4,28 October 2011,"1st watched 10/25/2011 – 4 out of 10(Dir-Michael Mann): Emotionally bland, but technically well-made re-imagining of the Miami Vice television series written and directed by Michael Mann. Taking over the lead roles for the big screen are Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell doing basically one big major drug bust that takes them to South America and back. And, of course, the two hunky leads have their set of lady friends and are meshed in with the story, occasionally. The problem with this movie is similar to a lot of action movies where the filmmakers don't take the time to help the viewers get attached to the characters. The movie starts quickly into the story, expecting us to understand the setting, the TV show, the characters, and the drug-trafficking scene with all it's special lingo and scenarios. Even if you watched the show(which I didn't) you will probably be confused a little bit (unless you happen to be a drug dealer). They decide to go undercover and out of the country to bust a big time world-wide dealer and in the meantime, Sonny Crocker finds time to hook up with an Asian leader of the organization, played by Gong Li. The camera-work and the music are definitely top rate, but the story just kind of leaves you flat. Too bad, because Mann is a good Director, and the leads aren't bad – although Farrell is better than Foxx as far as an actor – and the rest of the cast is OK. I guess what I was looking for was more than just one huge action movie but a little more storytelling to reel me in and this one didn't do it.",Miami Vice
43,TdSmth5,very good,9,3 August 2006,"The moment this movie starts, it throws you into the world of crime. There are no opening credits or even titles. There are no set-up pieces that introduce the characters and tell you what they are up to and what they want, or that display some cheesy cardboard personality. There's no time for the audience to get to know the people or get used to what's going on. The first thing that stands out is that the movie doesn't look good. MV looks dirty, dark, as if someone had left a filter in front of the projector. It's not crisp, clean, bright, or colorful. An unfortunate and bizarre choice considering that the action takes place in Miami, Havana, Haiti. The second thing is the poor sound is. At least for the dialogue. You can barely hear what people say and if you can hear it, you can't understand it. You'll notice that no explanations are given, the character speak the way they would in real life. So there's some realism. The characters are not talking to the audience, clearly articulating what they say, or explaining what they mean. This achieves the effect that the audience feels like a witness, as if you were riding along with these guys for a couple of days who are part of a different world than yours. You are standing next to them, they are talking to each other, not to you, they don't make an effort to be clear. The negative side of this is that it reminds one of those Euro-American B action movies made for the global market with foreign stars that you can't understand even though the script is in English. The story is not complicated at all, like some ""professional"" reviewers claim. Sonny and Tubbs are to infiltrate the drug world posing as entrepreneurs who can transport large amount of drugs into the US. We see plenty of signature Mann shots: helicopter flying at night around skyscrapers, houses with great ocean-views, first-person shooter perspective, a guy taking a shower, reflections on car windows, etc. Even though the movie is more than two hours, you really don't notice because you the story takes place all over the world and there aren't long predictable conversations. it keeps you guessing who, where, and what will happen. My complaints with this movie are: the ugly look, the overly poor sound at times, and the long sex scenes. While it's good to see sex scenes again, we haven't seen those in a very long time, these are overdrawn. The characters's faces are meant to convey what they think/feel/are going through, which they aren't putting in words, but the scenes could have been shorter. I'm not crazy about the casting here. Mann seems to like Shabaka Henley for some reason. Li Gong could have been replaced by any other Chinese actress, there must be some who can speak better English and look better. Mann has a great aesthetic sense but he doesn't have a good taste in women. He rarely casts attractive females. Foxx and Farrell do a good job. Some complain about the lack of chemistry between these two. This is due to the realism of this film. These characters have worked with each other for a while, they have seen each other at their best and worst, and they are somewhat tired of the world. This is just their job. The script doesn't call for them to be funny and cute with each other, this isn't a buddy flick. Audiences will also miss someone to relate to as well as some clear-cut good vs evil plot. This is part of the movie's realism and Mann's objectivity, the characters are they way there are, just like people, they aren't working to be liked. You witness their actions, which are morally ambiguous at times and you either like them or not, so be it. There are no long moralizing speeches about the evil of drugs, or the police chief rallying the officers to fight the evil guys.What I did like was the beautiful shots of scenery, cars, boats, etc. I like the realism, the fact that this is man's movie, not a gay or girlpower movie, you won't see the 90 pound 18 year old chick punching 300 pound guys to death. The action is great and surprisingly, Mann succeeds at creating video-game like violence. There are some interesting hand-held camera shots with the camera right next to a machine gun, and kill scenes that look just like video game deaths, but without being cartoonish. The story is somewhat convoluted, but I imagine that that's how drug trafficking is. The main bad guy with the ridiculous name Archangel of Jesus Montoya, played very well by Luis Tosar, is truly a menacing guy, although somewhat underused, while some other lesser bad guy is a little overused. There's a lot of guys with beards here for some reason. Another scary bad guy is the main neo-nazi. That's right, the story includes for no good reason at all the Aryan Brotherhood. You know those guys are way into the drug business in South Florida, don't you? It's a shame, and frankly ridiculous and racist, that because of political correctness, writers feel like the only bad guys in movies have to be white and neo-Nazis. Overall, this movie is an effective action thriller that builds quite a bit of tension and has a great shootout scene. Not nearly as spectacular as the one in Heat, but very brutal. I highly recommend this movie. Mann is a unique artist and unfortunately, few people make movies like him: no nonsense, straightforward, mature, non-melodramatic, somewhat realistic action thrillers for guys. In a time when movies are manipulative, cynical, mindless money-making tools made by the dozen to appeal to teenagers and meant to instill self-esteem in girls. If Hollywood is wondering why box office results are decreasing, here's the reason: you aren't making enough movies like Miami Vice, by men and for men.",Miami Vice
44,aharmas,What's this romance doing in the middle of an almost great film?,5,31 July 2006,"Will someone please tell Michael Mann to leave digital cinematography alone for a while and go back to regular film? The cinematographer has framed what could have been some breathtaking shots, and this muddy media makes everything look amateurish and too dark. The colors are muted, too bluish, and our attention is distracted by an exercise in style, even the content seems to be there. In addition to the aesthetics, the film is seriously handicapped by a side story regarding a romance that is as tepid as they come, and somehow it explains where some of the bloated budget for this film has gone.In the beginning there's much emphasis on the fact that style might be the overpowering force in the film as our two heroes stand around nightclubs in a city that seems to be corrupted by vice. Soon enough, they are recruited to get to the heart of an ever growing drug racket. The drama, action, and tension are fine until this moment. Before we know, we have a couple of sexy scenes, and the confusion begins. Soon Sonny meets a ravishing Asian beauty who is supposedly multilingual but speaks both English and Spanish with considerable difficulty... This, pretty much like ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is enough to make a saint lose concentration, as we struggle to understand how anyone of Sonny's caliber is captivated by such a person. So, we get treated to a quick trip to The Dominican Republic to see some dancing, drinking, and lovemaking. In the meantime, the drug lords are tightening their control of the drug market...Eventually, there are some interesting set pieces that recall the final shoot out in ""L.A. Confidential"" but lack any of the force that film had, as we bit our nails guessing the fate of our hero, we couldn't really care less about the underdeveloped characters in ""Miami Vice"". Needless to say, the final scene of the film doesn't make much of an impact, as Romeo and Juliet stare into the horizon...Michael Mann is a phenomenal talent. He just hasn't given us work of his usual standards this time.",Miami Vice
45,ShootingShark,Enjoyable But Unexceptional Undercover Drug Cops Action Movie,5,6 September 2009,"Crockett and Tubbs are two undercover detectives posing as drug couriers to try and smash a big Colombian trafficking route via Haiti. However, when Crockett becomes romantically involved with Isabella, the drug cartel's fixer, the sides start to get blurry A big budget movie, based on Anthony Yerkovich and Mann's iconic eighties TV cop show, this is a pretty good film but for me a disappointment in comparison with Mann's other police/action movies (particularly Manhunter and Heat). The reason for this I think is purely down to the style; there are several good tense sequences (a stand off with a bigshot dealer, a rescue mission in a trailer park, the final shootout) but the photography and editing are lacklustre TV standard, all quick shaky shots of nothing in particular. I guess movies are so expensive to shoot now that filmmakers like Mann must ensure they get through so many setups a day, but it just doesn't compare with the classic camera-work of, for example, Dante Spinotti. The story is okay, although I also have some complaints there; we find out who the big leak is via a quickly seen email - wow, what dramatic bite. The best part for me is the Isabella character, who is very unusual in this type of movie; normally she's just the hero's girlfriend, but here she's an original force - smart, sexy, sad and ultimately tragic. Gong Li is terrific in this part and steals the whole movie, although Ortiz as the bespectacled distrusting dealer Yero comes a close second. Farrell and Foxx are both fine but none of the original TV cast appear, which is probably a sensible choice, though what I liked best about the show was Edward James Olmos' extreme never-look-at-anyone performance style. The movie is full of the lush trappings the show was known for - elegant beach houses, high-end speedboats and designer clothes - and Farrell drives a rather chic Ferrari F430 Spider (although it's not as cool as Don Johnson's Testarossa). Perhaps the best thing about the film is the cool keyboard score by John Murphy (Snatch, 28 Days Later). A pleasant enough way to spend an evening, but this particular director can do much better.",Miami Vice
46,triple8,love it or hate it one will probably be talking about it after they've seen it....,8,5 August 2006,"SPOILERS THROUGH:I have to admit I liked this a lot, in fact way more then expected. What's funny is the person I was with wasn't to crazy about it and expected to love it. I guess this is a movie where what one expects isn't exactly what they get.I think this is the type of movie that one will not like so much if their looking for a lot of action sequences or for the movie to be a lot like the TV show. For me I wasn't that into the TV show and was not necessarily looking forward all that much to a lot of action scenes. What this movie did offer was more heavily geared toward mood, atmosphere & cinematography. Since I'm more into those things then a lot of action I really liked Miami Vice a lot, though I can see how one would be let down if their more into the former.Here's the things I liked. The moodiness of the movie was extraordinary and it was helped by glorious visuals, a great soundtrack which helped pump up the element of excitement and a lush atmosphere that was rich with suspense and was gripping almost from the beginning. (though the first 15-20 minutes were a bit slow.) But all in all, those aspects were very well done And I was pleasantly surprised.The casting was very good as well and I thought Fox and Farrel were both great although the supporting cast was a bit to underused. The girlfriends were pretty good and the movie was just so 80's! It kind of brings one back in time a little, and it WAS a gripping movie, in that, it sucks you in and I really didn't feel the length of the movie all that much. Overall there was a lot to like.Now The negatives. In spite of the positives, there were some negatives as well and though I really enjoyed this I would not give it a 9 or 10. First was the plot itself. I do not agree it lacked depth or that it was all style no substance. I think there was a lot of substance. It's just that it was hard to know what was going on half the time. (Actually more then half the time.) The plot could have been a bit easier to understand. I will admit I was swept into the movie and riveted but much of the time, I had absolutely no idea what it was I was riveted by(If that makes any sense.) If someone had asked me what was going on, at any one moment, I'm not sure I'd have been able to answer. That I was STILL so into the movie says a lot about it's ability to engage the viewer but I sure wish it had been easier to follow and so much hadn't been so ambiguous.There were also some major plot holes, some of which were never explained and that was frustrating. At times it seemed the movie was less a crime film, then a romance. (at the end I really did start to think Colin was going to start running after the boat screaming ""no-don't go. I love you""). I am not saying there's anything wrong with concentrating a bit on the romantic aspect(these two did have chemistry) but it wasn't all that believable at times. And there was no lead up to these two falling in love so that, even though their story was interesting because their characters were interesting and because they had chemistry, it was rather difficult to buy into. Fox's romance with Trudy actually came off more realistically and I wish that had been given more screen time.The ending was also a bit flat after such a strong lead up and the way ""Miami Vice"" appears on screen at the end, WAS a bit much....although I liked how it was done at the beginning with just jumping into the movie. That was cool.I had heard so much talk about how much sex there was before I saw this but there didn't seem to be a lot to myself and the person I saw this with, at least not compared to a lot of other movies. I'm also glad they did not choose to make the movie a comedy.(Although I must say when Gong Li turns to Farrell at the end and says ""who are you"", I couldn't help a random thought that popped into my head, that being what if Colin turned to her and answered ""I'm Batman."")All in all I liked this better then expected. I can say it will be extremely unlikely that I WON'T watch this again, maybe even buy when it comes to DVD. This is almost a ""guily pleasure"" type of movie except it does have depth and it IS a genuinely good movie in a lot of ways, it's just also a movie where a lot of things could have been done better. But I hope to see a sequel and am really glad I saw this. Since one can't give .5 ratings on IMDb, I am going to rate it an 8, but it's probably more like a 7.5. I did enjoy this so much though, in spite of the negatives, maybe it deserves an 8 just for the compelling aspect. All in all, I'd say, though not extraordinary, much better then average.",Miami Vice
47,onepotato2,Incoherent posturing,2,23 July 2007,"Michael Mann has always cared a lot about surface style. The progression of that style to this movie was not inevitable but here it is; the most vapid cop movie ever. It wants to have gravitas, but it's just chilly and weird. In most scenes Crockett and Tubbs stare offscreen in some alluring location making cell phone calls and talking over each other. There are characters in life who do this; use their phone calls to make themselves look important to their immediate audience. They're losers too. I don't remember any of the characters ever relating to each other. They have very important phonecalls to make and very important things to stare at offscreen. It feels exactly like Michael Mann has placed the audience in the ""unimportant"" column.I couldn't tell you what this movie was about to save my life. I also couldn't tell you why you should care.

49,eric262003,The Good Stuff and The Bad Stuff Here Make For an Average Film,6,22 June 2015,"Before he became a well-known director to such classic film as ""The Last of the Mohicans"", ""Heat"" and ""The Insider"", director Michael Mann's very earliest filmography was when he served as executive producer of one of the best crime-dramas the the 1980's had in store at the time, the always iconic ""Miami Vice"". It was a classic series that handled the style and substance quite proportionately. In 2006, Mann has returned to his early roots in a movie adaptation to the classic 1980's series self-evaluating what he's been taught to him over the past few years since the series cancelled in 1990. After watching the movie, there are a few things that didn't sit with me very well and one of the many gripes I had with this adaptation to the series was that at two hours and fifteen minutes, it goes on for much too long. If that's bad enough, it's not only too long, it is also quite hard to decipher what the plot is and at times it becomes very confusing at times. Mann is easily at fault here because he also handled the script as well. When scenes tend to look conventional, it's handled with a complete lack of a formal standpoint. He knows exactly which scenes needs more focus and which ones need to move forward. His scripts usually go beyond sublime, but it reflects just how it reflects towards its audience. And from Mann the performances are what keeps us intrigued. In the case of this movie, the principal characters (Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx) are not the once that provide the best characters in the film who replace Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas as Detectives James ""Sonny"" Crockett and Rico Tubbs who are up to their dangerous anti-drug initiatives. While Foxx gives his all even though his demands are more subtle than crime-fighting partner Farrell. Farrell can't seem to measure up to the more suave performance Johnson portrayed when played Sonny Crockett in the series. Where's Jeff Bridges when you needed him?The supporting players are the once that dominate in their limited screen time and they're the ones who everyone wants to see more of. Barry Shabaka Henley as Sonny and Rico's superior Lt. Castillo (originally played by Edward James Olmos) looks very imposing and fearful, a man you simply don't want to anger with, with the exception of his sensitive eyes. Meanwhile, Luis Tosar who plays Montoya is the polar opposite to Castillo. He is a kingpin who dresses stylistically with a polite manner and a beard, but once again the eyes tell a different story as he's anything but a harmless man on the wrong side of the law. We can see something disturbing about him with those cold piercing eyes. His words from mouth about giving best regards to your family is sign that danger is lurking around. Mann really brings a very interesting perspective to the Montoya character, the kingpin our heroes want to defeat.In most movies,the most evil characters are cunning and colourful. In this movie, it's too laid-back and not very exhilarating. Montoya and his sultry girlfriend Isabella ((Gong Li) are in bed together, with his laptop going over their strategy of who to kill and the time it will be done. The feeling of discomfort comes into effect in Montoya's circle as people were coming into the organization with an over-the-top level of perversity. Montoya's loyal stooge Yero (John Ortiz) was a real piece of work as a grimacing,threatening,jokingly convincing evil-doer. The most noteworthy casting comes from Gong Li. Sure her English is not her best quality and that's understanding, but how she says her lines will make you break into a cold sweat. Sure she's running a South American drug cartel making her an outlaw, but her seductive manipulation towards Sonny is enough to make glasses fog up from the heat. Sure the there have been several chilling female antagonists, but Gong succeeds in keeping it powerful and only her vulnerability is shown through brief flashes. You are crazy if you mess with her mind.The story starts off as a sting operation situated at a nightclub and then it turns into an undercover job going horribly bad. An informant kills himself by getting run over by a truck and how does Mann handle the situation? While refraining from using shaky camera work or thrilling us with gore and carnage, he lets the truck move on with a trail of blood paving the lanes. Then we see baddies killing off people with their ammo towards people in their cars. By filming the scene in the car adds a more personal touch to the film. The cinematography goes way beyond picturesque. When the motorboat coming in from Havana is likely to put you in a romantic view, even for only ten seconds. There's a lot of disparate entities that's happening in ""Miami Vice"". The scenes involving Sonny and Isabella are just steamy fillers. There's a crime story happening, but it doesn't have much going for it and by the last minutes of the film, it doesn't hold together very well. Film critics have been overfed with a cornucopia of junk. But to see a person who knows the ins-and-outs of a film like this one went way overboard in self-praising himself for it. What I have to say is that it is an average film with some good and bad things about it.",Miami Vice
50,gangstahippie,An Underrated Film That Could Have Been Better.,8,12 August 2006,"Rated R for strong violence,language and some sexual content.I just came back from seeing the film Miami Vice in theaters.I'm going to say this now I have decided to review movies on this site as well as TV shows and video games.Anyway getting back to Miami Vice.A lot of people seem to not like this very underrated film.Yes there were plenty of elements that would have made this film better.There was no chemistry between Crockett and Tubbs,there was not enough action,doesn't take place in the 1980's etc.Those elements would have made the film better but without those elements this is still a great movie.The acting was fairly good.Jamie Foxx can act very well and even Colin Farell.Aside from the two main characters everybody else in this film is not too famous.Michael Mann is a great director.We have seen him direct plenty of excellent films such as Heat,Ali,Collateral,The Insider etc.This film falls a bit short compared to other great Mann films but it is definitely not bad at all.There may not be lots of action in the film but the action is fairly good at parts.The gunfire sounds are simply excellent and realistic.Great addition to this great movie.The film is about two cops from Miami named Crockett and Tubbs who go undercover to foil a drug deal.Another reason this film was not as good as it could have been was because it didn't take place in the 80's.The 80's setting was part of the original Miami Vice show.The 80's fashion and 80's soundtrack was part of Miami Vice.This modern day setting takes that away.In conclusion Miami Vice could have been much better but the film is still very good and I suggest fans of the original show or action film fans take a look at this film.You wont regret it.Runtime:134min 8/10",Miami Vice
51,pc95,Poor Casting/direction - Mann has done A lot better,4,20 July 2008,"Miami Vice doesn't work. I was not a regular fan of the TV show, only really remembering the title intro/opening and theme. The movie here pretty much takes several of the characters from the show and loosely builds a crime story around them. The story is ho-hum while cinematography at times well done for the most part with the action scenes few and far between styled, fluid, and graphic. The problem is the cast and direction. First and foremost Gong Li, who in her defense is way out of her element. Reading most of the comments here, most imdbers are ignorant of her background. But seriously, she doesn't even come close to passing for an uppity drug lordess. Her beauty is renowned as is her prolific career in Chinese Cinema but she cant cut it in this type of fast paced Hollywood production - she doesn't have the experience nor language skills. Secondly Collin Farrell who's more or less an annoyance of an actor - he is not compelling nor brings out any kind of pathos in this role. He is the 2nd casting error. So given these 2 critical cast mistakes the movie cant be anything any better than average which it isn't. The romantic scenes were chewing up some 25 min of laughably bad footage, sex scenes, and dialog of the above mentioned 2 seriously fails the movie. Jamie Foxx on the other hand does a decent job as a straight shooter. Michael Mann brings a lot of the great panoramic views and urban settings effortlessly interlaced with crime stories that he has in most his movies. The problem is he's made some critical casting mistakes here. The polar opposite of Heat where he captured the essence of what bravado acting can achieve. Too bad, rent if you don't care much about acting believability.",Miami Vice
52,Luigi Di Pilla,Not a must see,6,9 January 2007,I had high expectations and I believed in seeing a first action thriller but I was hardly disappointed. What I saw here is nothing special except the fast boats scenes. The story didn't impress me at all because it's really weak and there were some slow paced sequences. I find they could develop some more plots and twists.Director Michael Mann delivered therefore many superb images and the cinematography was fine too.All in all my final verdict is that Miami Vice is not a must see and the TV-series of the 80s are finally much more better. 6/10.See instead COLLATERAL from the same director.,Miami Vice
53,DJAkin,Terrible Movie,2,9 October 2007,"I saw this movie and was hoping for good Miami Vice that was similar to the TV SHOW. What I got was an Irish Actor trying to act tough and Jamie Foxx trying to act cool. Trust me, the BOTH FAILED in those departments. Also, I had no clue what was going on during the entire movie. There was some white supremists and an Asian lady. I have no clue why that one dude who looks like SYIED FROM LOST was acting so crazy or what his ROLE WAS. Also, I had no idea why that black boss of Crockett and Tubbs was so adamant about being the leader at the end.

54,chrichtonsworld,who is going to watch this movie,5,7 August 2006,"When I was twelve i saw the first episode of Miami Vice and it blew me away! I loved it from the start and followed as much as i could. Now after 18 years i have watched some episodes and i didn't experience it as i used to. Miami Vice the series is a little dated but still contains a lot of style. So i can imagine that Michael Mann wanted to update the series with this movie!The problem is that you don't get involved with the characters, you don't care for them. There is no drama, not much emotion! There is no tension, excitement and very little action. What was Michael Mann thinking! Michael Mann successfully updated L.A. Takedown into Heat. You would hope he would do the same for Miami Vice. But then at least you have to come up with an interesting plot! Sometimes i don't even care about the plot as long there is a lot of style and action! But it just isn't there! And everything is so damn serious. At least Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas had some class and humor to show for. And where were the flamingos and where was Jan Hammer! Where was Miami! Don't talk about acting because nobody was acting. Nobody was believable! I am not going to waste my time anymore on this movie! Avoid this movie at all costs!",Miami Vice
55,oneguyrambling,The antidote for insomnia; a two hour bland msic video montage.,5,17 February 2012,"Colin Farrell is Sonny Crockett, he sports a Highlander mullet and a Texas-Irish accent that provided me with the only momentary amusement in this film.Jamie Foxx is Ricardo Tubbs, he is black.We are given no intro aside from what we see and hear, so that's all the first 10 minutes of Miami Vice told me.We join the action mid way through the first quarter, Crockett and Tubbs are undercover cops on the trail of some dastardly drug dealers.A timeout in the sting is called when a known snitch rings the boys out of the blue, begging for forgiveness for giving up information regarding other undercover agents to some white supremacist low-lives. The same white supremacist low-lives who kill said snitch's wife, and then snitch himself.The pair then consult with their boss and are introduced to the FBI, who want them to volunteer to go undercover as fresh faces to get to the bottom of all this, as the breach in security now means no existing FBI agents can be sure of their anonymity.Pausing only to bang a hot team member Tubbs and Crockett head down to South America where they almost immediately gain access to the nether regions of organized crime in the continent, they pose as drug transporters, thinking that it might be the quickest way to move up the chain to the kingpins of the organization.On they go with the main aim of bringing down the whole operation and avenging the death of a scummy druggie snitch – hey that's what I was lead to believe.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ OK I'm bored with this. Miami Vice actually has a plot, and the plot moves along with reasonable pace, it's just that everything is so damn serious. There are no jokes and no moments of levity, everything is totally solemn and the tension-meter is never showing less than 98%. The problem with this is that where no highs or lows exist it all gets so same-y. A chuckle here or there to break the tension would give the audience a chance to pause and recalibrate itself back into proceedings, alas this never comes.Even the sex scenes – and there are a few – are so deadly serious and procedural that they lack any significance. There is no tongue in cheek jokes, no moments of levity, not even a nod to the TV series.Even though Crockett and Tubbs move along up the line and find themselves in greater and greater peril I lost all interest, when someone finally pulled a trigger all I could think of was how long was left to go.The authenticity of the various accents – aside from Farrell's, which was less authentic than it was hilarious – meant that I really could have used subtitles for some dialogue, (subtitles that I know are available on DVD, but with 16 different languages it is more a pain to scroll through them all for a sentence here or there than it's worth).One last thing: EVERYTHING in Miami Vice is a music video, there are at least 15 scenes of locations, landscapes, guys getting ready, guys thinking deeply, people moving around etc, all set to loud distracting music. In a good film no probs, in a 2 hour pretentious snooze fest have one or two and then please get to the forking point.Final Rating – 5 / 10. I thought being a smooth lady-killing cop (either black or white) infiltrating a vicious and deadly drug operation spanning two continents would at least cause a couple of laughs or involve some cool moments of action. How wrong I was.",Miami Vice
56,PimpinAinttEasy,A wonderful mess of a film .....,8,16 June 2016,"Dear Michael Mann, Miami Vice was a wonderful mess of a film. Thank you for making it. I have not seen the original series so I cannot write about how the film compares to the TV series. I am curious about how the film would have turned out if you had not used digital photography. I like the carefully composed shots and the tasteful sets of your earlier classics like Thief and Manhunter.But unlike the haters, I thought Miami Vice was full of stylishly rendered scenes starting with the very first scene at the nightclub. You lined up an array of actors with remarkable faces for this film - they played white supremacists, South American gangsters, FBI agents and undercover cops. However, Colin Farrel, Jamie Foxx and John Ortiz were disappointments. I guess you had to cast huge stars to finance a big budget film like Miami Vice. Gong Li who looked like pure royalty made up for the unremarkable heroes and villain.The story isn't much to write home about. It is a stylized account of the lives of two undercover cops, their women and their toys. The plot is deliberately incoherent. The dialogues which are delivered in whispers with Chris Cornell wailing or heavy metal guitars growling in the background were a complete mystery. But then, it is not really about the plot. We get a look around Miami. And it is not just the posh condos and the exotic bars. But also the warehouses and the barren lands where all the stand offs take place. There are at least three remarkable stands off in the film. In fact, there are more standoffs than full length action scenes. The interracial romance between Gong Li and Colin Farrel and its consequences is a comment on the state of race relations in the multi-cultural and multi-racial melting pot that is Florida. Miami Vice is a moody, stylish and ultimately flawed film demonstrates what mainstream big budget Hollywood action cinema can be. In the decade since Miami Vice, we have witnessed the gradual decline of American cinema as superheroes and mind numbing special effects have taken over the landscape once occupied by the likes of you and Tony Scott. It is a real shame. But thanks for the effort, Michael. Best Regards, Pimpin. (8/10)",Miami Vice
57,seymourblack-1,A Reboot For The Noughties,7,18 March 2018,"The groundbreaking 1980s TV series that Michael Mann executive produced was very much a product of its time and so it's hardly surprising that this 2006 reboot should be significantly different. This time around, the exploits of Miami vice detectives Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) don't feature the same emphasis on fashionable clothes, designer stubble or the distinctive music of Jan Hammer but instead present a darker, grittier and more serious account of their work as they attempt to identify and hunt down a ruthless drugs kingpin.A nightclub stakeout aimed at arresting a bunch of sex-traffickers has to be abandoned suddenly when one of Crockett's former informants contacts him to say that he's on the run because his role in an FBI sting has been exposed and he fears for the safety of his wife who has been taken hostage by a group of white supremacists. Crockett and Tubbs aren't able to do anything to prevent the hostage from being killed or her grief-stricken husband from committing suicide immediately after and so take an opportunity that arises to take part in a multi-agency undercover investigation into the Colombian drugs cartel who their informant had been gathering information about.In order to infiltrate the drug smugglers' organisation, Crockett and Tubbs attend a meeting with Jose Yero (John Ortiz) who is one of its leaders and posing as transportation experts, make a bid to take over the cartel's distribution work from the Aryan Brotherhood. A Chinese/Cuban woman called Isabella (Gong Li) is also present and it transpires that she's not only impressed by their pitch but also occupies an important role in the cartel as she's the top man's business manager and lover. In this capacity, she arranges for Crockett and Tubbs to have a face to face meeting with Arcangel de Jesus Montoya (Luis Tosar) who, on her recommendation, agrees for the two men to be hired.As well as coping with the normal dangers encountered in this type of operation, the two undercover cops soon have to deal with some added difficulties caused by Crockett entering into an affair with Isabella and the menacing Yero (who had never trusted them) colluding with the Aryan Brotherhood to kidnap Tubbs' girlfriend Trudy (Naomie Harris) and demand a ransom for her release which could compensate them for the loss of the lucrative contract that Crockett and Tubbs had been given. When this plan fails, Yero informs Montoya about Isabella's affair and takes her as his prisoner in an act that sparks the ultra-violent confrontation that quickly brings the undercover operation and the activities of the drug smugglers to a sudden and very definite end.Director, screenwriter and joint producer Michael Mann does a great job of delivering a visually impressive thriller which features a couple of well-choreographed action sequences, some brilliant location work and an exciting soundtrack that features some great tracks by Jay-Z/Linkin Park, Audioslave and Moby. The atmosphere is consistently tense because of the dangerous nature of the undercover operation, the obvious threats posed by some of the criminals and of course, the self-inflicted complications that Crockett encounters because of an affair which both he and Isabella recognise has no future.The movie's dialogue is its weakest feature as it is often jargon-riddled, delivered in staccato style and unhelpful in terms of exposition. Good performances by the entire cast however, ensure that the characters are all brought to life very vividly and the audience's interest is maintained at a high level throughout.",Miami Vice
58,Angelus2,"""Let's take it to the limit one more time""",10,6 March 2008,"""Let's take it to the limit one more time"" And thats what these guys do. I am too young to remember the Miami Vice series but this film is not the series. The trailer was amazing revealing the plot and teasing the audience with scenes of the glamorous life of Gangsters.This film breaks its ties from the original series, and brings the audience to a more realistic and hard world of organised crime, especially the drug trade.Detective Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs infiltrate a crime organisation, by pretending to be traffickers. They find themselves in the company of criminals that are ruthless and have much more sophisticated tools then them. But, Sonny finds himself in a dilemma as he begins to fall for Isabella, the drug lord's girl.This film has been criticised for it's lack of direction as well as dialogue and honestly I can say that I do not know what these people are talking about. This is a fine crime movie, better than then 'Heat' in my opinion, or 'Casino'.Colin Farell and Jamie Foxx, work well along side each other; they lack a little chemistry but they make up with attitude. Gong Li plays the 'Queen' of the manor beautifully, you can see why Sonny falls for her, mysterious and seductive. The rest of the cast provide great performances.Michael Mann directs this brilliantly like 'Collateral' we see the darker side of this world, as it glimmers beautiful in the midst of darkness. Just look at the opening of this movie, straight away you're hit with the 'Numb/Encore' track and you are immersed within the night club scene and you become apart of the film in the bat of an eye-lid.The spectacular shots of great locations are simply spell-binding, we're given glimpse of places that we''ve simply never seen on films before, like the amazing water falls and oceans, rainforest's. Another thing people have complained about is the dialogue, I thought it was realistic, they didn't over explain things....like give a full history of the 'drug lord'...Now the action, it's not over the top. It's short and loud as well as brutal which fits the screenplay, in my personal opinion; when the team goes to rescue Trudy it brings with it a great feeling of anticipation and the end shoot-out screams pure realism.",Miami Vice
59,antoniotierno,below the usual standards of Michael Mann but certainly interesting,7,14 September 2006,"Think the two lead actors lack nothing of their TV counterparts and on the contrary they have shown a strong chemistry; maybe the story is not up to ""Heat"" or the other Mann's masterpieces but everything looks serious. Action starts immediately, rhythm is relentless and the scenes are beautifully shot. I judge very positively the fact that the film shows no routine and renders the modern Miami (million dollar apartments, gorgeous boats) in a very proper way. Therefore this remake of the famous series shot in the eighties is a very tense urban drama about two undercover cops who end up enjoying their new lives. To sum up I'd say this motion picture is is enthralling but suffers too much the comparison with ""The Heat"", that is unreachable.",Miami Vice
60,jaredmobarak,"Drugs, Money, and SpeedMiami Vice",6,29 July 2006,"I had heard a rumor going around that writer/director Michael Mann was having a real tough time cutting his feature adaptation of his own 80's television drama ""Miami Vice."" Supposedly he wasn't finding a balance in the material he shot that would support his vision of the update. Whether this is true or not, I believe he was finally able to come to terms with the brutal look at underground police justice he had filmed. The movie has an edge to it that works well with Mann's forte of shooting city-life at ground level like his recent Collateral and classic Heat. However, with that said, the movie is definitely rough around the edges. Many times it feels as though we are at a sneak preview screening seeing a preliminary cut of what will be trimmed into a powerful film. I can't wait to see the finished version. It's just a shame that that final cut is in fact what I saw.Colin Farrell's Sonny Crockett and Jamie Foxx's Ricardo Tubbs are Miami detectives in the midst of a bust when they are contacted by a former informant, the always-trustworthy character actor John Hawkes. They are soon enveloped into an agency snafu where it turns out that the two partners are the only people not compromised on a mission and will have to go deep undercover to set things right. The proceedings are shot very close-up and grainy with a deliberate approach to showing emotion on behalf of the actors. Miami Vice is a dark film, both atmospherically and contextually. We are shown dangerous dealings, without a safety net throughout, and see the danger these men risk their lives on. As most movies of this ilk show, we are privy to violence, role-reversals, bad women falling for the good guys, high-octane vehicular speed, and all the other action clichés one can think of. On the most part, though, they work and help make up a compelling if not convoluted storyline.On the acting front, all bring their A-games. Farrell continues to surprise with a nice turn as the cop on the tightrope of becoming that which he hunts. It's a shame people don't give him as much credit as they should; everyone should see his range in movies like Tigerland, Intermission, and even most moments of Phone Booth, before totally writing him off. Foxx shows us again that with the right direction he could be a great actor. Maybe not his best work, but performances in both this and Mann's Collateral help us to forgot debacles like Stealth and an over-the-top job in the otherwise underrated Jarhead. Gong Li is great as the woman playing both sides and Naomie Harris takes another small role to a higher level like she did in the Pirates sequel a couple weeks ago. On the other hand, we see two actors, who need to get more work in Hollywood, as wasted space. Isaach De Bankolé is seen for a flash in the opening scene and Justin Theroux is relegated to multiple, ""it's your call,"" quips to Crockett and Tubbs. I will, however, be on the lookout for John Ortiz in the future to do some good things in movies. His villainous turn here as the middle-man/coordinator José Yero is very effective, and probably the best part of the film.The acting just can't quite carry the film above its choppy feel. There are many instances where quick cuts between scenes feel as though something is missing. We are treated to short scenes like that of Foxx talking coordinates when flying a plane, that have no relevance at all, while also then cutting between locations with no sense of how everyone got there. Do we really need two gratuitous shower scenes that have no meaning in the plot other than to show how Foxx loves his and girl and Farrell loves his just as much? It's a real shame, for at many times during the sloppiness, there are signs of greatness. Even the music appears as though to just be placeholders until the real songs are added in post-production. The soundtrack is very good, don't get me wrong, it just feels misused in the scenes it tries to accompany. Also, when you have three songs by the same artist, (either Chris Cornell solo or with Audioslave), play at different moments it should have meaning. There are no comparisons to be made that the music links, they are just there. It confused me and did what a soundtrack should never do in a movie, be noticeable rather than enhancing.I went into Miami Vice with very low expectations. The acting was admirable, the mood engrossing, and the action scenes well done. Each small explosion of violence was effective and jarring. If only the movie itself was allowed more tweaking and honing, all that would have meant more. Mann had a vision that he just couldn't quite convert onto film. It's a great first draft. Maybe one day he will go back and tighten it up to make it what it has all the potential to be.",Miami Vice
61,adamscastlevania2,"Mann, what a dull cop movie",3,28 August 2014,"(28%) Like a piano with one key, or a guitar with one string, this is a movie with only one note. Everything about it is somewhere between bad and okay as the lead cast are given an even harder task than their characters with a script void of personality, wit, ideas, and intrigue. Fans of this movie harp on about it looking great, but I don't think so, it's too inconsistent as parts do look quite good, but then certain parts look do like a $10.000 budgeted amateur piece with some distracting, and all-too clear looking grainy digital crap shots. The biggest issue of all though is the sheer dullness of it all, it really is like watching a super serious ""Bad boys"" rip-off, and when the plot can be explained in a short sentence, then is it really necessary for it to be over 2 hour long? It is safe to say I'll never, ever watch this again because what's the point? Stick with the TV series as this, along with the very disappointing ""Public enemies"", is a product of a director running low on steam. Fingers crossed he finds form again pretty soon as this is total dross.",Miami Vice
62,jon.h.ochiai,"Hot ""Miami Vice""",9,30 July 2006,"Director Michael Mann is one of the great storytellers with a distinctive visual style. His reinvented ""Miami Vice"" is visually enthralling. ""Miami Vice"" is hot. For me two spectacular images standout: the tandem powerboats racing up the Miami River at night, and the awesome panoramic aerial shot of the waterfalls in Uruguay. ""Miami Vice"" is a driving action movie that is a stunning visual artwork. ""Miami Vice"" reunites Mann with writer Anthony Yerkovich in the reinvention of their ""Miami Vice"" television series from the late 1980's with Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx playing undercover narcotics cops Sonny Crockett and Richardo ""Ricco"" Tubbs. Here instead of the signature pastel colors and synthesizer based music, the style is distinctively darker, gritty, and edgy. ""Miami Vice"" begins without opening credits at the scene of a bust gone deadly wrong. Police are killed and an informant's family is brutally murdered. All point to an intelligence leak in this FBI run operation. And somehow this is connected to the Aryan Brotherhood. I myself was not following all of this. FBI Supervisor Fujima (Ciaran Hinds) asks Crockett and Tubbs to go undercover posing as drug runners. Ricco's girlfriend Trudy, an intelligence analyst, creates identities for Sonny (Farrell) and Ricco (Foxx).Farrell and Foxx have awesome chemistry as Sonny and Riccoa strength of ""Miami Vice"". Farrell is the tough renegade Sonny with the troubled past. Foxx is the smart and stable Ricco. Both are high on attitude and cool, and completely loyal to each other. They blatantly demonstrate the ""attitude"" in their first meeting with Jose Yero (John Ortiz), who represents drug lord Montoya (Luis Tosar). During the meeting Sonny has an animal attraction for Isabella (beautiful Gong Li), an international banker, business partner and Montoya's lover. Predictably this does not perturb Sonny. Roles become blurred and motives are compromised. In a quiet exchange Sonny warns Isabella that ""probability is like gravity""this could all end badly. Ricco sees what is happening and still stands by his partner.It was a surprise to see Gong Li (""Raise the Red Lantern"" and ""Ju Dou"") cast as the sullen and calculated Isabella. She is great. She embodies a force and deep sense of sadness in Isabella. At first the connection between she and Farrell's Sonny seems stilted; however, Mann's tempered direction makes the romance both sensual and poignant. The entire cast is strong. Colin Farrell, bad press and all, is one the screen's most charismatic and intense actors. Farrell also makes some interesting choices in playing Sonny, in depicting his vulnerable side. Works. Jamie Foxx is slick and so cool as Ricco, keeping the complexity just below the surface. Foxx is a powerful actor. He has a quiet conversation with Farrell before it all ""goes down"" that is mesmerizing. Elizabeth Rodriguez as team member Gina is intense, strong, and sexy. Barry Shabaka Henley (""Collateral"") provides his own style and interpretation of Lt. Castillo.Michael Mann creates chaos in the beginning of ""Miami Vice"", and I was able to recover as he navigates through his action mood piece. Soon the South American drug cartel, Aryan Brotherhood, and blanket deception become focused. With Mann it is more the experience and journey that distinguishes his movies, than the actual story. His ""Miami Vice"" is edgy and compelling. The climatic operation at the end is not the theatrical orchestrated showcase of his ""Heat"". The violence is chaotic, unrelenting, and realistic. His ""Miami Vice"" is a visually striking tale of love, loyalty, and redemption. Powerful and uncompromising movie-making.",Miami Vice
63,cultfilmfan,Miami Vice,4,2 August 2006,"Miami Vice is based upon the 80's television series of the same name. I have never seen the television show, but I don't think it would have changed my thoughts about this movie. I'm going to be honest with you by saying that I was bored to tears with this movie and a lot of the time while the movie was playing I was looking around the theatre and daydreaming, so I wouldn't be the proper person to give you a plot synopsis of this movie. When I was paying attention to the film which was often enough I found the story and what was going on to be so confusing that it made me lose even more interest. Pretty much everything is bad with this movie. The direction isn't stylish or neat looking and it instead feels and looks like a big loud and obnoxious action movie which it pretty much is. The script is absolutely terrible and there basically isn't much of a story at all to this film which probably leads to one of the reasons I find it so boring and terrible. The conversations between the characters in the movie were also ridiculous and some of what they said was pretty laughably bad. The acting didn't win me over and basically the characters didn't do a whole lot of memorable things other than talk, drive fancy cars and get involved in shootouts. The characters were not well played but anyone and I almost felt the film focused more on Colin Farrell's character than Jamie Foxx's character who is pretty much left out of the cold in much of this film. And this is supposed to be a buddy picture? The music was annoying and was just basically music that if I heard it on the radio I would instantly change the channel to hear something else. If all these reasons don't already prove to you how bad this film is it also goes on for more than two hours and I wanted it to end a long time before that. This is also one of the films where you are wishing for it to end and it just doesn't and scene after scene of filler and stuff that the audience won't really care about is thrown in. Miami Vice was boring, terrible in pretty much every way and was a loud and obnoxious action film that has no brains to it and whoever wrote this script was sure on autopilot because there is so little to it and as I mentioned before some lines were downright cheesy. Avoid this film at all costs and if you are looking for a good action film rent the vastly superior Running Scared. Miami Vice is one of the worst films of the year and I'm really sorry it took up two hours and twelve minutes of my time.",Miami Vice

65,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,It's OK,5,13 August 2006,"Two detectives go deep undercover in effort to get at the drug world in Miami. Predictably things complicate and their personal lives become unwillingly involved in the whole thing. Yawn.Michael Mann, it seems, tried desperately to top his crime saga 'Heat' from 1995 with this release. The way this film was made it seemed like he could do it as this film also has a broad story with many elements and characters involved. The set pieces are great and there is some terrific cinematography in parts - most notably in scenes with vehicles and a shootout at the end, but the rest of the film is an awful mishmash.The leads have hardly any chemistry together on screen and they are just barely convincing as under cover cops with their ever perfectly set haircuts and sharp looks. They look good, OK, but are these really guys who are stressed out from a dangerous and tiring job? Nope. Also, Michael Mann has decided to take the romantic element from 'Heat' one step further and include some sex scenes - one of which isn't too bad, but the second is pretty silly along with Mann's inclusion of radio hits as the main part of the film's soundtrack.Looks good, had some good elements, but also has some very bad elements. 5/10Rated R: violence, profanity, and sex",Miami Vice
66,abisio,The 135 millions budget was used to bribe movie critics,1,29 July 2006,"If by any chance, you were looking for the worst movie of the year, do not look any further. Is here and is called Miami VICE. It is also the most expensive bore of the year it should probably make some GUINNESS RECORDS.The biggest surprise is that the movie got some good reviews, so I imagine a considerable part of the 135 millions budget was used to bribe as many critics, magazines (EW for example) because there is no way what you see on screen could cost that much.It is pretty obvious, that no too much was expended on the script. It seems every Hollywood cliché was listed ordered by most used and the writer and/or director Mr. Mann used as much as he can until filling up the 135 minutes of continuous stupidity this movie packs.The starting looks promising; two undercover cops trying to avenge another one who's family (and himself) were betrayed and killed but some of the law enforcer department involved in the mission. However, that's has really nothing to do with the rest. The subject of corruption within the system barely mentioned again but nothing is done or suggested or even digger a little more.The two heroes (to call them in some way) start an undercover (but of course approved) mission to capture middle drug dealer and a drug king using methods that are completely unbelievable. There is not logic in what they do and by the end; the resolution is so dumb that you question what they took all that burden if things end up in a shootout where all bad guys are killed.Just to name a few:The police store a load of coke from the drug dealer to return to him later. If they knew where it was why they did not capture him in the first place.They go to Ciudad Del Este to contact a person but they never do any business directly with him but at the end a small army goes to the guy house. Based on what proof? If you do not know, Ciudad Del Este is a place managed by Arabs money and is the capital of drug smuggling in South America. If USA could have a minimum influence in that city (and it has not) they could have used it to finish the drug smuggling at least in USA.Driving a high speed boat, one of the main characters goes to Cuba and came back after a romantic week end. Did the writers has any idea that Cuba has a cost guard and full army trying to avoid an invasion from USA; that USA has another cost guard for the same opposite reason (and to avoid illegal immigrants) and on top of people in Cuba are being spied continuously; so entering and going out is not like going to Bahamas.By the end, one of the characters, goes willingly to Cuba when after 18 years in Miami, Cubans only want to go out of the island and if they are going back is as American Citizens to visit the very inexpensive JINETERAS (ask Mr. Mann the meaning of that work; probably he has no idea).There are many more things like the absurd love story or the miracle recover of the comma patient. The characters have no personality or even real motives. The acting is so lame that not even the two great actors can believe what they are doing.And as an action movie, it really is not. There are a few violent scenes, realistic to be fair but do not cover more than 5% of the movie. The rest when they are not in a stupid dialog is just a show off of a Ferrari and a few expensive cars (never damaged) and a few boats. I was never being really a fan of Mann. HEAT (to me) was good because only because of De Niro and Pacino; but COLLATERAL was a mediocre movie. However, both were far superior (and even the TV series was) than this overpriced and absurd piece of junk.Please avoid it at any cost; probably in that way, Hollywood will learn that people needs intelligent movies also.",Miami Vice
67,oneloveall,Miami-Iced,5,2 December 2006,"Michael Mann's frustrating update to the original television show, of which he knew a thing or two about, left many people scratching their heads pretty much right after the film began as to the nature of this reinterpretation. Was this a calculated attempt at the cold, sexy realism so effortlessly demonstrated by the notoriously detail-oriented director's previous work in a fun new setting, an excruciatingly inept revamping and fumbling of the source material low-lighted by the drained lead performances, or some mysterious concoction of the two? Surprisingly, I found myself leaning towards the less inspiring of those answers, as this most insidery of scripts hacked it's way through in a guise made of authenticity. What I found most authentic, despite Mann's continuing aesthetic loyalty to detailing urban action the likes of which few American directors could muster, was the astounding incompatibility, insensitivity, and overall skull-crushingly numb synergy between our two touted crime partners, Jamie Foxx and, more blame-worthy Colin Farrell. As if the massively convoluted, realistically dry, outside-looking-in, screenplay is not enough to alienate all but the most cop savvy viewers, we are then asked to accept this hollow, though realistic plot to validate the hollow, but unrealistic acting between the two. Mann's immediate recasting of one or both of these guys after watching screen tests together should have been a step in the right direction, although his entire noble but unfulfilled effort to grant us this personal view into the lives of elite undercover Miami drug officers would have been a gamble even in the hands of better leads. The entire ordeal, while straining for unadorned realism, feels strangled in it's self-imposed, stagnating machismo, sadly reinterpreted I fear for fans, in a most unflattering light. While the overall class and style demonstrated by someone as professional as Michael Mann forbids this movie from being utter trash in the same way many perceptive establishing shots override the majority of this numbing script, this is certainly a low point for me in the director's work, heavily exacerbated by the unintuitive chemistry.",Miami Vice
68,RJBurke1942,The real crime with this one is that you have to pay to see it...,3,3 January 2007,"It's shame when a director of the caliber of Michael Mann does a movie just for the money, or kicks. There can't possibly be any other reason for this turkey than either of those two reasons...He's been involved, as producer and/or director, in some noteworthy movies: Thief (1981); The Last of the Mohicans (1992); Heat (1995); The Insider (1999) etc. Each of those did well, and I still rank Thief as his most riveting with a great sound track by Tangerine Dream (you have to hear it to believe it)...Not with this Miami Vice, though: barely anything is intelligible and/or intelligent. The sound track is mostly banal, but perhaps that's Mann's way of having a dig at the Floridian nightclub and crime scene? The dialog is just awful: not only is it hard to hear most of the time, it's mumbled, and often too fast. Is that how Floridians speak down there now? I haven't been to Miami since 1967, so I guess things must have really changed there...What can you say about another story about drug and gunrunners? Ho-hum? That's about it, pilgrims...Oh, the action is just right, and plenty of it, even the soft-core sex. All of that will no doubt please the fans. But, this is not the TV series redux, not by a long shot. It's far worse.And what a shame also to see the incomparable Gong Li (or Li Gong, if you prefer) reduced to playing (again) a gangster's moll, sort of. Better to go watch Shanghai Triad (1995) than to spoil your expectations with this film. It made my blood cringe and teeth itch to watch...The solution: get a DVD with the TV series and watch that instead. There were no pretensions with that load of rubbish.This movie is just a joke.",Miami Vice
69,DonFishies,"Entertaining and engrossing, but far from perfection",8,31 July 2006,"I am far too young to have been able to catch episodes of Miami Vice during its original TV run. I caught a few over the last few years, and always felt like the show was pretty great for what it was. So even without the original cast, I was fairly excited for a movie directed by original executive producer Michael Mann. And while it definitely a Mann film, that is not necessarily an overly great thing.The film starts right up after the Universal logo with no opening credits, and just goes from there. After a bizarre and meaningless sequence in a night club, Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Rico Tubbs (Jamie Foxx), two detectives from the Miami Vice squad, find out from an informant that he snitched out on two fellow FBI officers working the Miami drug circuit, leading to their deaths by the hands of a White Supremacist group. So Vice Liutentant Martin Castillo (Mann regular Barry Shabaka Henley) calls in a quick meeting involving Crockett, Tubbs, himself and lead FBI agent Fujima (Ciarán Hinds). They speak of the goings-on, and how both agencies are trying bring down another Middle Eastern drug dealing group. They decide it okay for Crockett and Tubbs to infiltrate the group, and basically ""do what they do"" to bring them to justice.That's basically the general set-up for everything that follows, and while it tends to downplay itself into boredom off and on, Mann manages to make the film entertaining enough to be able to sit through. His wacky and innovative camera angles that helped make Collateral so different from other films, are back in full force here. The film is dark and gritty on one end, and bright and gorgeous on the other. Thus, so are the scenes that fill the screen. Some shots are intentionally grainy, and others are perfectly coloured, clear digital images. The shooting style is just about the same. One moment the film will be showing a conventionally shot scene, and the next second, it turns into a shaky hand-held shot. It makes the movie feel more realistic, and makes the audience really feel like a member of the Miami Vice team. It gets a bit too dark in some scenes however, and some shots just look silly (such as when Crockett and Tubbs are shown driving along from the angle of the hood of the car). But for the most part, they are appealing and are constructed and followed through with great skill.But while the visuals are perfect, the storyline is not quite up to the same level. The storyline aims for one thing, but ends up producing something entirely different. Unlike the show, the film is gritty and violent. It becomes a tad bit confusing at times, and in others, it just feels silly and implausible. Yes, Mann does not bother explaining everything for the audience, but instead, it feels like he just wants to throw everything he can at us, and just hope for the best. It simply does not feel like it has total direction, and in many instances, does not seem to know what it wants to focus on. And there is basically no emotion being showcased in any scenes. Characters feel monotone, even in times that they should not. Everyone involved is talented and has shown their merit in multiple films proceeding this, but they just feel a bit dry here, as if Mann wanted to just focus on making the visuals appealing and nothing more. Hell, he even let Farrell and Foxx be dressed up in blatant 1980's styles, and lets everyone else look like they are from 2006. Although they looked stylish, it is not very contemporary in the least.Despite their lack of chemistry (not on part of trying, but in part of there being basically nothing in the script to really mold together and play off each other with), Farrell and Foxx are great as Crockett and Tubbs. They look the parts, and despite not really showing any emotion, their acting is great. You can tell they are trying to break free of the one dimension that Mann wrote their parts in, and their finesse helps heal some of the wounds the film has. Unfortunately, everyone else is forced to stay one dimensional. Gong Li, the best thing about Memoirs of a Geisha, is basically muddled down into being Farrell's sex toy. She has a fairly important role but just cannot act her way out of the superfluous dialogue that befalls her. And even then, she spends more time having sex with Farrell, then she does concentrating on her role. Henley and Hinds are barely used and feel like complete wastes, as does Foxx's love interest played by Naomie Harris. All three of them have what it takes, but feel almost cut out of the story, save for the final third where Henley and Harris finally really show up. John Ortiz also falls into this boat, only he is used fairly often, but spends more time trying to break free of stereotypes than he does making his character a menacing villain. The rest of the supporting cast have roles that are so minuscule that they almost are not even worth bothering to mention.As a minor nit-pick, I was disappointed to not hear Jan Hammer's signature Miami Vice theme song. A rock cover of Phil Collins' ""In the Air Tonight"" just did not feel like an appropriate replacement.In the end, the film is a mixed bag. Even with the problems it has, it is engrossing and undoubtedly entertaining. It has great visuals, and great performances from Farrell and Foxx. A bit of work on the script and making the characters more fully dimensional could have made this film flawless. Just do not go in thinking this is going to be anything like the Vice of 1986. If you do, then you will probably enjoy it even less.8/10.",Miami Vice
70,Antagonisten,Better than expected,6,26 February 2007,"I remember watching the original ""Miami Vice""-series when i was little. It was about the coolest thing i had ever seen. Loads of action, fast cars and (at least by my 8-year old standards) good-looking women. So deciding whether or not to watch this movie was difficult, since the present can never compete with memories.First of all, i can say that i actually quite liked this movie. I didn't really expect to like it. Colin Farrell seems to be losing his grip more and more every day and Jamie Foxx is in my opinion a vastly over-rated actor. And while Farrell has the whole Sonny Crockett-look, Foxx is nothing like the Tubbs i remember. Of course focus is not on the less action-filled aspects of the original series, but rather on the more action-oriented police-part of the show. And i guess that's a given considering the limited time the movie has at it's disposal.The strongest point in the movie i felt was Michael Manns direction. There are several reasons i enjoy his work, but mostly it's a question of atmosphere. And in that department his fingertips have just become more and more sensitive in the last few years. Both ""Collateral"" and now ""Miami Vice"" have a distinct atmosphere to them that i like. The visuals are beautiful in both movies, a warm and calm L.A. in ""Collateral"" and a sweaty neon-soaked Miami in ""Miami Vice"".The weakest point on the other hand was undoubtedly the script. The movie is a solid product, but not a very exciting one. While one could expect a standard Miami Vice-plot including either guns or drugs (usually both) being taken into the US, it could have been done with a lot more finesse. Now it's just more or less a backdrop on which different elements (for instance action scenes, love scenes and general Miami Vice-vibes) have been tacked on. The blandness of the story is somewhat diminished by charismatic villains and visual accomplishment, but it leaves a rather empty feeling once the movie is over.I guess my verdict is quite positive but with a few complaints. It wasn't awful and it didn't ruin my memory of the original series. It had several of the elements that made Miami Vice enjoyable. For instance the fast cars, beautiful women and action-scenes. And most of all it managed to get the atmosphere just right, the neon-soaked warm nights in Miami. What i missed most, aside from a better script, was a decent Tubbs-character. I remember him as the man who had been undercover in the same city for a LONG time, and yet walked into bars posing as an out-of-town drug-buyer, with a Jamaican accent as his only disguise... That is indeed something that is hard to beat.I rate this 6/10.",Miami Vice
71,LazySod,A complete waste of celluloid,2,22 August 2006,"A long long time ago there was a TV series called Miami Vice. It featured two cops, teaming up together to fight crime. Each and every single episode of the series had about the same content and it wasn't half bad. In current time, filmmakers find more and more reasons to turn old TV series into films, and more often than not that turns out to be a bad choice. This is no different for Miami Vice. While the series was nice to watch, the film was not.Where to start? Nudity that doesn't bring anything extra to the film but the bits of flesh? A story that has nothing to offer that hasn't been offered in at least two dozen of similar action thrillers? Bland characters that bring their lines almost statically? It is the combination of all of the above that made the film almost unbearable for me. It doesn't happen often, but this was one of the times I was glad the film was over so that I could leave the cinema and go watch something more interesting instead.There is a good thing to say for the series: this film has absolutely nothing to do with it, except for the name and the names of the two lead characters. So I can't hold it against the makers of the series that this film turned out to be such a waste of celluloid.2 out of 10 cops with an attitude.",Miami Vice
72,suspiria10,S10 Reviews: Miami Vice (2006),8,28 July 2006,"Michael Mann returns again to his old 80's stomping grounds with a big screen adaptation of the hit show. Gone are the pastel patrol headed up by Don Johnson in the NBC show. Enter a grittier, modern version and bring in the new Crockett (Farrell) and Tubbs (Tubbs). They're still doing their thing for Miami Dade and get sucked into finding a mole responsible for blowing a Federal case. As they get deeper down the rabbit hole they break into a serious drug syndicate and when Crockett falls for the organization money manager (Li) it really hits the fan.Mann was right to tackle this one from a more modern angle. A straight forward adaptation of the series just would have never floated. Shot in high definition the film looks stunning. Most of the action occurs at night and Mann just knows how to block his shots in interesting and enticing ways. His frenetic action sequences are like a ballet with bullets kissing the sky. The look is truly excellent stuff and a visual feast. I can't wait to see this one in HD. Mann once again stacks the musical aspect of the film from salsa to hip hop, a little metal to the wicked cover of Phil Collins 'In the Air Tonight'. I did have reservations when I had heard Farrell and Fox were selected for the coveted leads. I'm not very fond of either but Mann kept them focused and they actually did an excellent job. I was surprised.In short if you are a fan of the show I'd think you'd like it. If you're a Mann fan and have a hankering for a little 'Heat' meets 'Collateral' with a little 'Manhunter' chaser then I think you'll enjoy it too.",Miami Vice
73,rubenm,Definitely not worth seeing,2,19 August 2006,"Shady drug deals. Tough undercover cops. Powerful drug lords. Gangs double-crossing each other. Meetings on dark industrial wasteland. And the final shootout where all the bad guys get plastered against the wall but the cops survive miraculously. We've seen it all before. I hoped that Miami Vice would steer away from the clichés. It doesn't. I went to see the move because of Michael Mann, who clearly is capable of making non-cliché movies like Heat and Collateral. Unfortunately, this one has nothing that stands out. A predictably complicated script, incredibly bad acting and some lifeless sex scenes, that's it. Definitely not worth seeing.",Miami Vice
74,MichaelMargetis,Michael Mann's 'Jersey Girl',4,2 October 2006,"""We get down if the play calls for it bud."" - Detective James 'Sonny' CrockettOne thing I can definitely say is one of the best directors working in Hollywood today is Michael Mann. From last year's hit 'Collateral' to the bone-chilling 'The Insider', Mann seems to never miss. Well, except, he created this television show in the 80s. A cop show with Don Johnson. Now, I know what you are thinking 'Neat! Gritty cop show, just like The Shield'. And you are wrong. 'Miami Vice', the show, was cheesy, campy and one of the worst shows to ever see television. I had high hopes for the movie version knowing how talented director Michael Mann is. I thought it would be a lot better and cooler than the lame television show, but guess what -- it wasn't. The R-rated movie version is just as campy and stupid as the series it just has some graphic violence, sex and foul language in it. Although Michael Mann does a good enough job directing this, the acting is terrible. Colin Farrell, whose quickly becoming the next Tom Cruise a.k.a. the most overrated actor in Hollywood, really bombs in his role here. He's a real tough cop with a scrubby beard whose supposed to look all sexy and bad-ass, but if you ask me he just looked like he was homeless or something. Jamie Foxx who delivered exceptional performances in both 'Ray' and 'Collateral' two years back, really phones in his performance, but still manages to be better than Farrell. Gong Li, whose work I was impressed with in last year's Memoirs of a Geisha and 2046 (a wonderful little Chinese film), is flat in this too. The only really good performance out of the bunch is Ciarin Hinds (Munich, HBO's Rome) who plays an F.B.I. agent. Too bad he's in the film for about five minutes total, I guess director Michael Mann didn't want him in the movie too much because he'd make the rest of the cast look REALLY bad by comparison. Along with the acting, the screenplay is also a mess with corny dialogue that's almost too embarrassing to listen. In one scene just before a huge action sequence, Jamie Foxx says to his former cops for inspiration 'Let's take it to the limit one more time'. Funny, I thought that was an Eagle's lyric. On the positive side, 'Miami Vice' is nicely filmed and has a few great action sequences. You noticed I said a few. For a so-called action movie, 'Miami Vice' has very few scenes of action. It's mostly dialogue and ""character development."" Know, don't get me wrong. I have no problem with character development, in some cases I love it, it's very important -- if the characters are interesting. In the film 'Miami Vice' the characters are about as interesting as having Ben Stein as your Quantum Physics teacher. And the dialogue is terrible. In conclusion, don't see 'Miami Vice'. Wait for DVD and only watch the action sequences, then return the DVD to blockbuster. If you watch any of the ""character development"" scenes, there is a strong risk you may become mentally retarded or incredibly boring. 'Miami Vice' disappointed the crap out of me. Grade: C (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, 7/28/06, Phoenix, Arizona.)my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces).",Miami Vice
75,PyroSikTh,Miami What?,6,30 August 2009,"I give this film a measly 6 out of 10.I gave it higher than a 5 because the direction was tight, the action was brutally fantastic, the atmosphere was dark and unnerving, Nazi enemies were shockingly scary, soundtrack was relatively memorable, imagery was awe-inspiring in places and realism was about as spot as ever.I gave it less than a 7 because the characters were underdeveloped, chemistry was lacking, dialogue was ""blah blah blah percentage blah blah blah load blah blah blah partners"", plot was average in a seen-it-all-before kind of way and it was probably a bit too long for what it was.You almost feel absolutely nothing for the characters. This rarely happens to me as I'm usually a fairly over-empathetic person when it comes to characters in films, but because of the droning dialogue that tried to be intelligent and profound but failed, it all fell flat on the floor. They looked badass, they acted badass, they were pure badass, and that's not a bad thing. The bad thing was that they spoke as if they were trying to be badass.This film was great at the start, keeping your heart beating, your eyes feasting, and your ears pricked. It plummeted for the next hour or so when it was boring, droning talking after boring droning talking after boring, droning talking. It's almost as if no-one actually did anything for an hour or so, they merely talked about doing it. There was love, some deception, some negotiating, but how they fell in love so easily, who was playing who, and what they were negotiating is beyond me. Maybe I was just that tired, but the dialogue went straight over my head in the middle slump. Then one of the characters' lovers gets kidnapped by the now missed Nazi's, and the film raises back up into the realms of enjoyable. The talking suddenly got snappier, made more sense, had more emotion and lifted the tension.Watch the first half an hour and enjoy the action, enjoy the talking. Once the FBI operator leaves the scene on the car park rooftop, fast forward until you see the big, muscled, bearded Nazi's abducting a woman and enjoy once more the action, dialogue, tension and atmosphere.",Miami Vice
76,richieandsam,Not good... such a shame from a great cast and director.,5,27 July 2013,"Miami VICEBlimey... this film was dull.I am normally a fan of Michael Mann, but he failed on this one.The film is based on an old TV show of the same name. 2 detectives go undercover to arrest a gang of drug smugglers and dealers.The story was average... but nothing I have not seen before. It's just a shame that it just dragged it's heels all the way through. There were some good scenes in it, but to get to those scenes there was a lot of nothing. The one thing Michael Mann can do is direct a great gun fight. Heat has the greatest gun fight I have ever seen in a movie. This also has a very good gun fight at the end of the movie, but not as intense as in Heat. There were some very good action scenes which were fun to see too, just not enough. There were also a few great action scenes... but the love scenes were awful. The cast just looked very uncomfortable and it just didn't feel like they were lovers.The casting was a big mistake. The movie stars Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx. Jamie was a great choice. He is a great actor in most films he has starred in and he does a great job in this too, unfortunately it was not enough for him to carry the whole movie. Colin was terrible. He looked bad and acted worst. Like Jamie, Colin has made some good movies in the past, but he murdered this one. It just felt like there was no chemistry between Jamie and Colin. They did not suit each other.It is a shame that this film was bad because it had almost everything to make it good... good cast and a good director, but it just failed at the final hurdle.I don't really have much else to say about it.I will give this film 5 out of 10.""I'm a disco guy""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Miami Vice

Well my opinion has not changed, I could have missed it with it being no great loss. Jamie Fox as Tubbs and Colin Farrell as Crockett gave good performances and that is all that I can say about this movie. It is just another shoot em up, blow em up movie that uses these sequences instead of the writers creating a good story line.

78,Offworld_Colony,Nothing Michael Mann does is by accident.,9,18 February 2020,"And so Miami Vice, much more an experience of multiple textures and incinuations than a straight movie, is rife with intentional and carefully manicured accidents.A ruthless efficiency of plot and dialogue is at work here, a glance at the script, written by Mann, versus what has made it to screen, shows a clear paring down and distilling so that just the potent vapour remains. This also means that when a shot lingers or an offbeat moment occurs it's made more pointed; if nothing is an accident from Mann, master filmmaker and a perfectionist, then when a line of dialogue with the car noise so loud you can hardly hear it, and instead you end up looking at the actor's face instead and it speaks volumes louder, it makes for a painterly movie; something on a standard canvas but with bits of twig or curtain stuck on to it or sea salt mixed in the with blue paint. Only this way, Mann paints his movie with the jarring iconography of a sports car, or a beautiful Chinese actress amidst the Colombian cartel, or Farrell's out-of-time moustache, or the absolute calmness and stillness of his leads in the wake of so much bedlam.Miami Vice's opening drops you straight in like it's the two-part finale to a TV series. It has the urgency, brevity and supposed audience trust that a long-running show would have. And in many ways it's right to do so; Mann uses the themes, plots and locations in broad sweeping arcs to paint us into a narrative we've seen before only to deliver it to us in a new way. It's like a ballet adaptation of The Wire or Swan Lake the graphic novel, it's something we know well done over anew. And Mann's full-tilt-digital approach is the biggest tool he uses, the beautiful, dangerous night photography, where you can practically feel that muggy heat, it's hard to overstate how shockingly unique and immediate the film felt at the time.In fact, Miami Vice has been the single greatest cinematic experience I've ever had. The film is flawed, the way any great experimental masterpiece is, but when I sat in that cinema the first time with its abrupt beginning and abrupt end, I felt truly transported. Or rather enveloped. I wasn't moved by the story or the characters, but by the absolute bravura filmmaking quality, the film as a whole, in a way that I've only ever been drawn in and hypnotised by a few paintings I've seen in a few art galleries.It's cool without being uber masculine. Epic without being cheesy. Despite the fast cars and the personal stakes, it is the antithesis of Bad Boys 2; Seldom do we see a sex scene stop and then turn on to another one at the right time for the couple. Few moments in any film come close to the moment Alonso looks over them and their faces, sad but detached, and how culpable and responsible they are for the death of his loved ones, and so he looks to the flowing ribbons on the freeway and cuts himself to pieces on the front of a truck. Disturbing and sorrowful and inevitable. A beat, later on, during a meeting and Sonny looks out to the sea as if prophesizing one of his possible futures. The water a mirror for his aching loneliness, when he does shack up with his equal and opposite, it doesn't seem so dangerous and so odd, as much as it feels necessary and natural.Before this film I'd never seen a gunfight that felt as if I was there. An ahead of its time kineticism pervades each encounter that makes it feel comfortably videogamey, that stealth sequence at the trailer park is a thing of beauty. Instead of shouty men that act out and smash things, the men here are professionals, they have his girl, just like pros, they plan, they prep, they act, they get her back. They know they can get her back if they work hard and they're smart. Although leaving her in the building is a little stupid and contrived.There are other glaring flaws. Gong Li for one. But like many paintings rated for their quality, or like a jewel of merit, it's their flaws that make it special. While Gong Li's sports a thick accent and phonetically learned English lines, her scared, overwhelmed face portrays and betrays a vulnerability, a cuteness and sweetness. It's believable that she may have been the wrong girl at the right time and made a life for herself somewhere where she maybe shouldn't have ever been.Miami Vice is a movie made for the night. It's a movie with an ending, the simplicity of which was lost on me the first few times, it's a movie about love and connection. Before Sonny sends Isabella away the camera shows us the empty bed, the place they would reside in, in another life. Or maybe it's a promise of the life they will have when all this has passed. The camera drifts the door and outside Sonny sends his love away, across the sea, and he once again feels the feeling he did at the start of the movie. But he's not in despair because of the love for his partner and his partner's love for his girlfriend. The purpose that binds them all together. Not many action buddy cop movies about drug traffickers lets the bad guy go free and ends the film with a man walking in to a hospital to support his friend.Miami vice will, instead of an explanation, use a look. It uses the lexicon of cinema to shortcut us past the cliché and to the moment. We construct it in our heads and feel smarter than if it is shown. And in that way, it is much more a symbolist painting, something in three dimensions and Michael Mann's magnum opus, than yet another simple reboot of an old TV show.",Miami Vice
79,ethanbresnett,"Bland, messy and boring.",4,29 August 2020,"I saw Colin Farrell and Jaime Foxx and didn't think twice about watching this. After a few minutes and realising there was a supporting cast of Naomie Harris, Justin Theroux etc I was even more buoyed. But by god was this a let down.The plot was very convoluted, messy, choppy and just a bit boring in truth. It was all over the place and just didn't work for me at all. This wasn't helped by the largely incomprehensible dialogue. There was no diction at all going on in this film which was very bizarre. I just don't understand what was going on here. Although the dialogue I could make out was bland, laboured and cliqued so maybe this was a blessing in disguise!In addition to the lacklustre plot, I had absolutely no interest at all in the characters, who had very few interesting or redeeming features. Even the villains of the film were resoundingly dull and uninspiring. Colin Farrell and Jaime Foxx were pretty bad in this film, which is so surprising considered they are both great actors, each with some exceptional films and performances under their belts. Nothing in this film got me excited or piqued my interest, which is very rare let me tell you. I can usually find something to get me going in a film, but Miami Vice had nothing.Miami Vice is definitely one of the worst films I've seen in the last few years, which makes it all the more surprising to me to learn that it is considered a cult classic in some quarters! In my opinion this film is to be avoided at all costs, but clearly some people like it, so maybe you will too.",Miami Vice
80,moviemanMA,Welcome to Miami,5,30 July 2006,"Michael Mann has created some of cinema's most famous fight scenes in the last 15 years. The notorious Heat showdown, the last hurrah in The Last of the Mohican's, and even recreated some of Muhammad Ali's greatest fights. His use of sound, color, and gorilla style camera work have given him an unmistakable watermark in his films.The man behind the hit 80's television show Miami Vice has had much success on the screen and with his classic detective drama. One would think that he has the right to bring his ""baby"" to the screen and introduce Sonny and Rico to a new audience as well as pleasing the first.We find our duo scoping out a Miami night club waiting to lay down the law on some low life when out of the blue comes a call from a past associate who appears to have lost it. The man who helped the FBI in a sting has cracked. He spilled all the information in compliance to the opposition so his family would be saved. When the sting goes down, hell breaks loose. Sonny and Rico (Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx) are brought in to clean up where the FBI have left off.The two are dealt into a drug smuggling underworld with some powerful individuals and the stakes are high. Millions of dollars are on the line as well as their lives. Do they panic? Of course not. As far as the dealers are concerned, they are the real deal, ready to assist in the transportation of their drugs. When Sonny becomes too involved with the wife of the man they are working for, it seems like the whole operation is about to be busted wide open.All the flashy cars and loud guns cannot save Miami Vice in the theatrical version. The film has intense shootouts, fast cars, ""go fast"" boats, and passionate love scenes. The acting however is not by any means as good as the film looks. Too many clichés and overused sayings are the fault of Miami Vice. Foxx and Farrell are a nice pair, although Farrell could have been a little more enthusiastic. The supporting cast was sub-par at best.Mann didn't make an abomination. Vice certainly has its moments. The final showdown is very entertaining. Like I said, a lot of loud guns and shiny cars. That is not a bad thing. Mann also uses a lot of colors in this film, specifically neon lights and streetlights. He gives Miami this nighttime splendor that makes it look like the city is never asleep, like a night club. When Sonny and Rico are flying the drugs to the drop-off, Mann has some excellent aerial shots showing how fast the planes are actually going, rather than the standard ""stay next to the plane"" shot.Miami Vice will please the action/adventure side in all of us. The violence and adult themes make it very different from what was originally aired on the TV show. Farrell and Foxx are fun to watch, especially with their great facial hair. It has that Collateral feel with a Miami Vice flair.",Miami Vice
81,Flagrant-Baronessa,Glossy surface is scratched and poked by faulty substance.,5,12 November 2006,"Michael Mann loses his crime niche and clumsily stumbles and botches his way through a generic action thriller. I think it is clear what he is trying to do here with the gritty and realistic approach, but to quote Depeche Mode, ""it's no good."" Miami Vice proves a rigorous exercise in style over substance that will date badly because it is so contemporary. There is a scene that illustrates what I mean: the nightclub opening scene that regrettably becomes a pastiche of a sweaty Nelly music video with a pumping beat and scantily-clad tanned women.Indeed very little stays true to the original series, for which Michael Mann was a producer. The plot outline seems to remain most faithful as Crockett and Tubbs are forced to go undercover for the FBI to expose a botched Miami drug-hit and become increasingly entangled in the corrupt underworld where the lines between cop and villain are dangerously blurred. The story attempts a fairly performance-driven approach, as is arguably Mann's strength, but owing to the uninteresting characters and flat actors it suffers immensely. After all, it is difficult to take Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx seriously when that comes out of their mouths is shameless plot-fodder and the former gets involved with that-one-woman-he-can't-have (Gong Li).But let us talk about the style of Miami Vice. Stripping the pastel-coloured TV series of everything that made it fun in the first place  high hair, hammy technology, glammy score, tequila sunrises and showy pink suits  to pave way for sleek high-tech gadgets á la 21st century renders the film a grayish run-of-the-mill action thriller, Collateral style. Mann wields inexplicably grainy and unfocused cinematography, aiming for a look that is a muddy gray haze of digital pixels all in the name of documentary-style. The prevalence of stylistic and over-the-top gritty brutality undoubtedly offers some entertainment along the way but in the end the novelty wears off.Yet there are many things that remain solid in the film and one can hardly complain about the explosions, fast-paced chases, hot cars and boats (in particular there is a vivid boat scene with Farrell and Li gliding on the ways with Moby playing in the background), exotic islands and women and fun sex scenes. Miami Vice offers plenty of moments to soak up the hot Miami atmosphere  although not nearly as effectively as the TV series did  even a few moments too many when the film endlessly stretches across a whopping 2h 12m. Yes, a little editing would have been nice but given circumstances in which Mann threw the stuff together in the end, it's not bad.I was never a member of the Michael Mann camp and I even thought Collateral was a below average film. For me Miami Vice cements the downspiral of his career, especially when the former dynamics of his cat-and-mouse games are gone and now feel more like dutiful inclusions than anything else. 'Miami Vice' is not an unwatchable film at all but it is utterly charmless and feels sloppy at times. It also proves a polarizing force  indeed it would appear as though many detractors are mere bandwagon riders while supporters give it high grades ""because it's Michael Mann"" (seriously, I've read professional magazine reviews citing that). So let's just agree that this is a distinctly mediocre film. 5 out of 10",Miami Vice
82,willcundallreview,Underwhelming return to the Miami crime scene,5,31 May 2015,"Rating-5/10Miami Vice, the name conjures up fast cars and the 1980's, but this movie creates very different ideas. Yes Michael Mann(famous for ""Heat"" and ""Ali"" etc) makes a crime movie that really does pay, and not very well on that point. It's the kind of movie where intense listening is needed and maybe a very big liking for police movies or crime, because this is one film that really doesn't show either for me, in a well made way.The plot is big and full of things going on at once, this is both it's positives and it's negatives in one, on one hand we have good action and exciting things, on the flip side we have boring dialogue and romance that really gives this movie nothing extra. I feel Mann is not always to blame here for what I felt was an under average movie, but he does direct it in a way which means it is not only un-exciting, but also just not a watch that is needed.Mann writes this as well and although our main actors Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx deliver the lines well enough, it becomes almost too much of a jumble. On to the acting itself and it isn't bad, it is well cast and doesn't shy away from picking names we may not know, but my main problem was with the way it sounds. The actors voices are so low and the accents so incoherent it is hard not to have to strain your ears to know what is going on, they do well most of the cast but what they say at times is a complete mystery.Now the film is beautifully shot, the cinematography for me all in all is the very best thing about this, it makes it not only real but also gives it a feeling as if you are there yourself. Dion Beebe is the mastermind behind this and if you haven't seen it, then notice while watching how it feels more like some sort of documentary than actual film, but that style really pays off. And what of the area they shot in, well it is pretty glamorous at times, I mean what do you expect from drug kingpins boats to the beautiful city of Miami, the film is well located and the scene shots can be breathtaking.Is it like it's basis, the 1980's show Miami Vice? ,not at all in fact it couldn't at times feel more opposite. It is much darker, and that is in tone and themes, the dark underbelly of Miami remains, but the city never looked so ugly when Mann wants it to be. I felt that the movie in a way doesn't hark back to the memories so many fans have, yes it has it's cars and boats, guns etc but not the beautiful scores that the TV show had, not to mention the actual connection people had with the characters, which just doesn't come though here. If you want good crime movies with smart plots and good action too, I won't say don't give this a watch, but just find something else first because this can and I guarantee for some is a real snooze. The plot as I said is thick with things going on, but there's the problem it is too full and you can easily be lost in the way things are going. The main two characters Crockett and Tubbs have no real bond and in truth spend too much time not together in this movie.Overall it's not a movie for all, maybe for some, but probably won't please fans of the TV series. I felt it was as mentioned under average and I felt that because not only have we seen things like this before, Mann can't even make this a good kind of seen before and his attempt at remaking this just becomes not bad, but too near to being poor to be acceptable.",Miami Vice
83,wrlang,Crockett and Tubbs are back,7,26 August 2006,"Miami Vice (2006) is a good remake of the popular 80s TV series. It has some modern twists that make it better than just an average crime/action/drama. Crockett (Farrell) and Tubbs (Foxx) come back to try and nab a drug smuggling crime boss. A good screenplay keeps the film interesting and the action adds to the enjoyment. Two unique scenes were the gun fight near the end of the film and the kill scene near the beginning. Very nice sound effects that were more realistic than anything I've heard before. The plot was like many other crime dramas, so there's not much new there, but the acting was very good. Bring in some nice cars, boats, planes, and other accoutrements, and you have Miami Vice. Enjoy it.",Miami Vice
84,iamjamalwhite,shallow and forgettable,5,15 July 2020,"I remember the Ferrari bumping the muffler against a bump on a bridge during a night scene, threw sparks everywhere as the music cranked. That is what is forgettable about this 90 minute failure to revive one of the best TV shows ever made. After this film, both stars when into rehab, turns out they were doing loads of coke the whole way through. Michael Mann is still one of the best directors of our time. He only needs a good script!",Miami Vice
85,daniel-mannouch,An unfocused mess that simply does your head in.,5,30 March 2020,"Michael Mann updated the TV show that saw him through most of the eighties with disappointing results. Though the film has many positives, such as being one of the first major studio films to use digital video and Mann's trademark attention to detail, the overall film feels very messy and that's probably down to the constant script rewrites done by Mann himself. Michael Mann films since the very beginning have been densely plotted and if this hot take by crew members is to be believed, then Mann seemingly was trying to combat a big budget production with TV serial methods and what that gave us was undefined characters and a serious case of information overload.Other factors might have been at play. Jamie Foxx apparently caused some issues and also shooting a film underneath three hurricanes comes with it's own problems. But, you know, even without all these issues, i would feel that Miami Vice '06 would still struggle for consistency as even the best televisual adaptations have problems with condensing the source material. This reboot would have definitely worked better staying as a TV show.As for where it stands in Michael Mann's filmography, I feel that Miami Vice '06 is the nadir of his artistic artlessness and had not stood the test of time. Fourteen years ago, this might have had an interesting look, but certain scenes just look like they came from a Youtube Premium film, and what's worse, you can say that for even some the acting.All in all, I saw Miami Vice '06 as just one huge motion blur of varying resolutions. It is definitely one of Michael Mann's lesser films and is an experience so cluttered with visual noise, it becomes overwhelming in the worst way.",Miami Vice
86,dead47548,Really took me by surprise.,10,8 January 2008,"Wow, what a surprisingly impressive work. It is a completely visceral and unbelievably engaging piece that I couldn't bear to turn my eyes away throughout the entire duration. No action/crime drama can possibly compare to this one in terms of it's brutal and unflinching realism. Everything is portrayed so beautifully and authentically that I couldn't help but be overwhelmingly impressed. A lot of this realism comes from camera-work that Mann uses which is some of the best of the decade. I can't see how someone would call it a flaw or less than sensational in any way. Even the gunshots and wounds increase the immense realism of the picture.Mann never lets up on his quest for the most authentic work, and it certainly shows in this. I hear a lot of people complain about the story being too complicated, but I didn't find it to be this way at all. Yes, it is very intricate and detailed but if you pay strict attention than it is quite easy to be completely up to date on everything that is happening. The performances are all fantastic and no one fails to impress, though Farrell's accent felt really out of place from time to time. Overall it was a film that I found to be incredibly engaging and beautifully done. The soundtrack added to the complete experience that it came to be, and really made the film feel slick and wonderfully stylish. I loved it. Easily one of the best of 2006.",Miami Vice

Michael Mann, the show's producer, directed this mess about a multi-agency undercover operation gone horribly awry. Crockett and Tubbs are sent deep into the drug trafficking game, and what follows feels like a throwaway 80's movie complete with an upbeat soundtrack, sterile sex scenes, and mindless action. Colin Ferrill's dull performance and bad hair day make Crockett originator Don Johnson look uber-skilled, Jamie Foxx needs to give his Oscar back, and Michael Mann has delivered better work in the past.

88,charchuk,"Stunning to watch, but not to follow",9,1 March 2007,"Very stylish and compelling crime drama, with small but effective amounts of action. The story, not the characters or the visuals, is the clear centrepoint of the film, and it's interesting enough to involve me, at least, during slow parts in the film. Though the pace is very deliberate and slow, the film never drags or feels boring, and it makes it the fantastic finale even better. Unfortunately, the characters aren't well-developed at all, and thus their relationships - especially between Farrell and Gong Li - don't feel natural and, ultimately, take away from the central plot. All is redeemed, however, by the stunning direction, especially during the final firefight - just some fantastic cinematography.

They could have just as easily called this movie anything- the link to being Miami vice is thin at best.Camera is held shakily for some scenes for that indie feel- another retarded swipe by Hollywood- hey Hollywood what we like about the indie films is not the camera shake but the plot and the content!! Idiots.The acting is about as abysmal and unconvincing and usually just downright annoying as it comes. Supporting roles are horribly cast and acted woodenly and calling this an amateurish train wreck of Hollywood action retardation would be about right.PLOT: Two people posing as Miami vice legends try to cash in on the brand recognition of the name- they don't deliver the goods and you will want to slap them by the end of the movie. Our daring duo needs to investigate a super criminal- prostitution, drugs, guns, you name it- he's in it at a super high level- our daring duo to the rescue- absolutely the worst acting ever.",Miami Vice

Trying to infiltrate this drug cartel, they start business with Isabella, who is connected with people higher up the chain. It's a simple premise, yet the confusing thing is for a simple plot, why the hell was this entire film so confusing.Continuing the trend on television remakes, Miami Vice has a lot of promise riding on it with director Michael Mann behind the helm. Revamping the series Mann produced, Miami Vice is brought to the modern day, yet retaining that eighties fashion style. The pastels come out thick and everywhere, with greased back hair and sleazy facial hair.All the main ingredients of Miami Vice are winning elements; hedonistic machismo, drug cartels, fast cars and boats, beautiful women. Yes we have seen it all before, but there's the problem; WE HAVE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE. With great films Collateral and the brilliant Heat, Michael Mann has ability to create captivating crime capers, juggling multiple stories lines, but something is off here. The story is just so convoluted and right from the get go, it's hard to wonder what is going on. Yet with those winning elements, Mann does stage some well executed confrontations, but they're nothing more of eye brow raising stimulant while cupping your head. Using the same grainy visual from high definition camera as Collateral, the chaotic camera work becomes irritating at times during the action scenes; it's hard to see whats happening and who's shooting at who.Wasted talent is the best description of the actors. Colin Farrell has shown he has great abilities; with great performances in Tigerland, Phone Booth and A Home at the End of the World, but he's so boring and uncharismatic. Not even his sleazy moustache gives him some campy charm. Winning a best actor at the Oscars, Jamie Foxx doesn't show any sign of that winning acting. Gong Li is sorely wasted talent, yet also feels ill casted.You think that the director of Heat would make a caper around the same caliber, though Miami Vice falls with a lot of the other television remakes.",Miami Vice

No. However, it does capture the ""vice"" in Vice City - aka Miami.It was a nice touch to include the Chinese actress Gong Li. I never quite got why she was involved. There was drugs being shipped on a Malaysian transport ship and there were a couple of references to Hong Kong, but nothing strong. Plus she mentioned her brother was in Havana, but he looked Cuban-esquire to me and not Chinese.Despite that, the action was good. A good story and kind of a heart breaker at the end. The story, again. fails to say why she had to go back to Havana and he could not follow.Overall, its a nicely done work. Foxx, Farrell, and Li do a nice job.

When Crockett and Tubbs call it in,They find the man's family dead. They also find the man was working with the D.E.A and that potential agents working undercover are now in danger of being ousted. So the D.E.A asks Crockett and Tubbs to work for the D.E.A to help bring them down. The New Drug-lord is smart he hides and gets others including Isabella to do his work for him.

Too bad a double agent working against them reveals their true I.D.'s and the drug-lord strikes at the Miami Vice officers thru their families and loved ones. Crockett and Tubbs go down to the wire in a no holds barred gun battle at the end which changes everything for Sonny Crockett and Isabella.Seeing this movie my first thought was it can't be based on the T.V. Show. It is and it isn't I like to prefer to think it's a different Miami Vice that had nothing to do with the series. The Series was a comic book fantasy in some ways. This movie is more gritty and more real life in some ways. Colin Farrell Makes Sonny Crockett his own with a strong portrayal. And Jamie Foxx makes Rico Tubbs a strong streetwise warrior.The Series was flash colours and flashy cars and boats this movie isn't. The series was a great show and a wonderful Classic.

The story was slow and not very interesting. The dialog was terrible and the acting wasn't very good.I have liked Jamie Foxx in all the previous films I've seen him in, but in this film he is stiff. I've never liked Colin Farrell and this film does not make me change my mind about him. He is on screen about twice as long as Foxx and he cannot carry the movie.The photography and the directing are very good. The music is loud and intrusive and pretty annoying.Unlike the television show of the same name, there is absolutely no humor and I don't think anybody smiles in the entire film.

96,come2whereimfrom,Mann delivers again.,8,12 August 2006,"Bang its going down in a club, its hot, its sweaty, its loud and its under surveillance. This is how the film starts straight into a deal gone wrong, bullets and bodies. Anyone who remembers the names Crocket and Tubbs remembers Miami Vice. Here there is no eighties fashion, pet crocodile or cheesy music from the series, Michael Mann's update isn't so much sun, sand and sea as suspense, style and sex with a bit of shooting. OK there is one mullet and a handle bar moustache but we'll come to Colin Farrell later. Jamie Foxx is excellent as ever working with Mann again after Collateral and he steals the show as one half of the crime-fighting duo. Straight into the story of the pair and their team with little or no background and headlong into the films focal undercover operation Mann directs superbly again less mainstream then collateral and rawer like Heat or Narc. The deftness of the shots adding to the emotive tenseness of the situations. Fast cars, faster mouths, guns and girls, it can be slow at times but like the lightning that plagues the background throughout it is the calm before the storm and the ending is as good as the set piece fight was in heat. I think Mann knows how to get the best out of his backgrounds rather than his actors and this is one of the weak points, the cinematography is awesome as expected but Farrell is almost a parody as is one of the baddies who starts to come across like Borat. A little long it may be with a few dodgy songs on the soundtrack but elsewhere it delivers and reminds us that no-one can quiet pull it of like Mann. This is as Collateral was a snap shot of a bigger picture a few days with the vice squad and all that involves. Mullets and misdemeanours aside, Miami Vice serves up a money and drug crazed greed operation and the attempts to foil or protect at any cost, accumulating in a another great piece of cinema from Mann and the gang.",Miami Vice

No character had any real motivation. Just walk into a scene, argue, walk out.There were some interesting cars, but they were shot from a camera car going the same speed - so there was no illusion of speed at all... but they added 10x the sound effects and flames out of the exhaust to get it back again.

But on the other hand, it seems a very big ""pilot"" for a movie that never was. I mean, great work of setting up the world and the characters (Fox and Farrell are quite good), but Im left with the feeling that now I'd like to watch the movie so thoroughly prepared.

People whine and complain about it not being enough like the show and all I can say is, had they replicated the 80's feel of the movie, right down to the pastel colored suits and sockless loafers look, this movie would have been a joke. Mann was going for serious and he achieved it by making the necessary deletions and additions. It reminded me of his earlier Heat, in how it examines the intricacies of life in the cops and crooks game. The film had a voyeuristic feel to it and I think a big part of that was due to the use of HD to film this.I'm recommending the film but reservedly. It may be too heavy for some. People looking for nostalgia will most likely be disappointed and it's a bit slow in spots. There's not really a lot of action but what's there is showstopping. I know this review is kind of up in the air but like I said, it took me a couple of days after watching it to realize that I actually did like it.

100,stormhawk2021,How to envy such a way of life!,2,1 September 2017,"""Miami Vice"" was a successful television series created by Anthony Yerkovich about two undercover detectives working against drug trafficking mafias based in that southeastern US city where they controlled the cocaine that was consumed in the country , while distributing it to various parts of the world. The series was broadcast between 1984 and 1989 in the US, and was also broadcasted in numerous countries of America and Europe, where it always obtained a high rating of tuning. Its executive producer, Michael Mann, who later became a brilliant and astounding filmmaker, with titles such as ""The Last Mohican,"" ""Heat"" and ""Collateral,"" was in charge of directing the film version of this popular series, which the characters of Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs - now played by Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx respectively - have to deal with the fearsome and sophisticated organization that has murdered two federal police and has massacred a whole family.Infiltrating the organization that commands a Latin American capo (identified as Colombian, but with a Cuban accent), the two detectives will see it complicated to finish with the dark smugglers, while Sonny is having a good time with Isabella, the finance chief at the one that has managed to seduce.If I had been able to dispense with the always pleasant and very sober presence of Gong Li - the muse of the excellent Chinese director Zhang Yimou, and replaces the role of Saundra Santiago - I think ""Miami Vice"" would have ended for me shortly before the first hour. The story became meager, monotonous, full of common elements...and the presence of Michael Mann, can hardly be guessed in the scene of action of the port where you can notice an efficient composition, and in that meeting where the romance uncovers its veil and takes the course that corresponds to it.What turned the real art of ""Heat"" and ""Collateral"" into the realm of the seventh art was Mann's ability to sculpt characters who came to life on the scene with their contradictions, their deep emotions, and their ability to connect with them indissolubly. In those films, there was a powerful dramatic breath, art and poetry went through any gaps, and a load of magnificent feelings made us proud of being human.But none of this is possible to find in ""Miami Vice"", and the only thing I can rescue at the story level is that it leaves well re- created the terrible, sad atmosphere in which so many people move.

This one is a good no-brainer.Miami Vice (2006) is based on the TV show about vice detectives Crockett and Tubbs going undercover to bring down a huge Cuban drug lord. Take ""based on"" seriously, because this is what this film is: based on the TV show.This film borrows the TV show's characters to build a nice straightforward story. So straightforward that the film might look like one special episode from your favorite police series, like CSI Miami or Law and Order. You don't have to think too much in this movie. There are no intricate plot twists or complex plotlines going on. Miami Vice (2006) just tells a very linear story.I don't know why sometimes between frames it seems they are using one very low-tech camera. The overall camera quality seems acceptable for the time, but one or two segments seem to come from an older camera than the rest of the film. It could be some cool film technique or anything, but I don't understand any of that.I enjoyed most of my time with this film, but I think it could be shortened a tiny bit.Overall, recommendable if you like action films with simple plots.",Miami Vice
102,shadowman123,Should not believe what everyone says...,6,26 December 2006,"Miami Vice was shown on TV when I was a little kid in the 80's however from what others have told me was that it was a great show but however the thing is that Micheal Mann's modern day take on it has not really done it a great deal of justice to the show. If you ask me the stylish settings , snappy clothes and urban portrait of the high life of Miami was good but to be honest thats all we ever get to see . I mean Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx done a good job but I felt that these actors were some what very under used and the they had to work with what they had as they dive into the world dirty world of narc's. Also another thing was that I felt it just dragged on a little too painfully in some places and I did have trouble fixing my eyes on the screen to pay attention to it . There was not much of a story to it either which would probably explain why the script was well...crap to be honest, even the new Ferrari could not save this film and trust me I love my Ferrari's and the hope of being able to watch that thing of beauty might of changed my mind but looked liked that was not going to happen (Jerry Bruckheimer made much more use of the Ferrari 360 Modena in Bad Boys 2).In my opinion Miami Vice is too much fabric and not enough flesh , I do was expecting much better! I would generally say avoid but check it out if nothing else good is on TV.Miami VICE 6.5 OUT 10 FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOODNITE AND GOOD LUCK !",Miami Vice
103,Bruce722,Was of the best films ever.,10,13 November 2013,"Miami Vice is hands down one of my favorite films of all time. I don't quite understand why it was never received well but I think it's just amazing. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are both great, as well are the rest of the supporting cast, Michael Mann did an incredible job directing the movie, the plot develops well and is very interesting, the action scenes are done brilliantly, etc. Honestly, I don't think there's a single flaw in the movie. It's definitely different, so I guess some people expected something else. It's not your typical action flick, that's for sure. It's almost more of an action-thriller in how it's filmed and presented to the viewer. The shaky cam and camera angles and effects work when used because of the overall feel. I'm not saying everyone will love it because it is a bit slower and replaces dialogue with introspection from the actors forcing the audience to pick up on the subtleties and nuances of the plot's development. Those things aren't in your face so some people might get bored with it. Not me. I thought it was great.",Miami Vice
104,roland-104,Shamelessly superficial action flick makes you long for the TV series to restart,5,28 January 2007,"In this bloated, interminable techno-testosteronic (rhymes with moronic) action flick, Miami vice detectives Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell in the role made famous on TV by Don Johnson) and Rico Tubbs (Jamie Foxx, standing in for Philip Michael Thomas) can do anything that Batman or Sean Connery could ever do: look lethal force in the face on a daily basis, race gigantic power boats and sports cars, fly jet airplanes, and even bed Gong Li.Michael Mann could have made a better film than this, for sure. After all, he was the Executive Producer of 110 episodes of the justifiably popular TV series (1984-1990), and more recently directed a very good docudrama, ""The Insider"" (1999). But for ""Vice,"" Mann, who also wrote the screenplay, apparently succumbed to the belief - probably true - that today's mainstream audiences want escapist visual spectacle, lots of automatic weaponry, plenty of xenophobic slurs against Hispanics, Russians and other demographic outliers, and, of course, legions of sexy women.Leave any hopes you might have for character development at the popcorn stand, unless you count Foxx's frowns and Feral's, wooops, I mean Farrell's silent little absence spells as signals of depth. The film basically plays like a comic strip.There's little point in reviewing the plot, which is easy to follow in principle and impossible to follow in detail, since none of the players has the least notion of delivering lines with detectable diction. Thank Heavens for the few passages requiring subtitles. It's about drug cartels and rival gangs and big bucks and stuff like that. With a supporting cast the size of Philadelphia.

105,TheMovieMark,Check your preconceived notions at the door,7,28 July 2006,"Dark. Gritty. Delivers a punch straight to the gut. All words and phrases to describe my mom's coffee. But they also accurately describe Michael Mann's Miami Vice.I know what you're thinking - ""Oh great, another cheesy movie based on an old TV series. Yippee!"" I thought the exact same thing when I originally heard the announcement of a Miami Vice movie. Well, surprise, surprise, this is a film that's most likely the complete opposite of what you're expecting, content-wise at least.Despite the fact that this could've used a little tighter editing (I wouldn't have missed the Colin Farrell/Chinese Chick romantic angle AT ALL - it dragged on about 10 or 15 minutes too long), Miami Vice is still quite the entertaining little crime ride.I like Mann, so I'm glad to report that this definitely has his unique style all over it. I especially loved the sense of realism - just listen to the gunfire and the bullets hitting metal, it makes you feel like your watching footage of an actual gunfight. Sort of an extreme episode of Cops.The gritty hand-held camera action helps add to this effect. The drawback is that the final shoot-out gets a little too chaotic, and the shaky cam and hectic close-ups make it hard to follow who's who and what's what. The dark atmosphere and minimal use of lighting doesn't help much.If you loved the original TV series and are looking forward to this, well, you might want to exercise a little wariness. My grandmother was a fan of the show because she thought Don Johnson was the most gorgeous man on TV. Believe me, if grandmama were still alive then she might risk having a heart-attack if she went to see this at the theater, expecting Crockett to prance around in his pastel best.Miami Vice the movie is about as far removed from Miami Vice the TV series as possible. ""Then why even call it Miami Vice?"" you ask? Good question. I wondered the same thing. The press notes make it clear - Michael Mann helped create the TV show, and he's always had a vision to explore the dark side of the characters he helped develop. He's had a desire to take them to places not suitable for network TV. In that context, it makes sense.While Miami Vice is not in the same league as Mann's previous top-notch action crime dramas Heat and Collateral, it still delivers cool cars, stunning visuals, excellent attention to detail (Stephanie even remarked on the ""realism"" of one female's uneven fingernails), and a lot of gunplay and violence that will catch you off-guard and jar you from your seat.I'm not going to pretend this is for everybody because it also features a couple of gratuitous sex scenes and a romantic interlude that brought the story to a screeching halt. Plus, some of the accents are hard to understand. Seriously, I could've used subtitles for the dialogue between the Cuban crime boss and his Chinese girlfriend. Prepare to squint your ears. But once we muddle through the clunky ""I love you but we can't be together"" romantic dialogue, the film gets back on track and stays there for the duration.THE GISTIf you're a fan of Michael Mann's hardcore action and unique visual style then you will find plenty to enjoy in Miami Vice. Don't let the unfortunate ""it's based on an old TV show!"" rap fool you. Others might want to first watch Heat and Collateral before deciding whether this might fit your taste.",Miami Vice
106,kooleshwar,Crime doesn't pay........or ......Does it?,8,25 September 2006,"The cast and crew of this movie make this movie absolutely unavoidable, Collin Farrel who gets more and more versatile with every role, Jamie Foxx who sometimes to be every bit as good as Denzel Washington and Michael Mann fresh out of the critical and commercial success of Collateral and Aviator.One of the first things I realised about this movie was that the camera was the same kind used in Collateral (must find more details).I really love the feel this camera gives and in this movie the camera serves to enhance the feel and impact of the movie even more than collateral.I haven't seen Miami Vice the series but if its anything like this movie than I have to watch that too.The other thing I felt was that even though Jamie and Collin may not share a great chemistry on screen, they perfectly compliment each other, intentional or not one constantly gets the feeling that even Collin and Jamie are partners in the same game they participating on a different level, while Jamie is firmly rooted in reality Collin the lines between the game and reality is constantly blurred for Collin.However both of them have performed their role brilliantly.In fact the entire cast is nothing short of brilliant, the menacing crime lord, the jealous right hand man, the white collar criminal associates, HELL even minor characters like the loyal bodyguard etc were near perfect.Technically too this movie is nearly flawless when the guns are firing you don't hear the hollywoodised sound we have come to associate with rifle fire but the real thing, coupled with the camera in certain scenes when the guns are firing you actually feel like looking behind your back to see in someone has his sights on you.The entire look and feel of this movie has been very carefully planned and it shows.Little things like the way body behaves when struck with a high velocity bullet, the kind of boats that are actually used for drug runs etc has been very accurately shown.Sadly though even though the same attention hasn't been paid to the plot and script.Don't get me wrong this movie is very very entertaining but when it comes to it somehow at the end of it you get the feeling not much has really happened at the end of the film.Maybe to much time was spent of developing the characters, if such a thing is possible, INSTEAD OF THE CHARACTERS DEVELOPING AS THE FILM MOVES THERE ARE ENTIRE SEGMENTS DEDICATED TO THE CHARACTERS ALONE, I get the feeling we are being set-up for a couple of sequels where so much time will not be spent on that department.IF THIS IS TRUE I CANT WAIT FOR THE SEQUELS.The movie is crammed with somewhat thought provoking stuff:- 1)The fact is the police have failed at their game giving rise to the old age advice, If you cant beat them at your game, then beat them at theirs, the tactics that police all over the world are using to tackle crime really make you wonder what the difference between the criminal and the law enforcer really is.2)The fact that the mafia is always to steps ahead, and how easily the lines between crime and justice can blur really makes you feel, MAYBE CRIME DOES PAY.Also this movie spent to much time on romantic elements, I don't understand why a director like Michael Mann has to waste his time on themes such as love prevails etc on a movie which just spent so much time confusing us about the viability of crime.I mean 10 mins into the movie I could say who the love interests were and and what and when was going to happen to them.The music of this film was great, the soundtrack was used brilliantly in some scenes.However the love scenes were one of those EVERYTHING BUT (pun intended) which kind of dulled the impact somewhat ,whats the sense of having a movie about hard crime drugs and criminals and then censoring the love scenes.Other than a few minor flaws this movie is absolutely brilliant (technically i think it is flawless), and a much watch for all audiences especially for lovers of crime thrillers mixed with a healthy dose of Action. (mostly guys who I recommend you watch this film with).So please Do Watch this film.-s script and plot is comparatively weak, soft stand on nudity and love themes unacceptable.+/-s to much time spent of character development , some of the audience were at times not that interested.+s technically flawless, excellent background score (FnF TD still rules though), I love the camera used and the impact the lifelike sounds have, thoroughly researched.Total 8/10 (on absolute terms and factoring in the fact that it met expectations).",Miami Vice
107,Avwillfan89,The beginning and ending scenes are the only things worth watching,3,8 July 2012,"The rest of the film is a total waste of time (and money if your renting it). I wasn't expecting it to be wonderful, but this film really is bad. In the opening scene you have Jamie Foxx and Colin Farell looking cool and determined in a nightclub with great music in the background, but after that, its all downhill. Absolutely nothing is well paced, therefore, you don't have the slightest idea of what's going on. You can't understand what the characters are saying to each other and why certain situations are happening. There's rarely any tension or suspense as it was Mann's previous movies like Collateral, Heat and The Insider and the violence just seems without depth, thrill or emotion, just total discomfort.Which leads to the biggest flaw of the movie: Both Farrell and Foxx move through this movie like boring robots, not even like the Terminator. There's no connection between them at all, no comic relief, no human emotion, no background info, not even the strain on their faces from certain stressful events. It's all about the work, and nothing else. I have no knowledge of the original T.V series, but this film is just really disappointing all the same, even if it was an original work. Foxx and Farrell are brilliant actors and Mann is a terrific director, so its a huge letdown for many fans.",Miami Vice
108,buzznzipp1995,"Crockett and Tubbs...'New Blood', a different feel.",6,28 July 2006,"-Twenty years later...Sonny and Rico ride again. Only now, more undercover of darkness than I recall from the original series. Looking for a 'Leak' that is causing the deaths of informants and agents! And the military battleship gun that is being used to rip into shreds these agents with their 'cover' blown. 'Once again, Vice is reborn, with 'new blood'. I was on the phone with the agent for Phillip Michael Thomas(Tubbs)(Back in 1994) and she mentioned that there had been some talk about making a reunion-Vice. A one time in the lives of all the original cast again, and I was really cooling-off from an interested point of view then. Considering before I was a regular viewer, in my teens. But now with 'tons' of promotion and ad-campaigns galore you can hardly miss the coming of this one! Is it worth the hype though? This new and improved 'Miami Vice' may not be all it's cracked up to be. The look and the back drop is there engulfing it, but these 'two' hardly seem to communicate on 'friendly' terms, or even have a real 'character driven' interest in each other. At very least with the 'original' series, there you had partners that had become friends, and the friendship came through for them many-a-time. They would challenge each other here and there, then the good-natured-ribbing and at times they hung out and partied. They seemed to even have laughs from time to time amongst the seriousness of the 'Job'. This (2006 vice) seems to be almost mechanical, maybe a sort of scowling numbness that doesn't convince someone that these two are 'down' with each other when it calls for that. Among the cast and from what I gather from other movie goers, Colin Farell, was not the ideal 'Crocket'. It was not in the same ballpark as the original, who had a bit more volume and clear delivery in his voice than this one. I was really not interested in a reunion show back in 1995 0r 2000. Don Johnson, is most Certainly not up to the job anymore. I had hoped that, that-old Miami-Magic would reignite the screen again. The 'feel' from the first one . Unfortunately even with Michael Mann, the original 'Brain trust' of the first series the man with the bold ideas and widespread vision, it still was just...almost there. A few things needed to change. I'm no film maker or expert but they should have taken a page or two out of the original Miami-Vice 'play book' and stayed a little truer to their 'mode of operation' for story drama and action that propelled them to number #1 in that decade. Although the 'Calderone' from the first season of the T.V. show look-a-like (that Ortiz played) was pretty awesome as a villain and that last battling shoot out was powerful as he was blasted, making a huge hole in his chest leaving the inside of his chest on the opposing wall! You could hardly hear yourself think, as the weapons were firing. Another Mann reality for cinema. It was seventies film style-grainy, it should have been 70's Vice, if it hadn't been for the newer cars, with that big-Ole mustache and long hair, along with that 'Allman Brothers talk' it sure could have been. And in fact when they were talking about a recovery-fee for the so-called 'recovered' drugs, if you listened close, could hear Sonny speaking to the drug lord with a Southern accent, at one point. Colin's Crockett, did leave a lot to be desired, his delivery of lines was about half of what it should have fully been. But still, with Foxx, it was faster more fearless and no apologies. I even took my 3 month old, he followed the action but we covered his little 'tiny ears' when there was a shootout, he even made it through, all smiles! No joke. Sort of recommended. Not for true fans of the original series, looking to be 'relit' on Vice again. (**)",Miami Vice
109,johnny-08,Top names doesn't bring you top fun,3,14 April 2007,"When I first watched series ""Miami Vice"", with Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, I was very happy because that was a hell of a show.The plot was good,actors was fine and of course Miami was here. After big success of that TV-series some people decided to make a movie. Movie was made, but that movie isn't that good.In the movie ""Miami Vice"" we've got lots of famous people,like director Michael Mann,actors Colin Ferrell,Jamie Foxx,Naomie Harris and lots more.Producers succeeded to hire big shot stars on this movie so they can replace actors from series.But they couldn't.Script of the movie is not that bad and we all know what Michael Mann is capable to do but it didn't work with this film.First of all this movie is too long.It is so long that I almost fall asleep in the cinema.Second,actors like Collin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are good actors but they cannot pull this one on their back.Collin Farrell is trying to be different from Don Johnson but he just can't do it.Don Johnson is so much better then Farrell in this role.Jamie Foxx played well,although I don't like him as an actor.And also I have to say that these two actors are good choice but why did they made this movie?To bring them money.There are lots of locations but why do they call it ""Miami Vice"" when the plot is not set in Miami.They could call it ""World Vice"" instead.I didn't enjoyed in this movie,but maybe my expectations where too big.I like Mann's camera and he really knows his job.The things I didn't liked where some scenes where Ferrell could do a better job and I also don't know why is this movie so long.It gets boring toward the end.Even though this movie has lot of famous people, it hasn't got some thing so I can say that movie is fine.It lacks of magic.",Miami Vice
110,PCT1970,Hard To Replace Johnson and Thomas As Crockett & Tubbs,7,12 May 2019,"This film has Mann written all over it and is a great updated adaptation of his 80's television series as it should be. On film he is able to create much more realistic vice world and all the sleazy components of it. Excellent direction, screenplay, settings, cinematography, soundtrack and acting. The entire cast immerses themselves in their roles with Farell, Foxx and Hinds standing out. With that being said it was still hard to view any other actors portraying Crockett and Tubbs other than Johnson and Thomas. The plot starts out with an intense club scene whereby the detectives are trying to stop a prostitution ring. Soon enough a case comes along involving a murder in South Florida that Crockett and Tubbs become aware of from their C.I. who can't stand the pressure. The case leads to the investigation, working in conjunction with the FBI, of worldwide major drug kingpins, money laundering, gun runners and the entire infrastructure of a massive organized criminal operation. While this is happening Crockett finds romance in the most unlikely and unwise places. Tubbs is also trying to protect his lover from a pending assassination attempt. The plot is unique, action packed, intense, gritty, villainy, corrupt, brutal, has twists, is intelligent and has a signature phenomenal Mann ending. This is one of the better crime films adapted from a classic television series.",Miami Vice
111,vailsy,much much better than i was led to believe (but avoid the unrated version),9,6 August 2006,"i heard many negative accounts of this film before going to watch itthe most popular was 'it isn't like the TV series'... good!! i loved the TV series, but this is a film and i expect a more polished approach and i want some reinvention. i do not want a rehash of the TV series, and a cameo by Don Johnsonwhat was popular about the TV series... the music, and cool cars and boats is still here. and for the real Miami vice aficionados, there are some scenes and story lines to recognise... the person attached to the bomb, the infiltration of a South American drug syndicate etc etc all pulled straight from the TV series the second major criticism i'd heard is that this movie is too 'gritty' and not smooth and polished like the 80's series. if you want real 'gritty' then watch NARC which is a film i would highly highly recommend. from the reports i'd heard on Miami vice, i was expecting lots of unnecessary documentary style footage hand-held cameras and the like. i.e similar to every cop drama on TV right now, Miami Vice wasn't like that at allthis movie is very stylish and dark. in particular i loved the start of the film when you are thrown straight, no titles, into an exclusive night club environment with thumping bass. afterwards the film just cruises along, and has a very laid back and high class quality about it... lots of bling on display, expensive boats, exotic women and locations. all finishing in a first class and tense final shootout(in response to someone on here talking about how the sound effects in the final shoot out are below par(!)... that is the most realistic shoot out sequence you are likely to hear on screen. if it confused you, its because it was too realistic. distance guns sound muffled and delayed, which is how they should sound. and emphasis is on the sound of the impacting bullets in the foreground. overall even better sound than the shoot out in heat which was also amazing)like heat i found this movie to have an almost dream like quality to it, and it's a film that i want to watch again and again just to get immersed in the world that mann is presenting. i personally left the theatre wanting more because i really liked this movie a lot, and liked manns choice for crockett and tubbs. once all the knee jerk negativity surrounding the film dies down, the ratings for this movie will rise. just a pity too many people are influenced by what they read.. i think this movie will be looked back on favourably, and as seriously under-rated when it was first releasedyes some of the lines given to farrell in particular are very clunky but overall he handles his character well over the course of the movie, and this is the best farrell performance i've seen for a long time. for the action junkies out there, this film might not have what you want. sure mann could have pulled 20 minutes of the emotional content and put some extra action scenes in for you... but for me that would have spoilt the movie (although i do think the scenes between farrell and li go on too long, and foxx could have used some more screen time)overall Miami vice is about the most detailed (if not totally realistic) movie you are likely to see about the drug business (and it is presented as such) and the undercover law enforcement that aims to contain it. unlike scarface for example which mostly concentrates on the criminal side of the coin..don't miss out. if you like intelligent cop/crime dramas with attention to detail, you'll love this one. and if you didn't like it first time, then i urge you to watch it again (perhaps with subtitles if necessary because admittedly the dubbing on this movie is not so hot!! tip, turn your eq at 1khz up all the way to hear the dialogue more clearly)*do avoid the 'unrated' or directors version of the movie though as it's been dumbed down to be more like the TV show - remixed with some crazy music choices, and recut minus the cool start in the nightclub making for a totally different and more commercial experience",Miami Vice
112,krycek19,No action at all!!,1,21 August 2006,"I looked at my watch ten times What a complete load of crap!! Sure it has atmosphere, nice photography and a cool soundtrack but thats all it has. The plot is non-existent as so many others has pointed out. And the action...there is no action!!! 3 shootout-scenes in the entire film. The rest of this very, very long movie, you see the two leads talk to cynical drug lords and some boring sex scenes. And as for the two detetectives talking to drug lords. This worked so much better in Collateral, where Max had to convince Vincents employer that he really was Vincent. You could feel how he was in real danger. That danger is non-excistent in the scenes in Miami Vice. I didn't care if they had killed the leads. And if the scenes had worked I would have cared. As for the action that isn't there, its just like another crap-movie Oceans eleven: a movie about a Casino robbery but we never get to see the robbery. What the hell is the point of that?? Just talk, talk talk and more talk. But no action. Very disappointing that Mann made such a boring pile of crap after an excellent movie like Collateral which also had atmosphere, nice photography and all that but also lots of action. And a really good plot.Don't waste money on this garbage. See Bad boys 2 again instead. It also takes place in Miami and its also about two cops trying to stop evil drug lords.

113,merrywood,Empty Calories,5,29 July 2006,"Movies used to be about story-telling and story telling used to be a child of the imagination and beyond that, perhaps a little channeling from the mysterious beyond. But that was a long time ago before movies stopped being pure entertainment, became conglomerate product and technology showed up. Today scripts are stitched together with planning to avoid the much feared cliché-cache, feared mostly by sword of Damocles threatened suits that in turn fear critics.Thus, the script became strategy and story elements became high tech planning nomenclature such as ""balanced vertical and lateral engagement"" and ""rising jeopardy."" Miami Vice is a propitious example of high-tech movie manufacture. The cast is lovely and apropos to character, the plot-points are plentiful and scattered about like gold nuggets salted in a mine and the gratuitous love subtext is there with a delicate touch and the prerequisite if not completely gratuitous Hollywood ending. Throw in stunning HD photography of Florida and the Caribbean, fast moving vehicles and a climactic, ferocious shoot-out and you have Miami Vice, AKA a roller coaster ride on a hot, new machine.What this and other modern ""products"" lack that is computer-stitched together by clever and creative folks is substance. Substance is the offspring of human involvement deeper than contrivance. Thus, while I can recommend this to action genre fans interested in paying ten bucks for a two hour park ride I would warn those looking for something deeper or at least character-driven to stay away.

114,noizyme,Highly interactive drug-ring movie plays well on DVD,7,14 December 2006,"When I first commented on this movie, I was furious. First, I couldn't tell why this was being adapted into a movie from the 80's TV show, but with that aside, secondly, I couldn't figure out how I felt about Colin Farrell (with his gruff voice throughout the whole movie trying to replace Don Johnson as Crockett) and Jamie Foxx playing Tubbs (especially because I always loved Foxx's more comedic acting over his serious roles). I saw it in the theater the first time around, and everything just felt completely off-putting for me, even little things like not including the trademark theme song from the TV show to hype up the movie.So I lost that initial impression altogether with a second viewing. I forgot that they never used the original theme music. I overlooked Farrell's acting like Don Johnson. And I had time (and subtitles for most of the overly specific commands and subtle name changes that the characters used throughout the film) to sit back and figure everything out without being uncomfortably squirming around in a theater chair to view it. Although I felt that some music changes would've gotten this film a higher score with my taste in soundtracks (or maybe a loss of the random sex scenes between the two vice partners and the included music in those changed around), ultimately the DVD proved a lot of my primary opinion were false.The camera-work was awesome (each scene being shot with a photograph included in place of a traditional storyboard layout). Time was put into the detail-oriented script almost to the point of confusion, for the audience at points, but in the long-run, the totally expanding life of a vice agent and the takeovers that are possible in the real world might be this sky-bound. Michael Mann deserves a lot of the credit for the entire film for its look and continuous feel throughout; this adaptation definitely could not have been made as complete without him as the director. And his tests for simple things (such as .50 caliber gun impact tests on a car) really show through in the final draft of the film.All in all, the film deserves at least 7 stars as its rating. I don't know about seeing it again and again (mostly due to its heady-script and elongated duration of the film), but there are moments of the film that have you laughing to yourself abut how this drug-trade stuff goes on within vice squads. Very informative, very stylish and functional camera-work, and very worth seeing.",Miami Vice
115,film_riot,Miami Vice,8,6 January 2007,"There are no opening credits in Michael Mann's thriller ""Miami Vice"". You are thrown into a scene, a dance club, you don't know what is happening.

You see the two heroes, which you already know from advertisements, but you have no overview in this situation. The mood, which Michael Mann creates in this absolutely fabulous opening scene is astonishing, but even more astonishing is that he can keep it up the 120 minutes running time of the film. The images are amazing, there isn't anyone who knows how to bring the big city life to film like Michael Mann does. The plot is confusing at first but resolves soon. But the plot isn't really important here. ""Miami Vice"" is not flawless, maybe it could have been 5-10 minutes shorter, but nevertheless.

Mann takes it's time to narrate a story that is unorthodox, free from clichés and with a dry tone of art. ""Miami Vice"" is a nice experience, a little challenging but ultimately rewarding.",Miami Vice
118,Craig_McPherson,Michael Mann revisits the scene of his television glory with mixed results,6,3 August 2006,"I think Michael Mann is one of the great directors working in Hollywood today. However, after watching his big screen version of Miami Vice, I found myself wishing he'd move beyond his fixation with urban crime and explore other themes, of which he has shown himself masterfully capable in the past.This is not to say Miami Vice is a bad movie. It isn't. But it's equally not a great one. Rather, it's merely an entertaining, artfully done popcorn flick that treads over the same ground as previous Mann offerings such as Manhunter, Heat and Collateral.Thematically the movie falls squarely in the middle between Heat and Collateral, conveying a better story than Heat, but not as tightly focused and driven as Collateral. Both Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx turn in decent performances as detectives Crockett and Tubbs in a quest to bust some South American drug lords, but the movie finds itself meandering at times, giving the viewer the sense that Mann is stretching the telling of a thin story beyond it's required time.Right from the beginning, Mann plunks the viewer down in the midst of a drug bust gone amok, leaving the audience scratching heads trying to get a grip on who's who and what's what. Eventually, as the silt settles, things start to become clear, however the introduction of a romantic sub-plot between Crockett and a high ranking female drug kingpin causes the movie to bog down just as it's garnering steam.Like Heat, Vice culminates in a lengthy Peckinpah-esquire gun battle that serves to tie the film's various sub-plots together, however in doing so Mann is basically telling the audience that his overstretched story has been pushed to its max and its time to reign it all in with some good old fashioned ultra violence. Granted there's nothing wrong with that, but with Mann I can't help wish for more.While his career history shows a director/screenwriter drawn to the drama of urban street crime, it's his work outside this mold that has seen him distinguish himself as one of the great directors working today.His 1992 epic retelling of James Fennimore Cooper's Last of the Mohicans is a truly spectacular piece of film-making. Driven, focused, beautifully scored and photographed with the full force of an incredible cast of characters, the movie is one of my all time personal favorites; one which I hold as among the very best ever made.Similarly, the 1999 film The Insider, which told the story of a lone whistle-blower's David like challenge to big corporate tobacco's Goliath was the complete antithesis of the action movie, but intensely riveting nonetheless.Mann's ability to wow the viewer with the impressive sweep of historical grandeur, or the tightly wound, dialog driven drama of a court-case illustrates his talent with dealing with material that is generally more substance than style. However his urban crime dramas have, for the most part, been the direct opposite  triumphs of style over substance.It's too bad, really, because Hollywood needs more of the former, and not the latter.",Miami Vice
119,masterjk2,Miami mush,3,10 July 2007,"Is that all it takes these days to produce a movie... more hot cars (they aren't real you know... companies make these fake look alikes so they can get blown up), hot boats, hot planes and hot (looking) stars? A plot that makes sense would be nice. Some good acting thrown in wouldn't hurt. Mike Mann has milked this storyline until it's dry and he's kicked the bucket, wasting a lot of good milk. Some of the actors have talent (not firth who always looks confused, handsome, but lost), but you'd never know it in this movie. They seem more interested in which mode of transportation they'll take next... go fast boat, go fast plane, go fast car, go fast girl... than speaking English so we can understand it. They talk as fast as the motorized transports race. Maybe they had to talk fast to get the movie over quicker... it didn't work... it was interminable. I liked Miami Vice in the '80s and so did a lot of people. We loved the panache and the glib dialogue. The dress then was haute couture and the men and women were genuinely high style. Whereas the TV MV was very stylish,the attire for this movie was mostly ala Target and Sam's Surplus.There is art here, in the form of the beauty of the landscapes. And although some of the settings were pleasant the idea of building a faux Maya temple house on the banks of the Igasu Falls, is ludicrous. Anything for a laugh, I guess. But I watch for the story, the dialogue, the interaction between characters. Gong Li is wonderful even if her English is sometimes inscrutable. Not to worry, the techno talk of the Americans is also.If someone could have paid attention to the script and made sure there was a plot and one that made sense, this could have been a good movie. As it was, it was a Miami Mess.",Miami Vice
120,teh_mode,"A triumph of style over substance, if a little bit empty",7,3 August 2006,"It seems the ever-persistent thought of pastel shades and beach tans will follow Miami Vice deep into distribution and maybe upon its DVD release. Ang Lee attempted to capitalise on the gay cowboy image despite the fact that his Brokeback Mountain was as distant a relative to Rocky Horror Picture Show pantomime as Miami Vice is to Starsky & Hutch style irony. I'd like to make one thing perfectly clear before we go any further: Michael Mann is a genius. The man who brought us the wonder that was 1995's Heat, the greatest cops and robbers film ever made, the best political thriller since All The President's Men with 1999's The Insider and the first, and best, film to depict Hannibal Lektar (sic) with an early classic in 1986's Manhunter, is someone I hold to be Hollywood's finest working director, encapsulating his films with stunning visual milieus, complex, introspective characters and detailed, layered plots. He creates films where no character is too small  everyone has a detailed history, regardless of whether it is someone grieving for the loss of a daughter, or a cop answering a ringing phone. He is also a fantastic action director, hosting the movie world's most realistic gun battles and a uniquely ambiguous use of violence in many of his past classics. Miami Vice is no different  giving our heroes plenty to shoot at, and much more to look at.The plot goes something like this: Ricardo Tubbs and ""Sonny"" Crockett are two street smart, undercover cops in South Florida. They are assigned unto the dealings of Drug Pin Jesús Montoya. Their mission is compromised when Sonny gets romantically involved with Montoya's banker-cum-lover Isabella, who is blissfully unaware of Crockett's true identity. There is much more to Miami Vice than the basic out-stretch of things. Explaining it any deeper, however, would be more difficult than trying to figure it out for yourself. The one criticism of all of Mann's previous work has been the density of his films perhaps compromises the ease of flow to which we follow his tales. I have always been a staunch defender of his  when people complained that their was too much going on in Heat I defended him by talking up the necessity to show contrasting thoughts on similar themes. One criminal makes us happy that he succeeds, whereas another makes us sad that he couldn't leave the life. In The Insider, Mann turns an incredibly complicated, and long-winded, story into an deftly intense thriller without the need of heavy gunfire nor the glow and night sprawl of Los Angeles. For every single frame, Miami Vice is incredible to look at. Not once did I, nor the audience, ever feel the need to twitch or fidget themselves out of discomfort due to the unfathomable nature of Miami Vice's ever complex plot. But whilst Mann is still yet to make a boring film, it seems he has finally over-extended himself with narrative convolution. We are served with none of the characterisation of Heat, the emotional exhaustion of The Insider, or the fascinating journey of Collateral. Instead what we have a terrifically realised triumph of style over substance, tickling our thirst for visuals and our hunger for action.The buddy cop formula was always going to be tough avoiding worn out clichés involving both characters tossing back amusing quips to each other. Perhaps it is fitting then, that their partnership is incredibly mellow, with both actors barely exchanging more than a dozen words in every scene they share together. Mann refuses to pay homage to 48 Hours or Starsky & Hutch by making our protagonists as dead-faced together as possible. Farrell, in particular, barely cracks a smile, which I think is a good thing, given his track record for camping movies up worse than Nicholson at his wide-eyed best. Here, he looks like if he smiles too hard he might strain his facial muscles. Foxx, on the other hand, only teases at the charm he displayed as Ray Charles, or the fast talking manager of Muhammed Ali. This isn't a criticism, more of a notice of the sharp underplaying performed by an actor who is clearly on a role as of late. I fell in love with Foxx ever since I saw him in Any Given Sunday, and he has come leaps and bounds since then. Yet, as with all of Mann's work, the real star of the film is never the person talking, it is Miami itself. After doing such a bang up job making LA look incredible in 2004's Collateral, Mann is once again teamed with cinematographer Dion Beebe to enthral our audience with visuals as stunning as they are detailed. The whole movie could be absolute clap trap, yet travelling through Miami's glorious beach trails, horrendously decrepit ghettos and bouncing along the waves of the Atlantic ocean is worth the price of emission alone. But it is never fascinating, nor is it truly emotionally involving. Crockett's romance with Isabella is too far-fetched for me to truly care what the outcome of it is, and whilst Tubb's ongoing relationship with girlfriend Trudy certainly offers much more introspection than any other part of the film's narrative it is nothing we haven't seen before.But it says remarkable amounts about a filmmaker when Miami Vice is perhaps his weakest project to date. Whatever it lacks in depth, Miami Vice has style and profile in abundance, glorifying itself in spite of its flaws. This is perhaps what something like Starsky & Hutch would be like were it a real life documentary. I never expected it to match the Heats of this world, but it wouldn't have done that regardless. The perfectionist that was Michael Mann is perhaps the experimentalist these days, although you'd still be hard-pressed to find a better track record anywhere in Hollywood at the moment.",Miami Vice

122,adrongardner,VIce City,7,12 August 2006,"I write this review as a fan of the original series. The movie Miami Vice is essentially about attitude, style and action. The original series was essentially about attitude, style and action. Lets get some things out of the way.I think Colin Farrell's voice is a bit overbearing for Crockett. I think Jamie Foxx was underused. The Ferrari too was underused! Don't bother trying to follow the plot, it doesn't make any sense. Who was the leaker after all?!?! The music blends too fast sometimes and some of the songs just don't work. The digital cinematography works sometimes, others its just annoying. The visuals are always a tad underexposed in the day time and the gain pushed in the night scenes, because of this bright night, it feels as if Mann wanted the night to be ""the day"" for these cops.All that being said, the movie was full of energy and style, just like the original on which it was based. The plot was clearly adapted from a few episodes like the one where they had to disable the bomb in the trailer and had to go to Columbia. The Violence is very real, like Collateral and Heat. The movie isn't very coherent, but neither was the series, this isn't a clean cop vs. robbers opera like HEAT. No Vice is down and dirty, after all, they are Vice.Michael Mann seemed to be trying a lot of things, the movie felt like an experiment. He is at a place in his career where with Vice, he clearly was taking risks in just about every avenue of film-making, and that is a good thing. Some of the risks pay out, others didn't, but in the end the film has a vibrant pulse and is truly entertaining.",Miami Vice
123,guyfromjerzee,A huge disappointment,3,29 July 2006,"I wish I could make the comparison to the TV series, but I haven't watched the show in the longest time. All I remember is that I did watch ""Miami Vice"" on a regular basis and enjoyed it. I'm sure I would enjoy watching the show (despite how outdated it is) much better than this dull, boring remake. I'm not the type of person who needs to see nonstop action, but if you're going to spend most of the time developing the plot and characters, at least do it in an interesting way. I felt like I was watching paint dry. The plot is no more than your run-of-the-mill undercover cop getting in too deep scenario. Colin Farrell is a talented actor, but I didn't find him convincing as Sonny Crockett. He does nothing more than go through the motions while mumbling in his almost unintelligible, unconvincing Floridian accent. Jamie Foxx does a pretty good job, but he plays more of a supporting role. This is definitely Michael Mann's worst film up to date. I loved ""Collateral,"" which contains characters that I found very engaging, and as a result I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire flick. If there was a drinking game where you were to take a shot every time I checked my cell phone for the time during ""MV,"" you'd be passed out drunk. I hope this movie is the biggest bomb of the summer, and I have a funny feeling that it will be.",Miami Vice

I had to rush to get off work early so I could go and see what I thought might be the best action movie of the year. I thought this because Michael Mann directed this and I love his work on Manhunter and Collaterial. I also thought he would be the man to pull this off because he was involved with the original show. I was wrong. It was two hours of nothing happening. Nothing, I swear. The is and I'm serious, a five minute boat ride to Cuba with like three lines of dialog. Come to think of it i believe there may only be like five pages of speaking in the whole movie. I know little word play does not make a bad or dull movie, watch the Road Warrior, but the little speaking has to have action supplemented into the mix are the film will die, like this one does. Never watch this.",Miami Vice
125,Blade_Le_Flambeur,"Exciting, refreshing, and classy - one of the best movies of the year",9,30 July 2006,"'Miami Vice' is based off the time capsule 1980s show of the same name, but the styles couldn't be anymore different. This will undoubtedly upset some who were expecting a conventional remake of the show, Michael Mann decided to make a gritty, HD shot, noir/drama. The results are captivating, utterly original, and this is truly one of the best movies of the year.There are no opening credits. Just the Universal studio logos then into a nightclub (playing the trailer theme song by Linkin Park/JAY Z.. slightly confusing, but I digress) where Dets. Sony Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricard Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are on a sting operation, along with Michelle Rodriguez partners played by Naomie Harris and Elizabeth Rodriguez. Unexpectedly, Crockett receives a cryptic phone call from an informant named Alonzo Stevens (John Hawkes) who kills himself shortly after. So begins the undercover agents descent into the underworld to find out more about an FBI leak that Stevens mentioned. Soon they end up operating with the intense José Yero (John Ortiz), and Isabella (Gong Li), a Chinese-Cuban accountant for the smuggling operation. A business relationship is worked out, but things spiral out of control when Crockett falls (hard) for Isabella, who is the girlfriend of the main kingpin Arcángel de Jesús Montoya (Luis Tosar). The plot is minimalist to say in the least, as Mann doesn't spoon feed the audience with what's going on. Names of characters aren't spoken way into the movie, leaving a better sense of realism. What makes 'Miami Vice' so sublime is the man behind the camera, Michael Mann (no pun intended).Employing the unmatched talent of director of photography Dion Beebe (who won the Oscar for 'Memoirs of a Geisha, also starring Li), Mann shoots in new HD format. This decision gives the film a gritty, almost unnerving feel, revealing deep clouds and beautiful Miami sunsets but also darkening the dangerous slums of Columbia. Mann penned the screenplay, based off the show he and Anthony Yerkovich created, which has some uninspired lines and moments, but is ultimately original. Despite the fact that 'Miami Vice' fits in the genre of action, there are only few explosions/gunshots until the very end. Yet, with his choice of settings and plot details, the film is every bit as exciting. The first few gunshots in the film come as complete surprises, and the audiences literally jumped then started laughing/applauding. The actors use firearms realistically, and also they suspiciously always make their mark, one must keep in mind that they are special cops with extensive training. Mann also make smart decisions when it came to casting. Both leads fit in naturally with their roles, and the supporting players all contribute valuably. Li has a tough time speaking English, and struggles, but I was able to understand everything she said. All the considers, the actors did fine considering the often limited emotional nature of the roles. But it is as a director that Mann fits everything together.Known for his realism (firearms training for actors is the norm), Mann who directed such thrillers as 'Heat' and 'Collateral' embarks on familiar territory but with a refreshing eye. Shots are always well placed and gorgeous, the action comes in sporadic bursts but fit in the with the story. The film is intense even during the scenes of dialogue, because the audience is unsure what exactly will happen next.This film definitely is one of the highlights of the year, along with Richard Linklater's 'A Scanner Darkly'. Although some clichés knock it down from being perfect, 'Miami Vice' is definitely one of the must-see movies of the year.9.5/10",Miami Vice
126,jwpeel-1,What is wrong with some of these people? GREAT MOVIE!,9,3 August 2006,"It was a hot day. Damned hot. We're talking heat wave and major global warning that's making me envy those polar bears on the melting icecaps - but not really. I'm frying in the house and the wife says, ""let's go to the movies."" So I ask what are we going to see and she says ""Miami Vice."" Cool. Loved the trailer. Thought the casting was perfect - Jamie Foxx and Collin Farrell and the place is air conditioned - unlike my house.Now it is already clear to you readers that I loved the film. That's why I don't understand so many hostile comments from other reviewers p some who were even fans of Michael Mann and/or the series from the 80s.The plot is simple but with lots of twists and turns and lots of great and hip dialogue. Drugs and people shooting at each other. Lots of ethnic types and music and fast cars and boats. But then there are new editions like hot but tough women characters (deliciously played by Li Gong and Naomie Harris, my new fantasy chick - but I digress) Good reason to go along for the ride. And what a ride it is! Add to the mix, killer Aryans with big muscles and even bigger weapons and a little S&m/B&D style danger and the movie is almost too scary because it is so damned real. But obviously that is not enough for some young moviegoers who want to write the movie themselves I guess. Whatever. Talk to the computer screen, guys.Now I won't say that Mann's newest film is perfect, but I would gladly go again too see this film. Whenever I see an action movie where I really can't wait to see the bad guy wasted, I know we have a winner here. And John Ortiz is just as slimy a bad guy as you can get. But here are the complaints I have with the film and why I don't give it a full ten stars.The screenplay by Mann seems to be trying to hard to be PC. We have our black and white lead characters and we have to see their love interests explored almost in equal time. Two shower scenes with naked babes (no complaint there but read on) and it just seems like these two things go on forever and eat up time better suited for plot points. Minor, maybe, but it doesn't make for great screen writing in my opinion.Then there is a factor that almost always bothers me with Michael Mann films since ""Manhunter"" (which no one else seems to mention in their reviews) and that is the blurry, grainy video blown up to 35MM format. Same with the TV show. Makes me nuts.And I could have dome without some of the music personally, but I have never been a big fan of Hip Hop. Somehow, I prefer actual singing and not disco clones. (Disco STILL sucks.) All in all, I got cool with the AC, jiggy with the flick, the action, babes and bloodletting even and had a large Coke to make the night right.If you loved Mimai Vice or Michael Mann's work, you should love this one too. Now when are they going to make a big screen Nash Bridges film? Another Don Johnson show but with humor along with the action, which Mimai Vice, for all its greatness, sorely lacked.",Miami Vice
127,MrBiddle,2970 miles per second in your inner medulla,7,20 August 2006,"Miami VICE, has some great HD real-world type of sequences shot by the hand of Mann, who has done the same thing in his prior work, COLLATERAL. With decent performances from Foxx, Farrell, Gong Li and company, it is a fairly watchable drama, and a highlight of Mann's work, which I've also witnessed in movies like HEAT and COLLATERAL is the precision quality audio of gunfire, and round-piercing clanks where squibs go off. These events in Miami VICE take place early on but are fully explored towards the end. Loved the scene when the lady vice squad shooter takes out the over confident big guy, holding the... thing I won't tell you he's holding because it might spoil you.Those who refuse to see a competently made, albeit dragging crime drama should skip this one, even the wallop that Mann packs with his gunfights in here may NOT be worth your time, but see it if you can keep an open mind. But hopefully not as open to accept, as I DON'T, the fact that even Mann is one of those filmmakers who rides the bandwagon of depicting scenes where full-automatic rifles don't run dry as quickly as they do in real life, but because of Non-John Woowee action scenes shot with his video-wy HD camera look (side by side with standard film filter or color scheme, or did they alternate with film as well?), those holes are reconcilable with VICE's redeeming qualities. Interesting also to note, that NO title is put during the movie's beginning, the same thing that happens in Mann's 2004 outing. What is that anti-titling trend all about anyway?See this if you want to in the cinema, no one is stopping you - but otherwise only worth a rental on a rainy day. Grade B-",Miami Vice

Another strange point is that I viewed this on TV, it had no opening credits. Usually when a movie does this you get a sort of back story or intro like you do with James Bond film, so for the first 10 - 15 minutes your waiting for them to roll, they never do and this is distracting.I kept thinking this movie will all fall into place anytime now, it did and it didn't.

130,Robert_Hearth,"""Time Is Luck."" --- Isabella (Gong Li)",5,1 March 2007,"""Miami Vice"" (2006)Directed By: Michael Mann Starring: Colin Farrell, Jamie Foxx, Gong Li, Naomie Harris, Luis Tosar, Elizabeth Rodriguez, & Justin Theroux MPAA Rating: ""Unrated"" (for strong violence, language and some sexual content) ***PLEASE NOTE: This Is A Review Of The ""Unrated"" Version Of The Movie*** I had high hopes for this big-screen adaptation of the successful television series from the eighties mainly because of its cast. Colin Farrell is probably best known for his promiscuous off-screen antics, but he actually is a very good actor. I can't think of a single he has made that I just flat-out disliked. Jamie Foxx, who won the Academy Award for his amazing performance in ""Ray"", is a great actor who has starred in a lot of big disappointments, the most recent being the dismal ""Stealth"", which underperformed at the box-office and hit a sour note with me. But, I still had faith in him. Gong Li (or Li Gong) is a great actress who is just finally making a mark on American audiences. Naomie Harris is a very diverse actress. She has taken on many different kinds of roles, from the mystical Tia in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" to the tough cop, Sophie in ""After the Sunset"". On top of that, Michael Mann was directing. Sure, he is no Martin Scorsese, but he has proved to be quite competent at directing crime dramas before. Having never even watched the original television series, I didn't have that on which to base my opinion so I was judging this purely on its own and, frankly, I'm disappointed. This isn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but it certainly isn't the best. In fact, I am oddly indifferent to it. It just didn't stand out at all.Detectives James ""Sonny"" Crockett (Farrell) and Ricardo ""Rico"" Tubbs are put on the case when there is a tragic security breach in the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force. They go undercover as offshore boat racers and outlaw smugglers, but things begin to spiral out of control when their personal lives become entwined in their professional lives. Sonny falls for Isabella (Li), the beautiful and alluring banker of the drug trafficking network they are investigating and Rico's loved ones become under attack. Nothing can prepare the two for the explosive and dramatic conclusion that will threaten to tear them both apart. I liked the sound of this plot and, had it been used properly, it could have made for an amazing movie, but it is not used properly. It is almost completely wasted on characters that are never given much depth and on a dreary, muddled execution.One thing I can say in favor of this movie is that the performances are handled well and are ultimately showing that I was right about something. This movie had a good cast. Colin Farrell proves yet again that he can act. This isn't his best performance, but it works. Jamie Foxx has fallen away from his Academy Award winning performance and he definitely needs to step it up if he wants to prove that he isn't a one hit wander, but he too does fine. It was a passable performance. Gong Li gives a subdued and dignified performance that works, making me side with her even though her character had a few questionable motives. Naomie Harris also does a good job and, though I was reminded a little too much of her role in ""After the Sunset"", I thought it worked well enough here as well. The remainder of the cast does okay, though I never felt that any of the ""villains"" were handled well enough. They just didn't seem evilor even mildly villainous at all. They were all rather bland.""Miami Vice"" is an average crime drama that never even tries to be anything more. I was disappointed by its lack of important characterization and also of Michael Mann's direction. It just did not work and gave the film a strange, tacky vibe that reminded me of an episode of ""Cops"". However, there is a certain amount of entertainment to be found here. We've seen almost every aspect of this film before and there really isn't anything original presented here, but the movie succeeds in entertaining on the most basic level. Shoot-outs and explosions are fun to watch and this movie is packed with them. I suppose the ending implied that there could be a sequel, but I hope that it does not happen unless there is some serious tinkering with the team that made this film, especially in the screen writing department. I will recommend this movie, but this recommendation comes with a warning. This is not a movie that I care to see again, but it isn't bad for a single watch.Final Thought: ""Miami Vice"" works on a very, very basic level.Overall Rating: 5/10 (B-)",Miami Vice

The exquisite shooting locations and sets, plus the wonderful soundtrack is all this movie has to offer. Else it sucks so so so so bad. People who want to conserve their hard earned cash don't go to see this movie.

132,Det_McNulty,Visually Stunning And Bursting With Stylish Flare. Shame That The Same Can't Be Said About The Substance,7,4 August 2006,"Once again Michael Mann creates an entertaining and enthralling action thriller with Miami Vice. As well as staying faithful to the original iconic 80s series, it manages to being a whole new life to the franchise that changed TV and though may seem to have not got better with time it is still always going to be something special. The film's narrative structure lacks the rhythm and motion that is needed to create a more ""compelling"" blockbuster.I generally hate Colin Farrell and when I heard that he had been cast as ""Sonny"" I was surprised and also disappointed. Colin Farrell lacks the discipline and gritty features needed to play a character such as ""Sonny"". What gets on my nerves about Colin Farrell's acting ability is the fact he is so ""over the top"" and never puts any depth, emotion or facial acting into his roles. He's generally a bland and un-appealing actor, also some of the dialogue (In particular Colin Farrell's) was so corny and lame you felt that the actor would have been being laughed at. In a strange way though you could stay the ""style"" of the script was a tribute to the odd 80s feel the movie had. On a lighter note Jamie Foxx was great as ""Ricardo Tubbs"", he lived up to the original character and put a new dimension into the role. I found it surprisingly realistic and he was awesome at keeping his ""cool"".Michael Mann's beautiful, sleek and cool direction style perfectly suits the mood of Miami Vice. Mann's use of lighting (As usual) shows tremendous skill and intelligence to perfection of detail. The editing is very sharp and flows nicely, unlike the film's story which in places felt dis-joined. The style added a real raw intensity to the film's look and I felt it was very good on the eyes with some of the beautiful scenery which grabbed my attention. Mann is always a perfectionist as visual flare and creating a tense crime film (Which usually are wonderfully structured). Even though the film is modern it still manages to feel very ""80s"" which I enjoyed.Being a huge Miachel Mann fan and a film buff I had been highly anticipating Miami Vice and was still enthralled even though it did not match some expectations. Yes I disagreed with a particular casting choice and was not a fan of the clumsy script, but I was still pleased with the final outcome. Though I was very hyped up for Miami Vice and it does live up to Mann's previous masterpieces it still manages to be the best film of the year so far in what is a (So far) disappointing year for film. Miami Vice is a ""cool"" film and I recommend it if you want some good entertainment.",Miami Vice
133,jaybizman,"""Miami Vice"" - the movie. Disappointed and later relieved.",7,24 November 2020,"Having watched all the TV episodes of the same named show,
on first viewing I was disappointed. What happened to the MV theme song?I had to re-watch a while later to appreciate Director Michael Mann's moody,
stylish and color palette for this MV movie version.Few observations: Colin Farrell was great, Gong Li was amazing (just a twitch
of a facial muscle and she filled the screen), Jamie Foxx was wooden.
Naomi Harris (Moneypenny in latest Bond Movies), was ok.Rather than rehash the scenes, to me one of the biggest standouts was -
the 'music soundtrack', specifically: One of these mornings by Patti LaBelle,
Aranca by Manzanita, SinnerMan by Nina Simone and Pennies in my pocket
by Miami's own Emilio Estefan, and the redone Phil Collins classic.Director Mann on second viewing did a good job. I understand it wasn't an
easy shoot - but all in all a solid 7/10. Check it out.",Miami Vice
134,JimD73,"Miami Vice boring, disorganized and far too Farrell-centric",2,3 August 2006,"What is the obsession with re-creating old TV shows from the '70s and '80s into movies that take place modern day and have very little to do with the show? Sure, I liked Mission: Impossible, but I am hard pressed to think of another that turned out even mediocre. Yet, if anyone can make it work, it's Michael Mann, who absolutely stunned me a couple years ago with the brilliant Collateral, even though The Last of the Mohicans is the only other Mann movie I have seen. Despite mostly negative reviews, after re-watching Collateral on DVD, I knew I owed it to myself to see this movie just for comparison purposes. Besides, most of the bad reviews were because it didn't follow the same path as the TV show, and since I never saw the show, I couldn't be disappointed by that, right? Well, even as a person whose closest Miami Vice experience was Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the new movie still, well, really sucks for numerous reasons.The movie starts off at a rave, with vice detectives Sonny Crockett (Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Foxx) receiving a call from a former informant telling them he's in big trouble. Turns out the reason why is that his status as an informant has been compromised, and a deal he set up between a group of white supremacists known as the Aryan Brotherhood and the FBI was busted and the agents killed. Since the operation was interagency, lead agent Fujima (Hinds) must assume that all branches involved may be responsible for compromising the deal, so he enlists the help of Crockett and Tubbs, since Vice Squad was not involved. The plan is to go undercover and position themselves as drug traffickers working for one of the Aryan's suppliers, Jose Yero (Ortiz) to smoke out the rat.The movie manages to quickly forget the whole problem with the inside rat. In fact, I'm fairly sure that problem is never even resolved. It quickly shifts attention to Crockett's romance with Isabelle (Li), the lover of drug kingpin Montoya (Tosar). The middle hour seems to be simply about their affair, leaving everything else on the sideline. This is probably the movie's biggest fault, simply because when the plot actually chooses to advance itself rather than float along with the numerous sex scenes (a surprising amount of which take place in a shower), the audience has almost completely forgotten why they are here in the first place, and the mistrust almost seems completely out of left field.The fact that the movie remains almost solely about Crockett throughout (except for a brief sidestory for Tubbs that you could blink and miss) really hurts the movie's potential, mainly because Foxx is a much more solid actor than Farrell. Tubbs comes across as confident and smart, but it is hard to know the character simply because he is not concentrated on, letting Foxx go to waste. The same thing happens to his lover, played by the usually amazing Naomie Harris. The movie is instead left in the hands of Gong Li and Colin Farrell. Gong Li does a horrible job, though it is tough to blame her. Emotionally, she is solid, but her struggle with English makes her lines very difficult to follow. Farrell, on the other hand, just isn't in tune with the movie, instead just floating along, mumbling many of his lines and just standing there when he isn't speaking. If the movie had evened the balance between Tubbs and Crockett (whom, by the way, have zero chemistry or, for that matter, dialogue), it could have been a great, gritty buddy action movie (I hate to use the word buddy, but nothing else fits). Instead, we get a Farrell centric disaster.The trailer is chock full of fast boats and blazing guns, which in the general sense would lead the audience to assume there would be plenty of action, right? Wrong. There is only one real action scene in the entire movie, taking place right at the end. Granted, there is a slight adrenaline rush at the beginning, with Jamie Foxx taking actions that seem to mirror what he witnessed Tom Cruise perform in Collateral. Other than that, the scene at the end is all. This leaves the rest of the movie feeling kind of dull, as the characters aside from Isabelle and Crockett never fully develop enough for us to care about them, and Farrell and Li give us no reason to care about them either.At least the movie does have some good Michael Mann moments that reflect the style of Collateral. While the final shootout isn't worth waiting through the rest of the movie for, it does pack a terrific punch, with incredibly loud gunshots roaring in all directions, much like the rave scene in Collateral. The scenes with Crockett and Tubbs simply driving a boat at night almost seem entertaining just because of the excellent scenery. Even if the plot couldn't deliver, at least Mann managed to create some artistic merit in Miami Vice.Aside from some nice visuals, Miami Vice is a train wreck in nearly every aspect. It is boring, disorganized and way too centric on the two worst acted roles in the entire movie. It really is a shame that such talent as Naomie Harris and notably Jamie Foxx (who blew me away in Collateral) are wasted while Farrell and Li eat up as much scenery as possible. Besides, as I understand it, the original TV show at least had some humour involved, while this one takes itself far too seriously. At least give us a shot of Farrell wearing shoes without socks to appease the fans. Unfortunately, Miami Vice is another wasted opportunity and big step down for Mann.",Miami Vice
135,manicman84,the first and hopefully the last slip-up of Michael Mann,5,23 September 2006,"Michael Mann is a highly inventive director who always shoot gripping urban thrillers. Even though I found his previous flicks engaging and original, full-length Miami Vice seems to be a second-grade movie which is dangerously close to being average and obviously far behind Heat or Collateral. At first, the remake is not faithful to a humorous original series and will certainly disappoint all fans of it. Actually, the pic is quite gloomy and serious, like previous Mann's films. One can say that it's even a continuation of Collateral as the same thread of alienation in a big city is kept. Secondly, I couldn't take a liking for or relate somehow to characters who are quite shallow and poorly-developed. This fact struck me as strange because I considered Mann to be a master of character's study. To make things worse, the dialogue is forced and not particularly memorable as well as actors play only correctly. The biggest virtue of Miami Vice is its unique style characteristic solely to Mann's productions. Director uses digital cameras so as to get a transparent picture of urban area. The film also contains spectacular shooting sequences in which Mann specializes. All in all, alike Spielberg's Terminal and Stone's Alexander, Miami Vice is the first slip-up of a great director. Okey, maybe not so colossal as Alexander.",Miami Vice
136,coljam21,As cold as Li's eyes,3,30 April 2014,"I actually liked how the movie was shot. It was dark and mysterious and a little artsy. I really liked Colin Farrell's character. Or rather I liked how he was portrayed. I even liked how the Irish accent came in once in a while. Liked his pseudo 80's hair do and his moustache. It seems they got everything right about him/his character. The rest of the cast however, I'm not too sure about. Jamie Foxx in my opinion is not right to play any role besides comedy because he always looks like joke. I'm sorry but he does. From the clownish expressions on is face to the way he waddles when he walks and how his butt sticks out like a duck. I just can't take him seriously.I can't for the love of understand why they chose Gong Li to play the Spanish speaking drug lord's mistress when she is a Chinese woman who can barely speak English! Also her eyes looked like snake eyes; cold and vacant. All those stares going back and forth between her and Farrell were just plain creepy. Oh and there was nothing sexy about the ill placed and ill-timed sex scenes between Foxx and his girl and Farrell and Gong snake eyes li. It seems like the director thought to himself oh something is missing, oh yeah the sex and he just threw it in there.This movie could have been so much better.",Miami Vice
137,Newsense,Miami's vice,1,24 February 2009,"Don't get me misunderstood. I like Michael Mann. Michael Mann's Heat is one of my favorite flicks of the past and Collateral turned out to be one of 2005's best surprises. I even like Ali even though the movie could have focused more on Muhammad Ali: the man than Muhammad Ali: the boxer. Miami Vice: the the TV show was a cheesy fun cop show that anybody that has seen it has warm memories of(myself included). Miami Vice: the movie is well..pretty boring. Jamie Foxx who was great in Ray and Collateral gives an underwhelming performance in this movie. Colin Farell spends most of the movie looking like Yanni with this unintelligible look on his face that screams: you woke me up out of my bed for this? Miami Vice looks good visually but the movie moves at a snail's pace. It never goes beyond the tale of two cops Crockett(Colin Farrell) and Tubbs(Jamie Foxx) who go deep undercover to bust a drug ring. Crockett gets into an uninteresting relationship with Gong Li's character(whose name I forgot) and ends up getting them into trouble with the buyer. YAWN. There is no chemistry between Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell's character and they both look bored out of their skulls. Not only is there no chemistry between Jamie and Colin, there is also no chemistry between Gong Li's character(whose accent makes it hard to understand her) and Colin Farrell's character. They not only have a bland relationship with each other but they have the most boring sex you will ever see on screen. Hell, Morticia and Gomez of the Addams Family have more chemistry than these two. Both Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell deliver their lines in a deep voice that makes them sound as ridiculous as a teenage guy trying to sound hip by talking in a deep tone plus did I mention that is almost no action in this movie. This movie is billed as an action flick but action rarely happens. Most of the time Miami Vice the movie is a dull drama with limited action sequences. In short if you're a fan of the TV show the movie is named after you wont like this one. At least Miami Vice was exciting. This movie is about as dull as wheat bread.",Miami Vice
138,vovazhd,Decent but forgettable,6,28 September 2007,"Miami Vice is one of those films that sounds great on paper but turns out a mixed execution. It is an adaptation of the 1980s TV series that I did not see, so I can't give any comparison insight. It tells the story of two Miami police officers, Crockett and Tubbs, and their investigation into a drug empire. From this summary, you would expect there to be a lot of action. On the contrary, there is practically no action until the last half hour, where it unloads, and is correspondingly much better than the first hour and a half.It starts off rather well. The first 10-15 minutes caught my attention, but it was lost with the content that followed. The plot was hard to follow and the style was bland. Colin Farrell does a fine job as Crockett, but Jamie Foxx makes an uninteresting companion. All the characters were shallower than I would have preferred, but the villains weren't bad (although not outstanding).The finale is actually quite good. It is filmed and acted well, and ties up the loose ends. The blazing action sequences also help make it more exciting. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite make up for the rest of the movie. In the end, Miami Vice just isn't good enough to be memorable and is a lost opportunity at something that could have been great.",Miami Vice

Barry Shabaka Henley isn't as intensive, nor as vivid!And where did the search for the leak go - it was just dropped, like a hot potato?! Maybe they ran out of money - all those fancy vehicles and vessels must have consumed a lot?!Compared to the TV series it has less story, but lots of filling-ins, with transport scenes, of various kinds.

This movie would have been more entertaining if it resembled more of the t.v. series when the movie was made. The movie itself was too badly dragged out, it was a boring as it could come.

As a feature film it is flat and not involving. Colin Farrell cannot hold the screen as a leading man. Jamie Foxx is handcuffed in a thankless role. The villains are dull. The action set pieces are few and seem like limp ripoffs of his other films. There is no synergy here. Michael Mann is all synergy. The music is uninspired. The editing is as confusing as the plot. Dion Beebe's groundbreaking high def work in COLLATERAL doesn't work very well for this film. There is not a single memorable moment in this film and coming from Mann that is a shock.

I've got to say, however, that credit is due. I think Mann pulled it off, delivering a sharp and classy thriller with no baggage for the casual viewer, but which was equally filled with little treats for fans of the series. Sure, there were quibbles, but it would be churlish to even list them. The world's moved on since the 80s, and this was a slick piece of movie-making that honoured the show and hopefully entertained a new audience.

144,tpaladino,Buy the Directors Cut...,9,30 July 2006,"This movie was just plain good. It undoubtedly did justice to the TV series, without being an exact replica. Crocket and Tubbs were well written and well acted, and the camera work was phenomenal. Really one of the best-looking films out there.I was a big fan of the original series, and I thought that the theater cut was really enjoyable, but I just watched the Directors Cut on DVD and found it immensely more satisfying. Most of the gripes I had with the original film were corrected in this new version.The one change that I was most excited about was the use of 'In The Air Tonight' during the lead up to the final confrontation at the end of the movie, rather than just score music. It was a great nod to that similar iconic scene in the pilot. There are several other additional scenes in the movie that add more depth and enjoyment to the experience also.True fans of the series will also recognize more than a few lines in the movie have been lifted directly from the original series, many from the famous 'Smugglers Blues' episode which featured Glenn Frey. In fact, much of the storyline loosely parallels that episode, which is a good thing, as that was one of the greats of the series.Not everyone will like this movie, and its not really intended for everyone. Its not a film that spells everything out for you, as far too many do these days, so many people feel a bit lost and detached without that hand-holding, nor does it have action sequences in the vein of 'Bad Boys' or 'Die Hard'. The film literally opens and closes nearly mid-sentence, as a snapshot of the characters lives, with very little else to go on beyond what is happening on the screen at that very second, and the action is minimalistic without being minimal. Its an interesting experience if you're up for it, but it may be too much effort to ask of many viewers.",Miami Vice
145,Stibbert,"Nicely shot, story wise OK.",6,12 August 2006,"I went to see Miami Vice on it's premiere night here in Norway. A quite interesting film I must say. First of all, let me just say it has nothing to do with the series. The name is just about the only connection between the film and the series. It's not a remake or a follow up, it's a standalone film. So, even if you liked the series, you can go and watch this movie without being afraid I'll destroy the franchise, cause it's hardly, if at all part of it.Now, it was an interesting movie. Not so much story wise. It's another one of those shoot 'em up under cover detective style films. It almost seemed like they had too much story. Very much dialog and stuff happening all the time. I missed shots that build up the excitement. Things kind of ended before it began.What was interesting about this movie was the way it was shot. On video, HD, with some really out of the ordinary shots. The use of gain was quite obvious and made a nice effect. Quite a lot of ultra close ups and shots totally out of focus. Not to mention the use of the depth of field letting things fall in and out of focus and hand held camera. Elements that give it a documentary-style look and elements of cinema mixed together. It turns out quite nice.If this movie is going to be remembered for something and stand out in the crowd it's because of the way it's shot and the way it looks. It got some really good acting too. Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell does some good performances and the rest of the cast is not bad. As for the music, well it's OK. I was expecting some themes from the series to be played in a new version maybe, but that didn't happen. The score builds the mood OK, but is nothing special.All in all Miami Vice is nothing like the series and luckily it doesn't try to be either. It's an OK film, but except for being very nicely shot and makes use of some interesting effects it offers very little new.",Miami Vice

Some great action scenes are involved too, but are too far and few between for those hoping for an action flick.There are some major issues with it though. Mann seems to have trouble making his high concept of the story watchable and followable. His idea is sound, but he's operating on a level that's somewhat alien to the audience, so it can be a little hard to follow at times. Keep your wits about you.Also, there is a lack of character present, where people come in to say lines directly related to the story, but few develop the personae of the characters themselves. Some things are said quite quickly, generating a ""wha?"" reaction from viewers. There were one or two really bad edits that I noticed as well - Mann can't seem to decide whether to make his movies documentary-esquire or straight up, as there are both kinds of work here.All in all the patience pays off spectacularly at the end, but was it really worth it? You decide. I think it's a little underrated on IMDb, but not as good as some of Mann's previous efforts, namely Collateral and Heat.

Show.P.S. I honestly don't know what version of the film I saw on DVD, but I do know that no matter what version I see, I will never be entertained.",Miami Vice
150,antonjsw1,"One of Mann's finest, this is so much better than the IMDb rating",10,2 January 2013,"Michael Mann's feature film adaption of his seminal 80s TV series comes across as a complex, exciting and thoughtful drama and is totally removed from both the TV series and a stereotypical view of what this film audiences might have expected. Nevertheless it is accessible and hugely entertaining. The action sequences are like Heat, only as a result of the development of the story. They are grounded, realistic and very exciting. The story, while paying homage to the original TV is complex, involving, thoughtful and engrossing, and Michael Mann's use of digital cameras really works for this film in helping tell this story.The film drops you straight into a ""day on the job"" and intelligence that is received by Crockett and Tubbs, both very well played by Colin Firth and Jamie Foxx, while on this job leads them into a new deep undercover role. Gong Li is also very impressive in the role as part of a drug dealing cartel. In fact, all performers are first rate and their low key and introspective performances are the major successes of the film. The characters are played as being on the job for a long time, and it looks like that all the key characters have become so immersed in the job that is all they live for. The development of Firth and Gong's character is interesting within the context of the story as we see the flickering's of a life beyond their day to day existence, just as an event in the film leads to the subtle humanising of Foxx's character, but as to whether these character changes are permanent, the viewer will need to judge for themselves.Action scenes are exceptional in their gritty execution. Dion Beebe's camera-work is first rate, and the use of characters presented in silhouettes works very well in terms of the subliminal message of the work they are doing being in shadow. There are some interesting effects of the digital filming, with some action scenes having an almost video like look. The mix of songs and Jon Murphy's score works well and really creates a mood for the story to play out in.Director Michael Mann again orchestrates the film with skill and style. As shown on films such as the Insider, he brings superb visual storytelling to dialogue and character focused scenes and yet handles action scenes in an involving and exciting way.In summary a entertaining thriller.

The story itself is decent and does the job, but it lacks punch and is rather flat. There's not a single joke in the movie, no excitement in the action scenes and the characters have no personality, so you don't feel anything for them. There's no rollercoaster of emotions here, it's just monotone. Amongst the cast, only Jamie Foxx has a bit of charisma about him, but not enough to save this from being average.
Also, what was the point of Montoya in the movie when he's only in 3 scenes. Yero should have been the big boss instead of ""middle management"" when he's the main antagonist anyway.

He always gets the most out his actors, has a great distinct visual style and is also a competent writer to boot, but this doesn't disguise the fact that he completely missed the mark with this one. The characters were bland and given no chance to develop, the plot was confused and ridiculously over-the-top, the script was littered with completely irrelevant dialogue and the acting and on-screen chemistry was just awful. Foxx had nothing to do and he said about two lines to Farrell when they are supposed to be partners! Farrell was wooden and looked like a porn star, which is probably understandable as this film was just stuffed with gratuitous sex- scenes and as for Gong-Li, not being a xenophobe, I couldn't understand a word she was saying. The whole thing is nothing like the original T.V. series and got boring very quickly, the only things saving it being a pretty decent final dock shoot-out, a good soundtrack (as is always the case with Mann's films) and Mann's great digital visual style.

I was aware of Miami Vice when it was coming out, I probably seen the trailer, I seen a TV spot which had the Linkin' Park song Numb. I tried watching Miami Vice twice over the years, lets say 2008 and 2013, my first year having Netflix. Miami Vice is a bland crime thriller.The acting is fine but the leads have no chemistry. Jamie Foxx was cast since he worked with Michael Mann on Collateral which was okay and I guess Colin Farrell was cast just because he's famous.Miami Vice is style over substance, the characters are weak. Mann worked on the series so I'm not sure why he made the film this way. I think he wanted to show off digital filmmaking again and he planned on fleshing out the characters in the sequel.Miami Vice is gritty and violent, apparently nothing like the show. The film is story driven so don't expect much action. Maybe lots of people expected an action film which would explain why the film bombed. Yes, the story is generic. Mann should of worked on the story since he didn't care about the characters.Overall, Miami Vice is a bland crime thriller. The film didn't need to be goofy but it would of been better. If you like the leads, you could check it out.",Miami Vice
156,HiddenVoice,Looked awesome in its style and visuals.Really cool looking film.,7,27 November 2006,"Too bad the film wasn't.One of the most disappointing films this year,along with Da Vinci and MI3 to name a few.Boring ,long and too slow,devoid of action.Action was minimum.The only time I saw action on screen throughout its 2hour plus running time was in the end for about 5 minutes or so,if I recall correctly.Other than that,I don't remember seeing much action.The main problem with the film was its weak script.Dialogues weak.Romance angles and sex were ineffective.The plot was going nowhere and gets confusing.And both the leads lacked chemistry,sadly.I can't believe this was made by Micheal Mann.But it's not entirely bad and it's worth watching,if only once.The cinematography was outstanding.It's the best looking film of the year,and its looks was what kept you interested.But beneath all the style and look,there wasn't much.I started watching the TV series right before its release,and it was really addictive.This film somehow tries to disconnect itself from the series and tries to reinvent it,only keeping the two lead characters.I loved the two leads and their chemistry and it featured more exciting action than this one.But still this is an above average flick,but quite disappointing one.This could've been a great film.All it needed was a little more action,a little work on the dialogues and reduce the amount of mumbling and heavy voices the actors used to sound cool and serious.It's very realistic but it's just too serious for its own good ,when I can't really take any of the plot elements much seriously.",Miami Vice
157,pookey56,Miami Mann,5,6 December 2006,"well, i speak two languages and can read and understand a third one, but i have trouble with gibberish, so i had a difficult time following the ""dialogue"" in this movie. it did leave me with some things to ponder: 1) if i pulled on Colin's mustache, would it just, peel off? 2) couldn't they have used some subtitles at the bottom, you know, so i could follow what the characters were saying? 3) who turned the lights off? 4) THERE'S the ocean...so it IS Miami then? 5) Who is Gong Li's agent now? o sure; she's Cuban... 6) Crockett and Tubbs were under cover agents busting up a drug cartel, right? 7) nice cars; nice houses... 8) will the movie break in to an MTV segment? 9) adjusting the brightness setting on my television isn't helping... 10) i counted three times where Colin changed the expression on his face. 11) i'm told there are Aryans in this film? is that what they meant by, merbygermmoogebe, arghgreha?The one thing that rang true for me in this film were the performances by Jamie Foxx and Naomie Harris. Both of them were good. As for Michael Mann, i would say that his greatest talent is in being able to recruit some great actors for his projects. He isn't in the same basement as Michael Bay, but if he keeps this up, he will be...he will be..... This humourless, flat, gobble-dee-gook film had some pretentious cinematography, big explosions, and gun fights. But who could tell who was shooting at whom? Not that it mattered much. The ending credits were in blue against a black background, and i found them unreadable. at least this is consistent. i wonder; were the people in this film glad for this? i wonder if Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas watched this? It's a reason to make them proud of their series. By the way; did Colin have that mustache right at the beginning of the film? I've seen worse films, but this movie is better suited as a foreign language film from another solar system.",Miami Vice
158,pressboard,Dangerously Off Kilter and a little silly,4,1 August 2006,"The best part of Michael Mann's movie are the action scenes (no surprise)and the worst moments are the romance arcs. The one involving Sonny drags out too long and in the end falls flat. I was almost laughing at the long puppy-dog looks given by Colin Farrell every time he is parted from Gong Li. I did not believe this romance and too much time was spent establishing this connection which screwed up the pacing and action of the story. As an action movie it would have been fairly good, but as an action/romance - no go. The relationship between Jamie Foxx and Naomie Harris was much more believable and interesting. She played her character with a lot of strength and sexiness and less time was spent establishing this connection. I not sure how much more can be said. This is a very one dimensional movie. It is not the original series, but does not need to be. I do not recommend this movie for any reason - wait for the DVD.",Miami Vice
159,crazyrabbits,"Push it to the limit...no, not really",7,12 August 2006,"After watching the remake movie based on the popular 80's show ""Miami Vice"", I felt this was an interesting, but somewhat flawed film that suffers from a couple problems that keep it from becoming a truly great picture in the vein of Michael Mann's previous works like ""Collateral"" or ""Heat"", but I'll talk about the plot first.Basically, the film is about two Miami P.D. vice cops, James ""Sonny"" Crockett (played by Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (played by Jamie Foxx), who stumble onto a multinational drug-running operation after an informant named Alfonzo gives up the identities of undercover DEA agents. To break into this ring, the two cops go undercover and start a business deal with drug boss Jesus Montoya, and like Tubbs says in the film, ""there's undercover, then there's in over your head"", as the two men realize this may cost them everything. Meanwhile, Sonny decides to go romance the business partner of Montoya, a woman named Isabella (played by Gong Li), which could be problematic for him.I guess the first thing I should mention is that this film has no opening credits, no mention of who the actors are, or even where the setting is. It just sort of drops you into the action. For some people, this may confuse them and make them upset, but personally, I thought it was a good way to put the audience right into the plot. Seriously, if you've been following the production of this film at all, you probably have an idea already who the main characters are and what the basic plot is, so my thought is that Mr. Mann doesn't take his audience for a bunch of idiots.The plot is interesting, but I guess it's also something that hinders the film, as it really does feel like an extended version of one of the old series' episodes. It really made me feel like there was a sense of immediacy, and yet, also a sense of impending doom, as these two guys escape quite a few close calls in the two-hour film. From almost getting killed by Montoya's men to almost getting blown away by a bomb hidden in a trailer, these guys really get put through the wringer. I felt that Sonny's romance with Isabella really impeded the flow of the film. Seriously, he goes on a boat with her and the next 20+ minutes of the movie are them having sex and sharing time together. Sure, it's nice to see them having a good time, but what happened to everyone else? The acting in the film was solid work all around. I think the most important thing to mention is that there is virtually no character development in the film. We simply see these two guys busting crime and going undercover, and we get the barest minimum of information about the people. We have to decide who they based on their actions or their facial expressions, and let that decide the way the story goes. This is why the acting works well, in my opinion. Colin Farrell plays a man who looks like he's been doing this job a long time, and it shows in his actions. He's probably the strongest thing about this film. However, other characters (like Tubbs, Castillo, the head drug boss, the organizer guy in the apartment near the beginning, etc.) have virtually no character development whatsoever, and only serve to drive the plot, which I didn't like.What I also liked is that the film really is more of a team-based movie than simply ""Crockett and Tubbs all the time"". The other members (especially the woman named Gina, who really shines in one of the film's pivotal action scenes) all play a part in the completion of the mission, which I liked. As well, the action is very quick, very bloody and very urban. There are no fancy camera moves or slow-motion deaths. It feels a bit more realistic than the 80's show.The film-making will probably be one thing that throws people off, and it did for me to some extent as well. Near the beginning of the film and in the final gunfight at the boat, it is often very difficult to see what the heck is going on because the camera is moving around a lot. Still, for the most part, the film looks absolutely beautiful, as it was shot in high definition, The ending is another thing that was sort of in the middle for me. While I thought the downer ending of Sonny having to leave Isabella and the drug dealer getting away worked well, the final shots were really reminiscent of Mann's earlier work, Collateral. Still, it was a fitting end for a dark police drama.Bottom Line: While I liked the film a lot, there were things in it that kept it from being truly great. I give this film a 7 out of 10. If you want to watch it, get it on DVD when it comes out.",Miami Vice
160,filmbuff1974,Very Dark!,6,7 June 2009,"I remember seeing the posters for this movie in the subway stations. I am a huge fan of the series and for the decade of the eighties in general and so I was looking forward to a movie that would bring back this very eighties iconic television series. Now, I knew that the movie would probably re-invent some of the elements in the series to make it more of a ""feature"" than small screen, but not like this!Let's just say I felt an overwhelming sense that Michael Mann went too far in re-envisioning the original series. I have never been so depressed after a movie viewing than in Miami Vice. The whole movie was so dark (literally and figuratively) that I found myself depressed. The original series had a dark atmosphere, but there was light at the end of the tunnel. I have never been to Miami and after watching this film, I'll likely avoid it, but when it came to the series, I never finished watching an episode of the original feeling that way about Miami. I would definitely say that Miami Vice is the darkest Film Noir I have ever seen committed to celluloid!",Miami Vice
161,editor-299,"Mann's 'Vice' is dull, pointless and plot less",2,26 July 2006,"Another in a long series of disappointing summer 2006 films, ""Miami Vice"" has director Michael Mann doing his best (or, in this case, his worst) Terrence Malik impersonation and delivering the cinematic equivalent of watching paint dry. I suppose he viewed star Colin Farrell's last movie, ""The New World,"" which took Malik almost as long to tell as the actual discovery of America took, and tried to emulate that effort.Sadly, what should have been a slam-bang mid-summer action/adventure flick was turned into an incomprehensible bowl of mush that induces drowsiness almost immediately. Those operating heavy machinery should avoid this film at all costs. Okay, I'll go even further than that ""everybody"" should avoid this film at all cost. There. I've covered myself.Another poorly-conceived TV screen to big screen translation that has fallen on its face. Don't believe us? Then just think about ""The Honeymooners,"" ""Starsky & Hutch,"" ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" ""Dukes Of Hazzard,"" ""Bewitched,"" ""Garfield"" and ""Twilight Zone,"" just to name a few (the only successes in this genre include the ""Mission: Impossible"" and ""Brady Bunch"" movies).Mann, who helmed one of my favorite films from 2004, ""Collateral,"" again has Jamie Foxx in a key role; but unlike his frustrated cab driver trying to outwit Zen hit man Tom Cruise, there is nothing for the Oscar-winner to fall back on. Not his character (one-dimensional Miami detective Rico Tubbs), not his partner/co-star, Farrell as Sonny Crockett (the two have about as much chemistry as O.J. and Nicole Brown Simpson), not Mann's light-and-get-way direction, and certainly not in his script (which calls for each lead to grunt, look mean and mumble incoherently).This worked with John Wayne and Clint Eastwood at times, but Mann also commits the cardinal sin of crime dramas  trading character development for action sequences when no characters ever get developed. We're left with the most boring two-plus hours since, well, ""The New World"" (at least that picture had Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography).Fans of the original TV series will not likely be happy, either, considering all of the elements of that show (flashy cops, high-energy music - they don't even have the classic, driving Jan Hammer theme song, interesting plots, and fast-paced action) are all missing from this Universal dud, the plot of which concerns the duo infiltrating either an Aryan Nation drug-smuggling ring or a Colombian crime lord's internal operations. Two female co-stars/love interests, Naomie Harris (as Det. Trudy Joplin), and Isabella (Gong Li  is she Asian or Cuban?!), add absolutely nothing to the story but monotonous love scenes.If you just have to have your Crockett and Tubbs fix, however, your best bet is to avoid this film like the Bird Flu, and simply buy the series DVDs and relive those wonderful, funderful mid-1980s when television was simple, peace abounded in the Middle East, Reaganomics was working and all was right with the world.",Miami Vice
162,inxsfett,"""The magic has gone...""",6,4 August 2014,"I gonna be very quick this time.The major problem of this movie is simply the chemistry of the main actors.I not saying that Colin Farrel and Jamie Foxx are bad actors Actually i think they are good(specially Foxx) but the chemistry between the characters are all gone i mean they have CERO magic CERO mixing nothing have the character that you be interesting in them.All the cool things of the 80's has gone (the music,the style,the close,the girls,the cars,etc) so is a really shame because the movie was directed by the MAESTRO (and creator of the original TV series) Michael Mann.Look if you ignore the name of the movie is a good action-thriller but if you want to see Miami VICE:THE MOVIE you be very disappointment.",Miami Vice
163,Chance_Boudreaux19,"Style over substance but oh, what style",8,10 January 2021,"I can certainly understand the criticisms of those that dislike this film. It's nothing like the TV show, it's slow and the plot can be confusing, simple and maybe a bit boring. Some say that good movies have characters that are alive in a way that you can imagine them living their life and the ways in which they spend their free time outside the boundaries of the movie that they occupy. I certainly couldn't tell you what the two main characters of Miami Vice do when they are not working, well apart from the fact that Crockett is a fiend for mojitoes. But that can also be seen as a strength of the film with the characters being so dedicated to their work that nothing else exists for them beyond it.The movie is so focused on the procedure that when the romantic moments happen in the movie they add the much needed emotion into the picture and the character's lives. At least that is the case with Crockett as Tubbs' has less personality and he doesn't get a lot of development. Both Jaime Foxx and Colin Farrell make the characters cool as can be but Farrell is the one that shines. He has a look of a man that loathes the world and wants nothing more than to get the job done. The romance between him and Li Gong feels genuine and exciting. The scenes on the speedboat and in Cuba are fantastic and I went back to rewatch them a few times on YouTube after watching the movie. The dialogue between the two is a bit heavy handed at times but it works within the confines of the movie that takes itself very seriously. A large portion of the movie centres around the chemistry between the two of them and when the ending happens it feels earned and perfect.This movie is definitely one where style takes precedence over substance. It's a movie that you feel more than you try to understand. Harmony Korine said he loves watching the movie without paying too much attention to the dialogue and I can see where he is coming from. Mann makes sure to create an atmosphere that totally encapsulates those that let themselves be engrossed by it. He truly is one of the better directors out there and proves once again that no one can film a city at night as well as he can. Moreover, his emphasis on the environment, the sky, the characters moving really adds to the mood of the movie. And that opening, I love the way the movie just throws the viewer right into it without explaining anything. On top of that the music choices for the most part are excellent and enhance the scenes that they are utilised in. Miami Vice isn't as great as Heat which is a perfect movie as far as I am concerned. In fact the lack of character development and the lacklustre plot made me debate whether to give it a 7 or an 8. Ultimately the style won me over too much and I had to give it the higher score. It's essentially a $100 million art movie with elements of action. Oh and when the action happens it's excellent as always in Mann movies with fantastic sound effects, mainly those of the gunshots. Some say the movie is underrated but I'm not sure I would call it that. It's what it is, a very specific, serious, moody movie and I understand why some dislike it but I'm glad it gained a cult following and it's probably a movie I will revisit in the future.",Miami Vice
164,StarCastle99,Ugh - Not Worth the Price of Admission,2,30 July 2006,"Once a picture is on the screen the role of the director is subtle. For example, Spielberg uses a lot of crane shots, but only in advancing the picture. Michael Mann, the director of Miami Vice, seems to be shouting: ""Look at Me - I'm the Director"". Well, some advice: Just because there are cameras that can be hand held, it doesn't mean they should be used beyond all reason. Second, dialog is meant to be heard. Unless you read lips, half the dialog in this picture is fuzzy or inaudible. I know that's not an accident. The director is there while doing the re-recording mix. Somehow Mr. Mann thinks it's more suspenseful when you don't know what's going on. Actually it's more confusing.My final gripe is the film is too long by at least 20 minutes. Mann is known as a director who doesn't take kindly to advice or criticism. If I were making a movie tomorrow, he'd be the last on my long list. The short list is for those who can tell a story.",Miami Vice
165,KaZenPhi,Made a decade or two too late,5,27 April 2021,"Michael Mann has had a very checkered track record over his career. He's made arguably the best action thriller ever with Heat and in my opinion the best adaptation of Thomas Harris' work with Manhunter, but he also got lost in his own vision after his glory days in the eighties and nineties making several confusing and sometimes deeply unsatisfying movies since.Remaking Miami Vice was not a terrible choice though. Mann worked as an executive producer on the original and revisiting it now it's obvious how his handwriting is all over it. Considering the contraints in budget and especially content of 80s television a movie adaptation that could realize the source material's full potential had lots of promise. However this adaptation turned out rather unfocused, generic and rather unexciting with only the rare hint at what it could have been.The story throws us right in medias res like an episode of the show and plays out pretty much the same way. Given the length of the movie and the weak material the story is woven from the constant turns are as predictable as they are tiring though.A mediocre episode from the show was 45 minutes, you could watch it or just skip to a better one, the movie clocks in at over two hours and it's the only one we get.While it seems a bit quaint now the original Miami Vice was for its time a stylish, atmospheric, occassionally gritty, entertaining and iconic cop show with a great synth soundtrack by Jan Hammer and creative use of several contemporary songs. Whatever 80s cheese factor could drag it down now is intercepted by the charisma of the main leads and their supporting cast as well as its sense for atmosphere. Its strongest moments are the dramatic music video like sections devoid of dialogue where all the talking is done through music and visuals alone. Now Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are fine actors and Zhang Yimou mainstay Gong Li is shining the brightest out of the cast, but there is virtually no chemistry between the leads. In fact they rarely seem to share scenes together. Not turning this into a complete remake and an origin story was a good choice but in turn you have to give us some reason to care about or understand the characters and how they are connected.This is where the movie falls apart both as an adaptation and its own original creation. All the characterization we're supposed to get is entirely from the original tv show yet the movie adaptation strays at times so far from it, the characters, setting and in fact the entire Miami Vice brand are almost completely unrecognizable, which leaves us only with a fairly generic mid-2000s cop movie without any true highlights.Ironically this movie feels more dated now than the tv show despite the latter being so firmly entrenched in its time period. From the lacklustre cinematography with the usual suspects of choppy editing and the shaky hand-held camera work that ruined all the other Michael Mann projects and many a thriller movie in that decade, to the bland score(complete with a puzzlingly bad alt-rock cover of ""in the air tonight"" that plays during the finale) and the unrelatable gruff one-note characters. The moments are too few and far between where you feel a connection with anything happening on screen and where the songs used enhance the mood of a scene like the original managed to do so well.Had the Michael Mann of yesteryear been at the helm here, this could have been an exciting new version of Miami Vice. As is, this was a bland and mostly forgettable experience that just happens to share the same name.",Miami Vice

I am so glad she is finally finding her way into major Western films with last year's Memoirs of a Geisha, this year's Miami Vice & next years Young Hannibal (the latest in the Hannibal Lector franchise). In Miami Vice she is given a major role that she inhabits totally. There has been some criticism of her accent but her English is just fine with me - she also speaks a little Spanish in this flick since her character is half-Cuban. Gong Li has an incredible body - body of work that is & I am so happy her career is finally taking off in the West.

168,QStrum,I'm suing the filmmakers for the gash I got on my forehead from the seat in front when I was nodding off violently while watching this boring film...,4,30 August 2006,"Okay. Michael Mann is a great director. Definitely deserves to be on the A-list. Miami Vice was a pretty cool show. It was sexy and cool, and I was only nine when I thought this. This doesn't mean that I shouldn't question the need for a big screen version of the hit crime series.I enjoyed the plot, even though it came off as cliché to me. I appreciated it for what it was. An action film. I was really getting into the action sequences.However, the filmmakers failed to make me care about the characters in the first half of the film. Foxx wasn't at his best (Academy Award winner?) and Farrell wasn't believable as his character. The plot wasn't clear to me for some time as well. Being that I was forced to rely heavily on the dialog for a complicated plot with a few twists, I missed a few things here and there because all the whispering made a few words difficult for me to pick up (my bad). I also found myself struggling to believe that Farrell's Asian love interest in the film was in close cahoots with these drug lords. I believe it can happen but not in the world of this film the filmmakers didn't take the time to develop. All of this struggling, struggling to hear key dialog, struggling to believe, struggling to care, made me dream of being in a better place during the film -- like my sofa or my bed. I was nodding off through the second Act of the film.The characters were poorly developed as well, partially the reason why I didn't care. I thought Mann could've benefited from popping in the 10th Anniversary DVD of ""Heat"" and remind himself of what he did with this action masterpiece. He could've taken a note from his expertise at using visuals to tell the story of ""Heat"" while analyzing the character arcs he had brilliantly crafted for the film as well.In MiamiVice -- It was when a member of Foxx and Farrell's team was kidnapped that I started to care. By then, it was too late. Although the action scene in the end was awesome and the love conflict that followed was engaging, the film wasn't worth my time. I give this film a 4 out of 10.",Miami Vice
169,Strider_1978,"Gritty, realistic, honest, with a touch of heart.",7,27 July 2006,"The trailer gave me doubts. Colin Farrell gave me doubts.I saw a pre screening at Universal last night for free and was glad that we made the trip.I have seen a lot of mediocrity in the last x amount of months and was pleasantly surprised that this film was not, the usual flimsy scripted fx happy Hollywood blockbuster.I did not like Mann's Collateral, but by this time I had got used to Mann's camera work and methods. This film got me from the opening nightclub scenes to the ending. I am a fan of the film 'Traffic', which also showed us the very real side of narcotic trafficking in the United States. To to see another film that did not try to woo me with special effects, but instead told a story through a gritty, grainy camera lense, was rather refreshingly good.I think that had this film tried to tell the story using normal camera angles it would have failed to serve up what it did. Mann's direction actually draws us into the film, makes us look at the characters rather than nice looking sets. You can be on that boat,in that car, seeing what the actor is conveying emotionally and believe it.Vice carries with it it's own cool, a street cool. The soundtrack is very good and I will be making a purchase soon.So there we have the high points, the honesty, the realism, the gunfights that actually sound like gunfights that revolve around luck and chance rather than fancy, far fetched work. And to boot, the emotion the film leaves you with.Yes, there is a very real non Hollywood stylised love play at work here. You can believe that the characters love each other, and it does not require a romantic setting to prove it. The ending shot, which I will not disclose, leaves us with a kind of nobility that is far from two characters moving into the sunset or 'bad boys' one liners.The lows are in simple acting flaws and the use of bad language that I presume was written to appeal to the target audience. But in my opinion this film did not need such sexual profanities; It carried it's own adult themes well. There is a particular scene involving a British actor who has developed a southern draawl for his character that would have been fine if it did not seem a little. . too theatrical. I felt that that scene, not so much in the acting but in the scripting (all characters involved) brought the dignity of the film down a little; Simply because it tried too hard to appeal to a newer generation of movie goers, rather than sticking to it's already established adult feel. Samuel L Jackson never needed to state that he wanted to pop a cap in anyones a** in pulp fiction. He was already radiating that cool yet intense demeanor. Colin Farrell is far from excellent with his dialogue, but his determined facial expressions seem to help pull off what his verbal ability cannot. Standing there with his phone on top of the building stating that he is Miami Dade pd, it is just not entirely believable. It was good, therefore that his side kick yet not so distanced friend Tubbs (Fox) held his own very well without needing to open his mouth.I recommend Miami Vice to those who do not want to watch standard Hollywood stylised tripe, but who are prepared to follow a story.7.5 out of ten",Miami Vice

171,UncleTantra,Disappointing,3,17 August 2006,"I had hopes for this movie, because I actually liked Miami Vice the TV show. It was visually stunning and changed the nature of both television and films. Mann was one of the first directors to use music as an integral part of the storytelling; one can make a case for his films being a series of music videos. It's actually rare in a Mann movie to hear periods of dialog *without* music behind them.That part of his film-making hasn't changed in the new movie. The fascination with glitz and visuals is still there, set against music that he feels makes the visuals more powerful. The problem with the movie in my opinion is that certain other parts of his film-making are missing in action in this new action movie.Mann has always been fascinated by the ""ethical bad guy,"" the guy who may live outside the law, but *never* strays outside his own internal set of ethical rules for how life should be lived. Think Dylan's line, ""To live outside the law you must be honest."" Think Okla (Willie Nelson) in Thief, ""Lie to no one. If it's somebody close to you you're going to ruin it with a lie. And if they're a stranger who the f*ck are they you got to lie to?"" Think the non-mainstream but consistent ethics of De Niro's character in Heat. Think even the warped but consistent ethics that underlie Tom Cruise's character in Collateral. That's what has always interested me about Michael Mann's vision as a director -- he has consistently blurred the line between good and evil, showing that there is some of each in every person.So we come to Miami Vice the movie. Action it's got, in spades. And it's got more flashy toys -- Ferraris, guns, planes, and fast boats -- than you can shake a stick at. It's even got a few good actors, who have a history of fleshing their film characters out to make them three dimensional, when the script allows them to. This one sadly doesn't.In the new Miami Vice movie there is almost none of the ambivalence about good and evil that marks the rest of Mann's work. The good guys are good and the bad guys are bad, period. Sadly, many of the episodes of Miami Vice the TV series were better written and filmed than this movie. This one has the oldest and most hackneyed plot in the world (cop falls for bad lady, and has to struggle with whether to bust her when he busts the other bad guys), with almost no subtlety or ""blurring the lines"" whatsoever. Color me majorly disappointed.The fascinating thing is that I suspect the film is going to do very well at the box office, in part because of all the glitzy toys and the stupid, lower-than-TV-level plot. It'll be a big hit, and perpetuate Michael Mann's career as a director whose films make money. And because of that he may go on to make interesting films in the future. I just wish he'd made one in Miami Vice.",Miami Vice
172,AndrewPhillips,Not that good,6,17 August 2006,"I was looking forward to this film, after all, the trailers have been out for ages and it looked and sounded cool, alas it was not to be.There wasn't much of a story to speak of, apart from Jamie Foxx the acting was only OK. He did a good job with a script that should have been re written 50 times. It just didn't feel stylish enough, yes I know the fast cars and boats were there but it was just a bit boring.I also couldn't understand the lead actress sometimes, though that could have been because I was loosing the will to live. It was over long and in fact they could have cut about half an hour off the run time.So that's the moans out of the way, there were some good bits and it's always good to end on those, the soundtrack was good and I liked the shooting bits, though that does make me sound like a little bloodthirsty, I'm not, it's just that they had good pace and were well executed, excuse the pun! The whole film was dark lighting wise and it wasn't until we got out of the cinema in daylight that you realised it. So all in all OK to rent on DVD but don't waste your money at cinema",Miami Vice
173,baba44713,Good down-to-earth action movie,8,8 September 2006,"I'm reading all the bad comments here and I cannot believe these are about the same movie I watched yesterday. The only reason I see is that the majority of those are from mindless action-deprived teenagers who expected a video-game like run-and-gun action movie like MI2 or something. There's so many of those ""too much talking"", ""dull and boring"" and similar complaints. What's even more perplexing is that teenagers shouldn't be this movie's first choice of target audience - hey, it's ""Miami Vice"", people who enjoyed this TV show are now late 20's, early 30's, and they should enjoy a more down-to-earth approach.That said, I must say I really enjoyed Miami Vice. Sure it has almost othing to do with the series, but as respectful as I am of the TV show, it was such an iconic 80's thing you really couldn't recreate it truthfully any more. Pastel suits, 5-minute synth-music interludes... it just wouldn't work.So Mann did the best thing he could. He stripped ""Vice"" to the basics - two vice detectives trying to bust a drug-smuggling operation, some flashy cars and speedboats, good soundtrack. This is where all similarities stop. The rest is a gritty, down-to-earth movie with more talk then action. I find this a good thing. I don't need my main character jumping from two trains, five helicopters and a few buildings in the space of 15 minutes, then dusting off and saying a witty remark. I like movies that at least try to be realistic.I can see the movie is not for everyone. Not enough action. Dangling sub-plots. Talk, talk, talk. Characterization. Confusing and hectic shoot-out scenes. No snapping remarks. No comic reliefs. Explosions and bullets actually kill people. Boy, you can find so much wrong with this movie.Anyway, I enjoyed it. It was a nice break from the usual Hollywood crap-o-rama, it hit my nostalgic note a bit and it kept my attention with an actual plot, not a string of action-scenes tied together with flimsy story-line. My recommendations.8/10",Miami Vice
174,mbanwait,Miami Vice = Semi Cool,7,6 August 2006,"I've been a Michael Mann fan since Russell Crowe starred in the directors best movie The Insider. Having re-visited Heat and watched Mann transform Tom Cruise into a villain in Colateral, I was keenly awaiting the movie adaptation of the TV series, Miami Vice.I saw the teaser trailer a few months ago and was instantly draw in to Manns camera-work and cinematography. Nothing was said about the plot during the trailer. I though both Farell and Foxx looked like they would be able to pull of looking cool in the flick. As well i'd read that Mann was going to make the movie darker than the pastel coated TV series (of which i'd watched maybe one episode in my life).Unfortunately, Mann achieves only average success in following up his other crime capers involving cops and robbers. The film does not have a coherent plot for the average viewer. I believe Mann deliberately chose a style of editing which was choppy and unlinked. But Mann cannot be entirely blamed for this as the budget ran over due to hurricanes in the South, which led to a ballooning budget (over $135 Million). I am certain the suits made him cut out significant parts of the film. There are rumours that Mann filmed a boat race sequence that was canned.I don't think the film entirely fails though. The film is an exercise in style. There is no doubt that Mann has a great eye for framing a shot. (million times better than that hack Michael Bay). In addition, there are 3 gun battles which will send your ears ringing due to Mann's attention to authenticity.It can be said that Collin Farell has more screen time than Foxx. If Farell had more of a story to work with and more action to partake in, this film could have been the one that catapulted him into super-star status which has eluded him ever since his stunning debut in Tigerland.But i do think this film will be appreciated as time goes on. Almost all of Mann's films age like a fine wine. Heat was considered an average cops and robbers story 10 years ago. Yet, now both critics and audiences say that it is a masterpiece and one of the best films of the 90's. As well as The Insider, which is IMHO, Crowe and Manns finest hour.I enjoyed Miami Vice even though i expected a lot more from Mann in terms of a storyline. I do hope that there is an extended cut of this film on DVD. Maybe closer to 3 hours in order to fill in a plot and a few more action sets.",Miami Vice
175,larry.launders,Save your money and go see a GOOD movie instead of this.,2,4 August 2006,"Let's start with the good things - Jaime Foxx and Colin Farrell do a great job with their characters. Everything looks good. The movie doesn't waste much time getting started.That's about all I can come up with. This one almost completely failed to hold my attention, has some major pacing problems that make the movie feel incredibly long in parts, and the story/plot line(s) never really accomplish much of anything other than showing by golly, the bad guys really are bad.For myself, the problems I have with this movie can be laid directly at the feet of the director, maybe a little bit with the writer. This movie impersonates an episode of the Miami Vice television show with two exceptions - it is much longer and far more boring.",Miami Vice
176,dreamdemon-1,A disappointment,7,7 August 2006,"Like many have already noticed, this is a 'thing' thrown to the public by master director Mann. If you're a fan of his work, the only advice I can give is: don't go see it. After introspective work like ""Heat"" and ""Collateral"", this particular movie is just action and not very spectacular either. The story is very linear and picks up the main duo from a bust and throws them into an undercover mission. Why this is so important and how did they get so attached to their new job is a mystery. Actually it's a whole puzzle that might try to feed the audience the concept of love at first sight (since at the time the two jump at the fed who wants to make the small bust, they don't know much save for the fact they 'asset' died because of the villains they get involved with). As for how they ping-pong in and out of the law, this idea is non-existent as they don't do much beyond their undercover duty, save for the fact Farrel's char helps his 'love' escape arrest. This point is also the most annoying thing about the movie. James and Isabella just get hitched out of the blue. No development, no insight, they spend a night together and end up in bed. The storyteller wants to feed to the public the idea that Isabella is tough criminal mastermind and partner of the Columbian mob boss, that lives for her 'job' and James shows her other sides of life. If she is such a hardened criminal how come she jumps in bed with the first 'hand' the boss hires, especially since she didn't even pay much attention to them and only seem them twice. As for the love blossom, it's really out of the blue, due to the lack of character development. Every step is predictable and disappointing and the acting doesn't help. While Foxx is right on in his character and even manages to give some personality to Tubbs, Farrel is flat as cardboard and looks more like a scared child ready to cry than a tough guy. What saves the movie is Foxx and the rest of the police crew that have a personality and the action scenes they do together. Elizabeth Rodrigues is absolutely cool and looks more of a bad-ass than Farrel (I love the scene where she describes the effect of a bullet to the lower brain to the thug with the bomb before sharpshooting him).All in all, the movie isn't worth the ticket money to see at the cinema but might make an entertaining moment at home with pop-corn and friends.",Miami Vice
177,Gezzerboy,What A PIle Of Dross,2,6 August 2006,Having been a fan of the original series I was expecting great things from the 2 well known lead actors.How wrong I was... After 30 mins I would have quite happily left the cinema had I not paid to go in. Where was the action (there wasn't any) until the very end of the film.Farrel and Foxx barely speak 2 words to each other throughout the film and it seemed the director had 2 write 2 different story lines one for each actor...The only thing I can say good about the film is the fact that the music score is very good with some wicked dance and heavier tracks throughoutTrust me. Save your money and don't even bother with this pile of poo.,Miami Vice
178,brooks250,Worth a Second Watch,8,6 October 2018,"I must admit as a Michael Mann fan, going all the way back to Thief, I was a bit underwhelmed when this movie first came out on '06. But a second and third viewing later on impresses with how Mann still has all of his talents on full display (the perfect music mix, the moody lighting, the clean and brutal fight and shoot out scenes and ,yes, a couple very hot sex scenes) OK, the dialogue and much of the setup are ridiculous. It's nowhere nearly as realistic as Thief or Heat. Still, this is very enjoyable filmmaking. Now that it's on Amazon, there's no reason not to have a fun 2:15. I'm disappointed there was no sequel.",Miami Vice
179,tom-darwin,"New Stars, Cars, Shades & Hair Gel but Same Old Mann",5,20 February 2007,"Forget about crystal meth, Special K, Ecstacy and Prozac. Take a trip back to the mythical days of junk bonds and leveraged buyouts, when a Prince poured Purple Rain, Oliver North poured it on thick and Dr. Huxtable always knew best. In Miami the blowdried but fearless defenders of Right & Justice prowled the streets in a Ferrari to ward off foreign pharmacists with more advanced weaponry than Gorbachev. Miami detectives Crockett (Farrell, who was still watching ""Speed Racer"" when Don Johnson was The Mann)& Tubbs (Foxx) are seconded to the Feds in order to infiltrate a multi-layered Colombian mob with unlimited resources in assault rifles, planes, electro-surveillance & Bodies by Soloflex. The mob hires Our Heroes, who've had their identities carefully crafted into hardened hoods, as a new means of getting the goods into the States. Running block for CrocketTubbs is the enigmatic Lt. Castillo (Henley), who's back though Black, a rotund patrician instead of Olmos's ghostly bureaucrat, though Castillo still hasn't learned to use articles or pronouns any better since the Reagan days. There are babes, of course, tawny and naked, but they're mostly cops, which is a bore since Mann has little talent for female characters who don't simper. The exception is the mistress & negotiator of Mr. Big (Gong), delegated to supervise CrocketTubbs. There's no more point to the movie than there was to the show. Everyone just looks wistful, troubled and determined in the midst of their surf, sunshine & zillion-dollar toys. The brooding is punctuated with threats, flexing, betrayal and the ritual Pointing of The Firearms, yet there's astonishingly little action. The photography is so impressive that you'd think you were watching ""National Geographic,"" or maybe an ad for Carnival Cruises. If Crockett is supposed to be a scruffily beautiful Dick Tracy, then Farrell portrays him better than Tom Hanks could do (oh, wait, what was Hanks doing back in the eighties?). The other actors are all suitably gorgeous, menacing, treacherous or doomed, as needed. Four outstanding actors--Foxx, Gong, Hinds and Henley--aren't enough to make a Ferrari into a Donatello, but then who could? Foxx brings a spirited fire into Tubbs that is a bit of shock to those who remember the dapper Tonto of P.M. Thomas. Gong, one of the most courageous & talented portrayers ever to grace the screen, is ghostly, sad & sexy but the script doesn't give her a chance to be mysterious. Plenty of guns, but no attempt to give Crockett a signature sidearm like his old Bren Ten or Bond's perennial Walther. In fact, there's little product placement, a technique that I thought Mann pioneered. Die-hard fans who need their Vice shouldn't be too disappointed, but others will wonder why CrocketTubbs go on about cocaine in the age of Bin Laden & the Patriot Act. In 15 or 20 years we'll have a ""24"" movie, no doubt. Until then, there are still ""Vegas,"" ""21 Jump Street,"" ""Remington Steele,"" ""TJ Hooker"" and ""Sledge Hammer"" to bring to the big screen. And Don Johnson himself can get back into movies by resurrecting ""Barnaby Jones.""",Miami Vice
180,OllieZ,Crisp cold celluloid; a gritty take on the 80's crime show.,8,3 January 2007,"Firstly, let's establish that this is film is in the same vein as three of Mann's other work; Heat, Thief and Collateral. All four films are completely different, each of them containing a similar aesthetic. Miami Vice looks more real than the other films Mann has made; the HD cameras really give the film an aesthetic edge.So yes, Mann has succeeded in bringing those urban landscapes to life again. Heat, with it steely blues, Collateral with diverse flowers of colour. Miami Vice shows us a dense urban landscape, with colour, texture and detail.But is it a good film? Thankfully yes, though not as good as Heat. The first time through, the film is difficult to understand, all thanks to the actors mumbling their lines. This comes off as too moody. Coupled with the torrid storms in the distance, you'd think that Mann had gone all depressing on us.However, the second time through, the film is rewarding. The performances are good on the whole. I particularly liked Farrell as Crockett. He showed just the right amount moody/mysterious, without becoming a complete tortured soul. Foxx comes off worse, trying to be too cool with his silent stares, but still manages to convince.Gong Li creates a convincing character, but her accent is sometimes difficult to understand. Nonetheless, I was sold on her chemistry with Farrell, though they were prone to shag a lot.The undercover antics of Crockett and Tubbs make for taut, adult and confusing crime film. Though the first half of the film struggles to get the motor running, the last half fares much better. Mann directs two tense ""action"" scenes. The camera is usually hand-held, and the movement of the battle methodically moves forward.This film is not for action freaks. It is not like the TV show. What it does have is an intelligent story, wonderful images, city life and mature characters.",Miami Vice
181,mick987g,Avoid the Vice,1,31 July 2006,"During this movie I was wondering how I would explain how bad this movie was on a scale of 1-10. There is no number rating for this movie So I thought how about James Cameron's Titanic is being the worst and The Big Leobowski being one of the better examples Michael Mann's version of Miami Vice runs a close second to Titanic. It is two hours of my life that I can't get back I don't know if Mann was trying for this effect or not but the filming of it was very grainy and the cinematography was horrible.Close ups were choppy at best.Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx seemed to be going through the motions. Can you say, ""Taking the money and running?"" It took Pirates out of first place, only because it was a curious factor In my opinion, I think you should wait till it comes out on video or pay per view. It's so not worth double-digit dollars",Miami Vice
182,hakeemtarabulsi,Very Cheap Picture,4,11 March 2021,"Well, the story has been touched a thousand times over years, and there was nothing different nor impressive about this version.Many scenes were shot in the darkness and lots of fire shooting. Most importantly, the plot was lousy.",Miami Vice
183,brainofj72,Not What It Could Have Been...,6,1 August 2006,"What comes to mind when you think of ""Miami Vice""? Most likely, wild pastels, synthesizers, and bikinis, right? Well, forget about all that. Director Michael Mann, who long ago directed said '80s series, has morphed himself into a well-known master of tough crime films, most notably Heat and, more recently, Collateral. Not surprisingly, this Miami Vice is an entirely different animal than what you may remember.FBI agents Sonny Crockett and Rico Stubbs, now played by Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx (respectively), are penetrating undercover into an international ring of violent, high-tech drug dealers, and they're getting in deeper than anyone before them. It's only a matter of time before their personal lives become involved and their loved ones thrust into danger.It seems fairly apparent, even from the previews alone, that Mann is trying to recapture the glory of Collateral. With Jamie Foxx in a co-starring role and that same gritty, lo-fi cinematography, he isn't exactly trying to hide it. Admittedly, it is a great look for this type of film  you can virtually feel the warm Miami breeze breathing down the back of your neck. However, I'm not thrilled about the recasting of Foxx, whom I find to be one of the most overrated actors in recent memory. He always seems to play the same character in every role, and this is no exception. Farrell isn't exactly a superb actor, either, but I guess Mann was going for star power in the lead roles, and I suppose he got that.But the film's faults certainly don't lie with the actors alone  Miami Vice suffers from the same pacing problems as Heat. The film opens with an intriguingly cryptic sequence and closes with a crackling shootout, but it sags throughout the mid-section. And it doesn't help that this mid-section is about one hour and forty-five minutes long. While Mann does manage to maintain a pretty good atmosphere throughout, the majority of what happens is rather predictable and uninteresting. For some reason, Mann seems preoccupied with focusing on romantic subplots instead of the actual plot, and again, they're quite uninspired.In the music department, Mann once again shows a predilection toward Moby and Audioslave. In fact, there is so much Audioslave that he should have just caved and hired Cornell and crew to score the whole damn thing. Well, not really, but you get the idea. The soundtrack is actually pretty weak  the Audioslave really only serves to enhance the already somewhat cheesy nature of the romantic scenes.But Mann does shine during the three action sequences the film has. He once again proves he has a knack for taut, intense, and unflinching shootouts. Sadly, they are just not enough to elevate Miami Vice to any kind of memorable status. With some better actors, a tighter script, and an ending less syrupy, Miami Vice could have been a very solid action flick, à la Collateral, but all we get is a bloated corpse of what could have been.",Miami Vice
184,teniente91,A Basket Case,5,7 August 2006,"''Miami Vice'' it's an action movie that it's disappointing me in a pain full way, I said on this page that I'm not an action fan but movies like ''Collateral'' has been a great entertainer for me cause it's from Michel Mann, but this picture in special is don't have the thing that the others pictures of Michel Mann have, but this movie it's good acting, the action it's so f*cking awesome, the sound it's murder, but in difference of the others movies by Mann all of us seen a movie for the two kinds of peoples: one the people like me that gone to the movies to seen good movies, and the assh*le people that just gone to the movies to pis in self's or seen the visual effects. But this movie is doesn't be to enjoy in no one of the two audiences for the screenplay, IT'S AWFUL, why, why is a basket case is so... uncompleted just show the things that make the characters not who are, is a basket case if don't show who are the characters the audience is gone to be tired and gone to be like me, SLEEP, is doesn't have any interesting thing like Michel Mann work on the TV series and the TV series is returned on VH1 is think that us know who are the characters you get tired of that is tired seen a movie like this if some one is gone to adapted something like this please complies to the f*cking audience",Miami Vice
185,SerpentMage,Really bad remake...,4,26 March 2011,"So I had to grudgingly watch this movie. When I was a teenager I watched Miami Vice. And recently due to reruns I was able to see most of them. What surprised me were two things; The series initially was very bigger than life and reflected the sign of the times, women in movies tend to have boob jobs these days.The movie instead of going with the times these days decided that somehow it was better to remake the 80's. What really boggled me is that it seems sunlight does not exist. Most of the movie is in the dark and well, this is ain't no sincity equal.Had I made this movie I would pulled it forward to these days. Instead of doing the classic evil Latino's and their coke they should have focused on the meth or ectasy labs of these days. Please don't start on the music choice. In the original Miami Vice series they chose hip and happening names. They tried to choose the same names except, well its dated! They should have chosen some happening techno or house names. That would have fit into the Miami scene and the current times.This movie is KITSCH!",Miami Vice

As a Broward County resident, who frequents Miami-Dade often, I was looking forward to seeing a vibrant city like Miami shown off again, this time on the big screen. Where did it go??? An opening nite club scene (SoBe or anywhere, USA!?), a few skyline shots from the ocean and that's it. The main settings are third world country dirt streets, back lot drug deals and an ugly Miami trailer park. For $135 million dollar budget. Yikes!! A few rented planes, some cigarette boats and two shoot-out scenes can't cost that much.So... OK, I guess I can live with that disappointment, bring on Sonny & Tubbs and that Michael Mann style. The plot immediately drops the characters right in the thick of an FBI drug heist gone bad (don't they all!?). No background, no character development, like I know this guys from 20+ years ago. Sorry, these aren't the guys I knew. They almost never talk to each other, and when they do, what the hell are they talking about? No humor (or any attempt), no chemistry, no comradarie. I can honestly say I never cared less for two ""heros"" in a movie, ever! And I saw the original ""Bad Boys"" !! In summary, a Miami Vice ""episode"", sorely missing Miami and the characters I was fond of decades ago.

187,gtbarker,Unwatchable,1,25 August 2007,"Michael Mann is one of my favourite directors and Jamie Foxx is an excellent actor. Their previous collaboration 'Collateral' was a fantastic film so I was genuinely looking forward to 'Miami Vice'. To say I was disappointed would be up for understatement of the year. This film was disjointed in the extreme, sacrificing story, character development and genuine tension for what the makers obviously thought was style. Visually it was confused, the characters were dry and the leads looked as though they couldn't stand to be on the same set as each other. I am absolutely positive all the people who rave about this mess of a film will soon forget why they liked it so much and will watch it again in five years and wonder just what there was to like. 'Collateral' was a model lesson in how to make this kind of stylish thriller and 'Miami Vice' an object lesson in how not to. Needless to say this was one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to see.",Miami Vice
188,Syrchek,Actually it's pretty well delivered.,7,20 November 2006,"I'm glad I resisted the curiosity of peeking into the ratings before I saw this one. A 7/10 is a pretty honest rating from me and I was a bit surprised when I saw such a low score. A logical conclusion: too many people compare it to the original TV series. I have to admit, I haven't seen one single part of the original 80's show. My guess is that the movie is far grittier than the series, but it maybe lacking some good chemistry and a finer story. What I like particularly is the use of digital HDTV format. This is probably the first mainstream film where digital format was used so often and so obviously. The use of the format creates a distance between modern film making and 80's film making. Miami Vice (2006) want's to look like it's own film, from it's own separate era. The effect of the digital format is that it somehow makes the action scenes look far more realistic. It looks as if you have live access to a gun rally that a TV reporter is filming on the spot.Pretty realistic I know. Well almost the same could be said about Farrel and Foxx, but they do suffer the lack of a good dialog at times. Something not very significant for a Michael Mann picture. This time the whole atmosphere doesn't reach the level of his previous film Collateral. Maybe it's because Crockett and Tubbs aren't dark enough characters to create a cathartic experience. They don't even come near it.But in general this is still a very adult oriented crime-drama, mainly because of the interactions between the mob and the cops. As I've said. The problems seem to be the lack of chemistry, maybe an even better story and a more persuasive and logical ending. Luckaly the story was still complex and twisty enough to keep my attention for a little more than two hours. But a better conclusion and a focus for more climatic events could make this movie better. I honestly hope that Mann will fully succeed the next time........ +3/5 .......",Miami Vice
189,Solipsisticblog,"Cold, technically accomplished exercise",5,11 August 2006,"Many reviews of this movie have used the word ""adult"" to describe it. I think boring is more apt. I was surprised at how stiff the film is. The reliable Colin Farrell, playing Sonny Crockett, is given little to do other than to look serious and sport a blonde mullet. He fails to engage the audience. We don't like him, hate him, or feel much of anything for him.We get several long scenes of his romance--they comprise about a third of the movie--with bad girl Gong Li, playing business savvy drug trader Isabella. Their love scenes are numerous, intense, and graphic without displaying the naughty bits. These repeated forays into intimacy are meant to sub for character development. By seeing Crockett at his most exposed and unguarded moments, we are supposed to finally know and understand the character. It does not work.Jaime Foxx, playing Ricardo Tubbs, teams up with Farrell to go undercover and take down a drug kingpin. Foxx, vibrant and interesting in Mann's ""Collateral,"" is practically a nonentity. He is given little screen time and the only scene that gives us any intimate details of his life is, not surprisingly, a sex scene.Because this is a Michael Mann film, it is technically accomplished. This movie is sharp, a masterful mood piece, and the best use of digital cinematography ever on the big screen. The action scenes are intense and incredibly violent. There are several moments where large rifle rounds rip holes in bad guys that elicited cheers from my audience.The intense sex scenes and unflinching violence have fooled many critics into labeling this film sophisticated. The adjectives I would pick would be the following: long, humorless, cold, empty.",Miami Vice
190,j_graves68,a contemporary me-movie from a dated me-decade...,5,14 August 2006,"Miami VICE- I hear Jan Hammer's percussion echoing through my brain and bouncing off its walls as I stand in line-I anticipate its success because one of the best actors of the 21st century, Jamie Foxx, is starring and the bomb director who helmed 2004's ""Collateral"" AND the original series is the flick's director, Michael Mann! I'm sitting in the theatre telling myself it's gonna be tight! It's gonna rock! After eleven minutes of worthless previews, we see the movie begin immediately without starting credits. It was similar to how ""Collateral"" began, but it also made me feel just like the old TV show made me feel: empty and inept. I always felt as if I had missed twenty minutes of the show. I always felt like they never gave much character development to Phillip Michael Thomas, but plenty to Don Johnson. Same thing with this one. Not much to Foxx, but plenty to Farrell. Gone are the pastel Italian suits, Edward James Olmos, Johnson & Thomas, and Jan Hammer's music. Mann does a superb job of preserving the hole-ridden plots the TV show gave us, along with the cool camera angles, lighting, and Ferraris.The first scene echoes like ""Collateral"", as if it were Max instead- daydreaming that he was Tom Cruise, plowing through the club, breaking arms and legs, kicking bodies. Afterwards, a few cell-phone calls and arms blowing off inside the cabs of cars, we are subjected to a lot of talk from characters that we really don't care about. For at least 45 minutes. And then remembering the show (I was about 13-14 when it premiered), I didn't seem to care about the characters either and all of their talk-talk. It's an emulation of a so-so eighties TV show: no surprises, not bad, but not good. The violence was graphic and Mann has the Peckinpah touch in this film, but at the same time, he is able to illustrate the violence by showing us the finished results. And the violence isn't supposed to look hip like the TV show (and Quentin Tarantino) made it look. When a guy gets shot in the head, the wall behind him looks like a bloody Jackson Pollock.I really hoped this would be better than the show, but it is just a flashy re-hash that is nothing more than an updated, ultra-violent cable pilot with the same name and gimmicks.",Miami Vice

The series had chemistry between all of the leads, especially Johnson and Thomas. It had humour, great music, and interesting cameos from guests such as Phil Collins and Gene Simmons. It wasn't intellectual but it was good fun.The movie, despite sharing the same director, Michael Mann, was a letdown. It had a plot that was hard to follow. This was compounded by poor and frequently imcomprehensible diction from the actors. Perhaps a DVD with subtitles may have lessened this problem. The movie didn't break new ground.In keeping with the overall theme of disappointment the end credits rolled on accompanied by an insipid interpretation of Phil Collin's ""In The Air Tonight"".",Miami Vice
192,nived84,"It's Michael Mann, not Michael Bay, and don't you forget that!",10,30 July 2006,"Miami Vice is one of the top three best adult-thrillers of the year; resting along side V for Vendetta and Inside Man. It's a Michael Mann film, not Michael Bay, and don't you forget it! This isn't Bad Boys or The Fast and the Furious, so don't go in expecting a huge two hour action flick with tons of explosions, car chases and a dumbed down plot that insults your intelligence. Michael Mann's style and his films have always been something of an acquired taste, and Miami Vice is no different. You'll either love it or hate it. Miami Vice didn't quite pack the same kind of punch that Collateral did, but I can say with confidence that this film was more complicated and ambitious than some of his previous films. And at nearly two and a half hours long you'd better be prepared for it, because if you're not you will probably get a little bored. Especially if you can't keep up with what is happening on screen, which some complain about not being able to follow the plot, and get lost in it. Trust me, a second viewing greatly improves and clarifies this issue. Miami Vice is easily one of the most complex and mature flicks of the summer, and its a welcome relief from a lot of bombastic CGI extravaganzas that seemed to have overtaken much of the summer movie season. This is slick and sexy entertainment that works because it's thrills and explosions are real, not fake. There never was a single moment where I thought to myself, ""You know that would never, ever happen in real life, not like that."" Miami Vice does a great job of keepin' it real. Now that sounds like an impossible mission for Hollywood to do these days!The film is in the spirit of the 80's television show; it's not an exact replication, it's a re-interpretation of the material. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx star as the famous undercover cop duo, Sonny Crockett and Richardo Tubbs. The two are quickly assigned to infiltrate the Colombian drug cartel to get information about a possible leak inside in the FBI when one of its agents cover gets blown; resulting in several deaths. In order to get close to the drug traffickers the two cops will have to go deep undercover to expose their business dealings and bring them down. Along the way Sonny gets romantically involved with Isabella (played by Gong Li), who's a banker for the cartel that Crockett and Tubbs have gained access to. Colin Farrell hasn't been this enjoyable in a movie since Minority Report, and delivers a pretty gosh-darn good performance here. But this romantic relationship does drag down the film a bit too much, and takes away from the Sonny and Richardo partnership aspect of the film, which is probably the best part of the film. Jamie Foxx seems to disappear for too long during the second act of the film. One of the greatest and most obvious aspects of Miami Vice was its cinematography and killer soundtrack; two things that are absolutely essential for a Michael Mann film. And once again the man doesn't disappoint. Miami Vice does drag it's feet now and again, and Gong Li does struggle often to master the English language, but the film also does build up to and deliver a great third and final act. And with all the cards on the table and everyone's lives on the line it leaves no room for error for these two cops, as the try to protect the ones they love and manage to bring down the bad guys. Like I said earlier this isn't Bad Boys. The film shows very well how dangerous this kind of undercover work can be. Their job requires time, patience and intelligence to get it done right and the same can be said about the film itself; it too also requires some patience and intelligence. And if you can come to the movie and deliver those two things, in the end you'll realize that Michael Mann did a good job with the material. The last 30 minutes will grab you by the throat... and squeeze. Especially with a furious gun battle that when shot through the lens of a Hi-Def Viper camera looks more like a finely polished home video; shining with gritty reality, and not some overly slick or ""fake"" Hollywood style. When all was said and done, and the bullets stopped firing and the smoked dissipated into the sky and Nonpoint's cover of ""In the Air Tonight"" swooped in over the end credits the movie left me feeling both thrilled and satisfied, but also pretty fatigued. Miami Vice gets a thumbs up.",Miami Vice
193,jaysilentbob37,"Miami Vice is a cool, stylish, and quite frequently intense thriller.",9,18 August 2007,"The first thing you need to know when you see Miami Vice, is that it's hardly anything like the trailers. While the insanely cool trailer makes this out to be a big, loud, mindless, shoot em' up action movie filled with car chases, explosions, and damsels in distress, the movie is actually anything but. They had to advertise the movie this way if they wanted to make money, but the fact is, if you go into this expecting what it was advertised as, you will be bored to tears, and most certainly hate the movie. I myself found the movie unbearably boring the first time I watched it. However, after a second viewing that I forced upon myself in my unwilling to be disappointed by such a cool looking film, I felt completely different about it. I was thoroughly entertained. Miami Vice is a gritty, intense, and often brutal, no- nonsense suspense drama that rewards patience and attention.The plot is fairly simple, but the realistic way it's executed makes it feel complicated. It follows Miami cops Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell), and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx), who are given a most difficult assignment. They are assigned to go undercover and infiltrate a major drug cartel, led by the ruthless Jose Yero, and find out who killed two undercover federal agents. Crockett and Tubbs, under fabricated identities, enter a world where their badges mean nothing, danger and violence is waiting around every corner, and if they show any signs of their real intentions, they will be killed on sight. It doesn't exactly help that Crockett falls in love with one of the cartel's most important members (Gong Li). Miami Vice is a very intense film, which maintains a consistent tone of imminent danger. Although Crockett and Tubbs (or any characters in it for that matter) are never really developed, we fear for their lives when things get too far beyond their control. The knowledge of what would happen to them if their identities were to be uncovered keeps us on the edge of our seat from the moment they begin their assignment. Employing non-stop action, which many people complain about the lack of, wouldn't make sense in this movie, because it's about characters trying to avoid anything that could set it off. There is action in the film, and whenever it occurs, it is not glamorous, or stylish. It is gritty, and often disturbingly brutal. The characters aren't in control of it, they are just as confused and terrified as any normal person would be if they were caught in a chaotic shootout.The action scenes, as gritty as they are, are still executed in a good enough way that they get your adrenaline flowing, and the climactic shootout includes one of the single best bad guy kills I've ever seen. The most suspenseful moment in the film comes from a hostage situation/standoff in a trailer park, where the tension becomes nearly unbearable. The scene culminates in one of the most bad-ass ""cop movie"" moments that I've seen in a while.The cinematography and music in the film are excellent, and any fan of cinema has to appreciate it. There is little, if any artificial lighting in the film. There are beautiful shots of Miami, lit only by the lights of the city itself, and breathtaking scenes of planes in the air, soaring through the clouds. There are times when the movie almost comes to a complete halt, just to bask in the beauty of the imagery, and while many people find these scenes boring and unnecessary, I found them to be hypnotic, and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Personally, I found the numerous sex scenes more boring and distracting than these. And the music perfectly fits the tone of every scene it's used in. The opening nightclub sequence is a great example of both of these elements, one of the single coolest moments to a film I've ever seen. As for the acting, it isn't easy to comment on, as the actors do very little of it. Most of the time, all their roles require is for them to talk in a serious, no-nonsense voice and never smile. Gong Li really needs to work on her English, and subtitles would come in handy for her scenes. Actually, I strongly recommend that you watch the whole film with subtitles, due to the fact that the way the characters talk quite often makes it difficult to understand the dialogue. Miami Vice lacks character development, and substitutes atmosphere, and tense dialogue for mindless action. It never dumbs down it's story for the audience's sake, and plays exactly as it would in real life. If you're looking for a good police thriller that doesn't insult your intelligence, I strongly recommend Miami Vice to you. I love this stylish, underrated film, and give it a 9/10.Miami Vice is rated R for strong violence, language, and some sexual content.Sex- 8/10 Violence- 8/10 Swearing- 6/10 Drugs- 7/10",Miami Vice
194,yannigk,"Terrible, just terrible.",2,30 August 2006,"Miami Vice sucked, the story was just so-so, but the worst part is the reality-TV camera work and the image quality. I don't know how they do it. One shot it's clean and colorful and nice, the next shot it's grainy and ugly and of different lighting/color. Who in their professional right mind would put that kind of shots together into a dialogue sequence? The lighting is terrible, top white lights that reflect themselves on the foreheads of the actors. What happened to cinematic quality camera-work and lighting?The art direction... ugh! There is NO art direction, what's up with the white walls with the white windows and white doors under white lights?! Have they got no paint!!??! TERRIBLE! I think they might have also used HD to make the film because some shots felt like video. I see how they try to make the film more 'reality TV' like, but it's gets too much and distracts me of the story because i'm busy looking at the grains on screen! The only good part where they actually used the camera-work to its full potential is the battle scene between the cops and the baddies near the end of the movie. That's the only time when I didn't yawn in the cinema.And also, what's up with the title coming out at the END of the movie, instead of the start of the movie? I understand that a lot of people has already known about Miami Vice and that it's probably not necessary to have a title sequence, but not even an opening sequence? If you can't even spend enough time to make a good opening sequence, then you won't spend any time to make a good movie.I read another user comment who loved this movie who said ""In fact, it almost feels as if we're watching the first episode of a new season of the TV show"". I don't think that's a good thing. If you can't lift a movie up high enough above TV, then it shouldn't be up there on the big screen.",Miami Vice
195,cotandreea,Cool but sometimes a little bit too slow,8,14 July 2020,"Although I think that adding some new elements could have changed the face of the movie, Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx were good in the roles of Crockett and Tubbs respectively.",Miami Vice
196,mhoney-1,Less-than-stellar Mann,7,8 August 2006,"Michael Mann is one of my favorite directors because he succeeds with virtually every project he undertakes. He has a keen sense of setting, character development, and how to stage action. He has been able to go from the urban cool of ""Thief"" to the epic frontier of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and back with ""Heat."" With ""The Insider,"" he showed how he could take a simple true-life story of a whistle-blower and imbue it with a sense of danger that is completely psychological.His biopic ""Ali"" was ruined not by acting or direction so much as by the constraints of the outline, telling a by-the-numbers story that encompassed the legendary boxer's career, without breathing new life into the sub-genre. But Mann quickly rebounded from that misfire by reinventing his urban thriller with ""Collateral,"" shot almost entirely in hi-def, with Tom Cruise giving one of his best performances, and comedian Jamie Foxx managing to outshine him at that.Many credit Mann with creating ""Miami Vice."" It's not true, as he only executive produced the show and directed a few episodes. But it's still safe to say he knows the world the '80s hit takes place in. The movie, like the show, follows a squad of vice cops, particularly the maverick Sonny Crockett and the cool Ricardo Tubbs, here played by Colin Farrell and Mann favorite Foxx.The movie picks up in the middle of a sting operation to bust a Haitian pimp at a disco. The sting is interrupted when they get an urgent call from an informant they haven't heard from in six months who's worried about his girlfriend, and some FBI sting operation fouling up. Due to some outside intel a white supremacist group is aware the people they are dealing with are FBI undercover operatives. And since Crockett and Tubbs know something's up, they agree to help FBI Agent Fujima (Ciaran Hinds) find out how his guys got leaked.The film starts off at a break-neck pace, with so many strands it's hard to figure out what's going on. It actually feels like a TV show, because they have to squeeze so much into so little time, and we're not really sure how everything fits together.. As the film progresses, though, it becomes more focused, one big undercover sting, with Crockett getting in over his head with a Chinese/Cuban drug liaison. The supporting characters of Calabrese, Switek, and Zito, are underdeveloped. The casting of Barry Shabaka Hensley as Castillo was criticized early on by fans who wanted someone like Danny Trejo to fill the shoes left by Edward James Olmos. And while it is true that in Cuba and other countries south of Miami there are a fair amount of Negro Hispanics, Hensley doesn't fool anyone.On the other hand, John Ortiz as bad guy Jose Yero chews up the screen nicely. Gong Li is stiff as Crockett's love interest, not to mention noticeably older (the actress is pushing forty, and Farrell is only thirty). British actress Naomie Harris does a great job of capturing the New Yawk accent of Trudy Joplin, and her chemistry with Foxx is good. Hinds, who recently garnered acclaim as Julius Caesar in the HBO series ""Rome"" and as the worrisome assassin in ""Munich"" plays a great bureaucrat, but it would've been nice to see more of him.The hi-def photography works well for the most part, but less so in daytime, when some otherwise beautiful photography of South America is obscured by blurriness.Mann has done a good job of reinventing the TV show for the modern era, but this is no ""The Fugitive.""",Miami Vice
197,knifemagnet,It's not so sunny in this tub of mediocrity,4,7 November 2018,"I should have reviewed this film twelve years ago. I've been a Michael Mann fan since Last of the Mohicans; and after seeing The Insider I considered him to be one of the better film makers out there... Until 2004's Collateral.I was just a kid when Miami Vice was on TV but I have seen some great aspects of the show (that were clearly Mann elements) which were too few and far between. I since still consider Mann one of the best directors out there but feel he needs to find talented writers and focus solely on bringing a good script to life. Since The Insider his films are superbly directed (who else can create atmosphere like Mann?) yet fall short on writing that equals that directing. Due to the writing the movie feels less engaging and often plods along. Forty minutes in the plot has barely begun to unfold. This is NOT Miami Vice. I don't know what it is - FBI Vice? Interpol Vice? What's more, this feels like a modern extended TV episode where Sonny and Tubbs get deputized and are off rivaling James Bond. The script could have been grittier and nuanced without turning two city cops into James Bond's counterparts - complete with homes, boats, aircraft, and cars a city cop could never afford (Mann did get it right in Heat). Any other film and you would be thinking these are some dirty cops. It's not the 80's anymore - you are not instantly cool because you have an Italian car. This film simply falls short in every category with the exception of the directing and most of the acting (sans Jamie Foxx - who's acting 'skill' within the first ten minutes began to annoy me). In the end it is a run-of-the-mill, massively sensationalized, containing zero the emotion Heat and The Insider gave us, very average film.Pass if you want something believable that can take you somewhere else. Watch if you would enjoy another mindless, out of proportion, James Bond-esque film.",Miami Vice
198,erikgloor,Story and substance shot dead by action and atmosphere,5,1 August 2006,"Sonny Crockett don't dance.Michael Mann is one of this reviewer's favorite filmmakers. He's never afraid to tell unapologetically clean, stylish movies about unapologetically masculine characters relating to each other in ways traditional Hollywood films seem loathe to explore. Grown-up crime pictures that don't involve a lot of martial arts; or fairy-tale logic; or elitist judgment; or stoic female disdain; or impossibly brave and enlightened children; is something there will always be a market for because without all this sappy embroidery, you have a story that's always more interesting because it's inevitably a story that's far closer to reality.Mann's latest picture, 'Miami Vice,' is similar to his groundbreaking '80s television show in name only. And let's face it, it was going to have to take bold strides to separate itself from a show that has become a punch-line for jokes about bad fashion and sleazy male egos.And sure, the TV show had a lot of silly excessive atmosphere, but particularly in the first 3 of its 5 seasons, it additionally had some really well-written crime stories with authentic characters trying to care about one another in a duplicitous and violent world of drugs and corruption.The movie is all atmosphere. It's an updated, high-tech, infrared atmosphere without a single pink T-shirt in sight. There's very little else to grab hold of except some really complex plot-flow that's hard for us law-abiding citizens to follow. Hand-cam shots and cop jargon and maneuvers alien to anyone not in the crime business all seem to conspire to make us not quite welcome in Mann's slick, high-tech world of players and low-lifes. We are treated, occasionally, to impressive gun battles and more often, to lush glamorous location shots but we're starved for the fundamentals:Who are these characters? What makes them tick? Where do they come from? Why have they traded safe lives of stability for dangerous lives of chaos? Why do they care about each other? Why don't they? These questions weren't always answered in the TV show, but they were at least addressed.In the movie, we are unceremoniously dropped into a Miami nightclub and perpetually made to feel as though we're on a ride-along with the film's two main characters, Metro Dade vice detectives, James ""Sonny"" Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs played by Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx, respectively.We follow their exploits as they go undercover in search of the collusion that has compromised a federal drug investigation and gotten an informant and his girlfriend killed. Why do we care? Who knows? Law and order? The police in this story seem as nihilistic about their trade as the bad-guys. If we're supposed to enjoy it as a competition of nerve or cleverness, there's a hundred other movies that do this ten times better -- Mann's 'Heat' among them.Too much how and not enough why.There's so little character development that we are completely numb to these men and their motives. Their lovers slink about in beautiful bodies but emote like clueless teenagers. Indeed, nearly every character in the film seems dead to anything but their task in life and ply it in morose if humorless fashion invariably. Jamie Foxx, recently embraced as an exciting new actor with depth, range and humor comes off as wooden and two-dimensional as James Bond -- a figure of limitless confidence and ability. Who ... cares?And then there's Farrell's Sonny Crockett. Where to begin?Don Johnson's Sonny Crockett, sure, was often a controversial figure -- especially among feminists and fashionistas. But he was written in a way that you could believe that his good qualities weren't just a veneer for a television audience.Of course the character's rep as low-rent lothario, naturally, was what got the press. And with Farrell's appointment to the role, it's as if Mann has conceded that nothing else of what the Sonny Crockett phenomenon was really about counted for squat.Pick-up artist? Sure. But Johnson's Crockett was also a rugged, charismatic, intelligent, eccentric and often articulate middle-class individualist with a heart of gold.*** Light spoiler, next two paragraphs ***Farrell's Crockett is a driven, but uncomplicated, mercenary dim-bulb who was still calling his lover ""ma'am"" after they'd had sex. A low-brow goon you'd sooner find working the door at some night-club for twenty-somethings. A nihilist lunk-head whose main shot for redemption entailed shielding a drug king-pin from justice just because she was his lover.Johnson's Crockett would have turned her ass in and drowned his tears in bourbon a la Humphrey Bogart.In one scene, Farrell's Crockett salsa dances passionately with Gong Li's Isabella.Any real fan of the TV show can tell you. Sonny Crockett don't dance.And it's not that the film suffers by comparison to the TV show. It just suffers. Times and tastes have changed, but good writing, story, and character development never go out of style.In 'Heat,' 'Collateral,' and now 'Miami Vice,' Mann's true talent is his ability to put you in the moment. Especially visceral moments of high adventure in urban settings.If these moments could sustain an entire film, 'Miami Vice' would be a masterpiece.Unfortunately, they can not.This movie review by Erik Gloor",Miami Vice

This pathetic film had a bad plot, terrible film work and was just extremely boring! Det. James 'Sonny' Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Det. Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) went undercover to discover and destroy the plans of a world-wide drug lord. I have seen too many movies with this plot. The only difference; this movie is a terrible ripoff. Det. James 'Sonny' Crockett and Det. Ricardo Tubbs had absolutely no chemistry together. They had been working together as partners in the F.B.I. for many years, yet the way they act seems like they just met.The plot was extremely hard to follow as well. I think to understand this movie fully, you would have to watch it one more time. Yeah good luck forcing me to watch this again.And on top of all of this, this was the worst camera work that I have ever seen. During the action scenes (which I may add was pretty good) the camera was way to shaky, as well it didn't following the action scenes at all. I think they tried to copy the The Bourne Supremacy's original camera work, but yet it was a cheap ripoff!

NEVERTHELESS its CROCKETT AND TUBS back from the 1980s when I was a kid.

The movie was serious alright, so serious that I just found it boring. It was trying to hard. There was just no connection. I felt no connection to the actors, the story, nothing. There was no comic relief, nothing to connect the audience to the characters. The whole movie took itself too seriously and ended up as a snooze fest.

211,davidhutch007,Stylish But Nothing Else going For It,4,25 September 2006,"I watched this film with great anticipation after witnessing Collateral which from that Michael Mann proved he was still the best at what he does,so going to see this i was going in expecting something good, unfortunately i was let down.The films story i am still bewildered by because even while watching the film i felt very confused by it and could never really understand what was going on mainly on part of two reasons: the first being that the sound was terrible in major parts of the film especially when foreign actors with foreign accents were speaking, at times it was so difficult to hear what they were saying i felt like the film was meant for lip readers and i cant lip read. The second reason is that the story is just generally confusing, there is (in my opinion) no clear way to get the story without reading IMDb which after viewing the film and viewing the trailer i actually got the story.The film is shot exactly the same as Collateral which is on digital film which gives great results, especially with night time scenes but with day shots i don't think it is as good and let the film down in those places, you feel like you're watching a documentary which is not what this film is about.The acting is good but not perfect, while Colin and Jamie both give performances they have little to add to the characters we know and love from the show and Michael Mann gives no more depth and no more to add to their characters which is a shame as both these actors could have doe really special things with their given characters. Gong Li who plays Isabella the love interest of Colin Farrel adds again nothing new to the femme fatal role that we have seen in countless other films of this nature and really has a throwaway character.So what can be said of out Director/Writer Michael Mann? Well first off this is no where near his best piece of work and should never even be considered so, i as a fan of his work (Heat especially) was looking for the gritty realism which i got but the rest i had not bargained for, here Mann shows a lack in writing quality by giving us the same old story of Colombians dealing drugs and going undercover which we've seen and so we don't need to see again.The action is the biggest reason for seeing the film, although few and far between is there and is good, with it being shot with the digital film cameras the gun battles look as real as they could ever want to be and at these moments you do feel you are right there with these guys shooting it out which is always good.So should you go and see this film in the cinema? My opinion is no i think is is definitely a wait for DVD title because it is nothing more than a Saturday night booze up with the lads than anything else and so don't waste money on the cinema ticket wait for good old DVD!**** out of **********",Miami Vice
212,deltajvliet,Review of the Director's Cut,8,18 April 2010,"People weren't really gagging over Miami Vice back in 2006, some said it was decent but nothing special, others felt that was being too generous. And yet, there are those the movie has grown on, people who feel it gets better with subsequent viewings. I'm a big fan of Mann. If I had to attribute my interest in film to any one movie it'd be Collateral. So naturally I was anticipating Miami Vice two years later. I even recall using the promotional desktop as my MySpace background. Yeah, that was when people still used MySpace. Maybe it was due to an unreasonable level of anticipation, but I was a little disappointed when I saw it opening weekend. Not because it was bad - it was certainly a solid movie - but because it wasn't better. I was hoping for something great and got something good. A year or two later I watched it on DVD, and while it did improve slightly, I had the same overall feeling. Last weekend I saw the Director's Cut in the $5 bin at Walmart and decided to pick it up. Watching it a day or two after, I suddenly really like this movie. Still not at the level of Collateral or Heat, but it's a helluva lot closer. So, do I attribute this to it being the DC? I honestly only noticed two things that were different. First, the movie opens on a boat race instead of the super-abrupt club opening in the theatrical version. It's gorgeously shot, but then so is the rest of the movie. The second difference was that In the Air Tonight precedes the final shootout. Nonpoint, not Phil Collins. These are welcome additions, but on their own don't seem to constitute much of an overall change. It's amazing then that all the littler, subtler changes made such a big difference. I'm not even sure what they were. The end product, however, is fantastic. An intelligent, smart, and well written action movie underlined by a terrific soundtrack and beautiful visuals. I agree that Mann missed the mark with Public Enemies cinematography-wise, but the DV absolutely works here. So check out the Director's Cut if you get the chance, your opinion might change. 8/10",Miami Vice
213,karenlynn1,Miami Advice--Don't see it.,1,2 September 2006,"sad homage to a pretty popular 80's SeriesI'll warn you not to see this. It's bad. The original series featuring Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas was pretty good--very dated, very glam, but good. I was expecting a less-glam, more gritty, more ""real"" version of the hit show. WHat I got was wooden acting, stale script, and gratuitous sex and violence thrown in in an attempt to either A) Wake the audience up, or B) make it seem more ""real"" and gritty (if so they went overboard). The plot was also confusing and was filled with loopholes and unanswered questions. And the saddest part was that Fox took a back seat to Farrel, even though Fox's acting skill far exceeds that of his co-star. To say that I didn't like it would be an understatement. I almost walked out of the theater, it was that bad. Spend your $10.00 on something better than watching this crap.",Miami Vice
214,thirdi,A rare misfire from Michael Mann,6,21 April 2007,"I am a huge fan of Michael Mann movies in general. I thought ""Collateral"", ""The Insider"" and earlier films like ""Last of the Mohicans"" were fantastic. And his crime opus ""Heat"" is an absolute masterpiece. So when I heard Mann was revisiting Miami Vice, with Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx no less, I figured it was sure to be a home run. No such luck.While the movie has a bit of edge-of-your-seat drama, and a few good action scenes, overall I felt this was an unfocused misfire from Mann. There seems to be little or no chemistry between Farrell and Foxx, and even less between other characters. Gong Li was miscast in my humble opinion, and Justin Theroux (a great actor) goes virtually unused. John Ortiz is one of the few high points, giving a truly creepy and menacing performance.I could get into a detailed analysis of the plot, style, acting and so forth but that's been done to death in these comments. The bottom line is the movie is basically all story, and no character. Which sometimes can be okay, but not when the story is a generic ""let's go undercover and bust a drug cartel"" plot. When you're dealing with a general idea that's been done a million times, you need characters to make it rise above. Unfortunately Michael Mann wasn't able to accomplish that with Miami Vice.",Miami Vice
215,secretagent_007,Miami Bites,5,3 December 2007,"Given the subject matter, this is a movie that should be exciting, engaging, intense, and smart. But it ain't. It's an update of a lame 80's cop show that hasn't gained an ounce of class in the translation. They have bigger guns, faster cars, more money, and a million other things used to make up for a lack of character, but the story is bland and uninteresting. Michael Mann seems to have taken the shotgun approach to storytelling here, touching on just about every undercover cop movie cliché in the manual without ever blasting a hole through the genre. Clichés do crop up in any genre picture, but if the script and performers can sell them well enough, it's not a big problem. So it's unfortunate that everyone seems to be sleepwalking through Miami Vice.Mann, who writes and directs, provides not a single moment that is wholly unexpected, not one scene that makes you wince, laugh, cry, or appreciate the witty dialogue ('cause there isn't any). All he delivers is his patented Collateral-style shakycam HD cinematography and some gory pictures of people being shot to pieces. Collin Farrell is as bad as I've ever seen him. For being a top-notch undercover cop he doesn't show much range as a performer. When the time comes to make deals with the bad guys, he switches from his unreal, grizzled American accent to his Super Hyper Monster GRRRizzled American Accent. And aside from this sentence, I won't even mention his ridiculous Hulk Hogan mustache/greasy mullet combo. Meanwhile, Jamie Foxx puts on his best bad-ass stare for 120 minutes. The failures of the actors could almost be forgiven if they served a better story, but thanks to a script that is no better than any episode of the TV show it's based on, it's all for naught. Lesson: If you're going to make a relatively ancient TV drama into a movie, make sure you've got more going for it than a greater allowance for swearing and violence. There is absolutely no reason for this movie to exist. I'm not surprised it only made $65 million at the US box office, but I am utterly astounded that it cost $135 million. Usually with a budget like that, at least it's on the screen.http://www.movieswithmark.com",Miami Vice
216,m-guszak-1,I have never hated a movie more than this one,1,19 January 2014,"I am one of the biggest fans of the television show Miami Vice. The show was truly revolutionary for about three of the five seasons it ran. You had well developed characters, great set designs, diverse stories, great music, it was a fantastic show! So, I was naturally intrigued when it was leaked that Michael Mann was making a motion picture version of the show. Wow! This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the TV show in any way. Oh sure, they used the names of the characters from the show, but that is it. Not one character had an ounce of depth or appeal to them. You had constant awkward sex scenes thrown in that made you think you were watching a Skinimax film. Slow and plodding story lines. You had absolutely lousy casting. The choices for Zito and Castillo were comically bad. It sure seems as late that Mann has gotten quite lazy when it comes to casting in recent years. What you had was a vastly inferior remake of Heat and Collateral. Why? Why bother incorporating the Miami Vice name if your movie has zero to do with the TV show or any of the show's themes? Seriously, I hate this film and thinks it was the first step towards mediocrity that Mann has been mired in for awhile.",Miami Vice
217,flitz35,Waiting for Miami Vice 2!!,9,15 July 2013,This was the hippest undercover cop movie to date. Back in the 80's when I was growing up watching Miami Vice I wanted to be Sonny Cricket. Who didn't? With those cool clothes and getting all the girls while fighting crime. So now we have Miami Vice back in 2006 and I think you would of needed to be a fan to really appreciate this movie. That was the only down fall and I gave 9 stars not 10. Yes for the unfamiliar viewer I could see overlooking this movie and maybe if the story was more commercial to catch every age group Miami Vice would of been a 10 star award winning flick. But as for us MV fans we all own a copy of the BluRay. The performances was perfect and I am sure if there is a second Miami Vice it will be perfected as well along with every aspect of a new film and I for one can't wait!,Miami Vice
218,El_Jefe,Irish Slingblade,5,22 January 2015,"Sloppy editing. Terrible voice-over work in many of the scenes. Lazy special effects and stunts. Colin Farrell sounds like Slingblade for about the first half of the movie, and only finds a reasonable voice for the closing scenes.I hear the movie was shot digitally. I don't recall the state of digital 'film' in 2006, but the movie looks like cheap, low-res, hand- held shots in an awful lot of the scenes.I found the soundtrack funny: lots of Chris Cornell, a voice I associate with the 90's. Ironically, a five years later, Drive came out with a soundtrack that would have fit in with the original Miami Vice. This movie would have been much better in the latter style, as more of a remake/homage and less of a reboot.The acting was... off. I didn't ""feel"" anything from the actors, even while they're supposed to be falling in love (or lust). It all felt stilted and implausible.",Miami Vice

220,PortugalOle7,Little to do with the series but still great fun.,7,4 February 2007,"While Michael Mann's updated version of the 80's hit has little to do with the series, it turns out to be a pretty slick action flick.Rico (Foxx) and Sonny (Farrell) must investigate the murders of three under-cover FBI agents during a drug deal gone wrong. The trail leads them to a drug lord and his mysterious wife. Rico and Sonny then go undercover to infiltrate this network and pose as drug buyers. Conflict of conscious occurs when Sonny becomes romantically linked with the drug lord's wife.Michael Mann has become a true artist in terms of cinematography and overall ""look"" of his films. Mann also mixes using both normal film stock and digital video, which he used entirely in Collateral. As a result, the action scenes make you feel like you're watching an episode of Cops, instead of seeing a big Hollywood shootout. Another staple of Mann's films is moody music and it is once again in this one. There's some great featured tracks by Audioslave, Moby, and a remake of Phil Collins ""In the Air Tonight"" by Nonpoint, that really are a big part of the film's soundtrack.While the approach is totally updated and fresh, the overall film is loosely based on the series. One thing that seems lost is the closeness of the relationship between Sonny and Rico. I thought it would be more of a buddy movie, but it turns out that the characters spend a good portion of the movie in different locations. When they are in the same scenes you really don't feel a sense of camaraderie. One other gripe that I had was with the dialog and story. Several key scenes have quick and incomprehensible dialog that make the film confusing in some specific aspects. It seems that there is a lot of technical police jargon that really isn't that known by common people. I think the film suffers a little because of this and while you get the general idea of what is going on, it makes you feel like you missed something that you should have picked up on.",Miami Vice

Not the most original but oh well maybe the show was like this every episode, I don't know like I said I never saw the show. Also the love story was bad, could have made the movie 30 minutes shorter.The characters I didn't really like. I don't think Colin and Jamie suited their rolls well. Also their acting was bad in my eyes. Not very believable or anything. Also there was no character development. But I guess you have to watch the show and maybe you would get some.The special effects were bad. When there was a flame it was horrible. When a guy got shot it was horrible. Also the action scenes were kind of all over the place and not well thought out. In the last firefight, the snipers don't shoot really at all.Overall I really didn't like the movie.

The movie is very visual. One can follow the story without the dialog, which I did since it was hard to hear the finer points. The movie is fast paced, and I needed to pay attention to get the subtleties.The timeline of the romance was too compressed, but otherwise I bought into most of the plot twists. The characters were not deep, but they were well-acted and distinct enough that we cared about and understood them. The directing by Michael Mann was strong. I have heard others say the photography was great, but I did not think so. I did not care for the graininess of many shots. I did like the art direction, even though I would have snuck in a few pastels. Fun to watch; A movie you can follow visually; Not for folks looking for Deep Hidden Meaning.",Miami Vice
225,arahman,"Stylish action but ultimately a major disappointment,",4,15 February 2007,"After 'Last of the Mohicans', 'Heat' and 'Collateral' Michael Mann was widely recognised as a very special director offering a unique, visually enthralling and thoughtful take on the action movie genre. His movies are a break from the norm and created high expectations of Mann going forward. When news was released that Mann would be resurrecting his 1980s cop show for the big screen I felt that the franchise would be done justice. Who better to recreate the gritty and often dark cop show where white baggy suits and deeply depressed undercover cops defined the style of an era. The style of Miami Vice worked so well that viewers would ignore the fact the cops could afford a Ferrari Testarossa, drive speed boats on a regular basis and would test the authenticity of drugs by tasting them intraday (a quantity that would apparently have done them serious harm, Im not speaking from experience of course). In addition to these strong visuals Miami Vice had one of the most memorable opening theme tunes ever and a Number 2 Hit with Jan Hammer's Crockett's Theme which was featured on the show (the evolution of 1980s electric keyboard) So a couple of decades later how did Mr Mann fare with his 2006 resurrection? On the subject of style one can not deny that the action sequences in isolation flow well and are characteristic of the long gun battles in Heat. Secondly the driving sequences and speed boat scenes are impressive albeit slow and seemingly without purpose. Some of the locations and scenes at sea are beautifully shot however. Plot? There is a loose undercover drug related storyline but not there is limited depth to this and to be honest if you delve too deep there are numerous holes to the story. More worryingly however the viewer never really feels compelled to think too deeply and there is nothing unpredictable or new offered by the movie. Acting performances? Whilst the original Crockett and Tubs had good chemistry any relationship between Farrell and Fox is limited to a sentence where Fox says that he would never doubt his partner. These guys are understated sure but Farrell in my view (Im sure women will disagree) does not have the acting talent or depth to pull off Sonny's persona and as a result a primary foundation of the movie is shaky. The criminals are also weak in my view and John Ortiz as Jose Yero (the crime boss' right hand man) verges on the realms of a comedian. The structure of the movie is also haphazard which is not aided by the fact that one is often unable to understand what the characters are saying (not just Gong Li). Finally, the love stories are totally out of place with the movie, often comical and detract from an already confused structure. Mann has therefore come no where near my high expectations but movie goers out there who are oblivious of the past may enjoy the movie in isolation for its action and style. Given its slow pace and the problems addressed above however, I would find this surprising. I would not be shocked if the number of people who walked out after the first one and a half hours were representative of the movie going public and as a result the chances of a sequel are likely to be limited. An entertaining distraction with some impressive and stylish action sequences if you can deal with the pace and length of the movie but not even close to what one should expect from Mann in a post 'Heat' action genre that he himself has helped to define.",Miami Vice
226,ninjagaiden007,An Excellent piece of expert telling and will become a classic in 25 years time. Nothing about it is clichéd.,9,27 July 2006,This movie was awesome. The acting was magnificent. The story is very originally done. It's a very interesting crime movie. It's almost as good as Reservoir Dogs. This film is about dialogue. Also can be classified as action. All the characters are lovable and interesting. The direction is excellent. The guy who directed this is almost as good as Quentin Tarintino. The plot is pure genius! Just about everything about this film is well worth it. The good thing about the film is that it didn't have much swearing. Most movies swear to sound cool and act tough and to get your attention where as this one did it by an excellent cast and an excellent plot. Definitely a great update of an 80's Classic and will be remembered forever. I recommend it to anyone who loves crime movies. 9/10,Miami Vice

I had been a part-time fan of the series and sadly, this was nothing like it.The series used soft pastel lighting whereas the movie was so dark, at times you struggled to see what was going on. Maybe I needed a set of night-vision goggles.In the series, I could easily understand what everyone was saying. In this movie at times the dialogue was so mumbled and riddled with slang, I needed subtitles.The pace of the movie was also quite slow: several of my fellow theatre goers found it boring. What action sequences there were, were entertaining without being original.And what was with Colin Farrel's hair?? Maybe I am out of touch, but I didn't thing hairy bear crossed with grunge was an image either a drug dealer nor a cop would like to portray.On some positive notes, I liked Gong Li's character. It was good to see a strong, credible woman in an action movie. The night views of Miami, especially from the water, were awesome. And on a dorky note, the boats were cool.In summary, if there is nothing else on and you want to be vaguely entertained without being offended, it's worth a look.

229,nvjs,"Strong intentioned story, but...",7,7 March 2013,"What I found was lacking in ""Miami Vice""; was how Nicholas, Eddie Marsan's character alluded that ""...they're A.U.C...a player negotiates too hard and you never hear from them again. 'Cuz these guys kill everything!"" Well, on the contrary, the Colombians and their ""pecker-wood proxies"" came off as pretty civil. I didn't see them as intimidating as Nicholas described, or as the great Michael Mann intended. In fact, besides their lackluster delivery of ""killing everything"" which was no fault of their own, it was probably an oversight Mann compromised on. Either that, or he wanted Crockett and Tubbs to appear as uber efficient with dialogue comparative to a sixth-grader who'd ascertained how to roll ""tough"" vernacular from just watching all of Mann's movies. I've always felt that way with Mann's dialogue. He may be great at story, but tremendously lacking in that vector.In fact, I perceive Crockett and Tubbs to come off as primadonna, jock-ish, bullies and their inadequate foes of the month as weaklings. That's my two cents on it anyway. I've read, that Jamie Foxx went all celebrity post-""Ray"" with his Oscar and tried to throw that heavy-weight around. Even forcing Mann to re-write the ending since Foxx absconded from the Dominican Republic after *gasp* ""hearing gunshots erupt""! Afterall, in the extras on ""Collateral"", Foxx boasted on how he was from the ""ghetto"". Well, if the ""ghetto"" meant Carmel, Malibu, or Beverly Hills...so perhaps that compromised the end result which we are watching ?",Miami Vice
230,deltajuliet,"Not Mann's Best, but not bad",7,30 July 2006,"Decidedly, this review is rather spoiler-heavy, fyi.Aside from M:I 3, this was my most anxiously awaited movie of 2006. I'm a huge Michael Mann fan and loved Collateral, Heat, et al.The very first scene is somewhat reminiscent of ""Club Fever"" in 'Collateral.' Yet, it seemed to resonate indifference, as though this cool-looking duo of Farrell and Foxx was enough to make this scene cool and memorable. It wasn't.This duo gets an upset call from an informant it had previously worked with; he garbles out how he ""hadn't given them up"" but was ""leaving town."" Crockett (Farrell) gets it out of him that he ID'd some undercover FBI agents that were in a drug deal going on at that moment for the criminals involved. We are shown the agents gunned down. Mann handles this well, and it proves to be one of the few highlights of the film.Soon Crockett and Tubbs (Foxx) get put onto this case by the FBI man who headed the original project that just went bad. The reason: there's a mole within the FBI so he needs outsiders to both work the case and find the mole, if possible.The next 2 hours are mostly Farrell and Foxx looking cool while infiltrating a South American drug organization. It gets a bit monotonous, especially since the two leads tend to keep on indifferent, serious-looking expressions the whole time.Towards the end of the film we are rewarded for our patience with an exciting and well-done night raid on a trailer with a hostage, but this doesn't quite make up for the rest.I wasn't sure what to think of the movie while I watched it. I figured it might get worse (and be bad), stay the same (and be mediocre), or shape up (and be awesome). When the gunfight at the end came around, I was hoping I was in for a great grand finale that would make the movie awesome. It started out, and the bank robbery in Heat came to mind. With Heat, though, I think it got progressively more exciting, and we had a good idea of what was going on. Unfortunately, in Miami Vice, this final shootout didn't give the audience a great idea of what was going on. We see a man get shot and wonder: ""was it a cop or a bad guy?"" Hard to tell. The excitement didn't really build either, at least not until the primary bad guy opposing Crockett and Tubbs comes face to face with his maker, at which point some might feel compelled to stand up and cheer. Still, this feeling is brief and doesn't seem to exist in the rest of M.V.The plot was pretty convoluted, but we get the overall chain of events and what they mean. Not one of M.V.'s best aspects, but not its worst, either.I don't want to give the impression that this movie was bad; it definitely wasn't. I just don't think it was all that good, especially considering Mann's presence as writer and director. I also want to mention that the cinematography of this movie is dazzling, from neon-lit nightclubs to beautiful, crimson, sunset skies. This was surely one of the greatest features this movie has to offer, and I'm sure if it wasn't for the Academy's stance on digital film, it would be a clear Oscar-winner for Cinematography.Overall, I'd say the movie was decent, but definitely not Mann's best work. I was debating between 6 of 10 and 7 of 10, and decided to give Miami Vice the benefit of the doubt largely because of its beautiful cinematography.7 out of 10",Miami Vice

Don't get me wrong all, I say most all of the on screen actors were good , just not Colin and his sidekick. There was no chemistry , no damn chemistry. The boats were smashing and the rescue scene of one of the agents put you on the edge for about 10 minutes.

232,DrStranglove,Mann lost it on this one.,8,31 July 2006,"Saw it tonight; my take:Casting: About the best I have seen of Ferrell since Minority Report. I was actually amazed that they made him look a lot like a young Don Johnson. Barry Henley for Castillo though. God he sucked. The Lt I loved was 1/2 Ninja and 100% cold bad ass good guy of few words. And when he spoke, you would have thought God was talking. Sadly, this Castillo was in too tight a shirt and was about to choke half the time. How did he get cast for that part? Mann MUST have lost a bet.Elizabeth Rodriguez as Gina had the best scene in the whole movie, when she shot the Nazi. And it lasted 10 seconds and she was the baddest character in the show. Too bad it was only 10 seconds... my hopes raised but got dashed. The movie never got back to that high point.Foxx err I still cant get past his Living Color days to take him seriously. And there was next to no chemistry between him and Ferrell. I kept expecting him to tell a joke.Setting: It was said before, the was not Miami Vice, this was ""-anywhere- Vice"" The movie could have been set in LA, NYC or heck, Cairo!Presentation: Where was the great epic gun fight we came to love in Heat? It was too dark and I had not a clue what was going on. I mean Switek is in the middle of the bad guys and they barely even notice him when the shooting starts. Then in the middle he just sort of vanishes?? What gives?? Bad editing and bad filming. And where was Sonny's Brenn 10?!?!?All and all I blame the Mann. I give it 2 out of 10 stars. Mostly because I have so loved MM in the past that this destruction of a beloved memory by bad acting, bad casting, and non existent direction really hurts.

234,p_jones92,Mr. Mann must of been using some of that blow being smuggled,5,16 October 2007,"Whooooeeeee, this is one mish-mash of a movie.First of, the Miami Vice TV series had such a following when it originally aired that any updated movie version was going to get a lot of attention, from both fans who saw the original series when it aired (a young me), and new fans who are in on that whole 80's retrospective thing going on right now. So there is an expectancy from the audience of what this movie will be like, but it turns out it's nothing like the TV series.The original Crockett & Tubbs had a cocky charm about them, they knew they were good but weren't overt about it. Farell & Foxx on the other hand just have cockiness, like they're too cool for school and know it and want to rub your face in it. Farell's accent is also off, this deep gravely macho sound to match his porno face fluff. I mean it's just not right for the character.The whole undercover drug smuggling plot is Miami Vice, but not done in a Miami Vice style. It's more of a James Bond-esq kinda thing, with lots of exotic locations, I mean they don't actually spend a lot of time in Miami, rather Cuba & Columbia. The story keeps you engaged, but more out of curiosity rather than an interest in the characters themselves.The story revolves around an FBI undercover agent trying to get in with drug runners being exposed and killed, and Crockett & Tubbs go undercover themselves to find out who is leaking the information. However, it soon turns into them trying to get the big Columbian drug baron. The problem is we're supposed to believe that they are putting their lives at more and more risk the deeper they go, but keep on going because they have this inherent need to do good, but the way Farell and Foxx come off in their acting and how they perform these characters, you don't view them as cops or do gooders, and hence you just don't believe they would expose themselves to such dangers, they'd rather be in a club with the ladies, you don't believe they'd do this for a love of the job, there's no incentive for them.The love story between Farell & Gong Li is weird too, you can tell it must of been written as these two just lusting after each other, but the on screen chemistry is such that it doesn't work, and the whole catching a boat to Havana just for a Mojito come on is clichéd and laughable.As for the direction, this is where Mann must of been on drugs. It just doesn't work. This movie is 2 hours, I'd say 45 minutes of which is actual scenes with dialog and driving the story forward, with the rest devoted to scenes with no dialog but a song (I can only assume they really wanted to promote the soundtrack for this movie) and lots of hand-held shots, mostly close-ups of hands and necks. It's just weird, you cut between shots using pro- cameras, and shots with little hand-held DVs and the way it's done doesn't work, it's jarring. The photography is great, but the visual style is what's off. I imagine the production must've been beset by problems too, because a lot of the dialog has clearly been dubbed over later.This is just not what you think it will be, it's Miami Vice in it's bare form, it's Crockett & Tubbs, but not as we know them or want them and most disappointingly, it's a Michael Mann film in name but not in nature, and therefore not a movie I would recommend.",Miami Vice

In fact it is so boring I can't even come up with the 5 lines needed for this review so I am just typing away which in turn is probably a lot like how they came up with those empty scenes...

237,saareman,Walked out after 30 minutes...,6,31 July 2006,"At first I didn't think I was going to qualify to write a comment on this film since I walked out after 30 minutes. But seeing that about half of the comments here seem to have the same opinion as mine and they watched over 2 hours of it to get there, then my relatively short endurance doesn't seem that bad in retrospect.Where did it go wrong? A jerky start to the movie as if reel number one went missing in the projection booth, we're in some dance club somewhere, but praise the gods, it is Nina Simone on the soundtrack with the Felix Da Housecat remix of Sinnerman! I'm thinking - confusing start to the movie but Mann has not lost his instinct for the good soundtrack so let's call it a draw to start with and keep watching. In the murky darkness Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx as Crockett and Tubbs begin to be apparent. They are staring into the distance across the club for most of the time except for when Crockett heads for drinks and puts the moves on the bartenderess - then back to more staring. At what we are not sure of, some sort of honey trap sting? Some guy meets another guy who gives him his female escorts and the guy heads into the back room to party down but the cops have it wired and are watching it on screens anyway, so what are Crockett and Tubbs looking at? Then for some reason they punch and kick their way across the room to get to somebody for who knows what reason - at least I think it was them fighting their way across the room because it was pretty dark and hard to tell. Then they go out on some balcony to take some private calls with their confidential informants on what they themselves even admit are un-secured un-encrypted phone lines. Turns out their buddy informant (played by John Hawkes, i.e. Sol Star from TV's Deadwood, yeah!) is in trouble and is on the run from the drug dealers he snitched out who meanwhile in a cutaway shot proceed to wipe out the FBI guys (we're gonna need some more FBI guys) that the informant linked them up with. Crockett and Tubbs get the triangulation somehow on their runaway buddy and within a minute (remember they were on the disco balcony seconds before) are driving right up beside him on the freeway and get him to pull over. Meanwhile the guy's family has been wiped out by the drug gang and when Crockett and Tubbs give him the word on that. he walks in front of an approaching transport truck. Turns out of course that the FBI has a leak and Crockett and Tubbs have to go undercover without anyone knowing who they are so that the leak won't give them up. So the drug dealers are in it with some drug importers who have fast boats and a warehouse of drugs so Crockett and Tubbs knock over the warehouse, blow up the boats and rip off the drugs - presumably so that they can offer themselves as replacement boat drivers cause the importer is gonna need a replacement shipment ultra-fast (we're gonna need some more drugs pronto). Then the whole cop posse is intimidating some hood who presumably has to hook them up with the dreaded drug importer gang. Then Tubbs & his lady friend cop are back at his/her place taking a shower and start to get it on and then...I don't know what happened next, because that was when I got up and walked out.Because somewhere on the way to that scene I had just lost interest in the movie and wasn't even interested enough in the 2 characters making out to care what was going to happen next to them. In this Miami Vice, I didn't know who these characters were, had no empathy for them and pretty much could roughly guess the rest of the plot from that point forward when I stopped watching. This was when it was possible to tell what I was watching in the murk and the graininess because a lot of the time it was pretty unclear what was going on. And I have no trouble with hand-held - I even liked the Bourne Supremacy's car chase with the crazy out of control hand-held - but I was shocked at the shakiness and graininess and darkness of some of this footage. And then I read they spent $135 million on this? And I have no attachment to the old TV Miami Vice. I haven't seen an episode in probably almost 20 years. But I seem to remember that Crockett and Tubbs were cool bad-a$$ cops with fast cars and attitude and cool clothes for the time and they were tight with each other and would back each other up to the death and always had a fast wise crack ready.The Crockett and Tubbs in this movie did not give off any of that chemistry, didn't have lines with any cool dialogue and the whole thing seemed to be pretty darkly and confusingly filmed.Maybe I missed something by walking out, but according to a lot of these reviews I apparently didn't.",Miami Vice
238,XFLRWF,"""Miami"" has no heat",4,30 July 2006,"Michael Mann is usually known for presenting a story with an intricate combination of action and drama. However in Mann's latest film, ""Miami Vice"", the film gets so caught up in details that there is barely enough material to make the audience care about the conclusion. Mann's script flounders all over the place that instead of advancing the plot or build the characters the writers preferred to throw in generic filler material. The talent in the cast could not even save ""Vice."" Farrell and Foxx do hit the mark as tough guys but one gets the feeling they wanted to get the film over with as much as the audience.While on an undercover case, Detectives James ""Sonny"" Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) get a call from one of their informants who is in deep trouble with a drug sting gone wrong. Sensing a mole in their ranks, the FBI recruits the duo to infiltrate the drug ring and discover who the snitch is. Playing an elaborate cat-and-mouse game with the ring's top enforcer (John Ortiz), the detectives must be careful to not only protect themselves but also their loved ones. One of them must also be alert of what is the true goal of the operation.Mann's direction starts off on the right foot. He is in tune to get the details of the opening bust and introduce characters to the audience. But once Crockett and Tubbs enter the drug ring, Mann seems lost as to where he should take the film. Instead of enlarging the plot or delving more into the characters, he opts to fill in screen time with repetitive love scenes and landscape shots which greatly slow down the pacing of the film. Mann seems to recognize this as he wrote in the gun battles for the final thirty minutes of the movie. These sequences wake the audience from their slumber as Mann does not skimp on the accuracy and bloodshed. But by waiting so long for the payoff, it hardly seems worth the effort.For their roles as tough guy cops, Farrell and Foxx are on target. But for the most part, that is all they are limited to. Each actor makes their character no-nonsense aces on the job but a bit more human when they are off the clock. Even with Farrell dropping his accent throughout the film, he does try to expand Crockett's character with what he is given. We get to see not only his dedication to his job but the age-old confliction of choosing the job or the girl. Had Foxx not been written with a girlfriend, his performance would have been equally wooden. With the added incentive of having someone he cares about being in potential harm, Foxx adds more personality than just being the tough guy. Additional supporting roles are Chinese actress Gong Li as Isabella and John Ortiz as the Jose Yero. Li does well in her role in presenting a good dichotomy between the hard-edged business woman with a twist in her conscience when she falls for Crockett. Ortiz's psychotic Yero is a great contrast to the heroics of Farrell and Foxx. He presents a real twisted nature that is key to the character without going overboard or campy. Yero leaves his malevolence up to the audience's imagination rather than going to extremes to prove his point.The main problem with ""Miami Vice"" is that it lacks direction. Mann seems to want it to want to be action movie, however, when there is nothing going on he doesn't seem to know what to do. There are spectacular action sequences in the end but only if you can stand sitting through two hours of repetitiveness. The characters are not properly built up and the plot feels more forced than thought out. Fans would be better off catching the television show for entertainment.4.0/10",Miami Vice
239,mvassa71,The Rise and Fall of Michael Mann,6,12 September 2007,"I'm not suggesting that Michael Mann will never make a great movie again, but in reality, he hasn't since ""The Insider"". ""Heat"" and ""The Insider"" came back-to-back, and I suppose now represent the zenith of Mann's career. Both are among my favorite films ever. But ever since, his choice of material and actors has been disappointing. The execution of his material has been disappointing. He seems to be pandering to Hollywood and big paychecks instead of producing the goods that challenge and inspire his audience, something he is quite capable of. Maybe Al Pacino is the missing link. Maybe he is the talisman that could bring Mann back from the edge of irrelevance. You'd think that the power he earned coming off of those two great films would have afforded him the ability to continue making intelligent, character-driven suspense dramas. It seems, however, that he just put things on cruise control, and ""Miami Vice"" is the latest result. As if to wave the white flag and declare without any doubt that he's run out of ideas, he's gone back to the 80's to rehash his old television success. And he fails again. There are signature Mann moments that you inevitably fall for, but when the credits roll, I was deflated one more time. Foxx and Farrell are a joke as Crockett and Tubbs. The love story is insulting to the audience on about five different levels, and the plot is just kind of pedestrian. If it's on free cable, I'd recommend it, otherwise, skip it.",Miami Vice
240,bigbillyt,Mediocre Action - No Real Drama,2,3 August 2006,"Another reviewer, Anandare, pretty much said exactly what I was thinking. I just wanted to add a few additional comments. There was no real point to this movie. The story was lacking any real rise or fall to the plot line, what little plot there was to begin with. The characters and dialog were very superficial and it was impossible to see why any of them acted as they did, much less care. There was no chemistry between any of the actors, even the sex scenes were flat. Overall, this was a waste of time. Even all the cool, fast, cars and boats were just used as props, there wasn't even one decent chase scene thrown in. If this is the direction Michael Mann has taken, he needs to rethink what he is doing., Heat this ain't, I think my four stars is pretty generous.",Miami Vice
241,kidboi,"Mann's worst film to date, but still better than i expected",5,14 September 2006,"When i think of 'Miami Vice', the first two things that come to my mind are Don Johnson and boat shoes. But Michael Mann has gone much deeper than that. He tried to create a film full of action and suspense, yet keeping the emotional line top notch. Sadly, only the action and suspense thing works properly, because everything else he tries to achieve pretty much fails. The film just looks too much like ' Heat' and 'Collateral', which is definitely not a good thing. Why? Because Michael Mann is no the man i would expect to copy his own films. When it comes to Michael Mann, i expect something original and innovative in graphic terms, i expect a lot of powerful and tough emotion. In 'Miami Vice' there is nothing of the above mentioned.Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx try to create the chemistry, they try to be the cool cops, best friends, and magnificent partners, but it just doesn't work out. There is barely any eye contact between the two, the dialog between them is cold and dull (as is the rest of the dialog anyway), and you don't want to feel for them, you just simply don't care what happens to them.But Mann succeeds visually, i guess that just Mann's field. It's something that he does best. I think we can all call him the pioneer of using DV cameras in films. He does it so good, that sometimes it kind of looks like a documentary (as weird as that may sound). The camera work in this film saves everything else.See this for some tough action, slick and entertaining visuals, not for the emotion or acting.5/10",Miami Vice

Michael Mann who's name means ACTION does no justice to the retro 80's duo of Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. Despite extra cool effects and action sequences ""Miami Vice"" was far too long and could not keep my attention. The trailer per usual packs up clips of the action and things foreshadowing it, dose not rain true. Instead the gaps from talking to action are far longer than normal and I felt no real connection like in the t.v series. ""Miami Vice"" is nothing more than a summer popcorn, blockbuster film.

244,anchorman360,Wow This Sucked,1,17 January 2007,I watched Miami vice a couple of days ago expecting it to be very interesting and with lots of action. It turned out to be 2 hours of boring talk and 15 minutes of action. Colin Farrel and Jammie Foxx play the two cops but don't seem too excited about it. For the first hour and 45 minutes there is about 2 minutes of action. Towards the end there was some nice action but it didn't make up for the rest. Now all of Michael Mann's movies have boring parts but this one has a lot more than any other. I am really glad I didn't see it in theaters otherwise I probably would have fallen asleep. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be an action or suspense movie because it did not have either one of them. If you are looking for an action movie to rent look elsewhere.,Miami Vice
245,mailljs,you would be better off watching the TV show,4,12 November 2007,"This movie is so bad it is almost unwatchable. It has nothing to do with the TV series except the director and the names of the two characters. The TV show was about sharp clothes, exotic cars, snappy dialog, the Miami sights and the relationship between Crocket and Tubbs. The movie has none of these attributes. First the movie is so badly lit that for most of the time you can't make out what is happening, even the end credits are undecipherable. Second Farrell and Foxx have no discernible relationship. They seem to mumble most of the dialog, have no on screen chemistry and dress in dark colored clothes like something you might pick up at Vinnies. Third the plot made no sense (what was the Chinese woman doing?) and the action scenes were amateurish consisting almost entirely of automatic weapon fire.

246,plotlessviolence,Completely Awful,1,31 July 2006,"I came in with low expectations, hoping for a stupid action flick, and I was sorely disappointed. The ""plot"" is every undercover cop cliché except for drug use, strung together as if by a man whose only relationship with law enforcement was having seen old television shows about cops which themselves were written by writers whose only relationship to law enforcement was having seen other old television shows.But all the movie really needed to work was a few good gun shootouts and I would have been happy. Instead, there's nothing interesting in terms of technique, choreography, or camera-work. Instead, we have Gong Li's audition for World's Worst Actress as she does her best wooden emotionless robot impression; we're supposed to develop empathy for a moral-less woman swimming in blood money whose only ONLY good characteristic is her willingness to sleep with a main character (and everyone else apparently)? The two main characters are totally indistinguishable (""Brooding"" is not a character archetype, or at least not a good one) other than that one is black and the other isn't, and the bad guys are all idiotic zero-dimensional clichés.The bad guys are all a joke and as bad as the plot is, it's still full of holes: there's never any explanation for why White Supremacists work for and/or buy from hispanics, who the leak is that starts the movie's ""plot,"" why the movie is titled after a TV show it has nothing to do with, whatever happens to the main bad guy (no real ending), why the movie is titled after a job the main characters abandon 10 minutes in...why this got made in the first place...Miami Vice started out OK, very stupid but at least very very fast, but 20 minutes in it slows down to a meandering 2.5 hour waste of time with 5 unnecessary sex scenes. It's honestly more of a softcore porn than a buddy cop movie. If my presence hadn't cost someone else his seat (overbooked theatre) and I hadn't been guilty, I would have walked out.Who rated this higher than a 3?

So what went wrong here? Well, Don Johnson in the original TV series, although a completely tallentless actor, at least had a certain charisma and screen presence. He also single-handedly changed the way that men dressed in the 80's, introducing all those pastal colours. Ground breaking stuff back then. Also, all those flashy cars and speedboats were a big wow-factor back then, whereas today ther'yre not so impressive. Nothing original was brought in.The two leads in this movie share no chemistry.

This is a no nonsense undercover cop thriller. There are no 'buddy cops', wisecracks, car chases, or O.T.T action, so the casual movie goer is going to be a little bemused by what they are seeing. But fans of Michael Mann's work will be in seventh heaven, because this has all the director's trademarks.There's some stunning camera-work (A lot of it digital), and some beautifully rendered sequences in this and some explosive action (But don't go expecting 'Lethal weapon' style action.) The trailer park stand off with the white supremacists was my favourite scene and an abject lesson in how to put suspense on screen.Performances are all very good, right down to the smaller parts and the plot demands attention. I found the films running time flew by. Its so refreshing to see a cop thriller for adults, with no silliness and one that doesn't insult the audiences intelligence.Best film so far this year.",Miami Vice

Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are great as Sonny And Rico, they make a great partnership. The action pieces are great, especially the final standoff between the Miami police and the drug dealers, you actually feel your in it, what with the shaky camera angles and sound effects. What stood out for me most though, regarding this slick popcorn muncher, was the brilliant soundtrack. From the start with Jay Z and Linkin Park, through to Moby's dance songs. It captures the spirit of the movie perfectly. Of course some of the film is over the top but in the end its a stylish no brainer that anyone can enjoy.",Miami Vice

251,whitakeroh,Truly Awful,1,29 July 2006,"All I can say is do not see this movie. This is the worst movie I have seen this summer. I take great latitude in appreciating movies. However, this movie does absolutely nothing the entire time it is on. This is the same type movie as collateral except far worse. We have Colin Farrel whose 6 or so pathetic lines in the movie make him sound like the fakest redneck I have ever heard, not to mention how his mullet looks awful. I know movies are bad when my friends and I start making fun of it 20 minutes into the film. The script here is absolutely horrendous, there are lines the characters say that lead nowhere and mean nothing. There are scenes that just seem to continue into forever while characters look aimlessly in the sky or in the distance. I mean we were making snoring sounds to express our distaste for how long and drawn out some of the scenes were. Why do women like Colin Farrel? In this movie he looks like a redneck speed freak with a mullet, and has the build of a 12 year old soccer player. The plot, oh my, is so terrible. I still am not sure what the horrid plot was. Suffice to say that we have ""major"" drug lords who don't look imposing at all, have no presence, and make no sense. Then we have this ""professional drug business woman"" who is with the top drug dealer in south America or something, and falls for some hillbilly from nowhere in one day in Cuba. This made no sense. Further, the other drug dealer guy was lameo. He looked as scary as my goldfish, and his presence wasn't ominous or anything of the like. Look, I like most action movies when they are fun, exciting, OK plot, whatever, but this movie is terrible folks. It makes no sense, there is no plot, the acting sucks, there are long drawn out scenes that lead nowhere and you the action isn't that great. There are a couple of OK scenes where there is heavyweight gunplay, however, these scenes comprise about .5% of the movie. The other 99.95% of the movie are stills of Colin Farrel looking into the distance at nothing while a camera shakes like your watching your teenage son direct his friend's band at the local bar. Lastly, a word on political correctness in movies: why the flip are the other drug dealers in Miama Florida white aryan nation guys? Is Hollywood so held hostage by blacks that they can't portray them honestly? I mean, the gangs in Miami are hispanic (latin American) or black, not white. Its almost like in film anymore we can't portray any truth, no movies about terrorists arabs, we still have the same Russian white guys, and here whites. Why? Because whites require no political protection from any attack. So directors play it safe so they aren't accused of anything, but it makes the whole movie unrealistic and boring.",Miami Vice
252,haasxaar,Mann succeeds in many ways and fails in many others,6,23 August 2006,"Michael Mann obviously wanted to distance himself from any prior reputation and connotations that the series of the 1980's entailed. This film is serious, gritty and realistic. However, some of the changes were not successful despite Mann's style and skill.It is plain to see in this film that Mann tried to challenge himself. The usual slick, blue backgrounds and atmospheric, colourful settings are still abundant. However, this time around it's obvious that Mann wanted something different - the use of hand-held cameras and a different lens calibration gave the film something extra. Mann attempted to avoid the over-styled and smooth direction of the series to focus more on a naturalistic manner of portrayal. Therein lie no real flaws in the film's direction style. Where the films's real problems surface are that when a director decides to purposefully pursue a film that has a hard, cruel realistic bite one needs believable and developed characters and a coherent and focused plot. Miami Vice has simply far too many characters, far too many plot strands, far too many pointless sequences.The main allure of the series was the partnership of Crockett and Tubbs. In this film their relationship is far too convoluted and the interaction between the two is minimal. The chemistry between Farrell and Foxx is not bad but Mann's script was a little underdeveloped, you never had the feeling that they really like each other. It would have been easy for Mann to descend down the Michael Bay a la Bad Boys route with stupid, superficial and pointless macho boastings and statements. Yet, Mann should have emphasised a stronger coherency between the two main protagonists. Mann should also have kept the story simple and more comprehensible, for it led to the villains and numerous side-characters being degraded into plain cut-outs.The end of the film never led to the emotional climax of Mann's best film 'Heat'. He had simply spent too much time on the stylistic elements, rather than on his writing. The script seems a little rushed and lacking in places, where surely Mann with his many abilities would have been capable of creating an overall better film. In conclusion it must be said that Miami Vice is not a bad film, it disappoints in its vagueness - for one that never particularly liked much from the 1980's it was glad to see that Mann tried to stretch himself visually and experiment, rather than play to the billions of fan boys by just rehashing the old formula of the series. A lost opportunity, but still a decent film.",Miami Vice

I can understand the need to keep things fresh and update a franchise. However, this is basically a very boring 'action' film incidentally entitled 'Miami Vice'. In particular Colin Farrell's pitiful performance bore no relation to the Crockett i'm familiar with. What Miami Vice the TV series lacked in depth it always made up for with a bit of humour and a good soundtrack, both were absent in this film. I'm glad it's flopped and there wont be sequel, its an insult to a decent TV show, very fondly remembered. Everyone involved in this movie should be thoroughly ashamed. The only good thing that will come of it is the continued release of the season box sets to cash in on the undoubted flock for the real thing when disappointed cinema go-ers head for their nearest DVD store.

Frame one to the appearance of the film's title after the fade to black. The FILM, not movie, went far beyond any expectations I'd had. A fan of the TV show, I admit that I'm guilty of what so many others are guilty of. That being a complete and utter misconception of what I remember the 80's series to be. Admit it, we think of the wardrobes and the 80's lifestyles and don't even remember the story lines. It almost as if we just can't get past Don Johnson's singing career to remember what Miami Vice really was. Trust me, pick it up on DVD and you'll see from the get-go how raw and hard the TV show really was.This film will not make the money it deserves to make. Too many nay-sayers and those fed up with TV-Show-To-Movie projects. That's too bad because Michael Mann is only getting better. An amazing accomplishment here is that the story (what's up with all the critics finding it hard to follow?) is so engrossing and involved that not even the celebrity of it's two stars can distract. Credit the director, the writing and the actors to be sure. Collin and Jamie become all new people of flesh and blood. I, for one, appreciate the subtlety displayed by all of the players. One of my favorite movies of all time is Scarface, but even it has it's moments where suspension of disbelief is shaken by and actor here or there that just doesn't get the line out or seems overzealous. Not here. From stars to bit parts to extras this film bleeds authenticity. I felt as though I was taken into this world and literally experiencing it with the characters.All too often ""bad guys"" are played out in such a stereotypical way that it's hard to be fearful for the heroes. Not here. Much care was put into making them HUMAN. A much darker way to approach the subject matter. Avoiding stereotypes, we watch our villains in everyday settings and having conversations that feel like real people conversing, not simply spoting off lines that drive the plotting of their evil schemes. These are businessmen who's business is crime and they do it well.I was emotionally involved and concerned. This is a brutal film. I don't say that to infer that there's an excess of violence but to illustrate that even beyond the violence displayed is another dynamic altogether where it's understood that the unknown is far more frightening than what's right in front of your eyes. Watching JAWS, we all know that the shark is a fake yet we were scared out of our minds. What was ultimately more frightening than seeing the shark itself was watching those barrels move around the water, disappear and the re-surface and just bob there a bit. I felt that same anxiety here. I'm reluctant to go into plot points but we all know that the film involved drug dealers and undercover officers. What makes this film truly stand out is the insider's view to both sides of the conflict. I love HEAT but wanted so much more of the investigative and criminal sides of the story. I understand now why it was made the way it was but Miami Vice delivers all of what I would have wanted and more from a film of this genre.I love where this film took the characters. I want more. Really, this film is the ""hang your balls out there"" film of the year. Probably won't get nominated (by virtue of name only) but it certainly deserves to be. Look out for another outstanding performance from Barry Shabaka Henley. Stellar acting all around. I want this entire cast and crew when I make my films.",Miami Vice
258,Lawrence-20,Not so hot,5,8 August 2006,"I had high hopes for this. They showed the pilot a couple of weeks ago on network TV, it hasn't aged much surprisingly. It is a very powerful effort. Most of why that was great are the same reasons this 2006 version is not. Mostly Crockett is not explained, there is no back story, there is no effort made to care about any of the characters. I was really disappointed by this, I couldn't bring myself to care about the characters to the point I would overlook blown scenes or lines delivered half ass.That being said, I am glad I saw it. The last 30 minutes or so are what you might expect from Mann, very real action.But walking away I felt a little taken for granted, like Mann spent the effort on the wrong thing. Crocket was a failure, college football player, couldn't be pro. Failed marriage drank too much. Generally was scared of doing his job. 2006 Crockett was a mumbling guy that said little, we have not reason to care about him.The nightlife scenes looked staged and fake to me. Also Gong Li's accent was almost impossible to understand and her uttering some of those lines was a bad joke.",Miami Vice
259,matthewpr06,An Criminally Underrated Movie Masterpiece,9,1 March 2007,"Miami Vice I watched Miami Vice for the first time today. I've been desperate to see it ever since it was released in the summer. Mixed reviews and a poor box office did not put me off one bit. Miami Vice is criminally underrated. This is a truly brilliant movie and every bit as good as, if not better, than Heat. Michael Mann's Miami looks stunning; the performances are restrained, minimal and calculating. The script is lean, complex and full of memorable one liners. The whole thing is paced almost perfectly, with only the Gong Li - Colin Farrell love affair subplot being slightly protracted. Restraint is the key word here, the gun fights and car chases are conspicuously absent for most of the movie, the later never materialising. But when the gun fight comes late in the third act, its violent, brutal, fresh and hyper realistic. Miami Vice is a Michael Mann film, and a man's film; girls, guns, glamour, speed boats, private jets and Ferraris galore. My favourite aspect of this movie (apart from the incredibly stylish visuals) was the Farrell/Foxx relationship; there were no buddy movie clichés or unnecessary banter, just consummate professionalism and trust.Smooth, that's how we do it.8.5 /10",Miami Vice
260,snodlander,*Yawn*,2,28 August 2006,"At over 2 hours, it seems much longer. To try and revive the flagging plot there are a couple of gratuitous sex scenes (It is apparently impossible to take a shower without having sex), but they embarrass more than titillate. Miami is so small it appears everyone knows everyone (There's a drug lord we have never heard of? No worries, we know someone who works with him. There is a hostage in a trailer somewhere in Miami? Oh, we bet we know exactly which one). There are plot holes galore, and unresolved plot lines (who was the mole, the premise for the whole film?).The big bad boss hardly moved, he was so wooden, even his lines were delivered as though he were a ventriloquist. My worry is that, as he was still at large at the end of the film, there will be a Miami Vice II.I was bored beyond belief. Er Indoors now has to see an arty film with me as penance.",Miami Vice
261,tomcantwell,Pointless and formulaic,2,27 May 2007,"A very disappointing waste of money and electricity. What the hell was going on? I defy the apologists for this movie to freeze it at any given point and say who is doing what. It's not that it's hard to follow, it's just that it's one pointless scene after another. No drama and no intrigue. No entertainment either, just butt-numbing tedium. I like a good explosion-fest as much as anyone (T2, Die Hard etc) and I love a good thriller (Strangers on a Train, A Simple Plan etc) and, although I like well scripted intelligent movies, I want my Saturday night movie to always be a roller-coaster-can't-take-my-eyes-off-the-screen type. This should have been that kind of movie but it wasn't. It was dull and boring. The characters were so fake that you would embarrass yourself suspending your disbelief. Everything in this movie has been done before and done better. Watch it if you don't have a real life to compare it to, otherwise watch one of the many excellent movies that are out there that don't insult your intelligence.",Miami Vice
262,wannasurf2,"Good action flick, not the original",7,28 July 2006,"Had I never seen the original show, this would have simply been another decent cop / action movie. Since I have basically seen every episode a million times, I was a little let down.As far as action and imagery goes, it was top notch, but the characterization of the original just was not there. At least the ""Michael Mann feel"" is there as well as excellent use of music, but even Heat seems a notch above this flick - and expectations were so high.The screenplay is a little ""messy"" at times and it takes about 15 minutes into the film to feel comfortable that you were watching characters and not simply Ferrel and Fox. Also, the abundant use of acronyms and insider terms is surely more realistic, but probably will leave anyone who is not a DEA agent confused throughout the movie.The biggest letdown of the film was the absence of Castillo (J.E. Olmos) who supposedly turned a reprising role. This would have made a huge improvement in the film and would have been the next best thing to having a 35 year old Don Johnson for the remake.Don't get me wrong - this is a good movie, but is not up to par with what one expects from the people that made Miami Vice in the first place, and had 20 years and a zillion dollars to work with.",Miami Vice
263,MorganMan1,Sonny just wishes he was so COOL!,5,8 August 2006,"Ask me what I think of the all-new and improved Miami Vice and I will tell you ""It is new and defiantly improved"" compared to the tired old TV series that could never hold my interest. As a matter of fact I am sure that the old Sonny and Ricardo just wish they were as cool as the new and improved Foxy Ricardo and bushy eyed, headed, Irish Sonny. Just look at the facts, the old version (and I do mean OLD) hero's could muster up an occasional $60,000 vehicle, a million dollar beach house, a nice cigarette boat or an Uzi or two. They could do all of that on a salary of less than $35,000 per year. The new and improved version hero's have a private jet, a mansion, a whole fleet of collectible cars including but not limited to $60,000 price tags, a flotilla of CIGAR off shore race boats that all do in excess of 200 kph and a whole squadron of Navy Seals at their disposal!! And to think my daddy told me ""son don't be a cop because they don't make any money"". He evidently has never meet Sonny Crockett or Ricardo!! Oh, by the way, before I forget, the sex and violence was new and improved also. That's a whole new review for later.",Miami Vice
264,shervinv,the good and the bad...,7,31 July 2006,"I agree with many of the comments I read about this movie... it had elements of good and bad. The story is pretty standard drug movie plot, no surprises, no twists. There's definitely something wrong with the sound in this film, like another reviewer said, I couldn't understand anything people were saying! Either they were mumbling, or they were talking in a loud disco, or were trying to talk with a mouth full of marbles... I think something like this happened on the set: ""it appears that half the actors have forgotten their lines sir""... ""hmm, never mind, the show must go on... just have them nod and grunt a lot""... The plot of the movie, tries to be more than it is, and just gets very confusing. There is little chemistry between the actors... none of the relationships were believable. Sounds like I must have hated this film, but I left it feeling good. Mostly because of the last gun scene, it was unique, in the way that the scene in Heat was unique, you'll just have to see it. Great action sequence. So I went to be entertained and I was. That's all I can say.",Miami Vice
265,Caliann,Impressive and engaging,8,29 July 2006,"I loved it. Lean mean scripting and even better sound editing. Technically impressive all the way around. To me one Mann's most creative. It gets a 10 on the ""have to pee"" test -- when you can't find a moment in the film that doesn't matter, you gotta hold it. And I did.I'm not a fan of Colin Farrell but he's beginning to grow on me. And while it seems most people judge the size and quality of the role by how many words come out of the actors' mouths, Foxx and Li were masters in the unspoken. Also not a big fan of hand held riffs but Mann kept it to a minimum so it did what it's good at, creating emphasis and urgency. And I think the story fit the bill. The jargon and accents sometimes made it hard to follow, but I never lost track of the plot or wondered what the movie was about. The overall look and feel of the film was riveting -- its immediacy, granularity of night scenes, Mann used just about every trick in the book to enhance his film without flaunting his virtuosity. But the sound editing and score blew me away. You've got to love a guy like that. He's a master who got out of the Hollywood mold and did his own thing. And yeah, this ain't your daddy's VICE.",Miami Vice
266,cliveowensucks,Mann goes for cynical empty corporate product,4,31 July 2006,"And bad corporate product. The critics have if anything been overly kind to it simply BECAUSE it's a Michael Mann film. Over here in the UK, Empire criticised the acting, the plot and the lack of direction but then gave it four stars 'because it's Michael Mann.' A lot of other reviews are the same. But take away the brand, and you've just got a bad misfire, shoddily made, badly acted, wildly UNrealistic and which really could have been made by anyone. This is the LEAST Michael Mann film to date, just a sellout to make a fast buck. Mann ought to go back to doing films he cares about, because he's really not any good at this kind of faceless, empty product (yes, I saw it). And that's all it is. No wonder it opened so poorly.Right from the start it was obvious that he was trying and failing to make a commercial dumbed own movie and he couldn't pull it off. He kept on trying to raise the material, but the more he tried, the more he showed up how hollow the whole thing was. The miscasting didn't help - Gong Li, much as I love her, should never have been asked to try an accent, it just killed her performance. Foxx was adequate, Farrell not. Anyone could have made this film. I really felt I was watching a bad Dominic Senna or Antoine Fuqua movie.The biggest two problems - no plot. Mann has no interest in the plot at all. It loses interest in the mole hunt and most of the undercover plot. Nothing is really resolved, but it doesn't make any thematic point of that. It's a film that starts in the middle of a scene and then stops two hours and twenty minutes later. This wouldn't be so bad if it didn't have problem number two - virtually no characterisation. That's what drags the film out. HEAT overstayed its welcome by a good half hour, but it still had a grip of character. The characters were clichés, yes, but played as if they were true. This film just has people we don't know anything about doing things we know little about. This may be because Mann writes himself into a corner. By beginning so far into the story, we're only really given the undercover Farrell. Huge mistake. Mann seems to think he's making a big statement about losing yourself in a false identity, but since we never see Farrell's real identity, there's nothing to lose, so no sense of loss and no empathy. That kills off his character even before Farrell does his lost puppy dog expression to show sensitivity. You MIGHT get away with that if the other players had character, but the vague sketching of Gong Li is all you get. Jamie Foxx has no notable humanity and Naomi Harris is just there to prove he's not gay. The villains are straight out of Fred Dyer's old HUNTER TV show. Pains me to say it, but Mann hasn't made a single decent film this century. He needs to seriously rethink what he's doing and how much he's spending.Be objective - if anyone but Mann made this, would you SERIOUSLY think it a good movie? People are cutting him way too much slack, and his film-making is suffering because of it.Oh, and the crappy HD video? It doesn't look realistic, it doesn't reflect the way the human eye sees in any way, it looks much more artificial than film. There's very little detail in those night scenes either, unless you call grain detail, but he could have got that on 35mm. The night excuse doesn't stack up either. Plenty of great night scenes have been shot on fast filmstock in the past. It may be quicker but it shows that no care is taken. There's no depth to the image, a lot of ghosting and artefacting. The night stuff manages to look worse than John Cassavettes SHADOWS, which was shot with available light on 16mm fifty years ago! One small saving for the balance sheet, one giant leap back for the art of movie photography.One other huge side-effect. Because they can shoot more cheaper, you get a LOT of scenes that go on and on forever as the actors go through their tics and mannerisms. In that way it's very like bad self-indulgent Cassavettes, allowing the actors to grandstand methodstyle instead of getting down to business. That's how you end up with a two-and-a-half hour movie where you never even get a resolution to the whole reason they go undercover. It just gets in the way of the story.If you must see it, wait for video or DVD where the problems won't be blown up to giant size.",Miami Vice

From the experience of michael mann with excellent films such as HEAT and COLLATERAL he follows up with this !! The actors were fine, soundtrack was good but a simple story stretched with no surprises. It was all predictable and seemed to be rushed to get it into cinema and break box office records which it didn;t quite do.The Series was good with action, drama and surprises this seemed to have a dull drama, alittle action to say they tried and no surprises.I know michael mann can do a better job so please remake this film again and do it right! if the remake is good this will soon be forgotten.To those who have seen this film i ask for you to be true to yourself and others and say what you really think, for example the new bond film {Casino Royale) is crap, daniel craig is undoubtfully a good bond but the script was crap and i seen better straight to DVD films.To Everyone on IMDb........ i repeat....... please be truthful.... don't follow the crowd and the media because you do know they're gonna say its good so you buy it............. right?I JUST BOUGHT THE DVD TODAY AND I KNOW I Don't REALLY LIKE THE FILM BUT THE SOUNDTRACK IS GREAT AND ITS A VERY SUBTLE FILM THAT YOU CAN WATCH AGAIN IF YOU MAKE IT TO THE END, ITS ACTUALLY QUITE COOL !!",Miami Vice
268,danieljames-65664,Michael Mann at his best,9,20 September 2018,"I've seen Heat several times, but honestly there's much more going on in Miami Vice. When Mann understands his subject matter well, the result is highly engrossing. This is how I explain why Blackhat was such a disaster, and why I'm looking forward to his upcoming Tony Accardo/Sam Giancana biopic.",Miami Vice
269,kctotal,Never Stands Out,5,31 March 2007,"Television series adaptations are usually unwise to make. However, Miami Vice always had a cinematic style and so a film was entirely welcome. The problem really is being faithful to the series. Miami Vice is brought to screen with a significant change. It has become more adult. Just as in the TV series, Miami Vice is mainly about two undercover agents trying to infiltrate a drug circle, led by Isabella and her partner. I found myself unable to grasp what was going on until half the movie, and there are too much characters dipping in and out of the story. Lots of characters usually mean lots of performances, but the film doesn't give them lots of screen time, so I will comment about three very important characters  Crockett, Tubbs and Isabella. As Tubbs we have award winner Jamie Foxx, and to be honest I'm not that satisfied. When his girlfriend, Trudie is taken captive, he doesn't show much emotion and therefore I can only state that he was quite a waste. He doesn't have much to do, and his background is too vague. Crockett is somewhat better as he is well portrayed by Colin Farrell. The upside to his performance was that there was more turmoil in his character, which means that there is more depth in his character. I have absolutely no doubts that Jamie Foxx is a brilliant actor, but this film ignored him and decided to give more importance to Colin Farrell. Last, but not least is Gong Li's mesmerizing portrayal as Isabella. I was once again surprised by this little seen actress who after having gained her respect in the recent ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", she has proved to be volatile even in a big action movie. At first her character is surrounded by a barrier of steel, but along the course of the movie the ice melts away and her emotional inner self takes place. Fortunately, she is given a decent amount of screen time. Her English isn't yet fluent, but she was much more understandable than her co-stars' frequent mumbling. Director Michael Mann is used to the film's setting and the series, so his direction is quite plausible. What is not welcome is the script, which left guessing what was happening for half the time. This problem was also increased by the actors' frequent mumbling which had me stretching my ears to understand a single word of what they were saying. The accent was way too American. This made it possible for foreign Gong Li to be the most understandable as her effort in speaking the language is priceless. Subtitles would have been terrible, even though I will definitely view the film with subtitles at home. The film also had a large variety of exotic locations varying from nightclubs in Colombia to beautiful and remote places in the forest near the waterfalls.The action is okay, but the problem is that there is basically no action at all. Men walk around with guns all over the place but there is very little impact. The film finally reaches its climax in a shootout towards the very end. It starts with a bang, but the middle part is too dull to be appreciated, only focusing about Sonny and Isabella's relationship and trying to get into the drug business. The film then takes another jolt as the film finally reaches its peak with some decent action and gunfights. Another big problem was the minimal inclusion of the other members of the team, which are seen, but not heard. As in M:I:3, the film doesn't give any importance to the rest of the characters.VerdictModern and exciting, this adaptation looks good on the outside, but it a little too shadowy and bare on the inside. At least we get another truly memorable acting turn by Gong Li.",Miami Vice
270,errol1909,A Mann's Mess...,3,28 July 2006,"This film like many other reviews, is NOTHING like the greatest show ever made. It's not Miami VICE of the 80's. It's titled Miami vice, and by coincidence the names of the main character's happen to be the same from the show. This movie was a wreck from the opening scene in a dance club. I had no idea what the hell was going on for the first half-hour. A little conversation here, driving down the Miami freeway, blowing up two boats, and then a little more conversation on the cell phone protecting an informant. What the hell is going on? The whole movie was like this from beginning to end. Michael Mann, you should be damn ashamed of yourself. Even the worst episode of Miami Vice ever Missing Hours had a plot. This is an over-blown, money wasted movie that has no PLOT. No characterization, no fun, crappy music,a low-key wardrobe throughout, and only one damn action scene that is more than a minute long. Which was a shootout, that was once again just as insane as Mann's Heat shootout. Also no car chase. You can't make a Miami Vice movie and not have an car chase. The worst thing about this movie was the hand held camera shaking and sloppy, rough cut editing that was confusing through the whole picture. Who edited this movie? Mann or a monkey. Does Mann also have a shaking problem? The camera focused in and out constantly, panned left and right very amateurish, and the film had a very cheap student film look to it. A lot of grainy shots, that made this film feel like it was being documented and at the same time filmed as a movie. An utter mess throughout. The characters of Crockett and Tubbs were dull, as were the bad guys. I'm going to end this now. I don't want to waste anymore time with this GARBAGE. Movies are coming to an end. This movie doesn't ruin Miami Vice THE SHOW. It's not the show, it just uses the title. There's only one Miami Vice and it stars Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas and it was made in the 80's! This movie should really be called the shield.",Miami Vice
271,teo-sun,"Solid, realistic and well directed!",7,18 October 2006,"You can see Michael Mann's signature in this one, just like ""Heat"" and the great ""Collateral"". This movie has almost nothing to do with the 80's TV series apart from the protagonists and the background. What we have here is a solid, well directed and very realistic cop movie. Don't expect a fast-paced flick like ""Die Hard"" or something like that 'cause ""Miami Vice"" is like a ""stealth"" movie in the world of cartels and drug dealers, with only few moments of action, but a very realistic action, nothing like the ""super tricks"" 007 style! The acting is very good, the photography is fantastic, adding that particular touch that only a great director like Mann is capable to put in a movie. The soundtrack, also, is great, with a lot of tracks from Audioslave that add that strange mood to the movie.In the end ""Miami Vice"" is a great movie. Go see it absolutely if you're a Mann's fan or if you liked ""Collateral""; if you've never seen the other two movies from that director go see it anyway: you won't be disappointed!",Miami Vice

Should do well at the box office, but gee, could it have been any more violent? Some people were laughing about it out loud in the theatre.One of the biggest problem in this movie is how low-profile Jamie Foxx is, but I guess it was the point too, everybody remembers Don Johnson more than Phillip Michael Thomas (and I would need to check because I'm not even sure it was his name) The plot, well, not as original as it could be, but how original can a drug dealer movie be? The movie itself is wonderfuly done, super imagines, good action packed, perfect popcorn movie, but not with the kids please ;)",Miami Vice
273,David Mills,Dark and realistic,8,31 August 2006,"If you look in the user ratings and comments, you either hate it or love it. Well I love it. The pace is great, the photography sometimes breathtaking and there is realism in this dark, dark movie. Mann made a new movie and did not look back at the series. I liked the series very much but it never felt realistic to me, just great entertainment. This one does. The lead characters are well played for this kinda movie and Farrell adds something extra here. The other characters are just awesome, casting for this movie was superb picking some relatively unknown actors who play their parts very convincing.If you look for a revival of the eighties don't go you will be disappointed, if you look for a collateral/HEAT kinda movie don't go either. But if you look for a dark, realistic and tough police flick go and you won't be disappointed.",Miami Vice
274,nalders,Visually innovative and realistic... too bad it was supposed to be Miami Vice.,8,17 August 2006,"The best thing about this movie is the fascinating visual style. Dark, gritty, not at all like the flashy 80's TV series it's based on. This movie has the character names and general story in common with the series, but the feel of the thing is radically different. The acting is adequate, and while I normally dislike Colin Farrell, the problem here is more with the dialogue he has to work with. Several of his lines made me cringe (Isabelle: ""How fast does your boat go?"" Crockett: ""It goes very fast."" No emphasis or anything. Unintentionally hilarious). The romance with Isabelle (Gong Li) seems forced and cold. Also, several plot lines are not followed through to conclusion, such as the FBI leak. Perhaps this is intentional ambiguity, but it makes for poor storytelling.The whole style of the movie clashes badly with the iconic features of the series that they reintroduce. I think this movie tries to do too many things at once; to recreate Miami Vice, and to make a hardcore, realistic, visually innovative crime drama. I think this would have been better accomplished in two movies, because these elements hamper each other. It was like seeing Crockett and Tubbs in their Ferraris and fast boats shown on an episode of COPS.Taken as a stand alone crime drama, though, it's not bad. The realism is taken a step farther than this genre has before (as much as possible while still trying to maintain ties to the old Miami Vice). The gunplay is exceptionally real; the chatter of automatic weapons is unfiltered. That is how they sound on camera.The ending gun battle is as realistic as I've ever seen on screen. More than Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, where the lighting is good and the special effects are dazzling. This is COPS real. Lighting is bad. Everything is loud. Nobody's pulling any Matrix-type crap, or making impossible shots (Farrell in prone position puts two bullets in a guy's head underneath a car, which isn't impossible but is exceptional shooting under the circumstances). Everyone's shooting for a purpose, with comparable accuracy. Tactics are done well. The battle is prefaced with a countersniping maneuver, and one of the bad guys has the vaunted Barrett Light .50, which makes its debut earlier. You never see one of these in action; I'd buy this movie just for that. Officers leapfrog from cover to cover under suppressing fire and Jamie Foxx's character, stuck behind enemy lines with an autoloading Benelli, tries do as much damage as possible while staying mobile at the same time. This scene makes the movie, for me. I give the gun battle a ten, the rest of the movie a six, which averages out to the eight that I decided on. Miami Vice has its problems, but there are enough things I like about it to make space on my shelf, when that day comes.",Miami Vice
275,cdoelle,Miami Yikes!!!,4,4 August 2006,"First off, let me say that the only reason I watched this movie is because it was free and there was nothing else to do. Miami Vice was a real stinker. Perhaps that isn't the right word... maybe crap fest is more to the point.Seriously, a free movie should not make you feel cheated... but this bit of celluloid trash not only wasn't worth the price of admission, but made me feel dirty for consenting to sit through it. Colin Farrell's accent went in and out throughout the film, Jaime Foxx, who has proved he can act, just phoned this one in, and the rest of the cast was... well, forgettable. The biggest blame of all falls squarely on the shoulders of Michael Mann.Not only did he over direct, over-audio-enhance, and under-light the whole thing... his writing is horrible. Hey, I know Mann is not known for his writing skills, but this made some of his earlier debacles seem watchable. An average episode of the old Miami Vice TV show seems like Shakespeare compared to this mindless crud. Boo hiss, Mr. Mann! Yeah it is crap with a capital CRAP! Gone is the coolness of Crockett and Tubbs. Gone are the hotties and the whole Miami scene. Even the fast cars and boats were only cameos at best - of less importance that pimping Bacardi and all the other product placement. (I mean how many times do they have to mention the Mojito?) And don't even get me started on the new Lt. Castillo.Once again, let me say...boo hiss, Mr. Mann! RATING 4 out of 10",Miami Vice
276,scherfcom,"Extremely well-done movie, ... great ambiance",10,31 May 2014,"The attention to detail that Michael Mann and the crew put into this flick is just phenomenal. Everything from the airplanes, cars, boats, wardrobe, locations, interior design, etc. used provide an exceptional visual experience and ambiance. Starting with the boat ride in the Mojo from Miami to Havana, the Cuba scenes from the arrival with the salsa dance to Manzanita's ""Arranca"" to the cinematography in the morning hours on the balcony are very smooth and engaging.BTW, the dancing is found throughout this motion picture, with disco scenes in the beginning to a sensual dance between actors Gong Li and Colin Farrell in a disco in South America. BTW, the soundtrack is also unique and an excellent selection with special tracks by King Pritt, Moby, Emilio Estefan's ""Pennies in my Pocket"" aside from the mentioned rare Cuban salsa track ""Arranca"" by Manzanita.Also, the cast was superb with wonderful chemistry. Performances by Colin Farrell and Gong Li are outstanding. John Ortiz delivered a great performance with the ""Jose Yero"" character ... really a joy to watch.I've seen this film by now maybe 30 times or so and I always look forward to it when I find time to relax as it's always an engaging flick, and as mentioned the ambiance and attention to detail regarding location, cinematography, etc. make it virtually a masterpiece.",Miami Vice
277,Skycoaster,Police Brutality,3,1 August 2006,"There are no opening credits to Miami Vice, and that is probably for the best, because otherwise we would have a name to put with this mess of a movie. Instead, the movie tries to be clever by launching us headfirst into the plot from frame one, but it goes all too fast and overshoots.And what I mean is that there is no plot, or at least not one we can care about. In fact, no one in the movie seems to care about it either, which is a disappointment from actors who should be able to hide their apathy. Instead, they trod through the scenes uttering nonsensical dialog in tones so low that sometimes they are unintelligible; they do not care enough to enunciate their lines, and the movie suffers from it.From the understandable dialog we can piece together a plot that may have looked good on paper: Sonny (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo (Jamie Foxx) penetrate a drug syndicate to catch a radical group that revealed an undercover FBI agent and killed him, his partner, and his family. Along the way, Sonny romances one of his targets, Isabella (Gong Li), who retrogresses without any outside influence from a strong and capable boss-type to an annoyingly pitiful ""victim"" . She falls in love with the undercover cop, her boss daddy gets angry, and the cliché lives on.After an hour of minimal entertainment (For the record, there is not a single laugh in the whole movie), we realize that this is not the buddy cop movie that we expected. Sonny and Ricardo are acquaintances, but they appear together so infrequently that they seem to be avoiding each other. Only once does one express confidence in the other's ability as a law enforcer, but the expression changes nothing in either cop's attitude or actions. The movie asks us to split our partiality between both, but they are caught in personalities that we cannot help but abhor.All the while, it is evident that something is going on plot wise. Unfortunately for the actors, none of the characters seems concerned enough to act logically. Unfortunately for the filmmakers, errors in sound direction drop crucial plot elements from the fragmented story. Unfortunately for the audience, enough people were lured into theaters for it to come in at number one at the box office. That is police brutality.P.S.: Should Miami Vice not take place primarily in Miami?",Miami Vice
278,jdfcanada,Pleasantly surprised,7,27 July 2006,"I went to see the Miami Vice premiere Wednesday with a friend and man was I surprised! I'll admit I didn't care much for the TV show, so I was expecting very little in terms of this movie. I'd seen the trailer but I didn't think too much of it either. I was expecting a cheesy retro 80s flashback to rolled-up sleeves and shoes with no socks, but instead got to see a very stylish and gritty cop show.The movie starts out with Sonny (Colin Farrell) and Rico (Jamie Foxx) working a sting on a pimp who uses a nightclub to solicit business. Just as they are about to bust the bad guy, they get a call from an old informant who tells them that his cover is blown and the meet he set-up tonight is going bad. Sonny calls the FBI but it's already too late. The FBI guys get blown away and very quickly Sonny and Rico are forced undercover to find out what went wrong and to set things right. The story gets a bit muddled here and the original bad guys (white supremacists) disappear and are replaced by a Columbian drug lord and his cronies.Fortunately, Michael Mann deprives us of cheesy 80s clothing and style and instead updates everything for the 21st century. Hot new cars, boats and planes are used every few minutes, as well as plenty of high-tech firepower. While the story stumbles in the middle, the action sequences are excellent (they kind of reminded me of Heat  a Michael Mann classic) and the acting is very good. Farrell and Foxx are worthy replacements for Don Johnson et al. There are also plenty of ruthless, unsavory chaps and beautiful ladies to round out the cast.It was much better than I expected and I think it should do well. If this was called anything other than Miami Vice, I expect it would be considered one of the best cop/buddy action movies in the past several years. Because of the title, some people will go in expecting to see a cheesy copy of the 80s TV show and might come away disappointed, but don't let the title deceive you, it's a good movie and well worth seeing in the afternoon to escape the summer heat.",Miami Vice
279,YugoNinja,"WTF, Mann?",6,22 September 2006,"I'm a huge Mann fan. I loved Heat. I adored the Insider. I was mesmerized by Collateral. I was really looking forward to this one. As a kid I watched Miami Vice and the idea of making a movie that would capture the spirit of the series was just ... great! But it didn't happen. The chemistry that Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas had, that buddy-buddy bond just wasn't there. I remember Rico cracking jokes, smiling, laughing a lot in the TV series, while Jamie Foxx doesn't even flinch. Colin Farrell is so dead serious, almost melodramatic, it just bothered me. I understand this movie is Michael's own, personal interpretation of Miami Vice, but it just WASN'T Miami Vice to me. The names and the location were the same, as for the rest... Also, I expected this movie to be action, I got almost 1 hour and a half of boring romantic sequences and a 5 minute shoot-out. Very disappointing.",Miami Vice
280,bryanross1985,a special occasion for me,1,6 September 2006,"Wow, I have never given a movie a score of 1 before as I was saving it for something special, well folks, this is it. While this film was visually stylish, this was overshadowed vastly by the swiss cheese plot, ham acting, unrealistic pyrotechnics and very poor direction which was overly evident in this mindless piece of drivel which, by the way, is a diabolical ""tribute"" to the legendary TV programme. I went to see this at my local multiplex with my fiancée, I was very excited by the prospect of seeing one of my favourite childhood television programmes made into a 134 minute long blockbuster, in our opinion, 45 minutes could have easily been shaved off of this film, this would have greatly reduced my displeasure and disgust. A tip for anyone who wants to see this film, sit on a piece of barbed wire while watching it as this film is an ideal cure for all you insomniacs out there. Lets hope they don't make a sequel.",Miami Vice
281,gbraver,Very Disappointing,3,6 September 2008,"This movie is awful. It bares no resemblance to the TV series that was the root of the movie with the exception of the names of the characters.The interaction between Farrel and Fox also was just missing. How can anyone say anything good about this, and what really ticks me off is they have a Japanese actress playing the role of a Cuban liaison. Who in their right mind would ever believe she was a Spanish speaking native. and the always needed gun shootout was off. You see police sharpshooters and swat teams on the scene but what happens to them when the shooting starts?I guess the good news is there will be no sequel",Miami Vice
282,nivekj1,The New Cool,9,29 July 2006,"Michael Mann's ""Miami Vice"" has been completely re-envisioned from its original TV series. Only the core concept remains the same: two undercover cops in Miami bust criminals. But this update uses every advantage it gains from being translated to the big screen. The language is harsher, the violence is deadlier, the style is sharper and the sex is steamier (literally).Everything from the TV show has been amped up. Its sense of style has shifted from 80s chic to a new post-millennial cool. As far as action goes, not much happens as this movie, for the most part, is more of a mood piece. The film invests in the characters until the last half hour where everything comes crashing down in one of the most thrilling shootouts in recent cinema.To be fair, ""Miami Vice"" starts out with little exposition and requires a lot of attention be paid to it. It doesn't insult audiences and it isn't a standard dumbed-down cops-and-robbers. All killer, no filler. Plus, the characters' undercover work causes them to remain a cipher to those around them except a trusted few. In other words, it's up to you to decide when they put their guard down and when they have their masks on.The supporting cast is great, but one wishes more time was spent with the Vice Squad and their lieutenant. The dialogue is minimal and terse, but far more information is conveyed nonverbally, with a look, a glance, or a gesture. Each performance is nuanced in a precise cool. And the music is a great accompaniment to the visuals.Speaking of the visuals, the HD video cameras used on ""Miami Vice"" allow it a sense of realism and depth that film cannot achieve. You feel like you are there, watching what is going on. The low-light scenes in this movie are breathtaking, be it on the sea, on the highway, or in the club.All in all, ""Miami Vice"" may be so in name only, but it is a brave, hip piece that honors and transcends what came before it. It holds its own, and exists completely separate from the series, as all adaptations should. Otherwise, what's the point? Some may not be ready for an adult, smart, dark film. But for those that are, they are in for a treat.",Miami Vice
283,Rooster9,The Ultimate Existentialist Action Film?,7,12 November 2006,"""Miami Vice"" is a dark, raw, shoot-em-up flick that serves as a love letter to and a scathing commentary on the world of crime dramas -- a world Michael Mann helped define in the original ""Vice"" TV series.Yes, the film is so steeped in jargon and verite-style film-making that the plot is hard to follow, but that's sort of the point. These vice cops are treading territory that's so familiar to the average film-goer (how many crime dramas have you seen in your lifetime?) that director Michael Mann refuses to waste time with familiar setups. And that's the film's greatest asset and its biggest flaw. There's no pandering. We're thrown right into the mix -- a confusing whirlwind of bullets, intrigue and neon lights. But that also means there's no background, no explanations and no stopping for breath. We hear whispered and hurried conversations about drug smuggling and sting operations. Someone's cover's been blown. Drop the ammo. Crockett's going deep. Run the load after dark. It's all so quick and mind-boggling, we're fascinated... even if we don't know exactly what's happening. But when you start to care for these characters (as I did during an amazingly touching sequence in which Crockett seduces the crime boss' moll, played by Gong Li), you also wish you knew more about them. Once you start feeling for Crockett, you realize that you have no idea what his character has invested in the story. And, truth be told, the film's been so intriguing up until that point that you didn't care (or understand) what the story was about anyway. And just when the film seems to make sense, it picks up Crocket and whisks him away. The story gets darker and thicker, like quicksand, and eventually swallows Crockett and Tubbs whole. And then they're lost. But maybe that's the point. Crockett, in the end, is a type, not a character. He is THE cop -- the one who lives for his job, goes undercover and loses his identity, then returns home to nothing... except his job. He's that American icon, the shoot-em-up cop. He has a duty but no identity. And when the film is over, Michael Mann has pulled off an intriguing magic trick. He's taken the cold, unknowable Crockett and convinced us that he's NOT the flat and undeveloped action hero we thought we were watching. He's empty and pitiable. He's the sad result of years and years of recycled and rerun action characters bleeding themselves dry on the big and small screen. He's no longer just a caricature. He's a tragic caricature. And unlike Gong Li's character, who seized the opportunity to save herself, Crockett turned it away. Why? Well, that's what he does. It was in the script. It's always been in the script.Could Michael Mann have made the ultimate existentialist action film?If such a genre exists, there's no wonder ""Miami Vice"" would be deemed too convoluted to win over casual viewers and too muddled to be truly successful. But, you have to admit, it's still an intriguing and exciting ride.",Miami Vice
284,robertblanton,How does the creator of Miami Vice make a movie worse than the TV show?,1,11 August 2006,"The best review of this movie I've heard came from an African-American lady sitting behind my seat in the theater. When Jamie Fox did his little shower scene, the lady whispered to her friend, ""Um, um, um! This is what I want to see! Oh, Yeah, oh, yeah! Um, um, um!"" As the final credits rolled, I again heard her speak to her friend. ""Who do I see to get my money back?"" That, my friends, about sums this movie up. This is all you need to know. If you have a hankerin' to spend $8-$10 dollars so you can find a quiet place to take a two hour nap, then this movie is for you.At the beginning of this movie there is action. At the end of the movie there is action. In between, for well over an hour, there is . . . there is . . . NOTHING! Here is what you're in store for if you waste your time on this movie: Sonny falls in love with a drug lordess who, presumably, is personally responsible for millions of coke and crack addicts around the globe, but, ahhh, why quibble about the little things? He tells her about his childhood. The drug lordess falls in love with Sonny, who, presumably, puts people like her in prison for 40 years. She tells him about her childhood.This, I guess, is supposed to create the tension and suspense of the film for well over 90 minutes. What it does is give the audience the opportunity to make three restroom calls and two concession stand visits without having to fear they will miss something important in the story.What else is wrong with this movie? I know this sounds incredible, but I'm not sure this script contained any speaking parts. When these people speak, it sounds as though they're making up the dialog; or, as the Hollywood folk like to say, ""improvising."" It sounds as though the direction was to ""say whatever comes into your head. It'll be OK. The idiots will still buy tickets. However, when you say the ""F"" word, be sure that you say it loudly,clearly and that you enunciate it with love."" Another reason for believing there was no written dialog is because half of the dialog is unintelligible. You cannot understand what these people are saying (but, of course, you don't need to). At first I thought that maybe I was the only one having this difficulty, but then I read Scott Holloran's review on Mojo and saw that he had a similar complaint. Not only was I relieved to find my opinion was vindicated, but my mind was also put at ease with the soothing knowledge that I was not losing my hearing.Finally, the drawing card of the the TV Miami Vice was the natural beauty of that Florida area along with the man-made glitzy beauty. People got bored with that quickly, and the show was gone (I think) after the 3rd season. There is a smattering of those attributes in this movie but not enough. Most of it was filmed in slums, dark cellars, deserted junkyards, etc. Who wants to see that? So how did Michael Mann, the creator of the TV show, manage to make a movie worse than his original creation? Ya got me, but somehow he managed to pull it off extremely well.If you really want to spend your money on a crime TV show, then do yourself a favor and invest in ""The Rockford Files."" The writing is a whole heck of a lot better and more interesting than anything in this disaster.",Miami Vice
285,discoelephant64,Michael Mann achieved something great.,9,29 July 2006,"With the slew of awful studio release movies so far, there seemed to be no hope remaining for summer movies. Superman Returns was good, but something was wrong that I just can't pinpoint, X-Men: The Last Stand doesn't deserve to be mentioned as it was a complete bastardization of anything we had seen before and Pirates of the Caribean: Dead Man's Chest was one of the worst, poorly contrived sequels we've seen since Matrix Reloaded.That all changed with Miami Vice.From the minute the movie starts, its already different. The Universal logo appears, then fades to black, and instantly, without any opening credits or even title card, we are grabbed by the collars of our shirts and pulled into this world that Mann has crafted. And crafted so well might I add.Each shot could stand alone as a work of art. The cinematography was beautiful, different, and nothing we have seen to date. The capturing of the neon lights over Miami, the unusual tinge to the sky due to the reflection of the city's lights and the thunderstorms in the distance are all incredible. And in this day and age when it seems anyone can make a movie that looks good for the sake of looking good, for Michale Mann, looking good is a way of forwarding the story.The two leads were great in my opinion. Colin Farrell did an excellent job as Sonny Crockett, and we always got the sense that there was something uneasy, some underlying issue he couldn't resolve. A man on the brink, it's his partner, and excellent Jamie Foxx, who keeps him sane.And it's that line that makes this movie fascinating. There really is no line, as both seem to be the same, dealers and cops. There is no one to be trusted, not even Gong Li, in an excellent performance, as Crockett's romantic interest.What Michael Mann achieved here was something beyond anything else I'd have expected. It was art at its finest, a movie truly crafted with care. It's too bad the majority of movie goers will not understand this. If something doesn't blow up every five seconds, it's deemed awful.This is not an action movie. This is a drama. And a damn good one at that.",Miami Vice
286,matrsowner,The best chef and the best ingredients can't quite deliver,6,23 June 2019,"I soooo wanted this to be a great film, as a fan of Michael Mann films, and his original TV series alike.The cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack is on point (pun intended), the casting is excellent, and the performances are all good. Sure, the story is a little weak, but surely that can't be the only reason for the film being so disappointing.I've watched this film many times, each time hoping for it to be the genius of Heat applied to the characters from the TV series. How it's meant to suddenly become this, I've no idea, but I feel I can't give up on it.I'd recommend this to anyone to watch to anyone who's a fan of the show or Mann's work, but this simply isn't close to Heat, Manhunter, Collateral.",Miami Vice
287,martinjp-27642,6.0 rating is misleading,10,23 August 2020,"This movie should have a 7.0 rating, minimum. 6.0 makes no sense.
It's nice to see a mature and serious (as in no nonsense) action thriller. You can clearly see this is written and directed by an older and experienced man (Mann) who wants so much more than entertain and go for easy emotions and cheap thrills. It's a cinematic experience in a very low-key way. Nothing like today's overly dramatic and self-glorifying blockbusters with scripts written directly for light entertainment and easy emotions.
Miami Vice is not ""style over substance"" as some critics have said. If you're a serious filmmaker, you don't differentiate 'style' and substance' like that. They're connected because the style IS the way to unfold the plot, and Mann certainly knows how to connect the two.If you like action movies with a lot more than just action, you notice and appreciate details, and you enjoy a script without comic reliefs and irrelevant dialogue, you should deinitely see this one. I really can't recommend this enough. I wish Hollywood still allowed movies like this one.",Miami Vice
288,chuckpw,Here's some advice for Miami Vice...... Don't bother........,2,29 July 2006,"I'm not sure what Michael Mann thought he would gain by remaking his landmark 80's TV series. That series was a game-changer in the way that a television drama was shot with contemporary music and stylish fashion. About the only thing common to this movie and the old TV series is the characters names, the fact they're in Florida and they're battling Latin American drug lords. Everything else is a distraction.There's no chemistry between the two lead characters, no background character development. There's no feeling for Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Tubbs', and the absence of his New York sensibilities make him appear as though he just gos through the motions from scene to scene. Farrell's depiction of Crockett is antiseptic at best. The comic side of Crockett is buried deep within this portrayal and besides the odd crack, there's no warming up to him. Farrell's at least 20 lbs overweight here and one gets the sense his playboy persona is a second rate version of Don Johnson's impeccable and brazen Sonny Crockett.Mann misses the opportunity to dovetail the original theme music and update it to bring the audience into a current state understanding of Crockett and Tubbs' experiences in South Florida. This movie might have had a chance had Mann picked up the story where he last left off in the TV series..... but alas, he didn't. He tried to pull the wool over the audience's eyes and went for broke, starting over again, but somehow entirely missing the mark.The epic violence was raw and in your face, which kept the audience engaged towards the end of this wasteful yarn. The female protagonist in this story could barely be understood thanks to her broken Cuban/Chinese accent. In general, the dialogue was badly written and the sound editing was atrocious.That's $11.75 that's gone forever, and I'll never get it back..... save your money, buy the DVD collection of the TV series and take it back to the 80's where it was really at and Miami Vice was a legend in the making.",Miami Vice
289,Reggie_Charan,Makes you wish for Don Johnson & Philip Michael Thomas,2,30 December 2006,"Some random thoughts I had while watching Miami Vice: 1. The casting is among the worst I've ever seen in a movie: Colin Farell and Jamie Foxx just don't seem bright enough to work vice, the guy who plays their boss, Castillo, looks like Cedric the Entertainer's cousin, and Tubbs' girlfriend is nothing more than an overacting, Rosario Dawson wanna-be.2. Gong Li's English is absolutely painful to listen to.3. No one so much as cracks a smile in this film: Looks like it was about as much fun for them to film, as it was for us to watch.Another instance of style over substance from Michael Mann.",Miami Vice
290,filipe-arte,"Moody, visually astonishing and thrilling",9,2 June 2015,"Saw this one back in 2007, the theaters here in Brazil didn't seem to make money out of it so I waited until the DVD release. And now I just came from a unrated version that sincerely blew me away even more than the first time.You have to see it as more than a simple action flick and embrace the audacity of the cinematography - the noisy shots from pre-4k- cameras are a charm for themselves.The characters are also very strong and they are nothing like the heroes that we usually see in pure commercial-action movies. They are the heroes of Mann's world: strong, relentless, intense.The storytelling does not tell you more than the wide camera shots, the moody blueish noir, the sad and deep look from the actors or the amazing sound design. It is a movie that exists deeply in the details way more than it does in the surface.A hidden masterpiece.",Miami Vice
291,horacekohanim,"Leave now, life is short, time is luck",7,20 July 2007,"This is regarding the Rated /Theatrical version As another Michael Mann and Miami Vice TV lover, my initial response to this was disgust. The fact that they didn't use the opening theme alone was too bad, but the missed opportunity to revisit the 80's and then the casting of Farrell kept me out of the theatre. But thanks to On Demand cable, and the knowledge that a Director's Cut is available too, I figured to see this, then the Cut and compare. Ultimately I am amongst the disappointed, but not for lack of certain appreciation. Mann is a master of movement, and like few directors can unify style with grace and substance. He also uses wonderfully exhilarating music. I am a sucker for this skill, and when he uses it here, I enjoyed the film. The supporting cast, Luis Tosar as Jesus Montoya and John Ortiz as Jose Yero were standouts. There is also some very impressive masculine hair (beards, goatees, burns, etc.) in this. Otherwise, it lacked in many ways. The Gong Li subplot was terrible. The lack of relationship between Farrell and Foxx angered. Then messy accents and inaudible dialogue confused. In ending, Mann's m.o. of ""Leave now, life is short, time is luck,"" gets sucked away by Farrell and Li's foolish relationship. Mann's heroes are loners and operate within certain codes. Here Crockett ignores these codes, thus the pride and thrill of Crockett and Tubbs and their vice crew's bond (what made the TV series cool and quirky-remember the van with the bug on top?) is nonexistent. I really give it 6.5 stars, but round up for Mann.",Miami Vice
292,kwhuneycutt,"Mann's ""Vice""",6,29 July 2006,"Director Michael Mann (Collateral, Heat) brings his gritty, intense, documentary-style realism to the film version of the TV classic ""Miami Vice."" The film is not meant to be an exact remake of the popular '80s television series, it is a darker more contemporary version for the new millennium.Mann's visual style is one of the best in the business and it is well displayed in this film. Like Collateral (2004), ""Miami Vice"" was filmed on location in HD with digital cameras. The shaky hand-held shots and high definition picture give the film a documentary like realism. Dion Beebe's cinematography was beautiful, artfully filling each frame yet still giving the film an amateurish documentary feel. Like Collateral (2004) Mann used natural light to light each scene and the street lights of Miami provided a subdued orange and blue glow. Collateral (2004) provided one of the most amazing and beautiful visual depictions of LA ever on film, but ""Miami Vice"" does not do the same for the city of Miami. At times the digital picture can become too grainy (especially when the theater is equipped with DLP) and the hand-held feel of the camera can get annoying. The sound engineering for the film was some of the best you'll hear, very realistic. Audioslave provided much of the film's musical score, which was really quite poor overall.""Miami Vice"" has Mann's great visual style but the rest of the film is disappointing. Colin Farrell and Jamie Fox certainly aren't your mom's Crockett and Tubbs. Both actors played their roles serious and super macho, and there was no real chemistry between them. At times it seemed both actors just spouted out their lines. Colin Farrell's attempt at a southern accent is laughable, I'd rather have him play the role with a full blown Irish accent. His hair and mustache also looked like he came right out of an episode of ""My Name is Earl."" Jamie Foxx did not have a lot of material to work with and I just don't think he is cut out for serious action films. I think Foxx is better at character work and supporting roles (think ""Ray"" and ""Collateral""). The villains in the film were not scary and were certainly no match for Farrell and Foxx. The bad guy's henchmen and other extras were more realistic and intimidating.The story unfolds in many different locations: Miami, Cuba and South America, providing many unintelligible accents. It was hard to understand many of the characters due to their accents (I would have liked subtitles for Colin Farrell). Mann's screenplay, sadly, is predictable and a bit thin. There was a lot of riding in boats, looking tough, and not a lot of quality dialog. You would think a movie with no dialog would have some action but this one does not. The action heats up only in the second hour! The film was also filled with 3 or 4 gratuitous sex scenes. The love story between Farrell and Li Gong was boring and brought the flow of the film to a halt. Does the film have any cool cars at least? Yes: Ferraris, Bentleys, BMWs, Cadillac Escalades and an '06 Dodge Charger SRT-8. The film does have a few homages to the show including the classic scene of Crocket and Tubbs in profile, cruising down the freeway in a Ferrari convertible.Michael Mann's film version of ""Miami Vice"" is certainly no campy remake like we see so much of today. The film has some of Mann's great style but I expected much more. If you are expecting pastel suits, '80s rock and lots of car chases beware: Mann's ""Vice"" is a dark, sluggish, gritty crime drama.",Miami Vice
293,jimwww,Don't see it - not even on video,2,4 September 2006,Wow.. almost no beginning and no ending - little bit of a climax but geez is this ever bad. Same drug story from any episode you have ever seen in a drug - undercover - cop story. I mean nobody wrote this right.. they just took it from an old episode right? THe focus puller should have been shot along with the writer. Both cannot do their jobs. It has been a long time that I have seen a movie with 9/10 frames out of focus. Wow. Flashy boats and cars.. One sex scene and now Sonny is in love with an Asian women. Ya sure. What was the point of this film.. NOTHING was innovative or refreshing about it - not one line of humour either.

294,jwoehr,Not the show but still really good,6,28 July 2006,"I went to threads for the movie where a lot of people had it planned to hate it before it even came out. So the one star reviews I see here don't really surprise me. They knocked the casting from the start and I admit I also had a problem with Colin Farrell and Jamie Fox being casted. They look nothing like the original actors or even try to sound like them here. Still I can't say they are bad. Farrell gives a kickass performance eiteher way even if he doesn't have Don Johnson's charm. I can't say that Farrell and Fox even have Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas chemistry. While their relationship with Lt. Martin Castillo here is disappointing as well. They barely even like the guy and curse at him every time they see him. Farrell however has really good chemistry with Li Gong. His relationship with her is at least faithful to show. I mean Johnson's Crockett was always falling for girls when he was undercover. Plus they also have a sexy and cool scene on a speed boat that's faithful to the tone of the show. The shootouts are also faithful to the show even if they are a bit more violent. The show had it's romantic steamy sex scenes and so does this movie. Fox and Farrell both have shower scenes where they share the shower with a woman. The look of the film is also faithful since Mann who produced the show directs here and since most of his films are little Miami Vicesish. I was hoping to at least hear the original theme music once or twice but that never happens. I forgive it for that though since I am a Michael Mann fan and was a Michael Mann fan longer than I was a Miami Vice fan. I just got into the show recently with the dvds. While Heat was one of my favorite movies for awhile. If you liked Heat and Collateral then you should also like this movie. Die hard Vice fans probably won't be as crazy about it. Crockett and Tubbs are hardly even buddy buddy in the film, they are partners and that's about it. I wouldn't mind sequels so everyone could develop a little more. How about Elizabeth Rodriguez getting more screen time as Gina. I wouldn't mind seeing her develop a relationship with Crockett like she had in the show ""although I think they only slept together once in the first episode lol"". Here they hardly even talk unless they are working together to bust or kill some bad guys. The movie is just all undercover stuff mostly and you hardly get to know them as people when they aren't undercover. This isn't a bad movie but I don't think it works if they only have one movie and that's it. It leaves you thinking of it as a pilot episode that has you waiting for more episodes....",Miami Vice
295,nkw88,"No Miami but Caribbean Sea in ""Miami Vice""",7,18 August 2006,"After I saw this film, I thought the title ""Cops of Caribbean"" was more appropriate rather than ""Miami Vice."" Crockett and Tubbs do undercover work for FBI, which allowed them to fly over the Caribbean Sea between Florida and Colombia. This makes the movie look like ""James Bond Film"" in which James Bond flies with jet flights, helicopters, and run through a sports car and a jet boat. Though the cinematography was great in this film, it showed the beauty of Caribbean sea rather than Miami. Gong Li does not show her charisma which she showed in Zhang Yimou films but is overwhelmed by Collin Farrel who showed great testosterone- driven character. Instead, the most impressive actor in this film is Elizabeth Rodriguez.",Miami Vice

So liking ""Miami Vice"" isn't a big deal.Second, I am a fan of the director. Yet since ""Collateral"" I think Mann has been stuck in a rut. He has just been trying to remake ""Heat"" for a while now. Here is the evidence: The T.V. Show Robbery Homicide Division (which was probably the best of the offenders) to Miami Vice (which is probably the worst) Yet Mann is one of the best American director's working today so ""Miami Vice"" kind of worked. (spoilers) Here is what I liked: Dialog. The ""copspeak"" refreshingly made the film realistic and also avoided the ""let's explain the plot to the idiots not paying attention"" banter that normally pops up in these kind of films. An example. The film does use the element of a ""mole"" so common to these pictures. Yet the dialog never mentions that plot point in a clichéd manner. Impressive.Most of The HD Stuff: Dion Beebe is a great DP. This Aussie came to notice with a small film called ""What I Have Written"". This obscure film demonstrated how much Beebe could push the texture of different film stocks and video. Now Beebe uses Viper Cam HD. And some shots in ""Vice"" show how much Beebe has accomplished. Some shots are just truly extraordinary. This film is also miles apart from the gorgeous ""Gasha"" movie as well. Mann picked a great collaborator.And finally, I liked the mechanics of the story. Drug cartel stories have been done to death. Vice managed to provide a fresh spin on the clichéd material.Things I didn't like. Some huge gaping plot holes that might be filled in upon a second viewing of the film.Too many sex scenes which tried to fully develop the characters but failed miserably. Plus theses scenes were rehashes of ""Heat"" and even the T.V. show ""Robbery Homicide Division"" (good canceled show, hope someone releases it on DVD sometime) Some bad decisions not to use ADR. I know Mann hates using ADR and loves to use location sound. But I couldn't understand some key conversations.And finally, ""Vice"" felt like two movies in one. This has been a problem Mann has had since ""The Insider"". To it's credit, ""The Insider"" had a very good transition to the other style of the storytelling. ""Vice"" joins the ranks of ""Ali"" and ""Collateral"": Films that have two parts that don't connect in a fluid fashion.The single most annoying thing about ""Vice"" was that this movie was made because of marketing. ""Miami Vice"" was just a brand to throw on the movie so the Hollywood suits could guarantee some kind of box office (Mann movies never do well at domestic box office. Often time it takes home video to make them successful) It had no tangible relation to the t.v. series and would have been much better if Mann could have made the drug cartel movie he wanted to make without having to brand it with ""Miami Vice"" baggage.Also, the movie didn't look like a $130 million dollar picture. Maybe $70 million tops. Where did the money go???? Hell, I think the modestly budgeted ""Lord of War"" movie kicked this films butt as far as showing production value. end kdc",Miami Vice
298,jb1211-1,Miami Vice is a disappointment,3,10 February 2007,"Miami Vice is a remake from the 1980's show ""Miami Vice."" This movie is about two cops named James Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs (Played by Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx) who are undercover to bust a group of drug smuggling murderers.I expected this movie to be action packed and very exciting but it was not. There were only a few minor action sequences and it was a very hard movie to follow. I did not enjoy this movie very much and would not recommend paying to rent this movie. Try to find it at the library where you can rent it for free. I'm glad I didn't see this movie in the theater. This movie is also not for kids at all! The few action sequences in this movie are very violent and gory.",Miami Vice
299,grantcook,Wha?,2,10 December 2006,"To tell you the truth, I got Miami Vice as a free rental and my video store, and I still feel ripped off.Let me first state I have a very fine screening room in my home as I run a production company out of it.I could barely understand a word anybody said in this movie, It seemed that if they didn't have a hugely annoying and hard to understand accent they mumbled their lines like they were talking with food in their mouths, I eventually turned on the subtitles! This is with a 7.1 DTS surround sound theater! Not only could I not understand them talking, what they were saying seemed like gibberish. Unless you had inside knowledge of police procedures you wouldn't know what the Jimmy cricket they were on about.This was the main reason I disliked this movie enough to give it a 2, I was really quite disappointed in Michael Mann, as I have enjoyed his films up until this. I can hardly believe that there was $100 million on the screen. What a waste of money and talent.",Miami Vice
300,gregv2k,"Perfect Mann film, perfect TV adaptation",9,29 July 2006,"It works on every level. As an homage to an outdated source material; as a simple police procedural; as a violent meditation on justice and retribution; and most simply as a Michael Mann masterpiece.I am a lifelong fan of Miami Vice and enjoy the shows to this day. I know about everything there is to know about the show, in front of and behind the cameras. I am not catching up with it now; I was glued to the set for the 1984 pilot ""Brother's Keeper"" and I've been glued to every episode since. Live, repeat, syndication, DVD-- and now, at long last, on the big screen where it belongs.There's so many homages to the TV show it's hard to know where to start. But folks, if you're not a fan, you will miss it. If you're a casual viewer catching up in syndication, you will miss most of the references to the show. They're sly and subtle in some cases, obvious in others, but the point is that anyone who says ""this movie bears no resemblance to the series"" is flat- out incorrect. Period.What Anthony Yerkovich and Michael Mann have delivered is essentially an episode of the series, with precisely the structure of an episode of the series. Had Miami Vice run on HBO and had they the budget. this is exactly what it would have looked like. Sounded like. Felt like.Free of the limitations of network censors and the appalling drive of network heads to dumb TV series to the lowest common denominator, Michael Mann presents a moment in the lives of two vice cops that is not sugar coated for the kids and is not so pedantic that high-school dropouts can follow the bread crumbs. You either get it or you don't. The effect is that as a viewer you feel as though you're being thrown into a world (voyeuristic in nature) that you would not otherwise experience. It's what the best movies all do- regardless of genre: it takes you someplace for two hours and does not let go until the final frame rolls and when the lights come up you feel as though you've been somewhere else for two hours.It's got everything the show did: the Ferrari, the style, the lingo, the snitches, the kingpins, the riveting violence and the driving beat of a contemporary soundtrack that enhances the visuals and mood rather than just lay on the soundtrack like so much background noise.It also moves as fast as the Ferrari does. You get swept immediately into an assignment and then the film proceeds to hurl forward from one scenario to the next in an ever-escalating web of lies, posturing and pre-emptive guesswork by the cops who work their way into the next dangerous level of an international drug organization.Here's the facts: it's ultra-violent, it's fast-paced, it's demanding of attention to follow the chess moves on either side, it's got supercharged sex scenes and it's got that singleness-of- purpose that eliminates the need for childish distractions like ticking alligators and supporting-character hijinks.(It's also got an informant who while not as funny as Noogie or Izzy is clearly cut from the same cloth.)Look, watch ""Smuggler's Blues"" if you need to, but trust me, this is as true to Miami Vice and its legacy as it could possibly be. I cannot wait to see it again, and moreover, I'll be first in line for the sequel.Stunning.",Miami Vice
301,Bored78,Terrible,1,4 June 2016,"I agree with many of the other reviews that gave this movie a low rating.It was a rare occasion where the wife and i said enough an hour in and just turned it off. We do that for less than 1 out of every 100 movies.The characters are uninteresting. Nothing in this movie makes you care about them or feel like you know them or even if you care if they succeed. To be honest, The main characters could of been killed off in the first 30 minutes and i wouldn't of even noticed.I tried following the ploy, but it skips around constantly. Somewhere a long the way it got butchered to the point of being a non functional plot. To demonstrate how the plot is: Rip every 3rd page out of a book, then read the book and you have the plot of this movie.The plot is boring. Its been done literally 1000 times. And 999 of those have been better than this rendition. The main characters have sex with pretty much unknown characters. Since you don't care about the main characters nor the support characters, the sex scenes are even more worthless. We actually treated the sex scenes like commercials, they were that bad. Actually commercials would of been more entertaining.The audio is terrible. The characters mumble a lot and its dark a lot in the movie so you cant even read lips or facial expressions that well. My wife is British, and worked as HR for 4 years in tampa and she was struggling hard to understand the dialogue. She is use to dealing with a lot of different accents, so what does that tell you? Its like The entire film crew were college freshman. I imagine the uncut version was much better, and then it got butchered. This movie isn't even worth watching for free, i definitely wouldn't pay for it.",Miami Vice
302,hyperbart,just not good!,4,18 January 2007,"this movie may contain some good ingredients, but it lacks a proper recipe. many of it has been pointed out by previous comments. but here is a break down:no character chemistry: farrell and foxx don't mix. both are good actors, just not good together. - bad script writing gives us a plot that is confusing, doesn't allow character development, feels fast but is just so boring it makes you gawp. movie is too long too. - Li Gong is not a good cast in my opinion. she acts good, but is just not the type for this ""woman who made it in the men's world""-rolelast, the action really disappointed me. many comments that i've read before said that the action made up for the flaws of this movie. but it really doesn't! the only cool action piece is when the bad guy with the trigger get's properly shot through the head. the final shoot-out is very very VERY BAD! it is very very confusing with camera switching back and forth... and because we only see people from their backs, we cannot distinguish any. in crazy war movies i can easily make out complex shout-out situations, but here it just makes me crazy. also the bald guy who's gonna check the money hides behind the truck, shoots 2 bad guys and is then suddenly taken out of the whole scene. and why don't the snipers provide more firepower after they've taken out the other shooters? it's just bad. in 'Heat' we saw a great chase through an entire busy city street, with the group splitting up and everything. and in that scene everything is clear, all makes sense and you simply understand what you see. why couldn't Mann make something like that, where did he blew it?all in all, just not good!",Miami Vice
303,rb-66,Not Heat but not bad,7,1 April 2012,"I think we have to accept that Heat was a once in a lifetime film for Michael Mann. The stars aligned for him and he nailed it to produce one the great crime films. The rest of his work, while still decent action films, are not in that class.For a start, Jamie Foxx and Colin Farell are definitely not Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. The plot is too far fetched, the cops are too good and too clean. I suppose The romance between Farrell and Gong Li is no less realistic than DeNiro's in Heat, but in Heat they pulled it off somehow.Everything in Miami Vice is too black and white, it has none of the shades of grey that made Heat so great. In Heat the cops and robbers were as damaging and dysfunctional as each other, they needed each other. In Miami Vice the cops are unmistakably the goodies, despite having occasional sex with the baddies.For all its limitations though its still better than most of the big budget crap these days. But if you're loved Heat's darkness, I'd suggest Ron Shelton's Dark Blue or Antoine Fuqua's Brooklyn's Finest.",Miami Vice
304,Andy4444,Vice Reborn,8,29 July 2006,"Miami Vice, was, for those of us in our teens or twenties at the time, THE TV show to watch. It took the style of the eighties, developed it, and amplified it. Music, clothes, palm trees, sports cars, drug lords, and automatic weapons. Coming on the heels of shows with lots of gun play but no blood due to censoring, such as the A-Team, the violence was shocking and refreshing for its time, and the main characters, Crockett and Tubbs, were a new breed of cool, gritty, antiheroes. So how does the movie stack up? Pretty good, I must say.Crockett (Farrel) and Tubbs (Fox) are drawn into an FBI undercover operation to take down a Latin-American drug lord, and try to isolate a leak in the Bureau. Nothing new, there, of course, but the sex and violence in a feature film is now free to move up several notches from 1980's television. Let's do the list:Pros: -Main actors do a fine job of reinventing the characters without changing their basic nature. Fox, especially, is great as Tubbs, and the drug kingpin is immensely creepy and dangerous. -Film is set in 2006 Miami with 2006 styles, instead of turning into an eighties nostalgia fest. And yet the spirit of the old Vice remains. -Music is reminiscent of the original, but is in fact all modern and used tastefully. The sound track is on my gotta-have-it short list. -Action scenes are intense and use camera-shaking and other film techniques that did not exist in the eighties. Boats and planes are beautiful and fast, and the gunfighting scenes just rock.Cons: -Some of the love..er..sex scenes just go on too long. Okay, these people look good naked, okay, it's a Mike Mann style thing, I get it. Please move on with the story... -The plot is a little hard to follow at times, and a few questions are left unanswered at the end, or did I miss it? -Sometimes the dialog is hard to follow; see above point. -Jan Hammer's recordings are not used, although remakes of some of his music are in the film. This film is not a realistic portrayal of life in the Miami PD (giant explosions, company-size gunfights, a cop driving a Ferrari and wearing a $90k watch, etc.), but of course Miami Vice never was. It is a stylistic interpretation of the glamorous and sleazy drug world and the cops who deal with it. The film captures this well, and places it in modern day.It's also a refreshing break from the standard modern fare, in which all bad guys are nebulous terrorists and it's okay for good guys to torture suspects who may be innocent. It's a throwback to the days when sleazy drug lords were all bad guys and the good guys squared off with them in a gunfight. While dressed to impress, of course!",Miami Vice

306,imdb-510,My new worst Michael Mann movie,1,6 July 2008,"I own and love Heat but...The Insider put me to sleep, The Last Of The Mohicans was a center-less attempt at an epic and Collateral set a new record for lack of realism.Then came Miami Vice. Someone actually recommended this movie to me -- you can't make stuff like that up.Details: (1) worst dialog ever because of (2) most clichéd/nothing story ever, (3) filmed in the worst way ever (i.e. zero imagination, and best described as amateurish). Apparently Michael Mann likes predictable (read ""idiotic"") shots -- see his bio page for mind-numbingly stupid scenes he likes to regularly include in his movies.While I was watching this non-action movie I figured out what the real story was: ""Director has prime property in Florida that he would rather not pay for. He films an ultra lame movie that uses said property and brings in millions to pay his taxes and interest."" Then I read Mann's bio page and it actually mentioned he owns property in Florida.So I hereby nominate Michael Mann as _the_ worst director in Hollywood, and Miami Vice the crown of AOL cds he deserves to wear.If you want action, go to a theater and see Wanted. If you understand dialog spoken in English (or French or German or Italian or pretty much any language on Earth that this movie might be translated into), avoid this film or your brain will melt. But if you like static shots filmed by 16 year olds on too many meds, this could be your ticket to paradise -- enjoy! 0.001 stars (out of 4).",Miami Vice

The movie and the story is way to slow with barely any action involved and this is under the action section? The acting IMO wasn't that good at all and i like Colin Farrell. Pretty much the main stuff that makes this a bad movie is that it's too slow and the story is as well and doesn't make sense at all. It's it jumped from another area to the area with no detail explanation on the drugs other than the ending which is probably my favorite part but still that is not enough.

Stylish, original and well acted.Unfortantely Mann tried to apply the same technique he used to make Collateral with Miami Vice.WRONG! All wrong.A Miami Vice movie shouldn't feature terribly dark wardrobes for the characters.Collin Farrel's character looked LIKE A DORK with that stupid biker/white trash mustache and long hair. He looked EXTREMELY out of place.Jamie Foxx, well you know what, I was going to type up more for this movie but I'm going cut it short.Miami Vice sucks. Bad.

It's nothing like the MV series, but that's okay. The 2006 incarnation is tough and hard. The action sequences are impressively mounted (of course), the dialog is clever and sharp and the acting is perfect. I'm not a big Farrell/Foxx fan, but they are superb in this flick.Michael Mann has returned to form after the disappointing Collateral. MV, as he stated, is an expose of life undercover. Sure, it's fast and flashy, but the job takes away everything that resembles a normal life for the characters.The villains on the other hand, are no dime store hoods looking to get rich quick. They're businessmen who will not let anybody threaten their trade.The film is completed by a subtle, yet effective soundtrack, composed by some of the industry's finest.In short, Miami Vice is 2006's best action/thriller/drama and also one of the best movies of 2006.

By the end of the film, I was confused, bored and aggravated. This movie promised action, I didn't see any. Instead, what I saw, was Colin Farell naked for 1/3 of the film with Lu Gong. This is easily the worst film produced by Micheal Mann. I was looking for a movie like Collateral. Fast paced, good action and smart writing. Instead, I repeatedly saw sex, drugs, and more sex. Jamie Foxx comes out flat and Colin Farell comes out even flatter. The actresses in this film don't do much of a better job. The movie was overall confusing, boring and dull. I was constantly checking my watch and any film that makes you do that is not a good film. Avoid this movie at all costs. I'm still waiting for Mann to refund my money.",Miami Vice
311,gav_mcf,Miami Vice emerges as a very good grown-up thriller despite it's flaws.,7,26 September 2008,"I'm a huge fan of Michael Mann, Collateral and Heat are brilliant and this unfortunately doesn't live up to those two. Having said that it's a tense and scarily realistic film. I mean, there's no way cop life is like how it's portrayed in films like Bad Boys and the Rush Hour series.Foxx and Farrell are solid as the focused partners, although it would have better to see more interaction between the two, they barely say two words to each other the whole film. The acting overall is very good, with Gong Li and Naomie Harris being the stand-outs.There's no doubt the main feature of Mann's movies is his visual style. The night time atmosphere of Collateral is brilliant and he makes no exception here, providing plenty of great cityscapes and night shots. The soundtrack is also brilliant and bonds with the movie well, the highlight being the excellent ""Auto Rock"" by Mogwai thumping in the emotional finale.I think the storyline is a weak point in Miami Vice and could have been stronger. I didn't have too much of an idea of what was going on half the time, but this again is part of the realistic cop scenario and avoids having an elaborate plot. I like the opening sequence when you're thrown straight into a heavy-hitting club scene, not sure whats happening and given no clues.I admit Mann's thriller will not be for everyone and like most of his films, it may take multiple viewings to take everything in. It is clear though if you are looking for a non-stop action movie definitely avoid this. However, if you want a grown-up, intelligent, realistic thriller I would be happy to recommend it.",Miami Vice

After hearing mixed reviews from the average movie-goer and the critics I became skeptical about going to see this so I didn't bother going to the theater to see this. After 4 months after the release word was Mann had created a "" Director's Revision Cut"" of the film 2 months after the Theatrical Release. When i heard about this i decided to buy it. Worth every penny. I enjoyed it greatly. I loved the cinematography which some hated, the soundtrack was excellent, its plot was great primarily based on ""Smugglers Blues"" from the original series first season. The acting was first rate. But i can understand why people hated this film. The trailer is misleading to a Michael Bay Bad Boys piece of crap that does great in the box office. Miami Vice is an acquirred taste. The viewer needs to be paying attention to everything, have a concept of vision and have a good taste in movies.For those wishing to watch take my word its great film, highly under rated and deserves more.

The remake of ""In the Air Tonight"" was cheesy but at least they saved that for the end credits.John Ortiz's character was great, he really brought life to that role. A great contrast to Li Gong's lifeless portrayal of the ""business woman"" and Colin Farrell's wet dishrag full of rage impression. Actually Jamie Foxx wasn't bad, he just didn't add much. At least he didn't go over the top like I was sure he would.The rest of the movie was dull and uninteresting. I was surprised that there was a plot but it still wasn't a very captivating one. If you are looking for an action movie, skip this one, the action scenes are few and far apart. I'd call this soft core porn faster than I'd call it action (the sex scenes were poorly done and added little to the story At least it wasn't a rehash of the 80's show. It could have been worse.

314,MPR6197030,It is possible for a movie to fail so completely?,2,30 July 2006,"Michael Mann has had a solid track record in the action genre. Both ""Heat"" and ""Collateral"" are solid works that evoke the very elements of big city crime and law enforcement. This, coupled with the fact that Mann worked on the original source material for the ""Miami Vice"" film and that he chose not to placate fans of the original series by paying homage to passé fashion and duologue, meant that the movie at least had some potential.Instead, ""Miami Vice"" somehow turned into a disaster on all fronts. The original plot established in the very first frames  that a mole has infiltrated a government agency and is wrecking havoc with undercover agents  is discarded half way through the movie with no resolution. Characters appear and disappear at will while most of the delivered duologue is incomprehensible. And both editor and director should be ashamed for letting ""Miami Vice"" pass the two hour mark. There was so much fat that should have been left on the editing room floor (completely unnecessary shots, most with hand-held cameras; five sex scenes, all nearly in a row) that the film could have survived intact  would probably have emerged better  at 90 minutes.Though the big screen effectively portrays Mann's stunning cinematography choices, very little else is gained at a ""Miami Vice"" screening.",Miami Vice
315,Bulldog7,"So bad, trading on star names",1,13 August 2006,"Going into this film I thought it would be a bit of mindless fun with explosions and guns. I was wrong. It was mindless but not in a good way. The camera work was shaky, obviously trying for a gritty, we-are-there feeling but it doesn't work, you just miss bits and feel nauseous. Continuity is another problem but that is minor compared to the awful acting from all involved. Honestly, what self-respecting film would include the lines 'If you can't do the time, don't get involved with the crime' and 'If they didn't do time with us, they don't do crime with us'? Colin Farrell was so bad it was scary. I do rate the man as an actor but he was more wooden than a 5 year old in a school play. Jamie Foxx wasn't much better. The nude/sex scenes were tacked on, surely for the cheap thrills although they didn't deliver any of those.One final point. How can a major Hollywood production, in 2006, produce such a big gun battle that was still boring? This kind of shoot-out was the reason I went to see the film and it was so bad I was rooting for the bad guys. The so-called gritty reality was obviously meant to show how the good guys were prepared to cross boundaries but there are boy scouts that have committed more crimes than these two.The next time anyone wants to make a gritty, hard-hitting film that shows there are no good guys watch Sin City and realise they have done it far better than anyone else could.",Miami Vice

MV got it right. Mann hired good advisers and it shows throughout the movie. The gunfight at the end came really close having the sound of the real thing and I speak from firsthand knowledge. Again, great audio work. Even the little bit of radio traffic from Tubbs while flying the A500 was on the money as well as the dialog between the ATC staff manning approach control looking at what supposed to be two skin paints. The cop loading the .50 caliber rounds into the Barrett's magazine was right on. The rounds may have been live as I think I saw real primers, not knocked out or drilled out like in so many other action films. This kind of realism allows the moviegoer to submerge himself into the story.On the non-tech side of things. Generally, during any romance segments during an action flick has been a good time for me to hit the head or buy more food in the lobby. Not this time. The chemistry seemed real. Li Gong, an ordinary looking Chinese chick was great in her part and came off hot enough to get me going.My only complaint is the use of the blue effect. I thought films were getting away from this. Yeah, it's OK in night scenes, but who pays money to see a blue and white film? We want all the colors if it's supposed to be in color.I was prepared to not like this movie after reading some of the reviews.

317,grimrogue,"As a stand alone crime drama, it works quite well...",7,30 July 2006,"This is a tight little crime drama. I almost felt like I was watching a reality television show about undercover cops in action. Forget the old TV series Miami Vice, for this is a pure 2006 update with gritty realism and a much darker style. There are no opening credits whatsoever, which helps to provide the feeling that these aren't actors up on the screen and that there are no ""stars"". These are criminals and law enforcers doing battle.I've read many complaints about the confusing story and lack of character development, but I think these critics missed the point of what they were watching. First of all, it's Crockett and Tubbs, and the movie is called Miami Vice. Even though the updated version of their characters does not resemble them from the 80's, we are all supposed to at least know a little bit about who they are already. It didn't really matter to me anyway who these guys were in their normal lives, as they are undercover pretty much the entire time, and the use of flashbacks or ""witty banter"" between the two of them to provide more depth would have been cheesy and distracting.This movie is like a fast paced slice-of-life drama, as we follow these two bad asses on their next assignment to bring down a big-time drug trafficker. As I've never organized multi-million dollar drug deals before and have never worked as a seasoned vice detective, I did feel lost at times trying to decipher the dialog and reasoning behind the character's actions. This was part of the charm however, as I just sat back to be taken along for the ride.Don't compare this to the TV series and don't expect a whole lot of action either. Miami Vice, the movie, is an entertaining crime drama that is well acted, intense, and worth sitting through the 2 ½ hour running time.

The realism is stunning, the bitter-sweet taste left after watching it is genuine and, above all, the entire time you have a feeling of uneasiness, as would the characters feel along the story... That's genius, if you asked me.Maybe a downside could be the casting of Rome's Ciaran Hinds as a unimpressive cop...I left at the end the perfect touch of the film...

319,THEPIPEMAN64,Bring On the Vice!!!!,10,26 July 2006,"Being a huge fan of the show my expectations were very high, so I was very worried about if this would be another bad TV to movie adaptation. Well my friends this took my breath away. The film is very raw and pulls no punches. It give you a hardcore look at the underground drug world. The acting is great, and the action is phenomenal. Foxx and Farrell pull off a great Crockett and Tubbs. If you are a fan of the show you will also see the characters: Gina,Trudy,Switeck,Zito,and Castillo. This is by far the best movie of the year,if you never see this film, then you have missed out on a great piece in cinema. This is Mann's best work since Heat. This is a Best Picture Nominee, and if they don't think so were they are just a bunch of overpaid political saps. I went with a friend that had never seen the show and he found it amazing. The story has a lot of detail so pay attention, and the love story might seem a bit long, but trust me it's worth it. So people buckle up for the wildest ride of the yea! VICE is back BABY!",Miami Vice
320,cheryl-142-917207,"Good movie but not ""Miami Vice.""",4,27 January 2013,"While I think Colin Farrel and Jamie Foxx are incredible, talented actors, they were wasted in this film. Miami Vice the TV series bears little resemblance to Miami Vice the movie. This movie should have had a different title with different character names as it related so poorly to the original. In fact, it surprised me to see Michael Mann's name associated with the film.I'm a Floridian and I found little of Florida in the movie. Was it filmed in San Diego? Some of the beach scenes looked more like California than Florida. The TV series was slick, cutting edge, and very strong on setting in its day. The movie failed to capture the spirit and feel of the series and, in my opinion, shouldn't have tried. The movie is a fine crime drama, just not the Crockett and Tubbs we fell in love with in the '80s. Perhaps it should be re-released with a new title.",Miami Vice
321,Temprock14,"Bad in the Absolute, Worse When Compared To",6,27 August 2006,"The groundbreaking TV show from 1984. A local reviewer called it an atmospheric muddle. I would half agree: muddle yes, atmospheric maybe.As someone who worshiped the TV show, and who has visited Miami for the better part of the last 30 years (mother, aunts, cousins, friends all resided there), it was hard for me to tell it was even filmed (in very small part) in the South Florida area. The TV show was as much Miami (clearly) as Rocky One was Philly(obviously). This should have been titled ""Uruguayan (or Paraguyan or Soundstage) Vice"".To me the dialogue and lingo were also muddled, muddied and too often overridden by a very mediocre soundtrack. I'm sorry to say I could not even understand the final lines exchanged between ""Sonny"" Crockett and the Chinese lady (whose character and performance I felt were superior to the others in the cast) The plot was absurd (hope that does not constitute a Spoiler). I love the Michael Mann grainy film stock/dark/light approach but I cannot believe how much this movie could not even stand up to an almost 20 years' past TV show.Somewhere Don Johnson (and even Phil Collins) is laughing. (BTW over the final credits a new age version of ""Something in the Air"" was played--I did love the irony of that for all of you old TV-Vice fans).",Miami Vice
322,nbubacz,Wheres the Alligator? Wheres Jan Hammer?,5,3 August 2006,"I saw this last night. I liked it as a stylistic action/cop movie. But it is a stylistic action/cop movie I will forget about. Thats not what I wanted out of a 2006 redux of the groundbreaking 1980s series. I loved Crockett and Tubbs and their standalone or ongoing undercover operations to catch drug dealers/smugglers or Calderon.This movie jumps us right into a scene with these guys undercover on some prostitution job, gives us no intro who we have here or what they are doing,then they get a call and switch jobs immediately into the main story about FBI leaks on a huge drug ring involving Aryans,Colombians and whatnot. It then goes full speed from there with no more explanation except Sonny and Rico are partners, they have a few teammates, and they have a boss.This is all OK with me ,I guess, I don't need to be babied into a gritty undercover story. But, we are talking about Crockett and Tubbs here, not to mention Castillo and the gang. Why not at least define Crockett as Crockett? Show us he lives on a houseboat with an alligator. Why not mention that Tubbs is a NY transplant who has worked for years with Crockett after they eventually toke down the most ruthless notorious dealer Calderon, or make mention to the fact Tubbs has island heritage in some way shape or form? Or even Castillo for this matter, I don't mind he was a black guy instead of EJO but hows about indicate hes a stony Vietnam vet who was in so much crap in that war he knows guys who can kill themselves by swallowing their own tongues? And another thing about Castillo, Crockett and Tubbs did nothing with out his OK, nothing! In the film Castillo actually has to assert himself plainly to them to behave.The story was weak with all its plot holes that never tied up but all that could be forgiven with better continuity and characterizations.The shootout scenes were OK. They were a bit dark and confusing and in at least the last one I had two serious questions pop in my mind that made me feel ""this is kinda stupid"". One was "" How come Castillo is telling cops to just open fire without any attempt to arrest?"" another was ""Did Castillo just tell his cops to open fire on the bad guys while one of his own men was inextricably mixed in with them?"" The answer to the second was yes he did. The answer to the first is ""huh I guess thats how the Vice do it"".There's one more thing , where the hell is the Jan Hammer opening song!? That thing isn't dated and it DEFINES Miami Vice, heck they used to spin the extended play on the radio back in '86. They should have fit it in somewhere, someway, without that song it is not Miami Vice to me.Anyways this movie is OK , and I do believe like ALL Mann movies this will get better with another viewing. But not much. Relive Manhunter,Mohicans,Heat at your video store and save your money from the theaters on this one.",Miami Vice
323,alexvoko0232,I walked out on it,1,6 August 2006,"There were so much wrong with this movie that i can't explain it all. First off, the dialogue was just crap. Also I had NO IDEA what was going on. There is no excuse for this movie to be this bad. With the people involved a great director like Micheal Mann, a great actor in Jamie Foxx and an OK actor in Colin Farrell, this film should have been better. Like i said earlier, me and two other friends walked out on this movie. I really didn't have any expectations on this movie, but this is the first time in my life where my expectations were lowered after seeing this movie. In closing, I wanted my 7.50 back after viewing this.",Miami Vice
324,bobfv,Don't Bother,1,13 January 2007,"This movie was a complete waste of time - I can't believe Michael Mann put his name to it.I was a great fan of the 80's TV series because it had several elements lacking from a lot of TV - character development, lavish and artistic production. The movie version is all flash and action, but no character development, no soul. The score was very disappointing, including a cover version of Phil Collins' ""Something in the air tonight"" - a song which was used in it's original form in the TV series, as were a number of other well-know songs by great artists.The dialog was horrible, and it was recorded so poorly that many parts of the movie required subtitles, I could not even understand what the actors were saying. Colin Farrell's American accent was awful and unconvincing, which didn't matter much, because he hardly had any dialog.Don't bother seeing this movie - it's not worth it and if you are a fan of the TV show, you will be sorely disappointed. Oh - and the seminal Lt. Castillo is played my a morbidly obese African American actor - worst casting I have ever seen.",Miami Vice
325,spamspaz-1,Not actually that bad,7,30 July 2006,"I am one of the many people who are seeing this film and have not even heard of the source material, I am too young to know what it is yet I am old enough to see the new and enjoy it. This film is not as good as the other Micheal Mann film with Jamie Foxx (Collateral for those in the know), but it still has its moments even though they are way to bloody for their own good. The acting is fairly nice in some parts, but is over acted with silly accents here or under acted with little emotion in some parts. The middle part of the film that with little reason skips out for an arguably more romantic half hour between Colin and Gong could be cut out or left in, but the action scenes are enjoyable and the plot progresses at a nice pace. This movie will most likely be enjoyed by action film people who aren't slow at following plots, but I found that even my mother enjoyed this movie. It may be graphic and a little on the long side, but it is a fairly good film that can be enjoyed by many.",Miami Vice
326,tlc8804,Screw Jamie Foxx,5,24 August 2006,"I was so excited for this movie. I was convinced it would be awesome, the action would be sick and the stars would have brass balls to match their Ferrari. I thought it wasn't that bad. The action was cool. I love the look of all Mann's films, maily Collateral and Miami Vice. It really brings the sets and locations to life, and should be used more often. Farrel was wicked bad ass and I think his acting wasn't nearly as bad as others have said. But I have no more respect for Jamie Foxx. He left the movie because there was gang activity on set, and he wouldn't participate in boat stunts because he's a big Oscar winner. Forget him. Farrel now has infinite respect from me for sticking around and doing the whole ending without Foxx. Oscar indeed. Go Irish Drunks!",Miami Vice
327,Maxsa,Wish I could have seen and heard more of it.,7,5 August 2006,As a big fan of both Michael Mann fan and Miami Vice I enjoyed this movie and can forgive the plot for being ordinary and cliché. Fox is always spot on and this was the best acting I've ever seen from Colin Farrell and the first time I ever saw him as a man and not a boy but the movie was too dark and the audio was either badly recorded or poorly mixed because I couldn't understand lots of the dialog and neither could two friends of mine in two other cities so it wasn't the theater. I thought video worked better in Collateral. I liked his available light shooting on film for Robbery Homicide because with film you can use different films and push fast film and have more options but video needs more light and if you don't give it to it gets muddy.,Miami Vice
328,Cimmerian_Dragon,Miami Vice a new Mann Classic,8,31 July 2006,"Well, my most anticipated film of the summer has finally arrived. As much faith as I have in Michael Mann, I can't say I wasn't worried about what tone this movie was going to take. Specifically whether or not this would be a case of ripping the name off a well-known property and then producing something unrecognizable with it. Not so in this case I was happy to see. This movie may look a couple decades newer, but the vibe was still there, and the characters, while less upbeat than in their earlier incarnations, really came across as the same people. As such a big fan of the TV show, I can say I was not disappointed.But this isn't just a treat for old-school Vice fans, there's actually a pretty darn good story holding the keen style of the flick together. I'm not referring to the whole drug dealers/intel leaks plot, but rather the emotional obstacle course the characters get dragged through as the threats change their targets from society, to the individuals trying to protect it. Crocketts love affair with Isabella, a drug lord's dame, starts off as a one night stand and quickly becomes a tremendous Achilles' heel in the Vice Squad's already hazardous operation. While some have said that the movie's narrative is confusing or muddled, I cannot see what their trouble is. Everyone I saw it with had no difficulty following along. There are some loose ends left at the conclusion, but that was Mann's intent. In the real world, the bad guys don't just line up for arrest and spout a long winded explanation of their devious plots when they sense the credits are approaching.Now, any red-blooded male is probably asking, ""What about the fireworks CD?"" Well, this isn't the Matrix or Mission Impossible, so don't go into the theatre expecting it to be. The movie is more about tension than action, and it should be, but when the lead does start flying it is a sight to behold. Not since Mann's own Heat has a shootout been staged as realistically and exciting as Miami Vice's climax. If it doesn't get your blood pumping, you must be at the popcorn stand instead of the movie.The only real complaint I have is that the numerous supporting characters from the series that put in an appearance here don't get nearly enough screen time, we really only get time to know Crockett and Tubbs. If you're familiar with Gina, Larry, Stan and Trudy from the series, then the whole film becomes more rewarding. Those that are jumping into the film first will wonder who the hell these people are when they show up, and no answer will be coming.All in all, this is the best film I've seen this year, both Intelligent and exciting. If you've got the choice, I'd still recommend the series over this version of the story, but both are worthwhile viewing.",Miami Vice
329,1janina,boring...feel asleep,4,29 July 2006,"I couldn't understand the drug lingo...The best part of the movie was the last half hour. If you're looking for an action flick forget about this one. It was very disappointing being that I loved ""Miami Vice"" the show.There was little character development and the plot was hard to follow as to who's who. Save your money and see another movie. Yes and I really did fall asleep for about l5 minutes and when I woke up I didn't miss a thing. That's only because all the action didn't happen till the end of the movie.I was surprised that the movie wasn't better because I thought Michael Mann would do a fabulous job. Even the hot sex scenes were boring because they were all so repeatative.",Miami Vice
330,fuzzy_wunz,Authenticity that systematically undoes what the original series did,8,8 November 2006,"A far cry from cop thrillers that overemphasize the inner workings of the protagonists' minds and draw the viewer in through intimate observation, Miami Vice is a detached and surgical ride through a near-predictable plot line. Gone are Crockett's loud turquoise shirts and Tubbs' ability to topple criminal schemes with sheer will and stoic cool. The characters that were once romanticized on the small screen for prime-time audiences are replaced with steely professionals who rarely mince words or deliver delightful quips that amuse. Where the television show employed charm and flash to boost ratings, the movie employs 21st century sophistication, ambiguity, and precision to give audiences an unapologetic glimpse at undercover work. Far from glamorous, the plot plays out with the calculated severity of a police report. Romance is reserved primarily for deception; and neither Sonny nor Rico are ever propelled to the admirably mythic heights enjoyed by their small screen counterparts. All in all, the movie is Miami Vice in name alone, yet the added dose of grit and realism cures the franchise of its 'cheese' and 80s pop culture malaise. In the end, Miami Vice is an ambitious effort that was easily undercut by its small screen ties and audience expectations of nostalgic escapism.",Miami Vice
331,pdmb,Interesting film (but I wish they wouldn't mumble......),7,15 August 2006,"This was an interesting film; enjoyable and well acted but hard to follow in places. It wasn't that it was poorly directed and written (it is Michael Mann, after all) but I was having real trouble understanding what was being said at times. Sure, many of the characters are of Hispanic origin but it doesn't prevent everyone from slowing their speech down a little and speaking up. This mumbling prevented me from understanding several (obviously) important sub-plots until it was too late (e.g. what the hell was that opening scene in the nightclub all about?) Like all Michael Mann films, it looks beautiful. Some of the camera-work can only really be appreciated on the big screen and he manages to do for Miami what he did for LA in Heat. And, as if to prove he can still do impressive gun battles (Heat) he manages a high-powered, if rather one-sided shoot out at the end.Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell are excellent, as is the entire cast. We don't know a great deal about the characters, but then they are undercover so this is possibly a deliberate attempt by Mann to keep the audience a certain distance from them in the same way they have to do to their enemies. As was pointed out, this is no buddy movie and they barely exchange a dozen lines of dialogue.Gripes? Well, I'm not convinced that Isabella would have fallen so easily for Crockett, particularly when their business relationship was still relatively undeveloped and unsure. And why was Montoya so angry at seeing Crockett and Isabella slow-dancing when she had already told him that she had slept with him? Maybe it was fully explained but they mumbled....Anyway, it's worth seeing and despite its length, it doesn't feel a long movie although the bit with Sonny and Isabella does perhaps drag on a little too long. Not up to 'The Insider' and 'Heat' but a worthy addition to the Mann filmography.",Miami Vice
332,twsegreto,Huge disappointment.,1,30 July 2006,"I am a huge Michael Mann fan! I loved  I repeat loved Collateral and Heat. I think his directing and writing is amazing. So I am at a loss of words on why this movie was so bad. First off, Michael Mann uses some interesting camera shots in Collateral and it made the movie really good, but in this Miami Vice he over used it and it almost made me feel like I was watching an episode of Cops. This film was basically a love story. The two detectives barely had any interaction. The plot was really bland as well  I didn't catch what was going on until the movie was half over. Jamie Fox was barely in the movie. I would of never of thought in a million years that this movie would be this bad. But it was  I regret seeing it. I was so disappointed with this movie I felt like I was going to vomit. I was looking forward to this movie for a very long time. Don't waste your time, don't see it  go watch Heat or Collateral again.",Miami Vice
333,Javert-5,Don't waste your time on this one.,2,2 December 2006,"This remake of the famous 80s seriously is terrible. The fact that you are thrown into the movie with no real idea of what is happening pales against the poor disjointed story line, poor acting, irrelevant sex scenes that last forever, and mumbling as opposed to proper dialog and speech. The only positive to the movie was shootout scene which seemed to be a little above average. I also found the DVD transfer to be poor. Seemed to be extremely grainy without any real wow factor.This movie had the potential to be a real 'wower' however ended up a dud.Don't waste your time on this one.",Miami Vice
334,mhltan,"Should be THE summer movie of 2006, truly excellent",10,27 July 2006,"I just went to the European Premiere of Miami Vice here in London and I was totally blown away by this movie. You can definitely tell that Michael Mann has put his stamp on this movie by filming it digitally, like Collateral. Samuel L. Jackson, who was there, said he especially came to the London premiere because he missed it in L.A. Michael Mann, Colin Farrell, Jamie Foxx, Gong Li and Naomi Harris were all present. Do not expect this movie to be like the television series. They definitely upped the ante in terms of grit, language and sex. So expect to see more GTA: Vice City-type action instead of the tamed down television action. Even the chemistry between Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx is different from Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. This movie should not be compared with the television series nor with the Bad Boys movies. The tone of this movie is much more serious and realistic. What still remains from the television series, are the boats, planes, cars and an updated version of their clothes. For all of you who are familiar with the series, I can definitely recommend this movie. For the younger generation who never grew up with the series, I can say, go see this movie and get yourself acquainted with Crocket and Tubbs and buy the series on DVD. I hope that they will decide to make a sequel, because this movie deserves to be THE summer movie of 2006.",Miami Vice
335,muhon-nin,"If your a fan, see this movie!",7,28 July 2006,"This movie, I think, really distanced itself from the original television show. And that is a great thing! The movie made a strong point about drugs in the U.S., and how the problem is getting worse that better. Michael Mann really did his homework, and provided a canvas different from 'Traffic'.I am very glad that the movie isn't the show. If that was the case, I might as well watch the show, and save my eight bucks. I thought this movie proved his ability to show an issue, exploit it, and make it very fun to watch! This movie is what every fan of Mann's craft has been looking for. though it may not be 'Heat', but it sin't a disappointment! 10 out of 10!",Miami Vice
336,kim-andrewj,mediocre at best,5,20 August 2006,"Unlike most movie critics or people rating this movie, I am not familiar with the original Miami Vice TV series (I was born in 1989; the show aired in the early 80's) but even so I got a feel for Miami Vice through this update of the TV series. It has its exciting moments, but they are all too rare. Maybe it's just me, but the language in the film is hurried and rather hard to understand. Also, there are lot of boring moments in which they are dragged out, almost dulling the movie. Colin Farrell has seen better roles for someone of his talent, and the same goes for Jamie Foxx. This movie would be much better if they simply cut to the chase and remove lot of the crap in the way.",Miami Vice
337,LASmoak,"What ""Vice"" fans have been waiting for, and didn't even know it...",9,7 August 2006,"Yipee, another TV series brought to the big screen. Here's yet another attempt by stupid studio heads to mine our nostalgia, and their intellectual property libraries, for more millions of Hollywood dollars. What will we get in return for prostituting our fond memories of sitting on our couches once each week and investing ourselves in characters we come to love? We'll probably be given something very much like the adaptations of Charlie's Angels or Starsky & Hutch or The Brady Bunch, right? Not this time, folks, not this time. This time, we are given something very rare in exchange for our nostalgia: a truly great movie.An unwritten rule of film criticism is to judge the film on its own merits, not allowing one's opinions of source material to affect what is told to potential viewers about the movie at hand. This rule is, in my opinion, sometimes difficult to follow. Films that are based on previously produced material carry a baggage that, while possibly unfair, is nonetheless obviously there and I think is best addressed. Therefore, address it I shall. What you've heard about there being no pastel jackets over silk t-shirts and no pet alligators and no white Ferrari Testarossas is all true, but what writer/director Michael Mann did bring from the TV series is the one trait made that series truly unique in its day: despair. Sure, the flashy clothes, the pop music, the fast cars and the exotic locales were all things we associated with the series, and they all helped make it different from anything else on television at that time, but what truly made Miami Vice different in its day was its sense of hopelessness, its acknowledgment of how seldom society's good guys actually prevail, and how time spent fighting crime may seem like time ultimately wasted. How many episodes ended with our protagonists on the losing end of things? How many characters died in vain? How many sad figures committed suicide in Crockett's presence? (the answer is four, two of whom, athletes-posing-as-actors Bill Russell and Roberto Duran, did so in back-to-back episodes!) Mann, the man who, while never actually writing or directing a single episode, oversaw all of the creative forces involved in the original television series, has brought the screen writing and directing talents he has repeatedly demonstrated over the years to this material with which he is so undeniably linked, and has delivered a film that deserves to be in the company of his other great films, such as Heat, Manhunter and Thief. He gives us something new and fresh, and yet something that feels somehow very familiar. He gives us a story with characters that we think we know, and yet are not exactly what we think we know, and thus we are given the pleasure of re-learning them. The story doesn't keep us locked into local Miami crime, but instead shows us how law-enforcement struggles to combat the business of vice on the international level, flowing through Miami and on to other points on the globe.Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx inhabit the personae of Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs, police detectives seconded to the FBI for a major undercover job after the Feds learn that the identities of their own undercover people can no longer be protected. They are not the flamboyant GQ-dropout pretenders to the cocaine-chic lifestyle of the mid-eighties we knew before, but are now instead jaded, downtrodden foot-soldiers in the almost-unwinnable war against crime lords richer and better-equipped than many nations. I shall not further elaborate on the plot, for to do so would require far more text than I fear readers would tolerate. I do, however, advise one thing for you potential viewers: PAY ATTENTION! Do not go for popcorn, do not go for a pee-break and do not check your cell phone. Listen to every mumbled word of dialogue and remember every darkened face and greasy landmark you see, if you hope to follow the Byzantine path the film takes to its bullet-riddled conclusion. I will also add that, for those of us who relished the stylized gunshot-inflicted deaths of the television series, we are given a couple of good 'uns, justifying this films ""R"" rating, along with some ultra-cool dialogue to precede them.Also for those of us who would look for such things, Mann gives us the characters (or at least the names) we expect to see: Switek, Zito, Gina, Trudy, Lt. Castillo are all here, and while these folks play important roles in the plot of this feature, they sadly do not have as much to do in a two-hour feature as they would in a 22-episode television season (one hopes for a sequel or two that would allow us to see more of these characters, but I digress). Justin Theroux and Michelle Rodriguez, as Zito and Gina respectively, especially utilize their limited opportunities to provide performances that give hints of richer character possibilities that this film did not grant us. The pastels are replaced here with blacks, greys and blues, shot digitally grainy at night and hi-def clear in daylight. If Miami Vice was made for HBO today instead of for NBC twenty-two years ago, this is how it would be.In the end, all that matters is whether this is a good movie. Yes, it damn-sight is. It is a fine police procedural made for attentive adults who enjoy a fairly realistic portrayal of how cops do what they do, and it works very well on that level. No, it's not The French Connection, but it is worthy of sharing a title with its groundbreaking crime drama television series predecessor, and is the best grown-up film of this summer season. It is most definitely not some throwaway TV adaptation meant to rake in a butt-load of cash on opening weekend and then slink towards DVD shelves, and is worth your nine bucks if you crave some adult drama.",Miami Vice

It's probably one of the most insipid scripts I've come across lately.It's full of what-the-f*** musical choices, American good guys and Mexican bad guys (of course), there are many intense existential close-ups of the lead actors in the shower interrupted by horny girlfriends, the color grading guys grained the SH**T out of every single shot to make them look grainy (because Miami is baaaaaaaaaaaaaad). You get to see soaked Naomie Harris and Jamie Foxx stripped to the crotch (hey, they gotta fund their movie).Let's not be negative here: there's some hope in the script in that one lead character's personal life falls apart while the other guy's personal life comes together and vice versa.

How can I put this?........Miami Vice is basically a watered down version of Bad Boys. It's Bad Boys without the humour, class script, top notch special effects and quality acting. In fact, Miami Vice doesn't even match up to the original TV series...I'd go as far as saying that the TV series had better effects, better acting and sharper scripts...with a sense of humour too.Colin Farrell is a handsome guy, there's no doubt there, but in the film, his acting was very patchy, and the script didn't help - the dodgy lines came thick and fast though, which help me get over the hurdles! Jamie Foxx didn't have any decent lines either, I was expecting at least some dry wit or some good put downs...but this film had none of that, there was no soul. But somehow, I ended up enjoying it, and I'll go and see a sequel if it happens.

Mann's way to subtly play with strong emotions is played out perfectly. But that's not it alone. It is hard to describe what I find so moving in this movie. Is it the amazing soundtrack? There is not one single scene where the music doesn't match the overall ambience just perfectly. It is hard to play in the same league as 'Heat', but this film has everything to be there. While I enjoyed Farell and Foxx in many movies and they're doing an excellent job, I think that John Ortiz is the one who really killed it in this movie! I have never seen a crook being played so well, credible and with so much energy.",Miami Vice
344,tex_a_2000,I would rather watch a household plant breathe,4,3 August 2006,"To be brief as not to waste any more precious time talking about the crap i just paid money to see... let me say that the script was obscure, pace of the flick was too slow, not the best of acting (jamies's acting was good though) , hard to follow themes (at times), very very very predictable plot (and boring as well )and lack of a needed climax. The action scenes were graphic however and well portrayed for the audience.Overall I would say IMHO that it is a flick i would ad=vise people to rent from a video store or read a summary magazine as the whole flick can be limned in about one paragraph (despite it was nerely 2 hrs long) i would rate it a 4 out of 10",Miami Vice
345,IvanX,"styled to be realistic, but at no moment is it believable",3,6 July 2009,"Another disappointed Michael Mann fan here. Heat succeeded not by adopting an excessively serious tone, despite its genuine intensity, rich characters, thrilling action sequences, and well-developed plot. In fact, it was Mann's glossy touch -- you could see the stylistic threads of the Miami Vice television show -- that gave that movie its vital sheen.By contrast, Miami Vice goes for gritty rather than glossy, with terrible results. The movie takes itself far too seriously, and creates continuous cognitive dissonance throughout by presenting its set pieces with almost faux-documentary realism (e.g. the shootout). Yet nothing seems at all compelling or believable. (An early death in the movie sets the tone here.) Is this how international drug law enforcement really is? Is that what the Aryan Brotherhood is really like? The movie seems to want you to think so by how it is styled, but I'm not buying it. Crocket and Tubbs aren't even convincing as archetypes, much less properly developed characters.I hardly demand accurate portrayals of the real world for a movie to work, as long as I am able to enter the movie's world. But I couldn't here, because of its insistence that what we are watching is somehow the ""real"" world. In the end, you aren't engaged, you don't believe, you aren't stimulated, and there just isn't much to enjoy. Too bad.Footnote: Michael Mann shoots the most unwatchable sex scenes in Hollywood (even in Heat), and he goes off the rails in MV. He should just stop.",Miami Vice
346,kubrick4277,I Think Gong Li (or Li Gong...However You Prefer It) Is A Great Asian Actress But.......,8,31 July 2006,"I love Gong Li (or Li Gong). I think she's an amazing Asian actress and she's one of the most gorgeous women on celluloid today. I enjoyed Miami Vice, but I had several issues with casting. If you cannot speak the language that your character is supposed to be able to be fluent in, you should not be cast in the role. Forget how great the actress is in her native tongue (To Live, Raise the Red Lattern, Ju Dou). You can't cast someone based on physical appearance and prior film credits. You have to cast someone who fits the role and who doesn't sound like they're struggling with the language that they are supposed to speak fluently. I imagine I'm going to get a lot of flack for saying this, but I have other actresses that I would have cast in the role of Isabella. Let me know what you think of these actresses (who have proved to be able to speak English, plus they have sex appeal and they are amazing actresses....oh yeah....and they're Asian): Tamlyn Tomita - She's my first choice to play the role of Isabella. She's younger than Gong Li, she's Asian, and she speaks English! She could probably just as easily learn Spanish as Gong Li did and I think she would have had better chemistry with Colin Farrell. For those who disagree, check out The Karate Kid Part II opposite Ralph Macchio. Also check out Come See the Paradise opposite Dennis Quaid. Both great films and she speaks the language clearly. Ming-Na - Also Asian, a little older than both Gong Li and Tamlyn Tomita, but she speaks English and she's sexy. She & Tamlyn starred in The Joy Luck Club about a dozen years ago. I think she would have fit the part. She speaks better English than both Tamlyn & Gong Li. I think she would have good chemistry with Colin Farrell as well.Alright people, time to sound off!",Miami Vice
347,stephenhill8,No Character Development,5,8 August 2006,"The power went out in our theater 15 minutes until the end, and I found I really didn't care if the injured character died in the hospital or not. There's plenty of brief sex to go around, but otherwise we're never shown the human side of any of the characters. Without this, why should we care if their character is avenged against the bad guy, or even whether they live or die? The Don Johnson character has the rough, street-smart aspect down, but he has no sexy style like the original. Likewise, the supposedly sexy Asian woman never creates any chemistry on her side of things. She is completely miscast. On that note, why choose a rather reserved Asian female lead when the whole movie is set in South and Central America? Why not go for the stereotypical latina hottie given the rest of the plot? Modern film noir-type dialogue plays well as the two heroes work their way undercover into the cartel. Action scenes also have good production values, as most large budget films. I just wish I had cared whether the good guys won instead of the villains.",Miami Vice
348,Filmmaker10,Not Mann's Best,5,2 August 2006,"This movie was not what I expected. The movie was getting so much publicity and hype that I thought that it would be good, but there was no action until the last half hour, and the sex scenes were nonstop. The movie was worth seeing, but the scenes were unrealistic, and unbelievable. Mann (Director) did not make his best film. If you want to see a good Mann movie see Heat or Collateral, because this is definitely not his best. Do not take this comment the wrong way, there were good parts to the movie, but there were definitely a lot of bad parts. Some good parts were the visuals. The last thirty minutes was action, and the movie put you right in the middle of it, it felt like you were there. I recommend you see the movie anyway because despite its unrealistic scenes, the movie was a little above average. if you do not agree with this comment after seeing the movie, see Heat, and Collateral.",Miami Vice

If you like Michael Mann you'll love this.",10,12 August 2006,"As soon as i found out Michael Mann was doing it i knew it would be great. When Mann started to direct the show, he saw a lot more potential in it, and this film is an obvious result of how much of a visionary he is. I've only seen the intro to the show so i can't comment on it. I presume it won't be a patch on the film. Foxx and Farrell are brilliant as the leads, you see on the screen they put everything they had into the movie. Watching a Michael Mann movie is like watching Michael Schumacher race, always exciting and always a winner, if you find this type of effort and dedication monotonous then you are just a sweet and sour junkie. Hats off to everyone who made this film happen.",Miami Vice
350,mrwinch,Everything it should be and more,9,16 August 2006,"I read a three star review of this film and almost let it put me off going to see it. So glad I ignored that review, I would have missed out on masterful piece of film-making, that I would put alongside one of my faves ""Goodfellas"", for meatiness, clarity of heart, entertainment and seemingly uncontrived, original imitation of reality, as all great art is.It was hard to catch every little nuance and eyebrow raised, code name, who was who etc., but overall that didn't matter, although this would make it worth seeing again to catch all of the details. Beautiful and moody to look at and experience. The music was perfect, the sound effects not overdone and anything visually overdone I absolutely condone in the movie, as it just added to the allure. During a gunfight scene the bullets sounded real, not heightened as so many film fight scenes are, by the sound department, which no doubt worked on it, but didn't oversaturate our ears to the point where we no longer cared or believed what we were seeing was real.At no point was the audience insulted, a wonderful thing from an American mainstream movie. I could not drive a truck through the script holes, there were none of any worrying size.I went on the journey with the characters which had no obvious conclusion, no clichéd and pointed plot devices, I was in no man's land with them, not knowing what would happen next. I loved and respect this movie for unseating my expectations thus making it more experiential.I read that someone thought it was a disappointment for a Mann film, but to me, this is his best to date and he raised his own bar as well as movies of this genre in general. Great respect to Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell. The female lead was also exceptional and believable, slightly unreadable, as it should be, as were the relationships, technology and plot.Don't hesitate to see this film.",Miami Vice
351,mrthrill,Fans of the Show Will Dig It,9,29 July 2006,"This is not so much a reinvention as it is an update. All the actors are ""in character"" (even Barry as Castillo doing his low-talking best) and echo the originals without mimicking them. Favorite new take: Gina, who has the single best ""shot"" in the flick. Otherwise the dangerous mood, downbeat tone, slick use of music, sporadic then ultimately intense and cathartic violence can all be directly linked to the source material. You won't miss the 80s clothes or alligator if you loved the TV show for its cynical attitude and hard-boiled demeanor. The show's stock guest characters from the heavily-accented Latin drug kingpins to the slimy Feds to the trendy nightclub denizens are all on the big screen too. So are the familiar atmospheric locations, from a lonely exotic beach to a glistening nocturnal skyline to an industrial shipyard to a bleak white trash trailer park. Best surprise: the ""plot"", pleasingly simplistic, was obviously culled from various episodes of the series, most notably ""Smuggler's Blues"" but with smatterings of ""Prodigal Son"" ""Evan"" and all the doomed romance pieces like ""Definitely Miami"" and ""French Twist."" True fans will notice these touches which are more of a true tribute to the series than a pastel palette would've been, and this will greatly enhance the experience.Critics who say this is ""darker"" than the show never watched the entire run. There's nothing here grittier (or even as gritty, really) than the whole Burnett amnesia story arch, or grimmer than TV SPOILER ALERT Crockett's pregnant wife getting shot in the back by a criminal he helped saved from Death Row on a false tip. There's more blood and more swear words and more nudity in the movie, but the show pushed those envelopes as far as possible, breaking new ground for its medium. It's only natural a feature film in 2006 would be bloodier and sexier than a TV show from two decades earlier. But it's not bleaker or more daring in context. It's totally true to the pioneering, uncompromising vision and spirit of the original. The whole point of the original ""Miami Vice"" was that it was cutting edge in terms of style and reflective of its times in terms of content. Mann's film version naturally retains those elements, since those are the real reasons his show became in icon in the first place, and still holds up despite the often outlandish fashions. Setting the new flick in the 80s would've been like setting the series in the 60s. This is ""Vice"" as if it never went off the air but just kept progressing with the times (as the series did - the pastels, the alligator and even Zito gradually disappeared by mid-season three). It does seem chunks of storytelling were axed to fit a shorter time slot, but these cuts (like the boat race) didn't seem to tighten up the often languorous pace anyway, and their inclusion may have helped fill a few plot holes. The tension remains and it's fun just to watch a new ""Vice"" unfold since it's been 17 years since the two hour finale of the show, ""Freefall"" (yet another subtly plundered episode.) I need to see it again soon since my first reaction was one of being satisfied yet somewhat underwhelmed. However, flashbacks to scenes of humid intrigue warrant a second immediate viewing. It's like recalling an epic fever dream. I already rate it as Mann's third best flick, behind ""Heat"" and ""Thief."" (Sorry, Cruise's miscasting totally ruined ""Collateral"" for me.) In time I think this movie will be seen not as a remake of the show, but as a continuation of it.ADDENDUM: On second viewing, this flick fired on all cylinders. The pace, camaraderie, use of music, etc all worked in cool concert, with no scenes seeming extraneous. If you're a Mann fan, a Vice fan, or a fan of unique, expressionistic cinema, see it. More than once. Destined to be a cult classic. It's still #3 behind ""Heat"" and ""Thief,"" though, at least in my book - but still a worthy companion piece in Mann's impressive neo-noir pantheon.",Miami Vice
352,csuperman,A Revision,8,16 November 2012,"The first time I saw this film was on DVD, and the film appeared to be mixed in such a way that the ambiance overpowered the dialogue track, making it very difficult to understand. I thought this was an aesthetic choice and actually admired the film for it - it felt voyeuristic enough with the digital photography, why not obscure the dialogue as if it were not exposition but actual genuine conversation between people? Of course the downside to this was that I didn't know what was going on (a point I'll further elaborate on in a moment) and, as far as the dialogue goes, in the few instances you could actually hear anything it sounded either dreadfully cheesy or not like anything anyone would ever say, ever. It made me quite happy I wasn't hearing too much, so as not to ruin the illusion of a complex and sophisticated narrative.But that was watching it out of context.I've now watched it again on Blu-ray, the dialogue track is clear and precise, and I can finally follow the plot of this film. And BOY does it move!It turns out what was obscured was a water tight, katana sharp script which tore you through its glamorous yet downright f-ed up world better than, I feel, far too many films I've seen in recent years. It's ironic that behind its rough and somewhat awkward exterior lies a smooth as polished marble interior. I don't think it's a very accessible film -i f it were pulled off in a cleaner fashion (shot on film etc.) it might've seen more praise, though, from where I'm standing, I think the two aspects compliment each other. It runs so smoothly underneath that when it gets plush and stylish, you fully believe it, as you do when things get tough and procedural.Some of the character stuff's still flawed - I believe in the drama of Sonny and Isabella's relationship but not in the actual relationship, and did Jose just fancy her too? I mean I was struggling to see his problem with them.I think my personal favourite thing about this film is that, tonally, I can't sense any difference between it and the series. I mean I'd describe it as 'exactly the same, just not dated'. Can't quite say why ... I can only assume Miami VICE is just as relevant today as it was back in the 80's",Miami Vice
353,PhattyMatty42,The Best Movie of the Summer,8,29 July 2006,"Easily my favorite Michael Mann picture, everything he does in this works like a charm. What I love about this flick is how there is no opening credits of any kind, hell not even a title. The Universal logo disappears and then we are thrown into this life of crime, drugs, cops, love, and sex the minute the familiar Jay-Z/Linkin Park Numb/Encore song erupts throughout the speakers... and not once does this life let us down. Mann's digital camera photography is like masterful clockwork here, giving this film the dark and gritty look it so desperately needed.I could tell walking into the theater most of the audience was there looking for this summer's Bad Boys crap fest shoot em' up. Too bad that's not what they received. Mann carefully has interwoven a hardcore undercover cop film with characters we generally like. I have never seen one episode of the ""Miami Vice"" TV show so I won't contrast and compare (not like you should anyway), but the characters of Tubbs (Foxx) and Crockett (Farrell) in this flick are no-nonsense bad mother jammers. They take no crap from nobody, and this movie doesn't either. Miami Vice is serious to the core making what we are seeing realistic as possible while in the boundaries of a major motion picture. Our two main characters are supported by their own love interests that raises the stakes in the latter half of this film, this device works extremely well by playing with your emotions a bit. Capping off with what has to be one of the best (and real) shootouts I've ever witnessed on a screen, your going to walk away either empty handed looking for a piece of 80's nostalgia or a bag full of goodies realizing you've just seen the best movie of the summer.",Miami Vice
354,sjsully,Amazing Cinema Experience!,10,30 July 2006,"The best cinema experiences are the ones that take you in and pull you along for the ride. That's how I felt as I sat through ""Miami Vice"": this summer's best movie. A feeling that stayed with me long after I left the theater. If you're the type of person that wants a constant snap snap snap action movie with overdone dialogue, you might want to go elsewhere. Michael Mann has taken a classic 80's TV drama and made it into a modern, smart, beautiful film with great respect for the idea behind the show he produced back in the day.There is none of that absurd campy crap we've seen in recent movies made from other TV shows (Dukes of Hazzard, Starsky & Hutch, Charlies Angels, etc). Nope. Remember, this was a groundbreaking show far ahead of its time when it came out in 1984, portraying the gritty underground world of Miami's drug cartels and undercover cops that had to sometimes walk the line, and Michael Mann does not disappoint. Wow is all I can say! Here we get the best paced movie Mann has ever done. So nuanced and tight with its filming and editing. Perfect Pace throughout. Top notch cinematography. Wonderful colors - dark, sublime;classic pastels and neon shades throughout. A great musical arrangement, as was done back in the original show. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are excellent as Crockett and Tubbs. A great supporting cast too, with Barry Henley as Lt. Castillo, Elizabeth Rodriguez as Gina, and the beautiful Gong Li as Isabella , just to name a few. Mann does not give you any background information of these men,nor does he dumb down his pace or plot for you to catch up. He hits it at the gut level - the classic visceral Michael Mann we've seen in movies such as Heat and Collateral and brings you into the dangerous world of the drug war. Let go of expectations or preconceived notions, and get taken along for the ride. You will see why Michael Mann is the best action movie director today. Brilliant movie!",Miami Vice

They could have made this into a ordinary buddy movie with shootouts, car chases and cheesy comedy but the instead focus on the two great leads in Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell. It is an intense movie in all aspects, action, acting, editing and sounds. The plot movies along great without any far-fetched twists for the sake of twists. It is always believable. . With some great tunes by Audioslave. And just like in Heat it isn't action for the sake of action, it is violence by trained professionals. If you watch this in a cinema with a good soundsystem you will flinch when they start shooting because it sounds so great. The movie is dark and have a documentary feel to the filming, something that suits the movie. My only critizism comes from that they seem to forget one of the key factors in the plot with the FBI rat.Somebody said if this is mediocer Mann that he doesn't want to watch more, I say that bring me more if this is mediocrity. Mann stills kicks major ass when comparerd to standard Hollywood action movies.",Miami Vice
357,BeDrinkable,I've come to expect better from Mann,5,28 April 2008,"Over the past decade and a half, Michael Mann has managed to set himself apart from the run of the mill movie maker that Hollywood seems determined to groom. This pack produces popcorn flicks with quick action, no character development and little that will remain with the viewer past the closing credits. Mann, on the other hand has made several gripping stories that delve into the psychological lives of the characters, gradually fleshing them out until they feel real to us and we care about the events that befall them.This has created in me a certain high expectation. In Collateral, Mann followed a patently ridiculous idea, somehow weaving in and out of situations with these characters, gradually exploring motivations until the situation faded into the background. In his best film to date, The Insider, he followed characters through their struggles with ethics, loyalties and danger. It was for this film that Russel Crowe deserved an Oscar.Now we come to Miami Vice, certainly the low point of Mann's mature career. He does still know how to set a mood. I enjoy the use of music, for the most part, and the quiet moments are welcome. However, he dispenses with the character development he is so good at. The story moves at a quick clip, and we have little time to understand the motivations of these people. For example, why are Sonny and Rico so devoted to each other as parters? We never know. We also are expected to believe that Sonny, while undercover, will allow himself to fall in love with the paramour of a Columbian drug kingpin. I also must take issue with some of the casting. I very much like Colin Farrell, but here has added some bulk (hopefully just temporary), and he does not carry it well. Gong Li, while a good actress, does not make for a convincing Cuban. She speaks with a noticeable Asian accent! Finally, Mann is not a master of the love scene. There were two, which bordered on painful to watch. I must commend Mann however, for his obvious distaste with the torture scene. His movies, while not gentle, do away with the unnecessary I-do-this-you-scream scene which pops up all too often in the action genre.There was well documented difficulty in the making of this movie, so perhaps not all the shortcomings can be laid at Mann's feet, but for better or worse, I have come to expect much, much more from him.",Miami Vice

I loved the TV-show but this is just plain bad, compared to the show the movie is way too serious, too boring and bad acted by almost everyone in the cast. The film has none of the charm or the cool style that the show had. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx both fail to convince in the leading roles. And Naomie Harris is not good at all as Tubbs girlfriend Trudy, but the worst performance goes to Gong Li, she is TERRIBLE!!! I don't get Michael Mann, why do a movie called Miami vice when the story doesn't even take place in the 80's? And why doesn't he even try to do it at least a bit charming and cool as the show? Compared to Collateral and Heat the action scenes here are just loud,noisy and brutal instead of smart,tight,slick and elegant.

I also thoroughly enjoyed the camera-style that has been atypical of all Michael Mann's police dramas and I felt like I was actually there witnessing the events unfold. This film allows you to feel the life struggles encountered daily by law enforcement in a place like Miami which to many of us is just a paradise we only visit on spring break.

I don't know if he was responsible for the two leads, but it was a fatal error. Although Foxx was good in Collateral, he and Farrell are a disaster in this film. I would have gone with unknowns or semi stars. Gary Oldman in Farrells role would have been interesting. Or Oldman in the Castillo role. Towles does a nice job as Coleman. Most of the other roles in the film are forgettable. I've seen many of Manns films multiples of times. HEAT is his masterpiece. What a great film. In My Top 100 of all time. I would follow this with Manhunter at two, Thief at three, The Insider at four, and Last Of The Mohicans at five. Hopefully Mr. Mann isn't finished making great films. I've enjoyed his work for many years.",Miami Vice
363,ReinaMissy,Great Summer Entertainment,8,28 July 2006,"I've heard and seen some negative comments already that Michael Mann expects us to know the lingo employed by the feds & drug dealers, and that he assumes we know enough about these characters' background so we need no further set-up for the film. It seems to me that in order for the film to be the gritty, realistic portrayal of the drug trade that it purports to be, these things cannot be detailed further than they are without adding an air of ""Hollywood movie"" to the film. Mann's deliberate omissions make the film much better and far more believable than the typical shoot-em-up cops movie.Though the film starts a bit awkwardly and is slightly disjointed in its move from one scene to the next, it's an enjoyable excursion to the theater in summer, which is honestly what we should expect from it rather than hoping it's schmaltzy 80s TV moved to the big screen.

365,krael74,Michael Mann's Vice,7,18 August 2006,"It's strange to really enjoy a movie, yet recognize every valid criticism of it at the same time. With Michael Mann, this often proves to be the case. Going in, it was apparent Mann intended something very different than the TV show he helped bring to the screen two decades ago, and he achieved this. This Miami Vice is colder, darker and distant. The often good humored chemistry of Crockett and Tubbs has been replaced by a much less telegraphed partnership. As in many Mann films, the movie stays detached from its viewers. The plot is incredibly simple, yet the breathing space the film lays around it may confuse those looking for the something more they expect. The atmosphere is very tangible. The actors rely more on body language and expression than dialogue. The action comes in climatic bursts rather than steady pulses. For those who enjoy Mann, this movie has a lot to offer. The cinematography and shot selection are a beautiful mix of huge ocean spreads and ominous storm-lit night skies. The settings shift from one bit of eye candy to the next. The actors all put in solid performances, yet I was unexpectedly impressed with Farrell. His Crockett has none of the wisecracking edge Don Johnson's original portrayal contained, yet he brings home the raw emotion of the Crockett character with force and an impressive economy of dialogue. Given the rapidly shifting tempo of the film, he paints a familiar picture of the character without ever quite climbing up on the ""hero"" pedestal. Jamie Foxx puts in a steady, if abbreviated, job as Ricardo Tubbs. This was one aspect I had hoped for more of from the movie, as Tubbs' character is so understated as to be nearly background. Luis Tosar does more with his eyes than most villains do with words as the drug pin, Montoya and John Ortiz performs with shark-like rhythm as his henchman, Jose Yero.Those who are not a fan of Mann's often disconnected and often abstract pace likely will become frustrated with this movie. Those who are looking for the chemistry and humor of the show will also find it lacking. However, if you enjoy the mood and restrained grit of a Mann crime drama, this has everything and more to satisfy that hunger. This is absolutely a pure Mann take on Miami Vice, and personally, it left me wanting even more.",Miami Vice
366,botner,One of the best of the summer,8,30 July 2006,"Well, you can read about the plot elsewhere, but to summarize..-Yes, this one will polarize audiences. You'll either love it or hate it. Those going into hoping for either a rehash of the TV show or an over-the-top action flick a la Mission: Impossible or James Bond will probably leave disappointed. The ADD moviegoers who need constant stimulation and a spelled-out plot will inevitably shift in their seats and wish they would have checked out 'Little Man' instead. Those seeking a competent, stylish, adult cop movie will get their moneys worth.-Not as good as 'Heat', but about on par with Collateral.-Yes, there are some plot lines/characters that go seemingly unresolved, but that is how it was on the TV show too, and how it is in real life. You don't always wrap things up in one quick swoop. I suppose that's what sequels are for.-The cinematography is exquisite, with breathtakingly beautiful shots, be it a purple Miami skyline at night or a boat cruising effortlessly across the ocean. -Both the leads do a admirable job. Despite getting saddled with an unfortunate mullet and a few cheesy pickup line, Farrell is pretty good. Bottom line: A great, 'adult' cop drama for the over 25 set. Those wanting something more flashy, well go see Pirates again.",Miami Vice
367,fish_stix03,"Heavy-handed, convoluted and ultimately unrewarding",5,1 October 2006,"I'm not sure why Michael Mann felt he needed to make this movie. Why he bothered to revive Miami Vice, a show that he produced in the 1980s is not clear to me. Mann's other films (The Insider, Collateral, Heat), are all much finer showcases of his skill than his attempt here. Particularly, Mann's previous film Collateral is comparable to Miami Vice, but works much better. Miami Vice is an example of how a talented writer/director, coupled with charismatic and gifted actors doesn't always result in an enjoyable and well-crafted movie.The set-up of the film is as follows. Detectives James ""Sonny"" Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx) are given an undercover mission after another undercover agent is killed by drug dealers. What the police want to know are, how the drug dealers knew who he was, and why. What follows is two-and-a-half hours of confusing drug dealer jargon and incomprehensible dialogue, several reasonably exciting set pieces and Crockett seducing the woman he should be surveying. There's also a piece of ridiculous manipulation involving Tubbs' wife (played by Naomie Harris).Throughout the entire film, the picture is grainy and dark. I don't know why Michael Mann chose to do this. Miami is such a vibrant, lively city (lively enough to be the setting of a film about undercover police officers busting illicit drug deals), but the way its shot in this movie is so poorly-lit. Put simply, it's just a boring film to look at. At first, I thought it was because Michael Mann wanted to make it look like an 80s film, perhaps as an homage to the TV series. However, with the technology that is used in the film (the latest Ferrari model, satellite phones and laptops) tell us that it is set in modern-day Miami. Because of this, the spotty and grainy film makes Mann simply look lazy. Combined with this, Mann's obsession with hand-held shots (which is infuriating in the opening scene of the film) makes much of the action difficult to follow and clutters the screen.While I'm sure there are many men out there who would love to be Colin Farrell, his performance in this film doesn't make me want to keep my hair long and grow a handlebar moustache. He delivers his lines as if he has deep contempt for the film and its screenwriter. As for Jamie Foxx, it seems that he's only in this as a personal favour to Michael Mann, who gave him a role in his previous film, Collateral. An actor of Jamie Foxx's talent should know not to do films like Stealth and this one in the space of eighteen months. This would kill the careers of many other actors, but hopefully he'll get a decent script to work with soon. He's far more talented that the monosyllabic dialogue he has been given in Miami Vice.In terms of positives in the film, there is a little bit of fun to be had. A couple of scenes toward the end of the film remind us of what this film could have been, and the use of music is quite impressive. Despite its deficiencies, the movie is still clearly identifiable as a Michael Mann film, and I have to give him credit for his style and grace, particularly in the love scenes. Having said that, if anyone puts one ounce of thought into this film, they will see how ridiculous and derivative it really is.This isn't a movie Mann should be proud of. In fact, it's probably the worst of his career. But he's not a bad film-maker, which is why it's such a shame. It's a real shame that this film, which should have been one of the most exciting, well-written and action-packed of the summer, turned out to be such a misfire. The director's, and the two lead actors', hearts just don't seem to be in it. After all, if Michael Mann, Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx don't seem to care about the quality of this movie, why should we?",Miami Vice
368,reisnersteven,"Very stylish, but incredibly unsatisfying",5,14 January 2016,"Before writing this I will say I'm not old enough to have watched the old show, which enables me to view this with more of an open mind. After finally watching this I could have and probably should have given it less than five stars. The only two saving graces of the film are Michael Manns directing, no doubt the film is visually appealing. After the directing it's Jamie Foxx who plays the role with a certain smoothness that gives his scenes an extra element of style. Unfortunately somehow during filming they must have forgotten he was there and decided to spend 45 minutes with Collin Farrell and his love interest that I could have done without. These two are supposed to be partners, they are never together, I wouldn't know their names if they weren't in the summary. No character development at all just a lot of bland dialogue. My expectations were raised by reviews on this site saying it's very violent and bloody. It's not. Yes there is blood but with a runtime over 2 hours I need more than one actual gunfight (i don't count scenes with 2 quick shots) before I call it violent, let alone very violent. It's slow moving, drawn out, the very few action scenes are completely predictable. If it wasn't for Michael Manns directing and the smoothness of Foxx Id probably give this two stars.",Miami Vice
369,patrick_bateman_esquire,Not quite up to the standards of the original TV show,6,3 July 2007,"This movie does feel like a TV show. You kind of pick up the story as it is already unfolding, much like the TV show began each episode. Moreover, you are kind of expected to already know the characters. Moreover, there is some real style at work here, great shots of Miami at night and motorboats, etc. But where this story kind of takes a nose dive is in the script. Mann just did not work very long on this thing. Very few characters (if any) are developed at all. The too many loved scenes are just tacked on for the sake of having them. The bond between Crockett and Tubbs is accepted because we have a background on the TV show, but it is never developed in this movie. I did not have a problem with any of the casting, the actors did fine, Foxx is perhaps an upgrade to Phillip Michael Thomas, but Farrell is no upgrade to Don Johnson, not even close, but still, he is OK. Castillo is not even Castillo and why they even bothered throwing the names Zito, Castillo and Trudy out there is beyond me. It is not the worst movie in the world, but when it comes to Michael Mann, you are expecting a little more. Although, Mann's current trend is starting to leave me expecting very little in the future.",Miami Vice

But then again, people who did watch the series may have also been disappointed.I think that there were good performances from a few actors as Colin Farrell coming from 'Alexander' has done much better in this movie, and Jamie Foxx has also brought us a good performance even though I thought we could have seen more of him.Most of the movie I didn't get so I was practically watching blanks, but the couple of actions scenes in the movie were very good and exciting to watch.

371,killa_man23,Michael Mann's first flop,5,7 August 2006,"Heat, Ali, Collateral. What those films had in common were their gritty and dodgy camera work, all exceptional. For a stylish 80's classic like Miami Vice, that factor wasn't really needed. The only reason I saw this was like everybody else, it was once a good TV show. When I bought the popcorn and coke, sat down and saw no opening credits, I knew this was going to be something unique. But mid way through, it felt like a spin-off of Scarface. Why did Mann decide to implement a stupid and clichéd plot like taking down a Cuban drug lord and infiltrating the drug trade? This is been overdone so many times its considered rape.I love Michael Mann's work. Miami Vice is nothing more than an episode of a gritty show on HBO. I don't know weather he used a HD camera or a hand-held but some of the shots were amateurish. It's a slightly okay film but the plot is achingly cliché.",Miami Vice

373,billyray331,In a disappointing summer....Mann gives us the years BEST film,9,5 September 2006,"After seeing countless summer films that were horribly miscalculated, poorly written, and completely free of any originality, the summer of '06 looked like a grisly and forgettable season that would be free of a definitive masterpiece. When sequels like 'Mission Impossible III' and 'X-men 3' failed to capture the spark of their predecessors, and when the abysmally under produced 'Dead Man's Chest' was bestowed on the public, I almost gave up. 'Superman Returns' had the most promise for a memorably great film, yet it lacked in coherent and flowing storytelling, leaving it good, not great.Then Mann (one of the greatest living directors) took a concept that spelled disaster, and exercised his brilliance. A modern, violent, straightly played update of a campy TV show with a questionable cast and a hard R rating was released, and amazingly, it amazed. Not only was this the summer movie we were all waiting for, but it is the YEARS BEST FILM. I won't go into it, but pay attention to the dialogue, and enjoy the killer soundtrack, the incredible sound design, and the attention to good adult thriller storytelling. After many films that take a campy approach to old television, here we have a respectful update. This is what the show would have been had it been made today... and put on HBO.",Miami Vice
374,LittleGirlLost,"Not bad, but not that good either!",5,31 August 2006,"My first thought after seeing this film, was that it could have been a long Miami Vice-episode when it comes to the storyline. It's not very original, it's filled with action, drugs and fast cars and boats... and of course women. I was no must-see-fan of the Miamy Vice TV-series, but I still missed a few aspects in the film that I think was typically Miami Vice... like the pink flamingos (weren't they almost like a trademark?!), the pastel suits and the close friendship between Sonny and Ricardo (and maybe also Sonny's alligator; Elvis). Jamie Foxx did a good job as Tubbs, but Colin... he tries too hard!! He just don't cut it, and his character seems false. They should have been able to find someone more convincing in that strategic role. Bad, bad casting! Li Gong as Isabella wasn't that bad, but her character would have been even more fitting if she had spoken better English... The worst thing about the inter-human aspect in the movie was the total lack of the solid, dead-serious but yet funny partnership and friendship between the two leads. From the adaption from TV-series to film it got lost on the way. And the film looses out!

I was assuming it to be another action flick that took the director a day to put together. The usual, chicks that have sex with guys, boats that go fast, cars that go fast, and shooting people in the f'ing face. This movie in all honesty, doesn't have a plot. Unless you call a Chinese woman getting ahold of Colin Farell and taking him to Cuba to drink mojitos, which it isn't. One sex scene is enough for a blockbuster, unless its a friggin porno. So yeah, this movie combines all the elements of an action flick, in the wrong way. They had the money to produce some killer special effects, great backdrops in scenes, and acting potential. It was the crappy music and constant attraction of ugly women that kept me yawning until I got home and thank god, found my bed to sleep in.

376,travis-detert,Oddly impressed with this movie,8,26 March 2010,"Considering what Hollywood has done with remakes in the last decade or so, I really had extremely low expectations of Miami Vice. I have watched this movie twice or three times since it came out, and I seriously really wonder why it received such low reviews. I generally don't think much of action movies, but I really imagine that Miami Vice provided a great insight into the world that is portrayed, at least from my perspective of an average white boy in America.It's character development is not entirely deep, but it's not at all shallow. Both Farrell and Fox delivered what I believe to be sincere performances of a deeper script than I would have ever imagined a remake of a TV show to possess.The storyline overall delivered what feels like an accurate depiction of what that world perhaps encompasses, and the tone of the movie matches what has to be a better depiction of the reality of the scenario than I've seen with a lot of B-class movies of the same genre.I could have done with a few less references to music genres of the time, but bringing 80's music into the picture would not have helped whatsoever. Overall, I think that if you are into movies with relatively sketchy characters operating in the underworld that is unimaginable to your current life, this movie will be greatly enjoyable. To imagine that a life outside oneself exists, and one that involves tons of poon, drugs, and organized crime; then you're in for a great ride. I recommend as a great passer of 2 hours.",Miami Vice

I personally like how well the caricatures have pulled of the rolls in this movie and was very pleased with the storyline as well as the cinematography in this movie. There was hardly any part in this movie that was dull and always kept my attention even in some of the slower cine's. I have watched this movie several times and I really liked the overall feel of how the movie was made and hope they will make a sequel to it down the road.

This MOVIE is chock full of Deep undercover flavor! My goodness, I saw LAYERS of quality film-making. To the viewer that is not accustom to this type of action, I say; go back and watch any of the Miami Vice episodes. It's all there. The weekend before Miami Vice opened in theaters, NBC had broadcast the pilot episode from 1984 sprinkled with Jamie Foxx, Colin Farrell and new movie clips in between. I believe that this was a brilliant idea. Why? To anyone that had never seen Miami Vice or the ""Michael Mann style"" of action, this was part education and part warning. I believe most ""television-to-movie-screen efforts"" SOMETIMES keep what we get shown as being not too smart on purpose. The story is made TOO explanatory because not everybody was a die-hard fan of the show. Hey. In the end, and even with the best ""TV to movie"" efforts, what we are shown can be perceived as one great big epic, episode anyway. Take ""X-Files: The Movie"" (1998) for example; or ESPECIALLY, ""Star Trek: Generations"" (1994).NOW. What I think was really brilliant about the pilot rebroadcast was made evident to me, in my opinion, because I love movies that can be complicated on more than one level. Michael Mann is warning you. The Miami Vice pilot IS the basic level of what to expect. He's showing what he sees TO YOU on more than one level. WHAT YOU SEE IS UP TO YOU, but you are gonna see Somethin'!!! Like Crockett says in the movie: ""No one has tread before where we are now."" This IS Mann's intent HERE as well as some of his past works.To those that don't know Michael Mann's works, be prepared for a texture of cinema that you may have NEVER seen before. To the ""Viceaholics"" and the ""Fans of Mann"", Tubbs DOES say it best: ""Smooth. That's how we do it.""",Miami Vice
379,case4christ,Not your everyday action movie.,6,5 August 2006,"This is Michael Mann. He doesn't sell Hollywood, he doesn't sell just explosions or violence. What he sells is REAL. What does this mean? Is there blood/explosions/cussing/sexuality? Of course. But there's also love, drama, heartbreak, and human characters. The violence is not at all that he's selling you. These things only occur to support what is happening in the lives of two undercover cops.Another thing that I love about Mann is that he does not DRAG OUT scenes of violence, either. Aside from the necessary climax of the film, the violence mostly consists of one shot to the head, and it is usually jolting and unexpected. The blood doesn't gush out for effect or anything. The people are simply dead, and that's all you need to know. It's real. The explosions are the same: when they do happen, they are concise, and we're on to the next scene. Mann doesn't need long suspense scenes or mind-numbing shoot-outs to make a film. He delivers what a viewer would expect from the real lives of two Miami Vice cops. Granted, it may not be exactly what would happen in real life, but what do I know (or most of us for that matter)? It beats all the junk that Hollywood is trying to feed us these days.Ultimately, it was simply refreshing to see an action movie that is different today. This isn't exactly ""Heat"" or ""The Usual Suspects"" but it's definitely worth a see if you like good, innovative FILM, but some Vin Diesel fans may not like it.",Miami Vice
380,tomouse23a,Well Below Expectations and Just Plain....Boring.,6,8 August 2006,"Let me start by saying that I loved Collateral, it's one of my favourite movies, I loved the visual style and the script and generally everything about it. So surely I would go into the next Michael Mann movie expecting something of a similar calibre. Unfortunately I was let down.The opening was good, no opening credits and in a nightclub, OK..maybe a little too much like Collateral; but I let it slide. Down, down, down it went.The opening scene was marginally entertaining but was followed with a barrage of uninteresting scenes that eventually played out into Crockett and Tubbs getting on with their mission....still BORING!What really astounds me about other reviews is that some feel that the lack of an engaging script was made up for by the good visual style but I always believe that script comes first and in this case it is thin and lacklustre.Sadly Farrell and Foxx's newest outing fails to impress and sadly shows that Mann's magic shown in Collateral and Heat is not always a sure thing.My advice: Watch Collateral or Heat instead for Mann's grittiest and best works, or even watch the original Miami Vice, just how Crockett and Tubbs should be!",Miami Vice
381,anarchyONtheSHORTbus,By the end of the movie I was $12 poorer and that much dumber,2,29 July 2006,"This will probably be the most unbiased comment on here. I had only seen a few of the old Miami Vice episodes and I felt that they were pretty good. So I'm not a hater or one of those fanatics that will say that it was absolutely wonderful when it wasn't. Me and a couple of buddies from work decided to get together and see a movie over the weekend. The majority wanted Miami Vice. I was skeptical at first. Few remake movies are ever as good as the original, and how good can a remake movie be when the main song in the advertisement is also a cover? That pretty much answered my question. In typical 1990-2000-ish fashion the movie starts out with a girl dancing provocatively in a night club. This basically foreshadows about 75% of the movie. Farrell and Foxx were horrible as Crockett and Tubbs. Not to mention Naomie Harris. Throughout most of the movie it was hard to tell if Crockett was from the South or from Ireland. And I'm quite sure the Latin community holds more respect for Taco Bell than Naomie's attempt at a Hispanic accent. Foxx's Tubbs was also over the top to the point where it was unbelievable. I'm starting to think that Jamie's skills are just over-hyped because one movie turned out to be a fluke. Yes, Ray is an awesome movie, but it seems as thought that's Jamie's limit. The action that you see in the trailer is just about all of the action you'll get. Out of 135 minutes you'll only get about 7 minutes of action. The plot was basic and didn't work for a movie that was over 2 hours long. It seemed as thought the writers and directors figured that having several sex scenes, three explosions, and two gun battles would be good enough to hold the audience. By the second sex scene a majority of the movie theater laughed out loud because it seemed like an unnecessary filler. I say wait to buy it as a secondhand DVD off of Ebay, but even that would be paying too much. Overall, 60% Sex+ 35% Plot + 5% Action= 100% Garbage.",Miami Vice
382,FreshOne10,"Original, Engaging, Intelligent Film!",9,17 August 2006,"After seeing a score of 6.1 for this movie I was hesitant to waste my money on it. I'm GLAD that I didn't go with popular opinion as I very much enjoyed it.If you go into the film expecting everything pretty and slick like it was in the TV series, with lots of babes, car chases, explosions, and gun fights you may be disappointed because it is not a duplicate of the TV show.Instead you get a film that is very well balanced (plot, action, drama, sensuality), with very good acting and that requires you to pay attention (THINK) all throughout the movie. (It seems some people gave a low score because they couldn't understand the film. But I much prefer that the producers, writers and directors did not dumb it down to the level of many action movies in the past few years. Triple X with Vin Diesel, for example.)The film stays true to elements of the TV show, while elevating things to a higher level. The storyline goes global and there are location shots in many places. The caution is that you aren't spoon-fed the unfolding plot, but it is not an obscure or warped plot. If you have a short attention span you may find the movie confusing, but just be patient or watch it twice.Someone complained of poor character development, but the characters of Tubbs, and Crocett are well developed and Isabella probably had the most character development. So it is there, even if you have to infer or derive things. Crockett and Tubbs have been very well updated (as characters) into the modern day. Do not think of this movie as happening in the same era as the 80s, when the clothing, mannerisms, building decorations etc were quite different.And the chemistry between Tubbs and Crockett is there... often you can see them having 'conversations' just by nodding at each other or staring at each other. And they have this cool implicit trust of one another.There is one thing I thought could have been tied up a bit better at the end of the movie. You'll know it when you see it. My only guess is that they have left some room for a sequel.This is a very good film that had me on the edge of my seat. Oh, there is also a very funny moment with Tubbs that made the entire cinema laugh. Overall, highly recommended.",Miami Vice
383,spaektor,"better than Collateral, not quite as good as Heat",8,31 July 2006,"(FYI I have yet to see ""Ali."") One of Mann's talents is that he really takes his time with characters; in Mann-land they are sharp, no-nonsense professionals at the peak of their game, whatever that may be... thief, journalist, dealer, cop. Their movements and speech are continual displays of precision and efficiency. Like Foxx's cab driver in Collateral giving his ETA's down to the minute, and DeNiro in Heat not wasting time with stupid speeches before dispatching his targets. This is, for me, part of the thrill in watching Mann's movies. He creates this hyper-reality that the average person only imagines or gleans from run-of-the-mill crime flicks, builds it with an eye towards authenticity and excruciating detail, and throws in protagonists that live in that world, relying on experience, know-how and balls. If you listen to what they say (which can be hard, 'cause Mann thankfully doesn't slow things down for anyone) and follow their trains of thought, you have to admire them because it dawns on you sooner or later that they are the best at what they do.All that said, I give this movie an 8 out of 10. The production value was fantastic. The cars, the boats, the planes, the weapons and sets, all top notch... what you'd expect for a $130 million movie. And that slow shot that pans up as you lazily cruise over a set of waterfalls, that was pretty breathtaking.The plot was a bit slow in the middle. There was one big hitch that didn't sit well with me, and that was Crockett and Isabella being so open with their fling. For God's sake, they're grinding on the floor of her husband's club? At first I thought it was part of some big scheme on Crockett's part, but it didn't go that route. Instead, they're caught dancing on camera and later outed, leading to her exile. It wasn't something two smart, savvy characters would've done. That was the only plot point I had an issue with. Well, that and Crockett suddenly producing a grenade in the meet and greet... did he pull that out of HIS ass or Tubbs'?! But moving on...there's a great payoff at the end. Anyone that got a kick out of the downtown LA gunbattle in Heat should be pretty happy with this finale. Good sound design, and great choreography.The casting was where this movie really faltered. Gong Li's Isabella was a disappointment. Her chemistry with Farrell's Crockett is almost non-existent. Part of it is his lack of presence... most of it was her delivery. She is supposedly an ice-cold businesswoman straddling the worlds of drugs and murder between Miami, Geneva, Havana and Columbia, but her enunciation of English and Spanish is horrible, and her discomfort when delivering lines is obvious. After being unable to convince myself she belonged in this story, I wondered what the point was for her character to be Chinese-Cuban (which is never explained, btw). Too bad, I would've liked to see an Asian actor with her talent outside the world of concubines, red lanterns and geishas. They should've spent more on a dialogue coach for her. Foxx was great, Harris was great, Rodriguez was sexy and badass to boot (man, that trailer park scene was outstanding). Farrell was just kinda there, needing a haircut and a tweeze job. But hey, Colin, Tigerland was good.I end it with thanks to John Ortiz, who plays Yero, the guy that has it out for our dynamic duo from Miami-Dade. Within a couple minutes, I realized he was the druggie with the itch in his undies from ""Narc,"" a part that made me laugh, feel sad, then laugh again. His performance here is subtle, authentic, menacing, and his screen presence is on par with, if not beyond, Foxx's. I really hope to see more of him in future films.",Miami Vice

As other people have pointed out hasn't Miami Vice been made into a movie before? Wasn't it was called Bad Boys, starring Will Smith. Story Wise the plots are almost identical. Both take place in Miami with two rogue cops going up against a drug cartel. Mann doesn't do much to differentiate it either. Like Bad Boys the plot and story line seem like an afterthought. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx play their roles mediocre at best. Farrell seems to have a hard time losing his accent and says lines like ""If they didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us"", as if he is reading them off a cue-card. The thick jowled Barry Shakaba Henley was almost comical trying to play Detective Castillo.The action sequences made up for it though. There are some moments of gun-play where you are on the edge of your seat, and the shoot-outs are some of the best action scenes I have seen in years.While not nearly as good as Mann's other crime films especially Heat or Collatoral, it is enjoyable if you are a Michael Mann or action movie fan.",Miami Vice

One thing that made the t.v. series good was the music and one thing that makes any movie better is a great soundtrack so it is a NO BRAINER that out of all the movies coming out this year Miami Vice should have the best soundtrack. But there was no real music in this movie. And I am still dumbfounded at this. Michael Mann should have put some real effort into a good sound track but didn't.Colin Farrell did an o.k. job as Sonny Crockett in at least there were times I got lost in his character and felt like I was watching Crockett. But Jamie Foxx as Ricardo Tubbs was a disaster. Granted I am biased as I think only Philip Michael Thomas can play Tubbs but still I at least expected something worthwhile in Foxxs rendition. Jamie Foxx was wrongly cast as Tubbs.But the real horror of this movie is there is no real chemistry between Farrell and Foxx as Crockett and Tubbs. That's one of the things that made the t.v. series awesome. Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas had a great chemistry on the set and you really felt they had each other's back as two vice cops and even as co-workers on the set. And that was missing in the movie. There were some attempts to bring some chemistry but it just was not there. I almost get the impression that Farrell and Foxx almost didn't like each other.What I did like was the on locations shots that reminded me a lot of the t.v. series. And I liked the story line and the classic Miami Vice angle on the sport car when Crockett and Tubbs are riding. Oh and the remake of Phil Collins song at the credits was nice. The movie was too dark and a little sunlight would have done us all a bit a good in that movie.And I would have really liked at the very end of the movie if there was a cameo shot of Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas just walking Ocean Blvd with the remake of Phil Collins song in the background. THAT would have been worth every penny that was spent to go see this movie. Sad they didn't honor the two men who actually MADE Miami Vice the hit it was.,Miami Vice
390,aek6000,A beautiful film,9,19 January 2007,I recently watched this film on demand. I was like many others who thought why make a Miami Vice film. It's a symbol of the 80's and what not.I saw the trailer and thought I might see it but after reading some of the reviews of the film I figured it must be lousy and I didn't see it. Two days ago I was very bored and decided to watch this film and I am glad I did.First of all if you're a fan of the original TV series mostly the first couple of seasons then you will love this film. The film has some spectacular and beautiful shots. It is one of the best films ever shot in terms of cinematography. The film itself is great it's well paced and the dialog is intriguing. The acting and the dynamic relationships are also very good. Colin Farrel does a very good job but I think him trying to hide his accent makes his presence some what strangled. Jamie Foxx was great he really pulled of Rico.After watching this film you really get the feel that this is an episode of the original series. I think that's one of the pluses to the film. Miami Vice is a modern and edgy realistic version of the campy television series and is something that I do recommend everyone to see.,Miami Vice
391,wdter,average cop movie,4,9 August 2006,"as i watched this i felt there was only one point where it ever captured the TV originals' spirit, I'm not talking fast boats or cars either. i would have expected a something extra from Mr Mann as he was so closely tied to the south-beach programme. it wasn't a case of particularly the wrong actors as their performances were all acceptable, it just felt as though it were a different franchise to the one i remember. as though it were a generic undercover cop movie plot set in Miami so they tagged the vice bit on to help boost its exposure. after Mr Mann's' deamonisation of silver suits, stubble and eighties style, with tom cruise in the excellent collateral, i really expected more.",Miami Vice

393,MichelleDeblinger,Entertaining Film but Characters Lack Chemistry,7,30 July 2006,"Two cool Miami detective in two-piece suits and shadesfast speed boats on Biscayne Bay, private jets, helicopters, a Ferrariguns, drugs, dealers and posh night clubs.welcome back Miami Vice! I've read reviews of Michael Mann's new Miami Vice movie comparing it to Miami Vice the TV series, which state that other than Crockett and Tubbs' names and skin color, there are no similarities. I beg to differ. Most noted in reviews is the absence of the pastel colors the TV series made trendy in the mid-1980s. Truth is pastels, disappeared off the show after the second season and were replaced with darker colors for the remaining three seasons it aired.Before going to see Miami Vice opening weekend, I pulled out my home-recorded video tape of the final episode of the TV series, which aired in 1989 as a two-hour made for TV movie. There was not a pastel color to be seen. In both movies, Crockett and Tubbs went undercover as drug dealers to try to get their man. The main elements in both are similar enough that there should be no question that the new Miami Vice follows the same storytelling as the TV series did.Despite the movie's genre being Action & Adventure, it plays out more like a Drama. This could be disappointing to movie-goers looking for a movie with non-stop action. The Drama versus Action in Miami Vice is more like that of ""Munich"", than it is of a movie like ""Bad Boys"".I'm a Miami resident and a Miami Vice fan from the days the TV series aired, so I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't excellent. Even though the TV series episodes weren't either, character development in the TV show surpassed that of the movie. Don Johnson did for Miami Vice what Johnny Depp did for Pirates of the Caribbean and I think his shoes were hard to fill. Colin Farrell had none of the cockiness I loved in Johnson's character, and with his baby-face, he appeared young to be playing the veteran, often burned-out Vice detective. Jamie Fox, didn't have the charm Philip Michael Thomas brought to Ricco Tubb's character. Foxx appeared too serious, whereas Hoffman often laughed and joked-around with his partner in private. Farrell and Foxx's characters were one-dimensional. The on-screen chemistry between Johnson and Thomas' Crockett and Tubbs just wasn't there between Farrell and Foxx. Never mind the absence of pastels, who cares, it's the chemistry between the detectives that the movie lacked most. And taking into consideration that Don Johnson got top billing in the TV series, and Crockett is allegedly the main character, I found the ending credits somewhat condescending when Jamie Foxx's name appeared before Colin Ferrell's. Granted Foxx won an Academy Award and Farrell hasn't (yet), but they are both superstars, both very talented actors and both deserved equal billing.If you loved Miami Vice in the old days, you'll enjoy the movie. If you never saw the Miami Vice TV series, the movie might not be what you are expecting, but you'll probably still enjoy it.",Miami Vice
394,themadmullah,One Of The Best Movies This Year...,8,25 August 2006,"Michael Mann films are those rare things a movie that you can actually look forward to and not be disappointed once you have watched it. And Miami Vice is no different. A superlative film from start to finish, Vice serves up a stone cold thriller (even if it was marketed as a action movie).Farrell and Fox sparkle off each other, with the former putting in a career best performance as Sonny.Okay so at times the plot is a bit wayward, and I was disappointed that the action sold to us in the trailer accounted for less than 5 mins of a very long 2 ½ hour screen time but what Mann does here is present an adult themed thriller, so beautiful in it's high def richness (a format that Mann more than anyone else has taken to heart and excelled with), so well acted but never quite reaching the brilliance that was promised.",Miami Vice
395,themcquade,A difficult but ultimately exhilarating piece of cinema,9,9 August 2006,"There is almost a documentary quality to this movie. Aside from one short sequence the film almost exclusively focuses on the characters at work. In essence the film is about two groups of exceptionally competent professionals- one set cops, one drug dealers - at work. And their work is a cat and mouse conflict between the two. There are almost no exposition or explanatory scenes. Similarly the film makes no concessions to the viewers in terms of the use professional jargon and language. The viewer is thrown in at the deep end, as in many documentaries, and has to work out for themselves what is going on.In other words the film treats its viewers as intelligent people and challenges them to understand. If you are prepared to accept the film on these terms then it is quite a stunning experience - beautifully shot, well acted, with some exceptional and realistic action sequences - by one of the finest directors alive.This film is several leagues ahead of the brainless pulp that often passes for thrillers or action movies. Outstanding.",Miami Vice
396,SylviaNorth,"Stylish, subtle and beautiful",9,2 September 2006,"Like all his films Mann has made Miami Vice a visual feast. But it's not all style and no substance. The plot is well paced and hints towards characters thoughts rather than painting their emotions on the screen. Farrell and Fox play well together and communicate an understanding without the need for lines and lines of dialogue between them. With Miami Vice, it seems less is more. The camera work is as good as I have seen with perspectives changing fluidly giving the viewer an insight into the subtler points of plot and emotion. It may only be cops and robbers but Mann, as we know, can turn a cup of coffee into an opera!",Miami Vice
397,jordanmono,Mann does it again! Superb!,7,28 July 2006,"Michael Mann does it again with Miami Vice. It's a jaw-dropping, gorgeous production as we've come to expect from Mann in the past with Thief, Heat, The Insider, etc. His direction is unbelievably beautiful and unique to Hollywood. If only he could work with a musical supervisor to pick some good songs or just go with a score! I'm tired of Audioslave ballads (he used them with Collateral too) and the crap cover of ""In the Air Tonight."" A simple score would certainly do. Nonetheless, Miami Vice was superb. The acting was fantastic from Colin Farrell on down. The plot was great as well. I can't say enough good things about this film. I have actually never seen the original series but went because Mann remains my favorite director. Do not miss this if you're a fan of action or a good crime drama. It should suffice for any movie lover.",Miami Vice
398,justiceforall,Mann turns in another great 'un...,9,9 August 2006,"I have to say, despite all the negative comments appearing on this page, ""Miami Vice"" did not disappoint; in fact, I have to say it's my favourite movie of the year so far. Although it starts off a little slowly, and took me around 20 minutes to get in to, after that the film picks up and from then on it's classic Mann. I'm a huge fan of his, and always look forward to his 'crime genre' films (""Heat"", by the way, is always top of my favourite films list). There are only two problems I can think of: firstly, no one is given enough to do apart from Colin Farrell, which leads to some actors being wasted, especially Jamie Foxx; and secondly, the annoying camera-work. Somewhere between ""Heat"" and ""The Insider"" Mann came down with a bad case of 'shakey-camera' syndrome, and from then on the damn thing wobbles all over the place, as though the DP was really drunk whilst filming. I find all the shaking a bit distracting, but it's a fairly small complaint. Everything else was perfect, and I'd highly recommend a trip out to see this film.",Miami Vice
399,kimchimofo,I guess people love to complain...,8,31 July 2006,"Instead of focusing on the negative aspects of this movie, I'd like to see people talk about some things that worked.For me, here are a few of these things: So many movies lately have been over-computerized to the point of folly that it's nice to see something that looks more ""realistic"". In my opinion the technology should only be present if it helps the plot along and builds a world that the characters can live in that then becomes transparent to the audience. Though technology was used extensively to make this film, it never really stands in the way of putting me right in the scene with the characters. In fact, I think Mann breaks some ground in this area by using COPS-style shooting rather than something more precise.I thought the sprawling landscape shots helped the film along rather than hurt it. It expands the world the characters live in, and gives the viewer a sense of the exotic. Besides, they were shot so beautifully too. How about the scene where they're heading off to Cuba? Remarkable! Even though the soundtrack was just OK, I feel it fit the movie pretty well. It's not like the old days though where every song captured some epic moment of the plot. I remember all the pop-songs that were launched from the original series ... But, I was surprised at how spare the soundtrack actually was. I thought it kind of completed the motif of the movie, which was exposed, raw, nude, bare.And hats off to the actors in this film for letting Mann shoot them in such an exposed manner ... it didn't cover anything up. It was very brave.The romance ... Well maybe it seemed a bit tedious having so much time spent building the romantic elements, but to their credit they were all so intimate. There's a scene where Farrell's and Li's character are in the shower and the camera focuses on the back of Li's neck with a green background. It feels more like a memory than a shot.I think the emotion in this film is strong, and much was done to capture it remarkably on film. Especially in the action scenes ... it's a good sign when the shootouts are as engaging as your favorite first person shooter and you can feel the bullets striking metal all around you. Only Mann could deliver that.Maybe I'll write about the weaker points sometime. If I had to name one thing though, where did the corniness go? Mr. Mann ... go back and watch the pilot episode. ...the cheesy slow mo sequences and music video like themes, and what about those lovely freeze-frames. And who can forget the first time Tubbs meets Elvis?",Miami Vice
400,olivet,Wish I hadn't gone to the cinema,6,7 August 2006,"The litmus test for me when seeing a movie is whether I am still thinking about it (or at least moments from it) the next morning. With Miami Vice the result was a resounding zero, zippo, nada, nichts. Watched and forgotten in a flash. That's how mediocrity is spelt.Because this is Michael Mann, who even at his worst is still a masterful craftsman, the movie isn't a total disaster. If what you see on screen was displayed as a series of photographs in a gallery, you would be pretty pleased. Sadly though, a film requires more and when it comes to plot, story, script, acting, well let's just say I really regret the time, money and effort that I spent going to see this in the cinema. I so wish I had waited and put this in my rental queue. It still wouldn't be a good movie, but I'd be less annoyed.Plotwise the film is quite straightforward, not in the slightest bit clever and even a bit boring. Story  what story? It all feels very much, been here already, seen that, done that. Without wanting to give anything away, particularly the story lines between the two main characters and their female partners is very same old, same old.In all fairness, I may have gone into this with the wrong expectations. Maybe Mann is trying to keep it all particularly low key, matter of fact, kind of downbeat to show the basic mundanity of crime. If that's the case, it worked. But not in a good way. Normally it takes a few minutes when you sit in the cinema to start really concentrating and get into a movie. Here, I was still fidgeting in my seat about halfway through the picture. Somehow I just could get into the darn thing.On the plus side, there were a few moments when my heart really lifted and beautiful stuff happened on the screen. Those moments were far and few between though.As a side note, I wasn't impressed by the hand-held camera work they used in some parts, it's great on a TV series like The Shield, but up there on the big screen it kind of feels amateurish and inappropriate. (Feel free to totally disagree with me on this one.) Talking about dodgy, I am not American, but quite a few of the accents sounded distinctly off to me. On top of that, I sometimes had difficulty understanding what Gong Li was saying, but this may well be due to sound quality issues.Overall, because I love Mann's previous movies, I trotted into the cinema with high expectations. Way too high as it turns out. With all the money and talent spent on this, it should have been so much better.Judging from the ratings here, this is one of those 'love it or hate it' movies. I didn't either. I just thought it was very mediocre, forgettable and way off Mann's best work.",Miami Vice
401,junky_stuff69,Why Toss Out Plot & Characterization with the Pastels???,7,28 July 2006,"I'll preface with two facts: 1) I was a HUGE fan of the 1984-1989 TV series (have collected all the music from the series & put them into play lists in the order they originally ran in each episode) and 2) I know a couple of people in Michael Mann's office who gave me a heads-up on the script before this film even began shooting. That said, I knew NOT to expect a clone of the show and was told to expect a film more along the lines of ""Heat"" or ""Collateral"". For me, that was fine, because both films are brilliant. I ended up disappointed with this new ""Miami Vice"", because it did not live up to Michael Mann's other master works. The film gets going right from the start, but feels like we missed something - like, say, the first fifteen minutes or so, any kind of establishing of the characters or premise. For the first half hour, I had no idea who was who or why they were doing the things they did. And the film never stopped to catch anyone up in that respect, a major flaw. There is finally a scene toward the end of the first act where the major cop characters are making a deal with an informant and I was able to figure out, ""Oh, that must be Zito. He must be Zwietek, etc., etc."" and had I not been so familiar with the show, I may never have figured that out. Likewise, the entire film goes through its loud, flashy sequences without telling us anything about who Crockett and Tubbs are. Mann created such great, deep characters in all of his other films, I can't understand how he missed the go-fast boat here. Anyone who can make two men riding all night in cab thrilling should have known to give the audience some idea of who these people are. It is possible he was counting on people's knowledge of the show to fill in these blanks, but that is unfair when the whole concept of this film was a complete re imagining of the premise. These are not the 1980's Crockett & Tubbs, as an audience, we need to meet them all over again to understand them.Beyond those serious flaws, the film has moments of sheer brilliance. Some of the action sequences are jaw-dropping. The cinematography, especially for high-definition video, is breath-taking and surely deserves at least an Oscar nomination. The sound, however, should just be handed the Oscar now, as I can't think of any film since ""Heat"" that created such a masterpiece of sound effects & editing. I also thought the gritty realism of the film was a terrific choice, because what made the first two seasons of the television show so emotional was the exploration of the dark side & consequences of a life in the drug underworld. Unfortunately, Mann forgot that the appeal of those early episodes was the juxtaposition of that darkness against the flashy, cool world of money, blow and hookers. The thin line the characters always walked was drawn by the dichotomy of enjoying living life in the fast lane while facing the constant tragic reminders of the reality of that world. In this film, Mann gives us the dark side, without explaining why the characters put themselves out there or why it would be appealing enough for them to lose themselves undercover.Final note, for a Michael Mann film, the soundtrack is just poor, falling short of any memorable songs or sequences where the movie and music moved together like art. The score fared better, even striking some moments of Jan Hammer-ness.Overall, ""Miami Vice"" is worth seeing, but is surprisingly more of a letdown compared to Mann's other works than it is a letdown to fans of the show.",Miami Vice
402,captainamazo,Miami Vice is the worst film ever made by humans.,1,2 August 2006,"I am entirely serious about this title. I have never seen a movie that is so profoundly awful. To be frank, it's simply horribly made. First of all, Michael Mann apparently has become the first director to film a movie entirely in close-ups. And he also thinks that transitional shots are a waste in this day and age, as scenes jump back and forth with no explanation. Character development (even character DEFINITION) is totally absent. There are many other faults; The dialog is almost exclusively in police jargon, the sex scenes are awkward and confusing, and at one point, the female lead admonishes Crockett by saying, ""Your ideas are too big for your skin"". What does that even mean? TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN, Miami VICE! I want an apology for this movie.",Miami Vice

Directed by Michael Mann the guy who brought us MV the TV show. He does everything humanly possible to distance this movie from the original TV show. But in reality, we are going to see it because we remember the show! Mann, you gots to know your audience bro. So, old time MV fans will be disappointed and non-MV people will just be bored.Also, I saw this in Korea and the film didn't contain opening credits of any kind! Maybe to pay tribute to the origina but not giving it a go????Sadly, movies like these are the same as drama TV shows (detective shows) except these movies have bigger name actors. Wait to see any other detective drama on TV instead of seeing this crap.",Miami Vice
404,maxwellsmart,Solid but underwhelming,7,29 July 2006,"Due to Michael Mann's track record it was hard to go into this movie without very high expectations. After all, we are talking about the creator of arguably the greatest crime drama/thriller ever made with ""Heat"", as well as the highly entertaining ""Collateral"". But ""Miami Vice"" fails to live up to Mann's past success in the crime genre.The plot is completely ordinary and doesn't offer up any unexpected twists and turns along the way. Because of this, the movie lacks intensity through much of the first and second acts, when everything that's happening is completely predictable. However, pedestrian plot aside, the biggest disappointment was the manner in which the characters were developed. Both ""Collateral"" and ""Heat"" were notable for the way in which they delved deep into the psyche of the central characters, providing compelling personal drama to go along with the heists, hits and gunplay. But in ""Miami Vice"", we never really get to know the characters or their motivations beyond the surface level. And to make matters worse, Foxx and Farrell never develop the kind of rapport that's necessary to make a movie like this work on a high level. Compare Foxx and Farrell to Johnson and Thomas, or Gibson and Glover, and you'll see what I mean. Even though the ""Miami Vice"" movie aspires to be darker and grittier than ""Lethal Weapon"", which it is, it fails to be as dramatic because we never really come to care about the characters all that much. While there was clearly a conscious decision to downplay the ""buddy"" elements of the movie, the result is that Crockett and Tubbs seem so disconnected from each other on a personal level that it's hard to buy that they would die for each other, which we are expected to believe. The only relationship that is at all convincing or fleshed out is between Crockett and Isabella. The rest seem decidedly distant and undercooked.What saves the film from being a bust is the visual splendor and great action sets. Mann once again proves that when it comes to creating a gritty atmosphere and staging shootouts, he's among the best in the business. When it comes to style, visuals, and atmosphere, ""Miami Vice"" is top notch.In the end perhaps what hurt this movie most was studio deadlines and delays while shooting. It's been widely reported that Michael Mann had to feverishly edit this film just to get it into theaters on time, and in many ways that shows. There are multiple loose ends that are never tied up or explained, and several plot threads seem underdeveloped. I'm sure some day we will see a director's cut which approaches the 3 hour mark just like ""Heat"", and perhaps that version will overcome of the issues involving character development and plot holes in the theatrical version. Until then, ""Miami Vice"" is a movie that, while far from being a total failure, is none-the-less disappointing in that it had the potential to be a much more complete film than it is.",Miami Vice

Though not the worst movie I've ever seen, it will take a week or two for the experience of ""Miami Vice"" to wear off. First, who would WANT to make a remake of a lousy and preposterous TV show in the first place? What's next, a remake of the Dukes of Hazard? Wait a second.... OK, if you insist on recycling old bad ideas at least write a screen play that has some character development outside the bedroom (and shower). Or that at least has credible dialogue or an actual plot. Or at least hire a credible cast (Li Gong as a Cuban....COME ON, what are you smoking!?). And guys, since when do VICE cops get involved in international narcotics and arms smuggling? Doesn't VICE usually focus on busting streetwalkers?

408,LinkfxTBP,"Visually lush, superbly acted, Neo-world noir.",10,9 May 2008,"I'm just going to start off by saying I love Michael Mann's films. No romantic image has struck me more than Robert DeNiro making out with Amy Brennaman in front of a hot Los Angeles skyline in a red night. The music, the acting, the visual, in Michael Mann films, these things perfectly coalesce to create a bluesy dream world of passions, hate, violence and life. Miami Vice is different, it exists in a different world. It's a world where people communicate in hushed whispers carried with veiled threats, where the ocean is a void within which to try and escape yourself, where life is fast and hard and has no room for slacking. It's romantic and cynical and gritty. Crockett is mean and extremely rough around the edges and his character is pretty exemplary of this world, where people die by bullets and he knows it. Colin Farrell is masterful as is Jamie Foxx. Everyone attached to this film has fully embodied this unique world of crime and punishment, becoming different people. It isn't a film really attached to it's origins, it's not the slickly packaged 80's pop cop drama. This is a mean movie with wonderful action scenes and great concerted dialog. Where Collateral had several failings in it's screenplay becoming to unrealistic, this film surprises with people who talk like the walk and vice-versa. Gong Li deserves very special recognition for her role in this film. I loved the character and her background and all the layers that went with that. She is hardened to the world and to other people, like Farrell's character, and sees ways out but knows deep down the world outside is not for her. Every character in this film is really deep down very sad and I think that bit of pathos adds a realistic depth. Who would REALLY want to put themselves in this situation? None of these people, having seen where they've ended up, would I believe have become the person they are now. An ocean full of lonely people wanting in many ways, to die.",Miami Vice

I know the director was trying to make the film look more like reality the way it was shot, but I don't think it works. I was too distracted at how cheap the image on the screen looked. At first I thought Collin Farrel was perfect for this movie, but after seeing it I totally changed my mind, and that goes for the Asian actress as well. Besides there is no chemistry between the two. A beautiful Latin women would have been more believable, being tied to a Columbian drug lord. What bothered me the most is there are no elements of the Miami Vice TV series, Mr. Mann should have listen to Jammie Fox when he said, hay lets do a movie version of the ""original Miami Vice"". All I can say to that is, don't try to fix it if it isn't broke. Sure 20 years has past, and styles have changed, but Miami is still beautiful, sexy, and hot. What happened to that in this film? That's what made Miami Vice such a hit TV classic, that's what people want to see. Not a muddy looking cop drama weak story, that only has the name of the original series.",Miami Vice

Watch the movie Bad Boys on video instead and give this movie a pass.

Heat is definitely in my top 20,Last of the Mohicans was exceptional, and the rest of his films are at least worth a watch. Miami Vice had fast cars,fast boats, faster women, and stylish clothes, but sadly that does not make a good film. I was a rather large fan of the TV show, but did not expect a rehash of the TV show with this film. From the day I saw the first trailer I thought Michael Mann had achieved something few others have, a great remake. I saw the film today and realized how wrong I was. The acting was decent and the dialogue while sketchy was more attune to things you'd really hear people say, but the plot,the camera work, and general conveyance of the story was poor. I could see why some people would enjoy the movie, but for me it was not a bad re-telling of Miami Vice, it was just a bad film even as a stand alone.

Sadly however, apart from that and Jamie Foxx's cool haircut, there's very little to praise about this film.So what's wrong with it? It's slow, there's no characterisation, no storyline to speak of and the acting is wooden. People drift around like they are sleepwalking. The cast give the impression that they don't really care and it's difficult to believe that the characters are real people. One reviewer rated it a triumph of style over substance and that's probably fairly close to the mark. It's hard to believe that 'Last of the Mohicans' or 'Heat' are by the same director.",Miami Vice
413,mailingmaster,A letdown,5,27 April 2007,"The original Miami Vice was an exiting mixture of great music, fashion and style with two great actors and amazing synergy between them. Now, Michael Mann has made a movie that lets you down in many ways. For the Miami Vice fans it's nothing but a huge disappointment: nothing of the original Miami Vice spirit is preserved. Sonny looks confused and sometimes even lost. The original Sonny was cool, raw and stylish. He was also a bohemian and was sometimes sad and depressed, but never lost. Farrell's acting is typical B class and there's no synergy between the two main actors. As for the music, fashion and style  forget about it. The new Miami Vice is dark, more vice than Miami. Conclusion: Miami Vice promises without delivering. My question is who is it for? The youth of today will find a lot better action movies, while the old fans won't find them self in this one. The original director is after all not enough to recreate the spirit of the original Miami Vice. (5 out of 10)",Miami Vice

This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen movies like House of the Dead and even worse House of the Dead 2. I have no idea how this movie got released because I would think Jamie Foxx or Colin Farrell after seeing footage would have said wow this is really bad. The plot is non-existent, the camera work reminds me of The Blair Witch Project, the dialog is pretty sorry and the soundtrack changes without warning, making absolutely no sense. Plus there are these looooong ""romantic"" scenes, i put romantic in quotations because they aren't really romantic I just have no other word for them, anyway the scenes don't belong and have nothing to do with the movie. This movie is getting bad reviews for a reason, save your money and don't even waste money on this thing when it comes out on DVD.

415,jakelamotta06,"""Miami Vice"" 2006",7,25 July 2006,"Michael Mann's 2006 cinematic update of the 80s-television show ""Miami Vice"" is gritty, violent, and nothing like the television show it is updating. Opening the movie during an undercover operation, we are introduced to the new Sonny Crockett and Rico Tubbs. We, the audience, are also introduced to the high-risk crime world these characters are a part of. Mann's picture is very detailed and seems to be more interested in being an undercover police procedural. That is until love connections of the two main characters are developed, trying to make these two characters more human and identifiable (and, in an all-too-calculated fashion make the high-risk world riskier). After the long-winded and uneven set-up arrives the movie's action set pieces, Mann's directoral specialty. But, what makes ""Miami Vice"" entertaining are its remarkable and impressive visuals. Michael Mann and cinematographer Dion Beebe, again, use the HD-digital camera and create a visual feast for the eyes (Some images making the movie seem better than it actually is). The beauty of exotic locales, a plane in flight, a boat traveling in the water, even the characters on top of building among the city's skyline are all gorgeously shot. Ultimately, it all adds up to an okay movie. Not close to the greatness Mann achieved in ""Heat"" or ""Collateral"". But, let's just say, its what ""Bad Boys 2"" (not a Mann picture) should have aspired to be.",Miami Vice
416,seer496,Miami Lice,2,1 August 2006,"This vermin is way too long. I'm sure someone thought that if one minute of scene footage was good, why not stretch it to seven minutes. And it might have been good at one minute, but it's deadly at seven minutes, but with the special bonus of not being engaging. So the word ""editing"" comes to mind. The story is hard to follow, but who cares. No one feels for the characters and they never arc, just like TV. But this is supposed to be a big summer blockbuster. It's more like an ""seat buster"" from sitting for so long without any real payoff. Instead it's a lot of yammering with flat action sequences, what there is of it. The character relationship was forced. And there is a scene that smacked of ""plot confidence playhouse"". Meaning in reality characters would never act like,but they do so an event will take place. In the sequence is extremely forced and it's obvious what will happen next. What followed was so trite, I was laughing during the somber parts. I was angry I guttered away 2 and 1/2 hours watching it. It's definitely not another ""Collateral"". I'd highly recommend missing this thing at all costs, unless you want to study how not to edit a film!",Miami Vice

418,aidonvito,Such a disappointing movie.,6,27 August 2006,"Overall I didn't like this movie, but I am a big fan of Michael Mann's films.This movie had such great potential, but in the end, it was too long (the editor needed to be more ruthless) and had very little substance. I cannot argue with the shooting of the film, the sets and visuals were superb. The soundtrack was good, but the big disappointment was the middle of the movie.A story needs a beginning, a middle and an end!. It seemed that after an initial good 20 minutes, the remainder of the movie, just ambled along with no real sense of purpose. The beginning and end were OK, but the middle was a mess.I have seen the movie twice, just to give it a second chance, but to no avail.The two leads (Farrell and Fox) just don't gel. I think both are very talented actors, but it seemed like they had met a day before shooting the movie began. They just did not create the impression, that they were a partnership on screen. Too many of the scenes feature Crockett, Tubbs and various other individuals. There should have been more scenes with only Crockett and Tubbs.More effort should have gone into developing the reasons, why crockett and tubbs were such a great team. The audience is just expected to assume that they are a great partnership, with little or no background.I am a fan of the 80's TV show, but knew it was an updated version, rather than a remake, but the story was still lacking.As I stated earlier, for visuals and soundtrack, you won't be disappointed, Mann has again scored on that front.The problem lies with the development of the story, after the first 20 mins. An informant commits suicide and this then opens up the main purpose of the film. Crockett and Tubbs are to infiltrate a drug smuggling ring and take down all the major players.All of a sudden, Tubbs is a qualified pilot, Crockett is adept at handling a speedboat and any action decides to take time out. The whole middle sequence of the film, rambles from Crocketts love interest to lots of dialogue about drug deals (at which point subtitles would have been nice!! the speech is too quick from all the actors and even with the great sound of a movie theatre, it is hard to understand what has just been said) Some action would have been nice, just to change the pace, but the whole middle section becomes quite boring.The last half hour does up the tempo, but by this time, its too little, too late, as you are treated to a couple of action sequences. Compared to Mann's previous movies, these sequences, seem like they were filmed in five minutes and not given much thought to.As I said, I am a big fan of Michael Mann movies, I saw it TWICE to give it a fair chance, but overall, this is not a good movie. I hope his next movie improves on this one!",Miami Vice
419,redskindav,Michael Mann's Flare Is Not Bright Enough,7,13 July 2009,"Miami Vice is one of the slickest and glossy films that I have seen. Colin Farrell and Jaime Fox playing after the title characters for the TV series are centered around a drug bust. Through this drug bust Colin Farrell falls in love with Drug Dealer's mistress, Jaime Fox's girlfriend gets kidnapped and now both the characters are on a quest for reconciliation to their dilemmas. One may seem that this is a typical formula action movie but it has the opposite effect. This mainly by the way the characters Colin Farrell and Jaime Fox are exhibited. They are both exhibited as empty shells of people. Throughout the movie they seem not to have a way of showing emotion. One example is the when Colin is in Cuba with Li Gong, Drug Dealer's mistress, Colin Farrell seems to have some kind of emotions but seems to hold back from displaying them. Both of the title characters seem to be drones in a technocratic world just doing there jobs and going home after a long days work. The ending of the film is the most puzzling sequence in that Colin Farrell rejects happiness and love to go back to his emotionally non existent world. I thought Jaime Fox's character the worst especially when he is in the hospital hoping for his girlfriend to wake up. One more point is that the film does drag especially in the middle of it with the Li Gong scenes. Overall this film has the style, it has the flash, and it has the glamor but with all that style, flash, and glamor it does not bedazzle me and most of the other people who saw this film.

420,ClydeBickle,Aesthetically pleasing crime drama,10,5 February 2007,"I usually don't leave comments here, due to the high troll population, but I feel so strongly about this film that I'll chance it. Michael Mann has crafted a beautiful, subtle, and poignant crime drama that is superior to your average action flick. Colin Farrell is wonderful as an undercover cop who falls for the opposition, and Jamie Foxx is rock solid as his partner. This film has been criticized for having shallow characters, mostly from people who are used to typical character development arcs in movies. The characters in Miami Vice don't develop in the traditional sense, that luxury is not afforded to them. These are men who do not live their own lives, but as undercover police officers they are like poker players, hiding their cards and waiting. Like his previous work, Michael Mann's film is gorgeous. More than any other director, he knows how to film a city to make it feel alive. Even the ocean looks more impressive than usual. Whether he is showing us a nightclub or a shipyard, the visuals are stunning. The film is not for everyone, not by a long shot. It upsets me to read posts like 'this film sucks', but it upsets me more to see the movies fans retort with 'you are just too retarded to appreciate it' or some such nonsense. This is not your typical action flick, and the fact that something like this was made with big stars and received a wide release is impressive, and I can understand why people are so divided on this movie. I will say it again, THIS FILM IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. And if you don't see what I see that doesn't mean you're stupid, it just means its not your cup of tea. I do, however, strongly encourage everyone who has not seen this film to give it a chance, even if everyone you know has panned it. Who knows? You may love it as much as I do. And for all you haters out there, I think you should give it a second viewing, maybe you'll appreciate it more this time around.",Miami Vice

Granted the action scenes were very well done, the story was a jumbled pile of crap. Your interest cannot be kept because you don't know what the hell is going on half the time. There is no depth to the characters, you don't know what, why, or who they are doing, and the scenes jump around with no explanation in between.

423,Barry_Delaney,"Mann is back, and as cool as ever...",9,14 August 2006,"If you are a fan of collateral, a film which totally changed Tom Cruises character persona on screen, or Heat, one of the best films i have ever seen (though how can you go wrong, teaming up Pacino and De Niro), then get ready for another thrilling and slick ride from Director and Writer Michael Mann. He turns what could very easily have become another generic drug, action movie into a smooth, realistic and coolly shot piece of work.A team of undercover cops are killed by a very sophisticated gang of drug dealers after information was leaked about their identity. Sonny (Colin Farrell) and Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are brought in to infiltrate the gang and find out who the cops killers are and how they came to know they were undercover. When they manage to get in business with the gang by posing as transporters for the gangs product, they realise that they are dealing with one of the biggest drug distributors in the world and plan to bring down the guy who controls the shipments and transport of the drugs: José Yero (John Ortiz), who is the middle man for the drug gangs leader Arcángel de Jesús Montoya (Luis Tosar). Sonny gets involved with Montoya's woman, which makes José believe she is not being totally honest to Montoya about their new American business partners. What follows is betrayal, love and a climactic ending that builds throughout the entire film and is well worth the anticipation.Some have said the script is confusing because of the ""street"" talk used, but it just adds the the authenticity of the movie. Manns cinematography gives an aura that there is danger everywhere for the two detectives and how they must keep their cool to avoid blowing their cover. Farrell and Foxx pull this off effortlessly. This is a serious film, there's no buddy quips or funny situations, just an extremely cool outing. enjoy.",Miami Vice
424,rdnk,"Fans of the original TV-series, brace yourselves",9,5 October 2007,"Miami Vice is perhaps the best picture of this summer 2006. That ain't saying much yet, though, but I liked it. It had the action, style and sounds I've learned to expect and respect from Michael Mann's movies. Compared to his previous works however, this does not quite reach the same level. But I'll concentrate here comparing the movie to the original TV series.The first time I saw the trailer, I wondered why on earth Linkin Park was chosen on the soundtrack. Then I learned Miami Vice was a modern version of the original classic TV series, so music should have a modern sound on it, too. That's understandable. Yet I also understand the people that say Miami Vice the movie has abandoned it's roots. People who loved the original series, listened to it's wonderful soundtrack of 80's classics, must feel a bit betrayed by the total remake.Collin Farrell and Jamie Foxx we're probably OK choices for their roles, but they seemed to lack the chemistry. They were just couple of dudes hanging together, and the friendship and respect Stubs and Ricardo had between each other in the TV-series was pretty absent. Most of the limelight was given to Farrell, and Foxx didn't have much space to operate. The other characters felt a bit shallow, too. Gong Li, who played the female lead, didn't quite make it either, I would've chosen someone with real Latin looks and accent for the part.I really respect Michael Mann for his films' strong visuals. The backgrounds, scenes, angles are totally incredible and in this film set the mood of the whole film for a Latin, sunbathing atmosphere. I especially loved the wide angle shots of Caribbean Ocean, those made me feel like I was really there, looking at the sea. The camera work was also good, especially during the last action scene. Btw, remember the bank scene from Heat? Last shootout is one for you who love (semi-)realistic gun fights.The plot was a bit downer, it was quite complicated and didn't have the same continuity as his previous masterpieces, for example Collateral and Heat had. Also it required quite a bit from the viewer, and perhaps this is one reason why many didn't like it, the dialogue wasn't the easiest to follow.I have never liked the Bruckheimer/Bay style of extremely fast packed bubblegum action films. Michael Mann does it with gritty and raw, yet deep and realistic view of portraying crime. For those who are projecting their expectations from the original TV-series into this film, you might be better advised to be open minded with this one.",Miami Vice

It was well shot and had a style which I loved. The visuals were fantastic. The characters were convincing and likable, with strong performances from both leads. The only down side was the lack of emotion. Even in opportune moments the film didn't give time to see the feelings of the characters. There wasn't enough depth there. It seemed almost in too much of a rush to get on with the story.I will certainly buy the DVD, and hope for a sequel as there is so much more to be told. Please Universal, make another.",Miami Vice

I don't know what Michael Mann thought when he was writing the plot. But I haven't really had the feeling of Miami Vice. The names (Ricardo Tubbs & James 'Sonny' Crockett) of the characters are the same but there ends it. For what I know of the TV-show is that Sonny lives on a boat in the Keys with his pet Elvis. In the movie he has a Ferrari and a house that is way to big for a cop earnings. When I saw it I had more a feeling I was watching Bad Boys 3 (Bad Boys I & II staring: Martin Lawrence & Will Smith) than Miami Vice, the movie.It's a cop movie like so many more.

It certainly had some flashes of the original series and was certainly dark in tone. Overall very enjoyable. It sagged it bit in the middle - especially the rather pointless ""boat ride to havana"" segment - once you have seen it you will know what I mean. Don't be expecting wall to wall action. There is some gunplay and when it comes it is very good. With Mann being so good at action set pieces I thought he would have made more of his skills.

So much so that I am amazed that I actually made it to the end. There was nothing there to maintain my interest. Colin Farrell was totally wooden, as was Jamie Foxx. The settings were beautiful, but every internal scene seemed to have been filmed in semi-darkness.At least the actors didn't fall into that awful American habit of inserting what sounds like 'full stop' every 3 or 3 words, but dialogue was still slurred and on occasions difficult to discern. Thank goodness for subtitles on DVD! The entire content of the film was just about enough for a 40 minute TV episode, but alas the film lacked the humour and self-deprecation of the original TV series.

431,matthewacollier,Michael Mann's Idiosyncratic Masterwork,10,9 September 2017,"100Viewed Theatrical CutAs luxurious as it is beautiful, Michael Mann's Miami Vice is one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen. Not necessarily in content, but more so in how that content is shot, scored, and cut together into a film. The cinematography is beautifully strange, utilizing hand-held in a way similar to Hard to Be a God(or should I say Hard to Be a God is shot in a way similar to this?), and the way the film is edited is so unorthodox is scene structure and narrative flow that it made me think that Michael Mann was warming up to Terrence Malick's method of jagged editing, deciding to use it in a police procedural, of all things, to make a wholly original experience. The film manages to have a luxurious pace that also has a very consistent flow to it, keeping the plot running while developing character and atmosphere simultaneously, making every single second count. It's astonishing the way the film manages to apply this editing style to something so seemingly foreign, and make it all gel together. The performances are extremely strong as well, with Jamie Foxx giving one of his best performances I've ever seen from him, as well as Colin Farrell bringing a multifaceted character to life beautifully in the course of the narrative. One thing I did notice was a distinct lack of action, but what I realize now is that this isn't even really an action movie. It has 3 great action sequences, but it's really about the way the characters function with each other and with their environment in Miami. It's all so idiosyncratic, yet unmistakably successful, that the entire film feels like an entirely foreign world from ours despite the level of realism that the film captures. I don't have anything else to say about this beast of a film, unfortunately; it's greatness eludes me. For now, just know that I loved this movie, and although not everyone will love it(there's no surprise that this film and Knight of Cups have nearly the same rating on IMDb, they practically share the same textures), those who will will find they have discovered a small/big masterpiece.",Miami Vice

The trailer reveals very little of the movie, so one might go in to see it and be either surprised by the awesomeness of the film, or be disappointed because they though they went in to see something different. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall darkness of the film, its noir feeling, its surprising (or perhaps non-existing?) ending, and everything else. The music and the atmosphere of the movie were also simply amazing. In a way, I saw the possibility of this being more of a gun-fight oriented movie. But on the other hand, I remembered how I expected Collateral to be some sort of ""taxi-driver-turned-vigilate"" movie, and that was obviously not the case. Michael Mann never seems to disappoint me.

Last night, with a group of 5 friends I was the one who in fact, voted to see Miami Vice impressed by the trailer and the 'visually stunning' scenery. 2 and 1/2 hours and $30 latter I had just witnessed the worst movie of my life.Firstly, the plot. Extremely complex- if your not following every single line your completely lost. Although I like complex plots when they work- this one doesn't. A drug bust doesn't need to be complex- it doesn't need 2 hours of talking and traveling For 2 hours I sat their watching the characters talk about their problems, rather then shoot it out.Secondly, the characters. Completely thick- their is no evidence of relationship between the two. Boring too watch- especially for two hours.Thirdly- the action. Two hours and 15 minutes has to lead to a good action sequence. If Miami Vice did, I would have given it at least a 3 or 4. However, it didn't. A simple shoot out (In the dark) mean that who was shooting and who was getting shot was lost to the viewer. No twists or explosions- just a shooting.I left the movie shaking. My hands were shaking it was that bad. We were speechless. At the end, I yelled out 'What the hell?' much to the amuse of other viewers.The fact that the first part of the movie leads up to a bust on a pimp is exciting- but then the fact that 'Oh no, our friend has called, leave him' provides the beginning of a horrible movie.

Most of the film is Farrell riding around in fast boats and super cars with particularly good-looking Western newcomer Li Gong. Though she's not the only good looking actress, as a matter of fact nobody in this film seems to be ugly at all.My biggest problem with this film is that it was directed by Michael Mann, a great director and has no lack of great films under his belt but what happened with this film is beyond me. Style is not the problem with this film, much like Mann's other films it has style in lethal doses but un-like his other films there's no plot.All in all, if you've seen the trailer and you think this looks good then go watch it again and don't waste your time with this film. .",Miami Vice
437,magutosh,Michael Mann has lost it,4,12 August 2006,"I don't usually comment on a film, not that I don't have any opinions about it. But today it's different. There is an urge within that I couldn't help but jotting my thoughts down.Michael Mann has completely lost his plot in this film, from the terrible choice of storyline, badly scripted dialogue, below average directions and the choice of casting Li Gong, which in my opinion is the utter most ridicule of Mann's career as a filmmaker.There is nothing fresh in the story of drug running, however, Mann and his research team could have at least spend some time to learn or investigate real life people and events if they wanna develop characters and stories, to make them more believable and convincing for today's audiences. Mann clearly hasn't been following today's on-screen story telling to come up with such a badly executed flick. If dealers and cops talk like that in real life, then there would be two possible reasons. One, they're way too smart to be a criminal or a cop; two, they've been taking way too much drugs themselves.Since when that he loved aerial shots so much? Maybe since he made too much money from previous work to feed his flying hobbit. Use it if it helps with story telling, who are you trying to impress??? The people still point at sky when a plane fly passes??? The film isn't packed with the kind of action you'd expect, no real story content, and bad taste in direction.Maybe Mann should take a break from making new films, to polish his craft and re-learn the basics of story telling, and next time, cast for the character, if one can't speak neither English nor Spanish, how can one to be in such a lucrative business, if any business at all. She might as well be serving ""egg flied lice"" in a Chinese takeway! That would certainly get her closer to the Oscar than a drug lord.Mann, you should really leave things as they were, stop touching gold and turn them into dirt, that's not a new trick, a lot of idiots do that pretty much all the time, and they do better than you.",Miami Vice
438,kovalchukyou,Far From Good,4,2 August 2006,"**Reveals minor plot** I'm going to be in honest in telling you that I had pretty low expectations going into seeing this because of the not so sweet actor duo Mann casted of Farrell and Foxx. It seems the film was never critically edited with gaping plot holes and love tangents going on for more than desired. Farrell and Foxx have as much chemistry as a recently divorced couple. Their characters are isolated from one another and they never seem to greatly benefit. What was the point of Farrell going to Cuba with his unintelligible speaking Asian/Cuban friend? Was it really necessary for Mann to have them cruising on a boat for 20 minutes then to make sure we didn't fall asleep, have the 2 love birds dance romantically in the club? The shooting scenes were for the most part well done with the non realistic parts being a bit of an annoyance. I haven't seen this amount of Rambo-ism since Mr. and Mrs. Smith came out. Does not follow the TV show nor do anything unique.",Miami Vice
439,sheepinator8,"FANTASTIC, but If you are unsure what to expect then read this",8,5 August 2006,"This is an almost perfect film. It is visually rich and stylish, the plot is a little confusing; mainly because the majority of dialogue is detective jargon, and i think is why a lot of the people who saw it didn't enjoy it, but (as a piece of advice if you are wondering about watching it) the deep meaning of the scene can be found instead through the brilliant acting and involving camera work from Micheal Mann, so don't focus too hard on the confusing dialogue.I have yet to see the T.V show but i understand that it is a fun ""buddy cop"" saga, but be warned! Do not have this expectation of the film! There is almost no character development, but this is a good thing in my opinion, because Micheal Mann wanted to portray of the reality of being an undercover cop, which includes not becoming to emotionally linked to your colleagues.If your a Micheal Mann fan then see it. Miami vice is like heat, but with style",Miami Vice
440,Opie-6,This is a great film - spoilers,10,3 August 2007,"I don't know if I've seen a movie in my life that has more mixed opinions than Miami Vice. I know people who believe it is a classic film, and I know people who think it is downright terrible. I think the difference in these opinions come from expectations.I saw this movie the second week it came out and had read the divisive reviews, so I expected a slower, more lengthy film. If you want a nostalgic film based on the TV series, you won't be satisfied. If you want a Bad Boys/Lethal Weapon type action comedy, you won't be satisfied (two series that I do love). If you want a gritty action movie full of drama, then you have to see this film.There are many complaints about this film, the two biggest being the dialogue is bad, and there is no chemistry between Jamie foxx and Colin Farrel or Colin Farrel and Gong Li.I think there is a very clear reason for these 'flaws' in the film. This is meant to be a gritty, realistic film. The characters stare death in the face everyday, and this type of work doesn't lead to well rounded, normal relationships. In other words, Crockett and Tubbs are not partners because they like each other - they are partners because they are very talented at what they do and they trust each other to do the right thing.There are several incredibly powerful scenes in this movie - the truck on 95, the first meeting with Nicholas, the scene where Trudy Joplin - Jamie Foxx's girl - is kidnapped/the trailer park scene, and finally the final gunfight/end credits are all incredible.Many people have complained about the ending, and apparently issues between Foxx and Mann kept them from filming the ending Mann intended. Nevertheless, the final scene in the hospital with Crockett returning is very powerful. The end credits with the final song, ""Auto Rock"" by Magwai is simply amazing.You have to know what you're getting in this film or you may not enjoy it. Highly recommended.",Miami Vice

442,edenhall,Terrible action film meets the wost camera work ever,1,2 August 2006,"This is quite possibly the worst action film ever: the plot is utterly incoherent throughout the film and the action is completely boring (even the explosions put me to sleep). The dialog makes no sense at times. I am not trying to berate the foreign actors, but I couldn't even understand what they were saying. I even moved up in the theatre in case it was just my hearing, however, even the other film goers were expressing their disappointment in the way the accents of the foreign actors obscured the dialog. I must say that Jamie Foxx's acting was great, but he didn't have enough screen time. And Colin Farrell completely destroyed the film with his poor acting. This movie could have been so simple, but they chose to make it ""artsy fartsy"" thus destroying the essence of the film. Seriously though, the camera work - two people even left to throw up during the movie. How hard is it to hold a camera still? Terrible.",Miami Vice
443,jimclarke-3,I feel cheated,1,2 August 2006,"It was good to read all the negative comments about Miami Vice on this website from our American cousins. I watched the film last night in the UK with incredulity that such a bad movie could be made on purpose. I thought I would be out of step with the rest of the world and MV would be a box office smash. However most of you seem to agree with me and hopefully we can prevent any more unsuspecting movie fans wasting their money. Why was it called Miami Vice? It bore no resemblance to what was a great trend-setting classic TV series of its type. It would not have been so bad if a little of the original's humour had been injected now and then, but all we got was 2+ hours of glowering looks at each other. I can just see the production meeting before shooting where they ticked off all the usual ingredients of this genre (they obviously missed the 'humour' box) and piled them into the film regardless. I had higher hopes of Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx, but this is one they will want to forget and so will I. Like so many of the comments here, I was tempted to walk out before the end, something I have never done in any film.",Miami Vice
444,Twinrehz,"Visually impressive, but ultimately boring",2,26 May 2020,"The more I think about the movie, the more it annoys me. It is visually impressive, with the action shots making for some of the most interesting scenes in the movie, but the story is just so downright boring and uninspired, taking no chances and just rolls along it's surprisingly predictable path with no character building or development, devoid of emotions unless you count the perplexingly awkward softcore scenes that seems tacked on just to mark the movie as ""for adults"".The characters are completely flat and unlikable with no redeeming qualities. ""I trust you 100%"" says Foxx to Farrell more than one time, a trust that might be true to the characters, but from an outside view, we're watching unknowns talking about unknowns, and with too many unknowns, this is an equation that can't be solved.The plot is very much not an unknown, though, as anyone who's seen more than one movie about undercover cops and drug-networks can attest to, it follows the same predictable path, (see 'A man apart' for another example) the only variation being the endangerment of someone close to the main characters, but since the main characters between them only have one 'emotional attaché', this is about as surprising as the sun rising in the morning - and like the sun, it's only a matter of when it happens. Since the movie alludes to this in the establishing scenes, it can hardly be considered a spoiler, and I can't consider it a spoiler because it's part of the entourage of tropes that comes with this movie.What I'll consider the final nail in the coffin before wrapping up this review is the audio. I mentioned that while the movie is visually impressive, in fact I'll downright call it a pretty movie, the sound is absolutely not - if you'll forgive my overly memetic reference - credit to team. After about 15 minutes, I had to pause the movie and turn on the subtitles, because I couldn't be sure if I heard the dialogue correctly. Coupled with a lot of names, places and jargon, the poor audibility of the characters meant that despite cranking the audio up and turning the voice-amplifier to max, I still couldn't be sure I heard what the characters were saying, and while the movie is as predictable as they come, I'd still like to be able to hear what's being said. The one good thing about the sound design is how well it works its theme. It is a very quiet movie that only comes alive in the explosive scenes, at all other times it's quiet and brooding, which I will say added to the tone of the movie.Do I recommend this movie? No.
Absolutely not. As a reference on 'how to shoot action scenes in the dark' and 'establishing beautiful panoramic shots', this movie is definitely of interest for anyone aspiring to film making; the action scenes are exquisitely well crafted and genuinely exciting, but the story falls flat on its face, and while I don't usually have a problem with open-ended movies, this movie just ends out of nowhere with no conclusion, returning their characters to normalcy once they've recovered. The characters came out of nowhere, went nowhere (despite travelling all over the Caribbean), and ultimately returned to nothing. While I like pretty movies and am prone to giving movies a pass for being visually interesting, Miami Vice leans too heavily on it's weak story, and it just doesn't hold up.I'm hoping this isn't going to be my running theme when it comes to Mann's movies, but I didn't like Hancock either. Collateral is on my to-do list, I'm hoping it can convince me that I've just been unlucky with what movies I've seen so far.",Miami Vice

What was the point of Tubbs in the film - his role was so thin and his appearance in the film seemed peripheral - none of the comedy that was in the TV series. Also Colin Farrell was not suited to the role of Crocket - he is not suave enough - don't know who would be suited though but definitely not Colin Farrell. There was also a danger of what plot there was being missed by the UK audience because of the large number of Latino actors being used - this may be easily understandable in the US but to be honest there was a need for sub-titles for some of the actors - it was necessary to concentrate on what was being said that a lot of the enjoyment went out of the film.",Miami Vice

To the people who liked this movie, what was to like? The real cool visuals (I mean, get a freaking steady-cam!)? The bug-eyed stare of Colin Ferrel? The mumblings of Foxx?

The best thing about this movie was the idea that it had an ending which you could look forward to so you could leave your seat and cry. On serious note the best thing that could be brought from this movie is that of Foxx's performance, possibly the only actor in the whole movie that actually showed he felt something and had some human emotion. Do not see if your highly interested you will come out angry and feel you have wasted your money which could have spent on a better Mann movie like 'Heat' or Collateral'.

449,damiencorso,Vice is Nice: Beyond expectations,10,26 July 2006,"Big summer surprise, Miami Vice is actually very good. With questionable casting all around, especially Colin Farrel as Sonny Crockett, I went in expecting a forgettable, mediocre action flick. Instead, Michael Mann hit another home run with his always ""on point"" visual style. The director also made full use of excellent sound technology, enough to make George Lucas proud.Breaking the trend of most TV-to-Movie feature films, Miami Vice actually contains an interesting and complex story. The screenplay won't win any Oscars, but its a plot better than most action plots. It still falls in the classic good guys vs. bad guys scenario, but that's not a bad thing. This movie definitely deserves a theatrical viewing and then at least a rental for casual movie watchers. For die-hard Miami Vice or Michael Mann fans, it is a definite DVD purchase, regardless of special features.This summer, if you're wanting to see a good action movie, leave the children at home and remember, Vice is nice.",Miami Vice

I was also satisfied stylistically; an updated remake, yes, but for the most part it held true (to the original series) in terms of pattern and theme (i.e., cars, boats, guns, clothes, clubs).The acting was, given the limitations of a script that didn't really demand all too much of players, pretty good.The script was, as I wrote above, adequate, but not something I would lavish with any significant praise. There were two scenes where the dialogue ventured well into the territory of trite, but only two scenes, and, more problematically, I wanted to be made more aware of the lines that were being blurred (by their going deep, deep undercover).On the whole, though, this was good entertainment. The music was good, the action sequences were well-wrought, the tension was kept in-line with a narrative arc that did basically had no missteps. And like I said, it's a beautiful movie.",Miami Vice

He took on the impossible job of making a movie of one of the most popular TV series ever. Instead of copying it, he created something new and fresh. People who doesn't think it's worth watching must have thought that they would get a trip back in time to the 80's and when they all dreamt of being Sonny Crocket/Don Johnson. This is not that movie. This is the one and true tribute to the essence of Miami Vice, which was much more about relationships, love, hate, honesty, sacrifices and commitment than of guns and drug lords. The movie has the exact same qualities. Everyone who doesn't think the movie makes the series justice should watch them again this time thinking of the characters and their life instead of the cars, women and guns.

And i figured, even if it wasn't good, at least it'll be better than 99% of the usual Hollywood crap out there....I was wrong.My problem is I like characters. I like characters with some flesh on it. I like to at least feel something. Alas Michael Mann forgot to drawn in this part. The movie really feels like your average undercover cops out to bring down some big-wig drug lord with lots of action. I mean you can see this on TV. Insert actor A here, insert actor B here, go from point A to B to C and you got yourself a movie !I will give credit on the action sequences. The gun fights are a lot more intense than your average action movie. I actually cringed at some of the parts hoping to escape brain fragments from falling into my lap. Not for the faint of heart and kids should really NOT watch this.Another thing that started to bug me - the use of video vs film. I do understand shooting at night, giving you a real feel a la Black Hawk Down but I'm getting distracted by video noise. Sometimes during the movie, I wished it shot it on film.Anyways, if you like straight-up action movies, you'll enjoy it. I'm used the Mann giving it something a bit more in his films and I just didn't really feel it here so for Michael Mann groupies out there, forget this one.Just my 2 cents....",Miami Vice

I went into Miami Vice with very high expectations, but sadly the film does just not deliver the package.The camera work and look of the film are fantastic and do deserve recognition but there is no real plot and character development is non-existent. We have no idea of the relationship between the two leads, we can hardly gather if there even like each other.One of the biggest problems with the film is the way we shift from location to location without a clue where we are or whats going on.I know that Michael Mann said that this film was meant to be independent from the TV show and not Nostalgic in any way, but to me, if your going to call the film Miami Vice then people will expect to be able to see at least a feel of the TV show in this movie, it just isn't there.All in all a bit if a disappointment but worth seeing just for the cinematography or if you have nothing better to do.",Miami Vice

455,snakej32,"One of the Worst Movies of 2006, Mann's Greatest Failure",2,25 February 2007,"I don't write reviews often, but after seeing so many positive scores for this movie I was compelled to write an honest one: Michael Mann taints his own great filmography with this piece of trash. Clearly Mann is, has been, and should still be capable of films much, much better than this. Let's start out with the absolute lack of any kind of character development whatsoever, the audience is simply dropped into the movie knowing nothing about the characters and by the film's end nothing has changed. Ferrell's wooden performance is downright laughable (how could anyone ever take him seriously with that handlebar mustache?), and Foxx's isn't far off. The dialog is weak and unmemorable and the script has so many plot holes and scenes that should have never gotten past the first draft that it's a wonder this ever got green-lighted. The main focus of this movie seems to be the love story between Gong Li (whose English is barely understandable) and Colin Ferrel rather than the experiences of two undercover narcotics officers, and to make things even worse these parts of the film are handled downright terribly. There are about 4 ""love"" scenes in this movie, and probably 3 of them take place in a shower, that is to say 3/4 could have easily been cut, and the focus of this film should have remained on what viewers (especially fans of the TV show) wanted to see: the actual police work. The music is also awful, every song seems to be the worst possible selection of Audioslave or some kind of instrumental that doesn't fit with the movie. To all those people who say that this is an ""intelligent cop movie for adults"", what is your definition intelligent? A movie where plot holes, bad dialog, wooden acting and unnecessary sex scenes run rampant? I don't think so. Every fan of this movie uses the same argument: ""If you were expecting Bad Boys 2 of course you were disappointed, go watch a Michael Bay movie."" Well I wasn't expecting Bad Boys 2, I wasn't even expecting an action movie, I was just expecting something good, and I was utterly disappointed. If you are a fan of Michael Mann, well-made crime movies, thought provoking dramas, or simply movies that are coherent, AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS.",Miami Vice

Jamie Foxx does fine, but his character gets a minimal amount of screen time. Li Gong is exquisite, but her English is barely understandable -- a distinct disadvantage in a drama.The ending is completely unrealistic!! No cop would not only let a prime suspect get away, much less actively support it by arranging transportation. And, to cap it off, there is absolutely no chemistry between Colin Farrell and Li Gong, even though it is supposed to be so absolutely crazy passion that they risk their careers and lives.

I think that from the opening seen to the end it was well thought out and more on the realistic side than most remakes. I kind of forgot that it was a remake of a show i watched as a youngster. I will make this short Jose Yero made this movie what it is. Everyone would expect him to be the boss and the head bad guy only to find he is nothing more than security. The emotion the actor John Ortiz put into his character is great. After watching this movie on cable I bought it on blu-ray just to watch John Ortiz performance. Jamie Foxx played his role very well as always and Colin did a good job too. Barry Henley gave the feel of a real police captain, the only unrealistic performances i feel were from the female detectives. Actually it gave me that feeling that Heat with Deniro & Pachino gave me, it just didn't have all the slick talk of Heat but otherwise a 7 out of 10.

458,bxballer79,Miami Heat,8,30 July 2006,"Oh what a hot time in Miami. The updated take of Miami Vice, starring Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell, is very accurate take on the life of undercover cops. Michael Mann, seemingly interested in crime dramas (i.e. Collateral, and Heat) updates the Miami Vice television show he worked on by adding grittier streets and a darker look. The police drama is filled with the usual beautiful autos, exotic boats, and plush houses known throughout the original series. However, unlike most Hollywood action pictures it runs on the sheer realistic depiction of cop life. The film isn't carried by great catch phrases and a top ten billboard soundtrack. This makes the movie seems more believable. The dialogue is filled with tons of information and law enforcement jargon that will copied and studied for cop movies for years to come. The movie still has an astounding look and feel.It remains to be seen if Michael Mann's more realistic approach will lead to box office dollars, but certainly the work attributed to sculpting the films core is commendable. The film is definitely a break from all the CGI and super heroes of the summer. We will see if this will mean a second go around.",Miami Vice

Two drug cops in Miami go toe to toe with Hispanic drug dealers, get ahead, then have to risk it all to save a captured girl.

461,rik_7,Michael Mann's Miami Vice,7,14 August 2006,"Having seen Miami Vice, i went initially with two main intentions. The main one being to see what Michael Mann had created, and secondly to watch what I consider a fine actor in Jamie Foxx. Michael Mann in my opinion is one of the greatest film directors ever. He conveys characters moods and sense of panic better than most directors. His use of angles and colour is always effective and precise. 'Heat' and 'Collateral' in particular are fine examples of Michael Mann being an effective and successful director. So I went into 'Miami Vice' hoping to see Michael Mann in fine form. I think 'Miami Vice' is a hard film to analyse, because generally it can not be called an amazing film or an awful film. I think the film succeeded in certain areas and in others maybe lacked something.The film had a basic storyline. I think Mann makes it seem more than it is really. While most directors would struggle to do anything with the limited resources given, Mann makes a simple film seem better than it is. This is credit to him but still makes the film not be as good as it could be because the story lacks. i think one area where Mann failed was in the characters' relationships with each other. Foxx and Farrell did not have the same chemistry that Mann created in Collateral and Heat. They did not seem to understand each others characters like you would expect two undercover cop partners to have. So whilst the characters were performed well individually, together they did not connect.I think it would have been easy to make this film into a typical no intelligence-needed-boyish film. It could have just been brain dumbing action, explosions, and bikinis. But Mann manages to find a balance in showing action when needed and appropriate, and also having many 'still' scenes with little physical action.On the whole I don't think Mann has disgraced himself, but working with limited resources, he has not delivered his finest performance. I still regard him highly and wait for another piece from him. The film is watchable and entertaining but you do not walk away thinking heavily about what happened. So I give Miami vice 7/10.",Miami Vice
462,3DeeP,tedious mess of a movie...,2,14 February 2009,"I just saw this movie on TV last night and was completely disappointed. Reading some of the entries here, I was astonished to see that many people actually seemed to like it!The look of the film is very amateurish and cheap. It was shot like this on purpose, but nonetheless, it really didn't work for me. The chemistry between Foxx and Farell is nonexistent, and their acting is, let's say, not very convincing.But the biggest problem is the editing and the script! I haven't seen such a boring movie for a very long time. The transitions seem forced and totally random, they just happen in the middle of a scene. The story keeps dragging along, and you find yourself not caring for a single one of the characters. The sex scenes don't help, either. I couldn't help the feeling that they were just thrown in to give the targeted (predominantly male) audience some t&a. Also, the dialogues were laughable! No wit, no nothing, just boring, clichéd chatter.The whole movie could have been shot in 90 minutes, which would have helped, but alas, it is 134 minutes long! And sadly, there's not nearly enough action. The few action scenes aren't shot well, and so here we are: A boring film that has poor cinematography, weak acting, a very weak script, laughable dialogues and almost no action. It's kind of fascinating how they could end up with such a terrible product with all the talent involved, but somehow, they did.My advice: Stay away and watch collateral instead!2/10",Miami Vice
463,Joventino,"The new poster boy for ""Style without substance""",6,10 August 2006,"Without a doubt this is Michael Mann's weakest effort.Miami Vice retells the tale of two undercover detectives, James 'Sonny' Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs who infiltrate a Cuban drug smuggling operation.The film's focus is eye candy first and foremost. You've got two of Hollywood's best looking leading men, sexy and feisty supporting female cast, BMW's, powerboats etc.Everything that shines in the film is visual flair, SFX and explosive action scenes (which the film does not have enough, unfortunately).This is as deep as the film gets. Character development is NON-EXISTENT despite the deep cast. The characters are no more than caricatures of Mann's vision of cops and robbers.The pacing is rapidly quick with the editing done as if the movie was an overly long TV episode. Those unfamiliar with the series will find themselves pondering and asking ""What the hell is going on?"" The cinematography is also disputable as half the film seems under lit and some shots are bizarrely angled.Miami Vice is one of those films that are really cool to read or hear about but not as good to watch.1.5/4",Miami Vice

The Cinematography is the heart and soul of the movie with Dion Beebe's (go the Aussies) style making the film so much more realistic and likable. additionally many have criticized the movie as it is not set in the 80's and doesn't have the Old school touch but the ""Mann"" wanted it too be more retro and modern which it was too a tee. 10/10 Make Sure you see This",Miami Vice
465,johnny_go_time,"Thrilling, Cool, Intense",9,13 August 2006,"This movie is floundering at the box office because: 1) The masses have an uninformed notion of what the TV show was about 2) The masses think this movie bears some resemblance to that pre-conception 3) It's too smart for the low-brows and there are too many guns for the high-brows.This movie is a non-stop ride to the top of Adrenaline Hill. The climax is among the most exhilarating and intense I've ever seen in a movie - hands-down this scene alone is worth the price of admission for you and your buddies.Michael Mann is incredibly good at what he does (and he seems to do just about everything on his films...) To paraphrase some review I read for Collateral, in a Michael Mann film, the City and the environment is as much a character as any of the actors.

467,omega786,The vice here is the mediocrity,1,9 August 2006,"After reading a few reviews on some well known film sites i thought this was going to be great...but the totally opposite was true. What a huge disappointment. The plot was going from one place to another and at times just gave you one big headache. Poor red herrings and over the top sub plots were shown to us as believable (I think not!). The film was just one sub plot over another and a zig zag of labyrinthian proportions of where the film should be going. And how about this for corny dialogue...'probability is like gravity...'? er..yeah, like dog crap and cheese are identicial???It seems Michael Mann is a one (HEAT) hit wonder, and simply adding a 10 minute gunfight lifted straight out of HEAT at the end of the movie is not going to save it.If you want to watch a decent cop thriller check out the little known 'Dirty' a superior film by a lesser known director.Avoid this Miami VICE and buy the TV series instead.",Miami Vice

Move into the new world of Miami Vice which deals with the underbelly of his hot, sweaty, sexually charged city.Sure this isn't a high brow study of vice in the city, this is guns guns, guns and people get their head blown off when the deal goes bad.This film is all about mood and style and Mann has spent a lot of time and money painting a beautiful picture for us to look at and admire.I can understand why people will hate this film. In the showing I went to, there was a steady stream of people leaving (equal to the body count on the screen, I think). However, this isn't a wide appeal film. It talks to a viewer who will not only leave their brains at the door but one who is willing to walk into this world and enjoy the ride.High points; seeing what happens to the human body when a bullet hits it close up.Low point; Daisy sitting beside me in the theatre crying to her boyfriend / husband that she wanted to leave because it was just wall to wall violence and blood.So, If you like Colin and Jamie with big guns killing lots of people you will think that this is cool. If you like them as either eye candy / romantic heroes you will hate this and do a Daisy on me.For me, pass me a gun and where do I sign up for a go fast boat, I'm going under cover.",Miami Vice

Sorry for the attitude but some of the reviews just got me speechless. This movie is the best action movie I've seen this year. I admit there isn't much novelty in the scenario, but the execution is simply brilliant and the introduction/beginning of the movie gets right to the point, as if you just jump in the lives of 2 undercover cops, no crap there.The sound during the gun fights was visceral, I was truly amazed, so this one has to be seen in a good theater or on a good home sound system.Acting wise, I thought the actor choice was perfect, Farrel's role is more important but both actors are doing a great job. Mann didn't go for the cheesy buddy cop angle screaming at each other all the time as in the OLD series. I felt both Burnett and Tubbs were very strong minded individuals each taking care of their business but also trusting each other, without being like brothers... and i had no problem with that. Some of the scenes were very intense and Farrel dialogue and play was exceptional, but I guess we can thanks Micheal Mann for that.Go see the new Miami Vice, not the old one.",Miami Vice
471,vickmankw07,One of the worst movies i have ever seen,1,17 March 2007,"Miami Vice was easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen. I went into the theater expecting a good, exciting movie but i do not think i could have been more disappointed. The director was the man who directed who made Collateral which is a brilliant movie however he failed to bring the same type of greatness to this movie. Nothing happened. Period. There was little actions towards the end but by that point i was so fed up i wanted to leave. A lot of the plot is a love affair between Colin Farrell and this Asian woman which was so unimportant and was awfully boring. Due to some of the camera angles it was hard to keep up with the movie, because it was so fast paced, and almost blurry camera shots. I would recommend you do not see this movie. It is the biggest waste of time and with such a star cast you will be simply disappointed",Miami Vice
472,rufname-familienname,"Pretty good, but don't expect a masterpiece",7,28 August 2006,"First of all: I'm a bit disappointed. It's a Michael Mann movie starring two of the most exciting upcoming superstars (Farrell, Foxx) and an interesting background, MV being a cult series in the 80ies, so I went to the movies with big expectations. I liked the characters, most of the movie's music is good and also used good and I enjoyed the action scenes (most of all because the illustration of violence is very straightforward). But actually when the movie's over I had the feeling that something's missing - for a really great movie. Maybe it's the portrayal of Farrell and Foxx as Kind-Of-Superheros who are too cool, too slick for their job. They don't seem to fear anything but sweat on their shirts in situations where a bulletproof vest would help them as much as an umbrella against bunker busters.Spoiler: The only situation where I asked myself if those damn smart cops got brains at all is the trailer park bomb explosion. They don't even spend a thought on the possibility of a bomb in the trailer while right that has been the first thing I worried about.So after all, Miami Vice is a pretty good action movie to enjoy by anybody who likes flicks about crime, drugs and (way-too-)cool cops. But if you expect another crime masterpiece like ""Heat"", it isn't gonna deliver.by the way: Does anybody know which two Audioslave songs are used in the movie? They aren't on the original soundtrack, unfortunately. Especially the first one is really great.Andy from Nuremberg (Ger)",Miami Vice
473,Gohanto,Not even worth the price of admission,1,28 July 2006,"This movie really shouldn't have gotten into production with it's script. There really isn't one to be found and nothing interesting ever really happens. It's a lot of people just standing around talking seriously about stuff no one cares about. The action is little and far in between. See Collateral for Mann and Fox doing their best with digital cameras, not this garbage.The digital style, for the most part, worked for the movie. The opening scene was slightly interesting, but after that everything went downhill. Random sex scenes (it was approaching Uwe Boll randomness), lot of shots of cars driving, airplanes flying, and boating driving. There wasn't any drama or chemistry between any characters that i could see.",Miami Vice
474,rust-7,courageous,9,31 August 2006,A lot has been written about this movie. Myself I found it a great experience. I thought it was a courageous attempt to make an almost documentary style action movie. True although the movie has a typical Miami vice plot the style is the direct opposite of the series. While the series was stylish flashy and high drama the movie gives an almost clinical view of the events that unfold. Case in point is the music that was so prolific in the series always remains in the background in the movie. The acting is also less expressive there is almost no crying or screaming in the movie. Things just seem to happen as they do in real life. It's refreshing to see a big budget movie that takes a new and daring approach to a genre. But do not be deceived it still makes for great cinema and Michael Mann sneaks a few beautiful shots in to the feature. My advise is check it out for yourself!,Miami Vice
475,thenationalzero,Delusions of Grandeur,5,20 August 2006,"This movie could have been *tastefully* presented in a little over an hour. But it dragged-on for as long as it did because of all the DEAD TIME in the movie: scenes in which the characters say nothing, do nothing, or perhaps aren't even present. And this movie really did drag on. Early, you can see the direction evident in 'Collateral', especially when it comes to randomly-placed scenes featuring dogs. And don't get me started on the gratuitous, absolutely unnecessary sex-scenes. The action sequences are gritty and well-done (when they finally get around to it), but that's how they try to fool the audience into thinking they're watching a good movie: by cloaking it in 'grit'. Thankfully (again following Collateral's lead), the music is pretty good. The acting wasn't horrible either, once Farrel and Foxx get the room to do something other than appear stone-faced and look 'bad-ass'. The visual effects were also a saving-grace for this movie: everybody looks 'super-cool', the gritty back-roads are smeared with discontent, and some of the sex-scenes actually do inspire passion.In finality: A waste. Don't expect to see much semblance between the series and this disappointingly average movie.",Miami Vice

The problem is that what he wanted makes the movie boring and difficult to watch.You feel as if you were dropped into the middle of a TV episode, and are already supposed to be familiar with the characters and plot. Plot? What plot? This film is a blur of guns, drugs, meetings, explosions, and filmed in a dark gritty style that never lets up! Most of the scenes are at night, or in a dark place. Between that and the jerky hand held cameras, it is definitely not and easy thing to watch.All in all, this is a boring mess of a movie: You might be better served by catching some zzzzz'z if the theater seats are comfortable enough.

The acting is poor, especially considering the cast, some parts of the film are grainy (i do amateur film work so i notice those kinds of things and n=know how easy it is to filter them) The Chinese lady cant hold an accent, i think i counted over a dozen different accents from her. There was very little action and no comprehensible plot whatsoever. Also, this is one of the few action movies I've seen where none of the good guys die, its just too unbelievable that they are ""that good"" (well except these in the beginning, but that hardly counts).

478,amacsween,TV series turned movie: Is it possible,8,10 September 2006,"Based on the fact that by the time the Miami Vice TV show ended any movie that matched the aggressiveness of the first few seasons would prove to be a fun film. The direction, acting and script of the film superseded the ""colorful"" life style of a vice agent in Miami represented in the TV series.. The script, even though the best part of the action was at the end, was still only plot driven. Where was all of the dialog? Maybe the dialog was lost in the anticipation for the action at the end, but with Jamie Fox who won an academy award for Ray, and Colin Ferrell who carried the Alexander film; there could have been more depth in the characters. Since the TV series was so popular, it wouldn't be a surprise to see more Miami Vice films. Maybe some side stories about the character's personal lives where their families didn't become apart of the job would balance the overall series.",Miami Vice

Watched Running Scared after-wards - that was at least fun and all I did through that one was pack my bag for work. Jamie Foxx was forgettable and just seem to float in and out of the main draw card Colin Farrell. Lacklustre performances on all sides. Truly astounded that it is receiving good reviews in Australia. Dull and uncreative, I feel that perhaps not taking itself so seriously and aiming for an authentic eighties flavour may have added some chuckles to weary predictable made in the Ol' US of A trite.",Miami Vice

Well, I must admit that it has lots of good action. Then again from a movie like this im sure most people expect it to have lots of good action but the quality of the movie and plot not that good... something like Bad Boys. The plot here was a little confusing... hard to understand, but Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell put on good performances in my opinion. Not Oscar worthy, but that can be cus of the not so hot dialogue. But in a movie like this I don't see how there CAN be good dialogue. Also, I mus say the soundtrack to this movie is AWESOME. Great songs and they complement the scenes very well.

483,scottee-mac,"overall great, couple of story flaws and short on wisecracks",9,31 July 2006,"I was really impressed. My major complaints were that there weren't enough wisecracks. Stan didn't even have a speaking part, did he?Some of the character's decisions were questionable. I found myself thinking, why the hell would Castillo tell Trudy to sit tight in the trailer? Ah, so it could blow up and advance the plot. OK, no big deal.Same thing afterwards when Jose allowed Isabella to check the product. That makes no sense since she obviously couldn't be trusted to provide reliable info and it defeated the whole purpose for bringing her.Also a little too much Chris Cornell. I actually really like Chris Cornell, but would have preferred a little more variety. they used him either three or four times.Those are the only things that really bothered me; everything else was done very well. Although the 80s sense was gone, the nostalgia was still there from camera angles, music transitions, and the music itself (in fact, parts of the score seemed to be heavily influenced by Jan Hammer's music).My wife was bothered by Colin's occasional lapses from American accent to Irish accent. I didn't notice that so much, but the forced gruff voice was amusing. Not bad, just amusing.I particularly enjoyed the gun fighting scenes. They threw away the canned sound effects and went with sounds and camera angles that seemed really raw without seeming like reality TV or the news. I was really happy with those scenes.All in all - I'm very satisfied with the movie and look at it as a chance to level set the genre and set the stage for future Miami vice movies. I think they're making enough $$ to warrant it.",Miami Vice
484,The_Dooger,Attn: Michael Mann...That was the worst $10 I have ever spent.,1,7 August 2006,"Mr. Mann...I want my money back. I knew coming into this movie it wasn't going to be anything like the TV series. In fact, you (Michael Mann) have a decent track record for action films starring a slew of great actors (Heat, Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans) supported with a good to solid plot. I am a fan. But Miami Vice falls short of even the lowest expectation I could have imagined. It was awful. You would expect this movie would play hard on the drugs, drug lords, hot women, hot cars, multiple shootouts, car and/or boat chases, savvy police work...simply put, an action movie. IT WAS A LOVE STORY. If I may, here is my critique (pardon your feelings)...Miami Vice's opening sequence seems to lack any fluidity (the music doesn't mix well with the bar scene, dialog and scene editing is very choppy, more...) but I still felt this will be an exciting film. I appreciated the fact that we didn't spend too much time with character development at the onset of the film. Then the movie came to a screeching halt, in order to exhibit Jamie Foxx's body in a gratuitous shower scene, just in case you missed his last couple of films. OK. Fine. We needed to establish the fact that his girlfriend (in the shower with him) was important to him, therefore this scene was necessary for what was to happen to her later (look up ""foreshadow""). Lets move on...The plot quickly, but briefly, picks up throwing our two heroes into deep undercover for the FEDS. Cool. Their mission is to find the ""leak"" in the FBI (or other agencies involved) that got agents killed. (we do not need to talk about this again, since Mr. Mann didn't deem it important to resolve it in detail) Then...you can hear the wheels screeching to a halt, again.Crockett falls in love. The next hour of the movie is a horribly written love story. Little dialog, absolutely NO ACTION scenes, filled with long moments of Crockett longingly looking at his Asian girlfriend, Crockett longingly looking at Tubbs (that felt weird), etc...Basically, not much of anything was going on except a bad script. When we finally have an action scene worth mentioning, it occurs to much toward the end. The usual blood, guns and tough guy poses. Then its quickly back to the love story. The only difference is that Crockett and his honey realize that they must go separate ways. This gets drawn out and brutally long winded. What I don't understand is why he sends her back to Havana, Cuba. OK fine. She is from there. (interesting history for an Asian woman) She is assumingly going back to her home, her house. The problem is that she is the (banished) wife of the most ruthless/strongest drug lord in South America. Won't the drug lord, at some point, find out she is still alive and at her home? Isn't Crockett sending her to her death? Trivial, yes. Excuse me.In summary: Bad script. Lack of action. Uninteresting dialog. Poor dubbing (asian girlfriend could not speak English well). Mismatch of soundtrack to plot. Choppy scenes. No chase scenes (boat nor car). Poor casting (what were you thinking with casting Barry Henley as Castillo???) Colin Farrell's Sling Blade voice. Wrong title. There was so many other things wrong with this film that I would need my own website. I believe I have said enough. Mr. Mann, please don't make a sequel. And, promise me you'll never try to make a romance movie. This one was bad enough. Oh, yeah....I want my $20 back. My wife hated it too.",Miami Vice
485,itsonlymehelen,Michael Mann Let Down,4,31 August 2006,"Sadly the names Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs are the only similarities to the original hit television series. Those going to see the film for a trip down memory lane will be bitterly disappointed like Charlie's Angels and Starsky and Hutch before it the film falls way short.Michael Mann was the perfect of not the only candidate for job as director not only does he have hits like Heat and Collateral under his belt, but he produced the original series.But he couldn't have got this more wrong despite what on the surface looks like great casting of Farrell and Foxx it doesn't work. Their relationship isn't explored or tested, the chemistry between will Smith and Martin Lawrence in Bad Boys for example doesn't exist as Crockkett and Tubbs barely exchange words in the whole two hours. The script also leaves a lot to be desired in places the plot is paper thin bordering on ridiculous, throw in some inane dialogue and by the end the question of who was leaking information isn't really answered.What should have been a slick, sexy hit descends into a jumbled mess with good actors going to waste.

486,jasonboulton-01858,Why do I love this film?,9,8 January 2021,I think the pseudo documentary feel really works for me. I actually love the cold start and also the lack of back story for Crockett and Tubbs. This is purely about the procedural aspect of an undercover operation and every actor plays his or her part to perfection. Possibly also contains my most rewatched scene over the last 15 years. The speedboat conversation from Miami to Cuba. Terrifically shot scene. All in all Heat is still the best but I rank this with Manhunter as another great piece of Michael Mann work. Great rewatch value. Have to give it a 9.,Miami Vice
487,bandana,I'm not one to normally walk out of a movie but for this I made an exception!,1,4 August 2006,"I love the TV show Miami Vice. I love Michael Mann films. I thought revamping the TV show for the big screen would be a good idea. I was wrong.The worst thing about this movie is that it makes no sense. There is no narrative logic to it. Scenes are so tediously connected. All we ever seem to know is that ""stuff"" is ""going down"". Characters have no character and their dialogue has no purpose. Some might well say in a case such as this ""you just didn't get it - this was a clever and realistic film"". It's true Michael Mann has made some mighty intelligent movies, and that's why I was convinced the film was just a slow starter. After 20 minutes I started to have my doubts. At 40 minutes I'd had enough.Yes, the movie also has pretty much nothing whatsoever to do with the TV show - aside from ""character"" names and that it's set in Miami, and a few other minor references - but this didn't bother me. I was open to something different. Open to be impressed. The only impression I got was that the film was made without a script.",Miami Vice
488,octoberth1975,I really wanted to like this film.,5,13 December 2006,"I'm a huge fan of Michael Mann's work. Heat remains the all-time best thriller I've ever seen. I came to Miami Vice expecting the same level of character detail and involvement, but found it sadly lacking. I realised, of course, that it wasn't going to be anything like the TV show, which made it feel slightly wrong that all these characters still had the same names. The film was so different in every way that I wonder what was the point of even calling it Miami Vice. It would have been better if Mann had just made a separate film about undercover cops and called it something else. Keeping that association with the TV series made it seem awkward and constrained, as though Mann was obliged to call them Crockett and Tubbs even though they don't resemble the original characters in any way. Then there's Lt. Castillo, a Latino character in the original series, with a distinctly Latino name, here played by African-American actor Barry Shabaka Henley. Again, it feels like the character is stuck with that name no matter who plays the role.Having said that, the direction and cinematography are as faultless as any Michael Mann film, and the locations are utterly astounding. The action and suspense are tight but widely spaced. Jamie Foxx was surprisingly good as Tubbs, yet Colin Farrell brought no humanity to his role whatsoever. I felt that what was missing first and foremost was dialogue between the two leads. I get the point that they've worked together so long that they don't have to say much, but they hardly say a word to each other through the whole film! They're partners, and yet most of their scenes are apart, and when they are together they just simultaneously brood. I didn't want wisecracking buddy dialogue, but something that brought out their personalities and friendship would have made me care for them a bit more. It's the little details that make a difference. In Heat, simply knowing that McCauley wants to go to Fiji gives his character some depth. In Collateral, Jamie Foxx's desire to open his own Limo service adds something to HIS character. Just a couple of tiny personal insights into Crockett and Tubbs would have done it for me. I will probably give this film a second viewing at some point, but I didn't immediately add it to my collection when the DVD came out because it didn't inspire the same excitement or involvement in the story that is usual with Michael Mann's work. In this case, it felt like the characters and director knew all they needed to know, so why bother telling us.",Miami Vice

However when friends who went to see it in the cinema's trashed it; I didn't go to the theatre for it. This weekend it was broad-casted on TV and now I know I did the right thing back then....The movie was pretty bad, I couldn't understand half of what was said, it was too long, contained some absolutely unbelievable twists and turns, and several redundant scenes. On top of this the director chooses to shoot from very weird angles to be hip or something but it was just annoying. I guess the intention was to make you feel part of the action, but that really didn't work.What was worst for me is that I didn't care for Sonny and Rico. They are not likable or even a little sympathetic.

Colin movies are always a letdown, but he's still the man, cause he's a drunken Irish playboy! Let's just say the Trailer was wayyyyy cooler than the movie!",Miami Vice
492,blakzab,"Bad beginning, strong finish",7,19 December 2006,"Thought I was going to hate Miami VICE, but in the end, I dug it. Really just another Michael Mann-cops and robbers flick, so its gotta be decent, right?The first forty minutes of the movie didn't work for me. No character development and too many confusing plots to follow. I really thought that I had accidentally skipped to half way through the movie. I was lost. But, once Crockett and Tubbs go under cover, the movie starts finally moving. Again, lots of M. Mann stuff here. Tough guys. Forbidden love. Tons of cop talk...sneering bad guys. Tense gun fights. One thing--as good as the digital photography looked, there were a few moments it looked really bad. Segments of the final gun fight often looked really cheap. But hey, it worked for the most part.",Miami Vice
493,Engineer_by_day,A nice update... Could've been a little shorter.,9,29 July 2006,"As a fan of the TV show, I was a little worried to read all the pre-release speculation that the movie was completely different. After seeing the film tonight, I'm pretty sure fans of the original will *not* be disappointed. The look and feel is updated, and it is definitely a big screen experience, but all the important ingredients are still there. To name a few... Great visual style... spotless cinematography, hip clothes and ""bling"", beautiful people, fast cars, and some nice locales. Note that the film is more graphically violent than the TV show, but it's never gratuitous and works well in context.The music... nothing cutting-edge like they did several times on TV, but the tracks were well-chosen and definitely propelled the film at key moments.The character development... impressive, considering they only had two hours. They were careful not to let the film become an ensemble thing (like the TV show tried to be at the beginning), but there were enough supporting roles fleshed out to keep it interesting. None of the characters are radically different than we remember them, so everything felt comfortable. And as you might expect with slimy underworld types, there just may be a double-cross or two in the cards.Not as a slam on the movie or on Barry Shabaka Henley, but Edward James Olmos's portrayal of Castillo back in the 80s was unmatchable. Too bad Olmos was unable/uninterested in reprising that role... it would've been sweet.My only criticism is that they could've cut a bit to keep the momentum going, particularly in the first act and in the middle. There was maybe too much on the mechanics of getting a controlled substance from Point A to Point B. And without getting too specific, there were a few times where I felt slightly embarrassed just like I did watching those cheesy made-for-TV love scenes from the 80s. We got the idea of where the scene was going... a few fade-to-black edits would've been sexier.Overall, this film is solidly entertaining and definitely has the ""coolness"" that the original had back in the day. And without spoiling anything, the ending was rewarding -- a little optimistic without being blatantly Hollywood. Just like the best of the TV show!Recommended.",Miami Vice
494,redwards29a,Better than I expected,8,30 July 2006,"I have little respect for Colin Farrell as an actor and expected this to be a Bruckheimer-esquire action flick with an empty storyline. Fortunately, I think Farrell performed better than average (perhaps the character is simply suited to him) and, while I was somewhat disappointed that Jamie Foxx is entirely underutilized, I think that the film as a whole worked rather well.A lot of the editing (particularly during action sequences) was intentionally made to look raw (unedited, really), like an episode of Cops. While I didn't hate that effect as much as I would've expected, I think that switching from highly polished to unedited was somewhat jarring. Overall, what makes the film work is the inclusion of a number of just excellent scenes that stand out from what would otherwise be a standard blow-stuff-up movie.",Miami Vice
495,rzk357,Went from bad to worse. Rotten is the word for this movie,1,25 February 2007,"Easily one of the worst films I have had the displeasure to see in a long time. Too much filler, too few action scenes, and I don't care about the inane love interest between an undercover agent and a mob cutie. Started to walk out many times, but thought the movie might finally have a reason for being. It didn't. Bad job, all the way around. For those who want to see a well-done crime action movie, go see _The Departed_. Maybe this movie should have been shot first, then everyone connected with _Miami Vice_ could have seen it and maybe figured out how it should be done.And they should have titled it something else, maybe _Slow in Miami_, rather than trying to draw on the immense popularity of the original TV series. Shame on everyone connected to this farce.",Miami Vice
496,bigheadfilms,"beautiful, vastly underrated",9,27 February 2007,"Maybe I'm reading too much into this film, but I personally think that, like Hitchcock's Vertigo, it will one day come to be appreciated as Mann's true classic. Vertigo was a flop at the box office -- and took a pretty serious critical beating as well -- when it came out. Vice is a fantastic film, with many of the reviews totally missing the mark, proving more that the reviewers lack imagination and intelligence than that the movie sucks. I've gotta add here that one critic who ""got"" it was A.O. Scott of the New York Times. Check out this tidbit from his insightful review: '""Miami Vice"" is an action picture for people who dig experimental art films, and vice versa. I'm not exaggerating about the art. Some of the most captivating sequences have an abstract quality, as if Mr. Mann were paying homage to the avant-garde, anti-narrative cinema of Stan Brakhage in the midst of a big studio production. Dispensing with the convention that the pictures exist to serve the story, Mr. Mann frequently uses plot as an excuse to construct ravishing pictures.' Well said. I would take it a step further and call the pic as much about existential crisis as about men obsessed with their work (art) above all else. One particular shot comes to mind regarding this: Crockett and Tubbs are in a criminal's seaside home trying to convince him to rat out a drug dealer. We're just several scenes into the movie at this point, and Mann has spared us any of the usual expository crap most Hollywood hacks think us dummies in the audience need to fall into a story. But as Tubbs is talking to this dude, Sonny, for just a moment, gazes out the big bay windows that reveal the infinite ocean beyond. Then he looks back at Tubbs, and Mann cuts right back to a wide shot and we're back in the story proper. It's just an instant, but in that instant, the whole tale is foreshadowed. Sonny is discontent. He's a kick-ass cop, totally dedicated to his work, but in this moment, we see the little crack that will lead him to risk everything--his life, the lives of others, millions of dollars, his career--for a woman, a drug dealer, later in the film. Criticisms of the movie's lack of coherent plot really miss the mark (aside from confusing ""story"" with ""plot""). The movie is about Miami, the romance and death and beauty and terror of the place. The characters and their little stories, as Sonny realizes in that one shot, are insignificant.",Miami Vice
497,bigbudgetplease,Bizarre,5,28 July 2006,"Something happened during the shooting of Miami Vice. Or perhaps it was during the editing. Michael Mann's polish and sense of structure is gone. The film begins far too quickly, then slows down with intermittent, short sequences of action, and finishes with a well choreographed albeit confusing shoot out.At this point in his career it seems impossible for Michael Mann to make an absolute mess of a film. Miami Vice isn't bad, it just could have been far better. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx, along with the rest of the cast, are solid but their characters are shallow, which is bizarre for a Mann piece. Everyone feels like they're back from a sequel where we should know more about their characters (and being as there is very little in common with the television series, this hurts the piece even more). Gong Li and Colin Farrell's romance is never really fleshed out and Foxx and his wife/girlfriend have no real chemistry. The story is also confusing, made worse by what could have been a poor audio mix (or perhaps my theater wasn't set properly). There's a lot technical jargon used which lends itself to realism, but at times can detract from the clarity of the storyline.The cinematography is stunning and every bit as gritty as that of Collateral. However, in the final sequence something happens to the picture (looks as if they switched to 30p as opposed to 24p) and the end result is a look similar to that of high budget student productions. The sound is also strangely incomplete. In the final shoot out, the same ricochet sound effect can be heard three or four times (however the weapons sound fantastic). A lot of the scenes are completely without ambiance or footsteps (which might have been a creative choice). Mann also goes with Audioslave and similar sounding bands throughout most of the piece which work in some scenes and get repetitive and detract from others.Mann's Collateral was perfection in the crime genre. We followed two characters closely instead of five or six bland outlines of ones. The soundtrack and cinematography worked together to create a gritty look at the night side of LA. We felt for Collateral's Max and Vincent. Tubbs and Crockett are shallow and make the action less compelling. Miami Vice feels hollow, rushed, and incomplete by comparison to Collateral. The action, which I'm guessing is what most of the audience will be paying for, is fast, realistic, and thrilling, but badly paced in the larger scope of the picture.Overall, I am glad I saw Miami Vice in theaters. It's nice to see Mann continue to make mature summer actioners, but I hope he returns to more intimate character pieces and infuse his furious and kinetic action in a better story.",Miami Vice
498,franciscoluis-brandao,Thought it would be a good movie worth watching,4,28 August 2006,"A waste of my money and my time. Why the endless sex scenes? You only need one minute to get the point that they're not impotent. Why the ugly chick? If you were a drug baron wouldn't you hang out with a better looking girl. Why do they keep staring at each other every time they speak? Whey have a conversation of two lines then look at each other for like 5 minutes. If they took the staring and the sex scenes the movie would be half the time, needless to say that Collin Farrel sucks. The movie could be so much better if the dialog was more elaborated and the story had a little more content, this way it's just another action movie, you could put Eddie Murphy and Vin Diesel in it and it would be just the same.",Miami Vice
499,the_hurricane15,Appropriate title...,3,31 July 2006,"I realize I am going to be criticized for what I say, but Miami Vice was a terrible movie. The key word here is ""movie"". I'll break everything down as best as I can to validate this.The Acting - Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx. Let's start there. Jamie Foxx is a wonderful actor. I have nothing but respect for the guy. Colin Farrell, however, I feel to be type-casted into these kind of roles. Both of these actors, no matter how good they may have been in the past, brought nothing to these roles. After numerous attempts, Colin Farrell still cannot bring out his American accent. This is known as he has to stop talking every sentence, to regain the accent. This means all of his dialogue has to be short and quick, nothing flows. Jamie Foxx wasn't used to his potential. In fact, he had hardly any screen time - at least compared to Farrell. Together, they didn't have very good chemistry, for the main fact, that they hardly talked to each other. The other actors weren't bad (and I'm not saying Farrell and Foxx were bad, I am saying they weren't fit for these roles - which isn't entirely their fault). Gong Li was very hard to understand from time to time, as were some of the other characters - something that needed to be worked on.The Script - This is where I feel the movie went astray. I found the script to be terrible. It jumped around from pointless scene to pointless scene without establishing anything that happened. We are brought into the beginning of the movie (which is actually like half way through a bust). There is nothing wrong with this, except that they don't break to establish character. Without establishing the character, one cannot empathize with them in their struggles against the opposing forces. While watching, I wasn't terribly involved in these characters, who kind of, just appeared from no where. I do understand the characters are from the TV Show, but even in the movie, some separate character development needs to happen. I also found the dialogue to be very forced and cliché. There were scenes that almost seemed like they were trying to top previous scenes with the number of cliché sentences said. I actually stopped watching after a certain line (to which I cannot remember at this time) and turned to a friend to comment ""Who the hell says that anymore?"". My forgetting of this line just proves how things like this wouldn't come up in regular conversation. Also, the scenes seemed to jump around for no reason, showing shots of this and that, or with these characters, which had no use. I'd be a little more specific but I don't want to contain any spoilers. Overall, the script was very rushed and haphazard. It didn't follow suite with the previous portions of the movie and was very monosyllabic (as far as sentences go - ""How fast does that boat go?"" ""Very fast"")The Directing/Cinematography - This is where my opinion of the movie differs. I really enjoyed how Michael Mann captured this movie. I loved the DV effects, and the smooth blend of film with the DV. The camera styles worked (although sometimes the shaky cam got a bit over-used) but generally, it all fit. He definitely knows his way around a camera. I am proud of this movie for this one fact. I actually give kudos to Mr. Mann for making it so aesthetically pleasing.But sadly, beautiful visuals don't make up for average acting and a flimsy script. This movie has very enjoyable action scenes and beautiful cinematography, but as an overall movie, it was quite flawed. Overall, I'd give this movie 3/10. It never lived up to the potential, and that, I found, to be quite disappointing.",Miami Vice
500,adam262,Worst Movie so far this year.,3,5 August 2006,I have been to tons and tons of movies at the theaters and I hate to say it but this was the first movie I've ever walked out of.I was lost after the first five minutes due to poor writing. And no I'm not just stupid and cant get it because I was always the one explaining The Matrix to everyone. The movie just starts and it seems as though You've just joined in on watching a movie half way over. You cant hear what they are saying half the time and there's a constant humming noise in the movie whenever music isn't playing.Then they just go from one thing to the next without explaining half of it and the only thing that saved this movie from receiving a 1 was the great visuals it had.Being a huge Michael Mann fan I hate to say this but I honestly want my money back after this poor excuse for a movie.,Miami Vice
501,amused_idiot,Pile of ****,1,20 August 2006,"Action = hardly any. The last 20 minutes is the only remotely interesting part and the whole movie is just dull throughout in terms of plot and script and acting. The love scenes were passionless and it even seemed that Gong Li was trying to avoid kissing or even getting close to Colin Farrell. I know English isn't her mother tongue but it was still pretty difficult trying to understand what she was saying. The background music was just all over the place and didn't fit the mood and some close ups on the actors faces (used to portray emotion or subtle personality traits) were poorly done. Jamie Foxx was good....for the scenes he was in - which is not much since he's only featured in the movie in about a total of 20 shots. There also lacked scenes of Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell being together and it was hard to figure out that they were supposed to be best friends which is what Miami Vice is supposed to be about. All in all, the casting was OK but the script, editing, in fact everything was just downright dull. At least throw us a catchy phrase to mimic?",Miami Vice
502,vic_mackey_uk,Film didn't deliver what the trailer promised.,6,1 December 2006,"I was a big fan of the TV series, but after Starsky & Hutch, and all the other remakes, I left my preconceptions at the door.I wanted to like the film, as I have enjoyed previous work of Farrell, Foxx and Mann - I can't think of a previous Mann film I didn't like. I've watched Heat and The Insider numerous times.As has been mentioned, I also found the sound quality poor. I had to turn on the subtitles - yep, sorry, watched it on DVD. I also thought some of the shots were too dark. But my main gripe was that neither of the lead characters engaged me...for at least 40 minutes, and then not to any great degree.Neither character had any great redeeming trait or fatal flaw on which to hang my emotional hat. De Niro's character in Heat leaving the glass wrapped in a napkin by his girlfriend's bed. Overweight Crowe putting a point of principle before his own welfare in The Insider.To my recollection, Tubbs' introduction to the TV series had him as a leering drunk in a skin bar, before he was revealed as an undercover cop. Crockett was soon apologising for Elvis the pet allegator on his boat for being too aggressive. Two small scenes, but right away you have some emotional investment in the character.Mann is an experienced filmmaker, so I can only assume he intended what was on my TV, unless the studio intervened? I will always be a fan, but it's a shame nevertheless.",Miami Vice

That is all I can say about this movie. A bad good metaphor is all I can come up with. That says more than anything really. There are a few sex scenes which somewhat make up for the otherwise poorly executed screenplay. Give me the salami that is Don Johnson any time.

I went with a friend to go see m vice and we couldn't follow what was going on and we consider ourselves to be movie buffs.We walked out of the showing to talk to the manager and tell him and the movie started late but he insisted it started on time. I then told him we couldn't understand what was going on and that we weren't slow or anything either. Well after talking with manager for a bit we took his word for it that it was running normally.I was then trying to pay attention to what was going on but the lack of flow kept me form getting into the movie. the film's constant choppy editing was irritating, and i felt the acting was pretty bad to boot from the main stars of the movie. I'm then thinking Farrell and Foxx are A list actors what the heck are these guys doing acting in such a awkward way.

505,mj_882,Direction over Story,6,21 December 2006,"I had only recently had the opportunity to view this movie and was really curious to see why it had received so many mixed reviews. I'll get straight into, a lot of people claim that critics have cut the film a lot of slack because it's a Michael Mann movie. On the contrary, I think the only reason why it wasn't well received was because there had been an immense comparison with his previous films.Anyways, I thought it was a mediocre movie albeit several vital flaws. The story was way too underdeveloped and wasn't really engaging, certainly not one of the pros of the movie. Another shock from Mann were his to lead characters. They lacked any sort of charisma and were portrayed with wooden performances. Miami Vice is quite character-oriented and to rely on 2 dimensional characters wasn't very wise. If the script had been a little more interested and perhaps a bit more energy in the characters, it would have redeemed itself a lot! However, what shine was the cinematography, it was beautifully shot, no doubt about that. The direction of the film was the best thing. It's as if Michael Mann tried to experiment with how he could redeem a poor script with excellent directing. Test Result: The Story is the essence.I give this film 6/10, that is being quite generous but it was a mediocre movie.",Miami Vice

I kept waiting for the theme song or even the P.Collins interlude but nope, I kept looking for Pink Flamingo's and sunshine down the strip but nope, 80's disco...close but nope. I do wish that they would have taken it back to the 80's in some ways, but I'm not detracting from the movie. Some great car/gun scenes, even the wife liked it, basically my only downer is that I was going into it hoping for other similarities to the show, but the drama, the pull between love and crime, the close in faces... it was gripping, just wanted a little more ""Vice"" visually.",Miami Vice
508,GuardianAngels,A Very Nice Summer Flick!,7,21 August 2006,"20 years later Michael Mann made a good movie based on the TV series Miami Vice. In prime time, the TV series was soft, toned down and today looks nerdy. For the cinema the movie is different : a dark thriller, violent, strong characters and pretty well filmed with some grainy and shaking pictures that make them look more realistic plus some very nice pictures filmed at night. For the non-initiated people, the lines are more difficult to understand so the script and the story could be confusing. Some cops infiltrating powerful gangs of drug dealers must be up to it : Ferrari F430 Spider, powerboats, jet, designer clothes, nice dance clubs, ... The first scene sets the tone then gives rhythm : trap, explosions, hostage. Witty cops Foxx and Farrell make a great team showing solidarity (it looks like they were cops forever), Foxx is good, Farrell rocks and he is drop-dead gorgeous! Each tracks from the soundtracks were interesting. 2 hours flew! The critics always give Mann's films good reviews as they don't want to look stupid (as they know MM is a highly intelligent director) which misleads the everyday movie-going fans (of average intellect) into thinking they might be enjoyable, blockbuster films so they inevitably come away disappointed. That's maybe why the today votes show 12% of 1/10. Good movie for the ones who liked the TV series, Collateral or Heat. Otherwise steer clear of this one. 7/10",Miami Vice
509,penatr8,Could've been good,4,1 August 2006,"I expected a lot better from Michael Mann.There was very little interaction between the two main characters.

There wasn't much and most of it was just cop movie clichés.cop cliché long break cop cliché break villain cliché break love dialogue cliché breaketc etc etc GAHThere is almost no exposition. You are *introduced* to Foxx and Farrell and 5 minutes into the movie they jump into the main plot. Thats it... There is very very little development of the characters so you don't really care about them.The editing is strange. There's a lot of cuts that just happen and it goes scene to scene with no transition of any kind.Its too long.Thats about it",Miami Vice
510,baz1779,"Keep clear, it's a stinker!",1,15 September 2007,"I cannot stress how bad this movie is people. Mann should be ashamed of himself, churning out this rubbish, after creating a masterpiece such as Heat, and thoroughly enjoyable movies like collateral, Last of the Mohicans, The Insider and Thief.Firstly, I'll mention about the character progression. Wow, hold up. What Character progression? As far as Michael Mann is concerned we know and love these characters already from the TV show in the 80's where Mann was an Executive Producer. OK, someone tell Mann that there had been a gap of 16 years since the show ended and the when this movie was made. The action takes without any back story (hence no character progression), so young fans never had a chance. Just for the older die-hard fans I suppose.And yes, I am old enough to have seen a few episodes and found Don Johnson (Crockett) and Philip Michael Thomas (Tubbs) a lot more engaging. It epitomized the 80's with the clothes, the hair, the cars, the women and the fabulous weather you came to expect from Miami. Got to warn ya, all gone in the movie (Weathers OK).The plot basically evolves around (wait for it), drugs (couldn't of seen that one coming), and how Crockett and Tubbs have to go undercover to infiltrate a gang of Cuban drug lords. Easily done I might add.That brings me to the two leads in this film. Now we have Colin Farrell as Sonny Crockett and Jamie Foxx as Ricardo Tubbs. As far as Colin goes, it was a very wooden performance (Surprise, Surprise. He does try so very hard). He wasn't helped by a poor script but he's not exactly Oscar material. On the other hand, Jamie Foxx is,(winning for ""Ray"" in the biopic of Ray Charles and Oscar nominated for another Mann film, Collateral)and his performance wasn't much better either and as a pair, their was no chemistry, and at times, you could be forgiven for thinking these characters just met.With the supporting cast, which could only be described as dead weight, you have Gong Li as Isabella who's parents were Asian who emigrated to Cuba. She was the undoubtedly the worst character on show, who was only more than willing to betray the people she worked for and start a relationship with Crockett (Farrell)and give him all the information he needed (no plot twist here then). The Chemistry between these actors was awful, and the sex scenes felt so awkward and messy and really slowed whatever progression the plot had left. One thing I cant understand is how Crockett could have been so unprofessional as to have a relationship with her, even ignoring advice from his ""Partner"" to ease up. More evidence that the new Crockett and Tubbs couldn't care less about each other.Naomi Harris seemed to play a very masculine character, who had been through the wars in this film and nearly didn't make it in the end. She was beaten,blown-up and nearly shot by her own man. Big who cares. I had my fingers crossed that she would be killed. She really went down a notch in my estimation after this annoying performance (again, bad script), but was saved by a good performance in Pirates of the Caribbean: DMC.As for the rest of the cast. Not worth mentioning. The soundtrack was poor (with exception of Linkin Park, but used poorly), shoot outs were badly executed which all added up to a boring and very frustrating evening for me and the people I had come to see this with.There is one good thing to come out of this though (yes, one). I really thought the cinematography was beautifully shot, especially some scenes that took place at night.Doesn't save it though, and I'm glad it bombed at the box-office which took in a mere $63 Million as opposed to costing $135 Million to make. Complete waste of money.",Miami Vice

It is very, very tightly told, I have never seen better pacing in a movie. You don't get long soliloquies or dialogues, you just get the characters as they are, and through the movie you see why they are who they are.I have rarely seen as intense a performance as that given by Farrell in this movie. Foxx shines brightly as well, but IMO Farrell gives one of his best performances here.The mise en scène is faultless. The camera-work, choice of camera and film itself, everything is amazing.

However, knowing Mann's body of work, doing some research on the film, on themes, etc. I began to think more and more about it. After a week of this I saw it again, alone, in a theater and loved it. It's a deep film, deeper than you might at first believe. It must be viewed more than once. The first time you see it, you will probably be a bit confused and unsatisfied. But after some time, let it digest and see it again. It will come together and be a beautiful film. the final shootout is a great example of this. The performances are under stated to be sure, especially Farrell, who really does a magnificent job. He outshines Foxx, though to his defense Jamie doesn't have quite as much to do. The biggest and MOST IMPORTANT THING to remember is that this is not an adaptation, nor is it an update. It is a totally fresh story with the characters, based in the 21st century. I'd also urge you to really listen to the music, the soundtrack is a notch above many films. Also the sharp colors of the fabulous HD cameras, and some of the sexiest kill scenes in a long time.

It was very hard to understand the actors most of whom seemed to mumble. To many long scenes of boating, driving and flying. There were many scenes that were too long and going no place. We would be asking each other like who was that and are they the good guys or bad guys. We could not tell at some points who were the good cops and who were the drug dealers. There would be scenes with an person in it and then you never see them again. This movie in no way reminded me of Miami Vice from days of old. No comparison. I hope they do not do a second one.

The reason for this, other than the nice cinematography, is Jamie Foxx. In his past several films (barring Stealth, which no one saw) he has delivered consistent and intense performances. Clearly Mann recognized this in ""Collateral"" (and so did the Academy). His impassioned killing rampage at the end of the film, avenging the injury to his beloved wife, is one of the only truly compelling scenes in the film. While Farrell's lines can seem forced and unnatural, his background performance in the film is really what allows it to function.While the digital film can sometimes distract the viewer, as there are clear differences to that of regular film types, it ends up looking beautiful and helping to intensify the action scenes. Overall, I approve of Mann's latest action film, and would recommend it despite its flaws.",Miami Vice
516,Bulletta,"So very, very disappointing.",4,2 March 2007,"I have to commend Michael Mann. It's not often that one goes to see a film with so much going on without anything vaguely interesting occurring on screen.Instead of exciting plot twists, good dialogue and stunning cinematography, Miami Vice is a baffling cavalcade of bad music, lengthy shots of fast vehicles driving around, dull sex scenes and utterly pointless digital shots. It was honestly a bit like watching a two hour music video.Which is a shame really, as Michael Mann's not a terrible director. I guess he just phoned this one in.",Miami Vice
517,jipokowalski,Undeserving of the backlash,7,19 December 2006,"OK so it's flabby in the middle and Colin Farrell's hair and 'tach are ridiculous but come on, it's an update of Miami Vice for god's sake. The show that gave us Don Johnson in a pastel coloured suit with the sleeves rolled up worn over a tshirt complete with loafers and white socks AND made us like it. Vice detectives driving sports cars and speed boats all the while modelling the dodgier fashion of the day is what the TV series was all about. Mann has successfully taken this and the other core of the TV series, Crockett and Tubbs' friendship and partnership through the strain that their work puts on their personal lives, and given us the most beautifully filmed piece of po-faced macho action since Heat.Unfortunately slap in the middle of it he has put a nicely filmed, well played, romantic sojourn to Cuba complete with jazz bands, sultry dancing and family stories that could have been fifteen minutes shorter. On this point I agree with the film's many critics; the film loses almost all the dramatic momentum built up by the whirlwind action of the first act and struggles to recover.The other big problems that critics seemed to have with the film were the dialogue and the relationship between Crocket and Tubbs.The fast police/criminal jargon that makes up the majority of the film's dialogue is typical of any police procedural we see on TV, Mann has just removed the slabs of mumbling exposition designed to keep the disinterested viewer up to speed. This, in my opinion at least, is no bad thing.And the relationship between the leads is not the main focus of the film as the characters are not unknowns. They need no introduction to the audience or to each other. With this in mind the audience is dropped straight into the narrative with a bang. That said the few revealing moments of non business orientated dialogue that they share together are downplayed, fleeting and typical of Mann's flair for no nonsense sentiment. There is no caricatured emotional outburst or teary epiphany, just trust, honesty and a sense of duty.Finally, credence must be given to all involved for making a thoroughly huge film. Every frame of the film is dripping with scope and style from go fast boats to planes over the jungle through to one of the best gunfights committed to (not) celluloid, Miami Vice has got everything in spades. The startling digital photography seems to be dividing audiences but after ten seconds of Collateral I was sold on it and Miami Vice seals the deal. Scenes shot in near total darkness make palettes of orange, blue and black where previously there would have been only a blurred mess. HD is the future.All in all Mann and co. have made a thoroughly enjoyable, if a touch over indulgent, action film that doesn't pander to the ""stupid action film"" audience but is still a bit too light dramatically for the more discerning viewer. However if you are a fan of Mann's previous work there is plenty here to make it worthy of the admission price.",Miami Vice
518,mdbeck,"Unresolved plot lines, lack of chemistry, very, very bad!",1,6 August 2006,"I don't want to reiterate what has already been said. I agree with most posts completely. The plot lines are left unresolved. The sex scenes gratuitous and boring. I saw this with my 17 year old son who I would imagine was part of core demographics the producers were targeting, and he thought it was awful as well. Not even the sex scenes had him looking very interested.The question I have is one which I've not seen addressed or asked. Is it really believable that the police would let a car exit a crime scene without even attempting to stop it? When Crockett gets into the car with Gong Li's character (can't even recall her name), it doesn't appear that he's given a second glance. There were police around, cars entering the dock, parking lot, wherever it was that they were, and he was simply permitted to leave. No one even looked twice at the car.I went with high hopes, and they were dashed. I did enjoy the music in the opening rave scene. I liked the boats, and enjoyed very much when the Nazi type was blown away before he got to launch into what I thought was going to be a boring tirade. The woman sitting next to me checked her watch at least a dozen times. This movie was tedious, and far too long.",Miami Vice

The TV series was all about clarity, colour, sound and tone. Each week's plot was fully resolved by the end of the episode: the boys get some undercover info, go on a stake-out, make a deal, cut some quips, get in a spot of trouble and eventually arrest the bad guys. Sure this has the usual fast cars, boats and planes carrying the ubiquitous drugs, thugs and double dealing villains. Except you know the plot's in serious trouble when it has more shoot-outs than you can shake a six-gun at. This re-make is so slick you'll think you've just been pork-barreled by a politician on the re-election trail. Case in point, who was leaking the info to the cartel and why (God no, please, not a sequel, haven't we suffered enough)? Two final thoughts. The fake blood splatter on the hand held camera lens was bad enough, but would you really pick anyone up and carry them to the back seat of a car right after they may have sustained a serious back injury? And lets not even mention the coma awakening scene that looked like an Acting 101 exercise. Save yourself the time, trouble and effort and (re)watch the TV series instead.",Miami Vice
520,robert-spears,"If you enjoyed the original, you will love this remake.",10,9 August 2006,"With the exception of two scenes, I absolutely loved this movie. It had all the chemistry and action of the original series, combined with an updated look and sound. All the high tech toys are there, the fast cars, boats, and beautiful looking women. But also tossed in was the violence of the 21st century, as well as the corruption that is a part of every day life. Everyone today is the enemy, everyone cheats, lies, and can be bought; from the FBI to the local drug runner. The only thing you can count on is your partner, and the gun in your hand. So while this movie will NOT win any awards, it is a must see for those who enjoyed the MV of old. Also, if you enjoy the check your brain at the door style movie, this movie should be on the top five to go see. You will not be spoon fed some director's mantra, or some producer's political opinion. ...AND THANK GOD !!!",Miami Vice
521,t-h-flint,Sadly no heat,4,9 September 2006,"Michael Mann has made something of a rod for his own back; having given the world one of the greatest cop thrillers of all time in Heat, Mann now has the unenviable task of attempting to live up to or surpass this remarkable movie every time. Miami Vice falls well short.It is a brave attempt - the dialogue is cursive and punchy, the action sequences are well choreographed and atmospheric, and the film as a whole is a visual and auditory feast - but Mann is let down by his storyline and his casting. Jamie Foxx plays intense and moody, and the knowing interplay between him and Colin Farrell's eyebrows is occasionally entertaining, but isn't enough to support a film of this length. Neither is the plot, which meanders around aimlessly, its excuse clearly being that ""this is what the world is really like"". If I wanted the real world, I'd watch a documentary.Nor do the characters prove capable of remotely plausible relationships; the huge strength of Heat was its ability to involve you intimately in the lives of its protagonists. Miami Vice presents a glamorous superficial picture of glamorous superficial coupling, accompanied by great stunts and the obligatory excellent soundtrack.It's a peculiarly unsatisfying movie, underlining perhaps the issues Michael Mann faces in representing human relationships effectively. If this absence doesn't bother you, you will certainly watch very few better demonstrations of the mechanics of a cop thriller. Ultimately, it lacks the emotional depth required to make its mark in the same league as its illustrious predecessor.",Miami Vice
522,timivers,The worst film in 2006,1,28 July 2006,Okay lets just say i was so excited to see Miami Vice I almost went to the midnight showing on a work night. Fortunately i didn't lose any sleep over this one. THIS MOVIE WAS SO BAD we walked out of the theater one hour into it. Where do I start my rant?... First off where was the opening credits??? Does Michael Mann think he's too cool for intros. The script was dull and unimaginative. The acting was HORRIBLE. the plot was uneventful and confusing.... I can't continue with this review this movie was so bad. At least the television series was entertaining. This movie just sucks! I've wasted enough time on this one. Bottomline I wouldn't even rent it on DVD.,Miami Vice
523,danielladongsbury,Not Your Typical Michael Mann film (in the bad sense),4,10 August 2006,"Now, before you start reading this, don't thing that i'm your generic Miami Vice or Michael Mann hater. Don't get me wrong, i loved Collateral and Heat. They were both 2 fantastically put together films, character development was just right, and the directing skills and cinematography were just amazing. But this, unfortunately, had none of that.The large proportion of the scenes were shot in such a way that you didn't care about what was going on in the film at all. The acting was bad, but not as bad as the acting in any Uwe Bolll film, crappy made-for-TV films and Poseidon. The action scenes were just so fake it was unreal, and the sex scenes, i felt, were not needed at all.The only thing in this film that sold it for me is the script. You cannot fault Michael Mann's superb screenplay writing ability. It's just unfortunate that the rest of it let it down.If this film was written by Michael Mann, and directed by someone else, then it would have been far better.",Miami Vice
524,jmosser-99099,Disgrace to the franchise,1,5 March 2017,"As a fan of the original series, I was beyond disappointed. When I heard they were making a 'vice' movie, I was excited. There's so much material and fertile ground to work with, that you have to really try hard to make a bad film based on Miami vice. The film makers succeeded in doing just that. First off the casting. You can't underestimate the impact Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas had in making the show such a huge hit. Even without great acting, just on visual appeal alone they were very intriguing. If you get that part wrong, you ruin the whole thing and that is what happened here. Apparently Jamie Foxx suggested this film to Mann after working with him in Ali. This pretty much guaranteed the part of Tubbs to Foxx, dooming this picture from the start. I think Foxx may be the most over rated actor of the past decade. While certainly not Oscar-worthy, he did do a decent job of portraying Ray Charles, but I have never been able to take him seriously as an actor and any time I see his face I keep waiting for some buffoonish punchline ala in living color or the Jamie Foxx show. He comes across as cheesy and fake and it is impossible to take him seriously in any dramatic role. With humor being his strong suit, you would think they would have given him a couple of jokes, as even the original Tubbs had his share of punchlines, but Foxx remains overly serious and stiff throughout. It was rumored that Will Smith was considered and he would have suited the role of Tubbs much better. Colin Farrell makes an equally bad Sonny Crockett. Part of Crockett's appeal was the fact that he was a plain spoken all American guy working in a vibrant international city. Put in a foreign looking guy with a foreign accent and it just doesn't work as well. Apparently Don Johnson himself suggested Ferrell. What was he thinking? Another element of the TV series appeal was the surrounding characters. Zito and Switek. Gina and Trudy. And of course Lt. Castillo. In the movie, these characters are completely under developed or nonexistent.As for the plot, it was throw away. Generic international smuggler routine taking us around the globe. The beauty of vice was it's focus on Miami. There's so much potential for juicy plot lines right there that there's no need to go overseas. The villains in the TV series, although stereotypical, were very colorful and more believable to the city. The Italian mafia goons, Cubano, Colombian and Jamaican villains that inhabited Miami in the TV series should have been reprised here. Instead they chose to go for a non believable neo nazi type. What white supremacist would ever live in Miami? the least white major city in America.While the cinematography was okay, it did not do the legacy of Miami Vice justice. The original Miami Vice was criticized for style over substance. The movie took away the cool style and left zero substance. What made Vice so iconic was the bright sunny Miami backdrops. Beach scenes, beautiful women, groundbreaking wardrobe and awesome houses cars and boats. They would do scenes right on Ocean Drive surrounded by highly recognizable Miami landmarks. They were known for using bright neon and art deco colors. In the film they went for low lighting and dark and grey color schemes. Gone are the neon cityscapes, bright south-beach scenes and the beautiful women. Take all that away and Miami vice just isn't Miami vice. The digital photography gave the film a feeling of a bad reality TV show. The Miami of the 80's was fast paced, dangerous, and is remembered as a mythical time. By setting the film in modern times it just becomes somewhat stale and boring, but even with a modern day setting it could have been way more interesting and entertaining than it was. The pacing and lack of action in this movie are inexcusable especially with 100 million plus budget. The great thing about the TV show was the high action. The fist fights, the shootouts, the car chases, the boat chases, the explosions. The movie overlooked these almost entirely and opted for blood and violence just for violence sake. While the TV show had a lot of killing, there was a lot less blood. More of the actual violence was left to the imagination.Overall, the movie is Miami Vice in name only. They very loosely follow the formula of the original in that it is set in Miami, there are smugglers to be caught and the bad guys get killed. But they do this without any of the charm that the show so masterfully employed in getting us from point a to point b. The eye candy and the danger of Miami at the time, laced with a little bit of humor, an authentic Miami feel, a clever twist at the end with some folksy cop wisdom of lessons learned by Sonny usually followed by a catchy phrase, beautiful Miami sunset and credits. I think part of this movies problem is that it takes itself too seriously while the series was somewhat tongue in cheek. They have done a great disservice to the franchise. People who never saw the show will think 'what was all the hype about Miami vice' and people who did see the show will assume the film makers were trying to distance themselves too much from the original. The film doesn't stand alone on it's own merits or in comparison to it's predecessor. It shows that Mann probably had little to do with the TV show's success. Then when it came time to do the movie he really had nothing. They had one shot to get this right as the 20 year nostalgia cycle was coming around and they completely blew it.Skip this movie, especially if you liked the series.",Miami Vice
525,pulpfaction06,Great Cop Flick,8,31 July 2006,"Why don't we get past the cons of Miami Vice. Character development is poor, and the plot is standard cop stuff. Okay, I believe thats the worst you can say about it. You got fast cars, fast boats, guns, and girls. Thats what your going to this movie for, and because Michael Mann is in charge of this film, its above average, its near the top. It's filmed dark, gritty, its done realistically. When so many action movies are out now, with impossible stunts, and bullet dodging, like Mann's Heat and Collateral the action is believable.Like I mentioned its dark, the times that we are offered any light hearted moments are in the love scenes between the two leads and there women. Cause outside of thesex, these men have to be tough, and believable to the drug dealers,suppliers, etc.Colin Farrel is in the lead in the movie, Jamie Foxx is too, but as you watch Farrel is definitely the main player in the film. And while character development is weak, we have to remember there two cops undercover. Foxx doesn't really need to grow as a character he knows what he has to do and what he needs, the little character growth there is, comes from Farrel, and his relationship with Gong Li.While this film is not perfect, in this persons opinion it has enough grittiness, beautiful people, and gun fire to satisfy anyone with taste, and enough twist and turns, and suspense to keep you pinned to your seat.",Miami Vice
526,gavin-boyter,A fair balance between style and substance,7,10 August 2006,"Never having been a fan of the TV series (but I confess to never having seen an entire episode), I had no expectations going in, except to be entertained with Mann's customary flair for terse dialogue and stunning visuals. And on that level, I wasn't disappointed. I'd also read that the film wastes no time establishing any backstory for the uninitiated, and so it proves. In Zen-like fashion Crockett and Tubbs simply ARE, which allows the film to kick off in the thick of the action.The best way to watch this film is as a police procedural, with a side order of oddly yearning romanticism. No concessions are made to the audience in terms of explaining the cops terminology and the limited exposition is justified as one group of criminals explaining how their operation works to their new collaborators. Once you realise that you don't have to register every nuance and detail to appreciate the plot, you can sit back and enjoy some eerily beautiful Hi-Def cinematography. Petrol-heads and fans of unfeasibly fast motorboats will also find much to enjoy. The ""mojitos in Havana"" romantic interlude was a pleasant surprise, with Farrell having to flex more than just his eyebrows to convince us that this probably is the ultimate first date.The jury's still out for me on Mann's use of music. The blaring MOR rock fits stylistically but can cheapen some scenes. And it would be nice to more scenes soundtracked by near-silence, as is achieved very effectively in a stake-out/rescue scenario later in the film.Farrell and Foxx do work well together, indeed its refreshing to have a cop pairing without all the cutesy buddy stuff. Nevertheless, when one tells the other ""I will never doubt you"" it's almost a statement of love, coming as it does out of a void of professionalism.The parallel-plotting is a little overdone, with not one but two ""lover in jeopardy"" scenes and the dialogue could have been better layered/mixed for clarity, given the obscure nature of some of the procedural references. However, much of the dialogue was laugh-aloud funny in its Mamet-like moments (did he perform a polish?) and Mann's action direction is of course superb. Great sound design too in the final shootout scene.Engrossing and enjoyable but not as emotionally involving as Heat or as kinetic as Collateral.",Miami Vice
527,jonesjulia,A Wasted Opportunity,2,27 December 2006,"A respected director, respected actors and a rather weak and shallow script. It is difficult for even the most dedicated of cinephiles to follow what exactly is going on and the film culminates in a cringe-inducing showdown and predictable ending. I'm sorry, but this is a cautionary tale for filmmakers, and evidence that even the most skilled of directors can make mistakes.The stylistic devices themselves seemed to be desperate attempts to salvage some merit from the threadbare and entirely disengaging story. Unfortunately, the use of blood-splatter on the camera lenses (a technique usually reserved for self-reflexive films rather than mainstream Hollywood productions)served to completely draw the viewer from their suspension of disbelief and to ask themselves the urgent question that dominates the experience of watching the film, 'Why?'.What a waste of a potentially fantastic film.",Miami Vice
528,ryohara,"What happened here? This movie had so much promise, and it was a disappointment",4,1 August 2006,"I was with my friends one night, and we just watched Heat (another Michael Mann film), and we decided to go see Miami Vice, thinking it would easily be just as creative, exciting, and thrilling as heat. Let's just say it was the complete opposite. I didn't like how the movie just started up. Was that Michael Mann's way of being creative, and steering away from the cliché? I think the big problem with this film was the story. It really wasn't that great of a story to tell. In comparison to Heat, the story essentially was about police officers pretending to be drug dealers to shut down a big wig drug lord. Midway through the movie, they changed their goal, but then decided to take down the old goal anyways. It just didn't make that much sense. The soundtrack was very annoying as well. I found myself wanting it to end in the movie theater because I got bored with the same idea over and over again. After seeing that movie, I'm going to have to look behind me when I shower because every main character in that movie had a sex scene in the shower. What was the point of this? Overall I was disappointed because I expected Michael Mann to make another ""Bad Ass"" cop flick. There was no connection with the characters, no main events that made sense, and an overall conflict that is never clearly defined (too many sub-plots). Basically the movie is The Fast and Furious minus the cars and plus the drugs. If you're looking for that, enjoy, but if you're looking for a well made dramatic action thriller, stay away from this one.",Miami Vice
529,JamesXabregas,The Vice Of Mann,6,11 August 2006,"I'm not sure if I missed something with this movie but it is clearly not in the same league as Heat or Collateral.Miami Vice does many things right. Michael Mann the director, does an extremely good job in creating a gritty and atmospheric movie. Michael Man the writer however, appeared to be checking into a rehab clinic for One Liners Anonymous. Jamie Foxx appears to have no purpose in this film other then reciting one liners for the movie trailer. Colin Farell is an empty shell with a bad haircut and a nice suit.This is a plot driven film, and the plot isn't that bad, it's actually quite good. The problem is that we don't know anything about the characters in this movie that would make us care about them and this severely effects the impact of the film. It actually seems like the most important character's are the least developed of all. We literally know nothing about Sony and Ricco other then the fact that they are under cover cops. How can you care about a character that doesn't exist?Now I've read some crazy theories that compare Michael Mann to auteurs of French New Wave cinema. The claim basically boils down to this: the characters aren't explicitly spelt out, they are all revealed through pensive looks over the grainy Miami skyline and subtle inflections in voice that reveal their true intentions and feelings. That's a nice theory and it may be valid one, but it doesn't make Miami Vice a good film. I didn't go to watch a French film, I went to watch an American film. I want to see characters with troubled pasts learn valuable lessons about the nature of life, death and love right before things begin to explode in a stylistic, over exposed neon glow. I don't want to watch ill defined puppets stare into the distance in an overpriced motion picture postcard.Heat and Collateral were brilliant films with good stories and great characters and excellent cinematography. Miami Vice almost got it right.",Miami Vice

Great soundtrack, flashy cars, and tongue in cheek devil may care attitude of Tubbs and Crocket.This movie tried to be dark, and was just tired.There was little chemistry between Fox and Ferrel and it was as if Mann had to write to parallel plots for each leading man. Two girls, two romances, two sex scenes, two shower scenes, two girls in distress scenes, etc.Finally, for a relatively pedestrian plot, Mann left most of the plot twists hanging and unanswered. Who was the FBI leak, what was in the Russian crates, why was a Montoya a Russian working with a Chinese national using American skin heads as muscle, why did they need to be deputized by the FBI and what the hell ever happened to the FBI in the movie.The movie just didn't rehash the magic of MV or reinvent itself.",Miami Vice

Instead I viewed a long drawn out plot which doesn't need a large amount of sex scenes, but insists upon it nonetheless. The conversation is hard to follow at times because it is played as cool and to some extent low key. The movie wastes time developing a plot which is pretty straightforward to begin with. The action sequences are brilliant, but building up to them takes forever. I actually for the first time in my life got up walked out of the theater and refilled the popcorn. If you are a fan of the TV show like me, don't expect any similarities whatsoever other than the two characters' names. Michael Mann completely redesigns the whole thing. I am a large fan of his work such as Collateral and Ali. This movie failed in comparison. Collateral had a fast moving and understandable plot, Miami Vice chooses to waste time arranging an over detailed story. Furthermore it insists upon graphic sex scenes making it only and adult movie, while in my opinion Collateral was okay for anyone over 13. It's your decision but at least think about saving your money and renting this average film.",Miami Vice
533,marianaruiz1982,Lousy movie in beautiful Miami,4,14 August 2006,"I went to the movies last night expecting so much from Mann. After such masterpieces as Heat and Collateral, I was so disappointed, you just can't imagine. The film starts in 2006 with two cops in tieless suits chasing the bosses of a prostitution business. Or so I understood because from the first moment you just hear some loud music and two actors mumbling. Then comes some police informant fearing he's going to be killed, whose wife has been killed and says he gave up a pair of FBI agents to some drug dealers and then he throws himself in front of a truck and dies. At this point, we see some FBI boss asking for help to the two tieless cops because the ongoing operation to stop this really mean drug czars went out of control. From this moment on, we see a couple of actors (Foxx and Farrel, fine actors I might add) just riding fast boats, having sex, flying jets, coming and going from and to South America and displaying the most macho attitudes I have ever seen. As under covers, they get into the drug business masquerading as transport agents for drug cartels. The plot just gets dumber as Foxx's girlfriend is kidnapped, Farrel REALLY falls in love with the drug traffic bad girl Isabella and the movie ends with a gunfight in which you better just pay attention to the music because sadly, Mann doesn't even allow you to see who's shooting at who. From a creator such as Mann, I'm sorry to say, I never expected such a lousy movie. The beautiful scenes of Miami just can't compensate for the lack of chemistry between the actors and the poor dialogues in which you see how expendable the so-called partners are from each other. Let me make myself clear, I LOVE music, and this movie's soundtrack is as good as it gets but I definitely can't appreciate the fact that the spectator doesn't even get to listen to the actors' mumbling as they try to communicate. Mann loses in this movie the essence of the Miami vice series: the tight friendship between the two main characters and the humanity that made them everybody's favorite for over four years and still does. It doesn't matter whether you are 20 or 50, the original series where something special, something that Mann was not able to recreate in this multi-million dollar Hollywood production.",Miami Vice

Also it does not underestimate the intelligence of its viwers. If you like Michael Manns' work then you will surely like this. Miami Vice is a very stylish film and there are more than enough elements to keep the aduience engaged. The soundrack of the movie was very good, some of them remain with you even after finish watching the film.

I had a hard time believing she was Cuban because every time she said anything it came with a very strong Chinese accent but I liked her Spanish. The dialog wasn't inspiring, funny or interesting. This multimillion dollar movie would have been saved if there was some exciting dialog. A third of the way in the movie my attention span maxed out and I wanted to watch other things.

This movie's action scenes were boring too though. This just goes to show you that you can put a superstar cast to work on a project, but that can't carry a bad film. There were so many loose ends in the movie that your head is spinning by the end and you just want to claw your eyes out. From head to toe this movie simply sucked. Editing, directing, writing, acting, even the costume department must've been getting high on set b/c Colin Ferrel was wearing the same shirt for like a week at one point. The only thing that was good about seeing it really was the laughs afterward ripping on it with my friends. We all sat around at Cold Stone ice cream shot and hysterically laughed at how incredibly stupid and lame this movie was.",Miami Vice
538,key-26,Michael Mann's takes a dive,3,1 August 2006,"I'm not sure what's happened to Michael Mann over the past few years, but the performance he turned in as director of ""Miami Vice"" is shockingly bad for a talent filmmaker. One might try to argue that the stars salaries were such a big part of the budget that no money was left for a good cinematographer, gaffer, or camera operator. In truth, it seems Mann opted for a lazy directing style he could try to pass of as ""artistic"". Many of the scenes shot at night have a graininess indicitive of too little lighting or a student film shot poorly on 16mm. The focus drifts in and out throughout the film and, perhaps most annoying is the DP playing with an intermittent zoom that looks more like someone's hand accidentally hit the zoom button for just a moment and was quickly pulled off. I don't know if this film should be called underdirected since a little more effort would have yielded a much more watchable and even good film. Perhaps it's just the new, irritating style of overdirection where the filmmakers feels a need to call attention to themselves and the camera at the cost of the story. We've seen the same tragic results in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Constant Gardner""; another two films that would have been considerably better if the directors knew that the ""MTV"" -style of shooting and editing might work for a 30-second commercial or music video where the image is secondary, but it detracts from a feature film. How a director like Mann can makes these mistakes is a mystery. Let's hope he's learned his lesson and returns to his roots for future endeavors.Wait for video on this one.",Miami Vice
539,tomveil,"Just like foreplay, interesting and necessary",9,7 December 2006,"I still remember that evening when the show premiered on TV. Needless to say I was ecstatic at the idea of (finally) seeing this show on the big screen it deserved. You might find the movie overrated or shallow, I guess people were expecting more excitement or action. At least, the movie is faithful to to the show. Yes you jump straight into the story and YES it lead us nowhere and YES it focuses only on Crockett & Tubbs (just like 99% of the series by the way) and YES the brilliant supporting cast is underused.BUT you've gotta see that as a new introduction to the Vice Squad. The TV show had numerous stories revolving on supporting characters, sometimes even bad guys (i.e. Albert Lombard (Dennis Farina)) who supposedly disappear to come back several seasons later, back from the undead. Neptune's night club prologue will eventually lead us somewhere in installment #2 or 3.Because YES, it will be heavily sequelled over the next decade ! Justin Theroux (Mullholland Dr, Charlie's angels 2, 6 ft under) will have lines. The mole will be shot dead. More complicated shots will be edited. More 80's tracks will be remixed. More designer clothing Will be displayed. More $200k+ roaring cars will cruise the street of Miami.

This probably was due to the early foreshadowing that was as easy to follow as a first grade reader. The action scenes were ho-hum and the plot was so-so. Even the development of the ""love interests"" were boring. If you were a fan of the original TV series you will be very disappointed by this movie. The only resemblance to the original was the title and name ""Sonny Crockett"". I'm not sure why they didn't use the name Tubbs.

Without a doubt it always has been my favorite television series of all time, so with Michael Mann helming their movie-make, my expectations were very high. Too high I fear, because I left this film disappointed. First the actors. Collin Farrell did a good Sonny, who stole the spotlight of the picture, along with foil/love interest Isabella (Gong Li). I did miss the house boat and the pet gator though. After those two, everybody else, including Jamie Foxx's Ricardo Tubbs, were little more than after thoughts. Foxx played his character far too low key and missed the cool Caribbean vibe Phillip Michael Thomas brought to the television role. In this film, Foxx was little more than a sex scene and a prop to propel Sonny's story forward. The action itself was good, but not great. There was a fast pace, as any Miami Vice story should have, but after all was said and done, I just didn't feel the film did justice to such a ground-breaking television show. After leaving the theater, I remembered why I stay away from movie adaptations of favorite comics and television shows. All hype, not enough substance. I think I will go sit down with my Miami Vice Season II DVD now, and watch the characters I really love...",Miami Vice

We need action it was bad enough that the movie didn't take place in the 1980 like most of the fans would had liked but at least have some decent action shoot out or something.The camera angles was horrible,Jamie Foxx is talking and the camera is pointing to his shoulder.

543,phroZt_bytE,the new Mann style,8,19 September 2006,"i went to see Miami Vice at the movies recently and was blown away. the plot itself was not 'provocatively new' nor the acting 'film festival daring' but the artistic style was smashing. the POV style carried throughout the film, make for a feeling in line with this very technology u are reading. i felt it was an incredible way to enter further into the emotional and consequential state of the individual characters. obviously taking some of the raw footage ideas from the news with our 'camo dressed, embedded news crews with bigger cameras then the soldiers have guns' for the action scenes really gave the scene more credibility, precisely because it looked like 'something off the news'. additionally i thought that the more dramatic moments were intensified by the use of the same POV style. a stronger sense of empathy or thrill is accomplished by giving the viewer the same position/view as the character on screen - strengthens our impressions of the character's feelings and impetus for those feelings.personally i would love to see more of this new Mann style, regardless of whether i coined the phrase {searchgodbetablog.blogspot.com} or not.",Miami Vice
544,scottsteventon,I couldn't help but feel disappointed!,3,1 December 2006,"Miami Vice- Well I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed from this film. I mean the hype and speculation leading up to it's release was very high from the get go. The story it's self wasn't very well written at all and they tried to sell it as more of a story film than an action film, therefore they didn't include enough action scenes for my liking. The only type of film that can pull that sort of move off is a film that has a gripping story, which like I said before this didn't have.Also there were quite allot of sex scenes in this film, which is not something I am against but I feel they didn't have allot to do with the story and weren't needed. It sort of felt like to me that the writer must have run out of ideas and used these scenes just to make the time up and use them to give a cheap thrill to the audience.The very few action scenes in the film were all right but nothing special at that. This is one of those films I'm glad I didn't watch at the cinema and that I only watched it on DVD, (I'm just happy I didn't buy it and only borrowed it from a friend).",Miami Vice

I thought this was going to be a good movie."" This movie seemed to be just one big drawn out music video. Jamie Fox had a good performance. The weak character development and lack of decent dialog makes this a movie to view from home and not to pay an over priced theater ticket to see. Michael Mann truly dropped the ball on this epic monstrosity of a let down. The Hype for this movie is better than the actual viewing. Sound Track the best part of this feature flop. The brief action there is however is quit brilliant. This does not make up for the hour and a half of the two hours you sit there disappointed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who likes quality film. I suggest waiting for it on DVD and watching the beginning and end of this film and completely ignoring the middle.",Miami Vice
546,pinkyt,"Sad, bad and dangerous to see!!!!",1,3 August 2006,"I really did not want to see this movie but my brother dragged me along assuring me that I would love it and I was willing to give it a chance. Now, I'm not a fan of the original TV series but I can see that it had a certain 80's charm to it. With that in mind I cannot see who this movie could possibly be aimed at. Firstly, Michael Mann is obviously trying to get as far away from the TV version as possible. This version is 'gritty' and 'raw' without a white suit in sight.This movie probably would have been really good if it had been released in the 90's when audiences hadn't seen EVERY movie on undercover cops. There is nothing new here - it's the same old 'undercover drug bust - rogue cop seduces Big Boss's girlfriend - bust goes wrong - lets shoot lots of people' story that has been done a million times before. You'd think that to bring this back after 17 years it would have to be something brilliant and fresh, but it falls into every cliché possible.The performances are also pretty dull. I don't know what Colin Farrell was trying to do with this role but his performance looked like it belonged on Saturday Night Live. Jamie Foxx gives the only viable performance but his screen time is seriously diminished in favour of Farrell who gets whole chunks of the movie to himself so that he can look out into the sunset and get it on with Li Gong.Basically, if you've got even half a brain cell, this movie is not for you.",Miami Vice

548,good_b_johnny,Not for the weak minded.,7,12 August 2006,"This was an awesome movie. I didn't watch the series when it was running, beyond a couple of episodes, so maybe the fact that I didn't go into it expecting a rush of nostalgia was what allowed me to enjoy the movie for what it was.There are those who went into this expecting another Will Smith Special, which would go something like this: Rich guy with attitude, gets into a sticky situation, breaks all the rules, makes some lame jokes, launches himself over a building with a frag grenade, and shoots down some helicopters with a handgun. Sorry, not here.This was a film that actually tried to have a shred of reality to it, and was obviously too much for some. Apparently they couldn't be bothered to fire up that second brain cell.This movie was great. Good solid plot, no stupid racial jokes, good acting (although I'm not a big fan of Colin Farrell), and believability. It did have a couple of sex scenes that were totally pointless, but I'm sure there are plenty of undersexed teenagers and 35 year-old virgins who loved them (or hated them for not being longer).There are few movies that don't make me say ""Yeah right"" at least a couple of times during the show, not this time. So if you're looking for a believable, well-made movie, check out Miami Vice. If you want another mindless film to distract you from the absurdity of itself with fake explosions, and unrealistic plots, keep moving. Go rent I-Robot or something.",Miami Vice

No character development, thin plot strewn together with soft core sex scenes and no real climax. It exists, then it doesn't.I would have liked to at least seen some scenes where they are not either dancing, screwing, driving or shooting. Dialogue anyone? There were no lines in this picture! Merely a few stage directions read aloud. I expected so much more. More time in the story. More time with a double cross. The sound was terrible, half the time you can't make out what they are saying, and when it is loud enough, the terrible accents detract from the meaning.

An hour into the film 7 remained. Even in the beginning the film was extremely hard to follow as there was no introduction to the story. About halfway through the film I walked out astonished at the complete rip off the people who come to see it tomorrow would get. As the extremely long line out the door during its showing proved, the movie was terrible. Not worthy of the number one spot it yanked from the Pirates of the Carribben:Dead Man's Chest film.",Miami Vice

At first i thought the movie was just an excuse for Michael Mann to show of his great way of filming scenes. I even thought, after the first hour that the movie didn't have what the trailer promised - high explosive action, a good and well written script etc. But then, out of nowhere, the great action came. It even took my breath away and the way they filmed it, with regular dv-cams (i think) and still got away whit it cuz they painted up every scene like a masterpiece. I was touched... It all felt so real, you could feel they're pain and emotions and it gave me goosebumps... A truly masterpiece Michael Mann, thank you for this and COLLATERAL and of course HEAT!",Miami Vice
552,themarions5,What were you expecting?,8,5 August 2006,"Yes I loved it and why wouldn't anyone? It's a movie based on a television show. We should be thankful that Mr Mann decided to make the movie darker instead of making the movie a comedy. No, the director took us serious and decided to make something with some teeth. I've read some comments that would compare this to Collateral or Heat. Sorry, it's just not going to happen, and not because it isn't a well made action packed movie. It's because it's an ""artzy Miami Vice."" The movie is dark, steamy, and even delicate in some places. But it's still an eighties television show made for this generation. Sequel? I doubt it. At least not with these characters. Still, I've been wrong about sequels before, and after this summer in which Disney ruled with average movies (don't get me wrong I loved Cars and Pirates) you never know how low other studios will sink to get people into the theaters. However, if you did find this movie at least average, I will say this, If they could make a sequel and give us more of what we did like about this one, I think it would be a blockbuster. What did we (me and a few others on here) like about the movie? First, they didn't bore me with how the detectives were able to cross international boundaries or who gave them the money to do what, or which agency did what to who. Second, the political message in the movie was minimum. Thank-you Mr. Mann. Finally, the plot had ""no-holes,"" and God bless the idiot who said that the plot had holes because it is doubtful he or she knows what that means. Anyway, the plot was simple, the action was realistic and simple (no wire tricks thank-God). Go see it.",Miami Vice

I got so fed up that part way through I got my laptop out and started browsing the web (I was watching it at home). The story didn't go anywhere. There was kind of a hint of some drugs trading, but you never really knew who was running the whole thing, what the reason was or, well anything really. One minute a character is in the shower, the next they are shooting bad guys. You didn't know why they went there or how. They just suddenly appeared in the next scene.

And although my wife who would join your parade, did a fine job of pointing out the movie's many flaws and failures to me, I gotta say I loved it! It was RED MEAT. If you were looking to SCUBA with VICE a.k.a GO DEEP, you probably were unhappy because with this rendition of VICE it was GO FAST, much like the TV series. Only thing is, we don't have a whole season to flush out all of the intricacies of characters. But then again, we already know them don't we? You must read between the lines. And yeah, pay attention closely because the dialog is as rough as the action. No time to fish for popcorn. The DVD subtitles will help later.To me this was VICE brought to the Big Screen in good form, not the Wild Wild West. As a fan of the TV series, I was not disappointed. It is not Fantastic, Super, Batty, X-traordinary or a Zorro. It's certainly not Pirates, Prada or the Lady from the Cove Lagoon; all cool in their own right. And it is not the best thing you're gonna find of its kind. But if you want the superficial flash and gritty violence with intrigue that has a very good mode of authenticity and cinematic flair, then you should give it a go.Of course the box office will decide whether we see the sequel.

Although sometimes a strenuous story-line (concentration is needed to follow the plot) Foxx and Farrell provide excellent acting in an impressive action - flick. Good acting support is provided in a film which doesn't just concentrate on action but touches on so much else. An improvement upon the already great Collateral, and a worthy successor to the original Miami Vice T.V series. With a mix of romance, beautiful settings, gorgeous vehicles, excellent fire-fights and inspirational acting - this is the film of the year so far. Mann has outdone himself.",Miami Vice
556,wbgate,Much better than expected,8,30 July 2006,"There is not a lot that Michael Mann's big screen treatment has in common with the Miami Vice TV series other than the title and character names and so be it a generation later and without the same censorship standards. The cast works very well highlighted by Colin Ferrell's understated treatment of Detective Sonny Crockett making the character comfortably his own rather than emulating Don Johnson's on the small screen. Gong Li as Isabella is both a foil, and a steamy, mutual lust at first sight interest to Crockett. She is the drug lord, Jesus Montoya's (Luis Tosar) money launderer as well as his female companion and falls for Crockett spending a significant portion of the movie's mid-section getting to know him intimately over Mojitos and Cuban rhythms in Isabella's Havana. John Ortiz captures the essence of drug middleman, Jose Yero, taking his character's 'Crazy Pig' nickname straight to heart in his portrayal while injecting a different kind of music to the somewhat eclectic yet well balanced score through his ownership of 3 'disco' clubs. Jamie Foxx's, Ricardo Tubbs, is comfortably played albeit definitely in the second seat while still offering a credible depth of character development with a significant co-worker romance of his own adding both humor and drama. The High Definition cameras used bring some spectacular scenery almost to life from unique perspectives including the incredible Iguazu Falls area on the border of Argentina and Brazil and the action sequences are HD beneficiaries also. The plot revolves around Crockett and Tubbs going undercover to pinpoint the source of a leak that cost the lives of a pair of FBI agents and it weaves an entertaining if not highly original storyline. If you are expecting a TV series remake on the big screen you may well be disappointed. If you are able to suspend the TV series from your thoughts and take an open mind into the theater you are likely in for a cinematic treat. Either way, buy some stock in your favorite Rum distiller as Mojito sales are sure to surge.",Miami Vice

The action finally starts but by that time you are already too far gone. The first real deal shooting will finally awaken you from your slumber and create a collective sigh of relief from the audience, then the movie really starts and is great from then on, but the first half of this movie was so bland, that the thrilling and sudden killing of the last half can't turn this into a good movie, only into an average one. Colin Farrell is average as he must of been tired from his reported late night romps, and repetitive and unnecessary sex scenes as they had already established his character's love interest. Jamie Foxx has what seemed to be a secondary role and there were far too many cliché's. Such a great second half of the movie but like K-Fed to Britney the first half only drags it down. Also real Vice fans will be ticked off at the movie's loose basing of the show.",Miami Vice

Not to mention that it's absolutely boring!! After watching Heat and Ali, I thought...""well here is a director whose talent is only getting better.

560,avner08,Bad scripts always make bad movies,5,30 July 2006,"I've been a fan of Michael Mann for quite some time now. The Insider won me over. Heat became my first DVD purchase. Collateral made me remember what gritty crime thrillers are made of. Logically, Miami Vice became something I had been following for months prior to it's release A couple of mixed early screening reviews made me hesitant at first, but I knew in the back of my mind that Michael Mann would somehow pull it off. I was wrong.Let's start with the bad stuff. The movie starts off wonderfully. It throws us right in middle of the action. However after the twenty minutes or so when the ""recruitment"" idea is brought up, the movie goes downhill. For the next two hours, the audience is pulled through senseless sex scenes, a plot with loopholes all over, and bad acting. A large number of audience members in my movie theater walked out. Only in the last half hour, when Sonny Crockett (Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Foxx) rescue a fellow agent from Aryan nation members, and the final spectacular shoot out, redeems the movie (partly). The characters are too flat, poorly written, and thus the audience creates no emotional attachment to them. The run time is too long in the film as well. Collateral was lengthy, but at least the movie kept you pinned to your seat. I've never liked Colin Farrell as an actor. Maybe it was the result of me watching Phonebooth a dozen times. Anywho, he just didn't seem to fit the leading role. Eric Bana or Hugh Jackman in my opinion, would've been a better selection for Sonny Crockett. Jamie Foxx acted well with his character, but not on par as he did in Ray. The good parts (however few there are), are limited. The cinematography is done rather well, along with the color schemes that appear in the film. However it would be a good thing if Michael Mann would use film indoors, because it looks rather tacky with the lighting. The filming in digital at night, outside is done rather well in my opinion. The shooting locations are also well done, showing the true gritty dark side of Miami.In conclusion, the film is not terrible, but also far from good. One thing I could say is that a movie script makes the movie. The script in this one was horrible and flawed. I wouldn't go all out to say Michael Mann is a horrible screenwriter, since Manhunter and Heat contradict the statement. However I do believe he needed more help in the production of this script. Maybe a call to Stuart Beatie might have saved this disaster.",Miami Vice

I felt dead watching it. Michael Mann did a fabulous job making the movie so boring and lifeless.Some people will say it is raw and realistic. Those people may have some sort of slight mental retardation, or maybe they're just joking around, I don't know. That being said, I understand that people are entitled to their opinions.At least a quarter of the movie was filmed with a shaking handycam. I suppose this was supposed to make it feel more gritty and raw, but in actuality, it made the film feel cheap. Kind of like a really, really bad episode of COPS.More disappointment is coming your way if you were a fan of the character Tubbs, as he's barely in the movie for 15 minutes. Crockett is the focus.

I hate it when movies talk down to me.Acting: Not much to work with especially Jamie Foxx's character who was as two dimensional as any of the Simpsons.Overall, it's got guns, money, drugs and the high life. If you're down with these elements in your movie, this movie's got entertainment value for you.Criticisms: (1) The camera work sucked because it shook so much a la Bourne Supremacy. It felt like when you're watching a key moment at a ballgame only to have the guy in front of me stand and obstruct your view so that you have to crane your neck to get a view. This works when used very seldomly, not when it is a dominant feature of a movie; and (2) I still can't figure out half of the stuff that the chick said in the movie, her lack of English skills was a detriment.",Miami Vice

Meandering, hard to follow and eminently unbelievable plot (maybe true to the original?). Leading lady Li is like a twitchy wooden doll - zero emotive/evocative power beyond the occasional tear-filled eye. Ferrel and Fox are clearly wasted in this vehicle. Best and most believable performances were by supporting players: Henley, Ortiz and Tosar.Best line (IMHO): uttered with medical precision by the Gina character when drawing a bead on a particularly annoying bad guy who threatens everyone, including himself, with explosive death.Most Satisfying Scene: elimination of another really annoying baddie near a shipOther complaints: early sex scene with Tubbs and Trudy character -- if trying to set up a relationship for testing/angst later, it was a complete failure. Sex alone does not a relationship make. Would have liked to see more with Gina.My wife didn't scream once (she ALWAYS screams at suspense and action flix). In fact, she nodded off. Others in the theater kept asking ""what did he/she say"" (mumblicious). Or perhaps it was just a bad sound system.Plus: scenery was stunning. Most of the martial arts scenes were crisp and convincing (hand to hand).

Jaime Foxx do not do movies with Colon Farrel again, he will ruin your career with crap like this. And to add another note. The director seemed to try too hard to make the punchlines too bad ass but ended up making them really horrible. For example. ""Colon Farrel - ""Hey Chica"" pretty lame if you ask me. Especially since he was saying that too an Asian woman. I just don't want people to waste their money like me and my Fiancé did. We were pretty upset that it started and ended the way it did.",Miami Vice
566,vargy,Miami Vice is TERRIBLE!!! PLEASE don't waste your time!,3,10 August 2006,"OK...I just went to Miami Vice.I generally go along to movies with expectations. I am pretty well read about movies and quite often will go into a movie thinking it is going to be amazing, and then get sorely disappointed. Sometimes I go into a movie thinking that it is going to totally suck, and then get pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.Miami Vice is NOT one of those movies.To preface, let me just state that I thought this movie was going to suck. From the moment I saw the trailers, I didn't understand why they would make a movie based on a semi-OK 80s cop show. It had its moment, why couldn't Hollywood just let it fade into DVD fan obscurity??? Unfortunately, they couldn't leave well enough alone.However, even though I had total expectations of EXTREME suckiness, I did not actually expect to be both viscerally disgusted and BORED to tears by a multi million dollar blockbuster movie! THIS IS THE SECOND WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! (The first is Alexander...does anyone else see the Colin Farrell thread of responsibility here?) There is almost nothing to like about this 2 and a half HOUR monstrosity of a film. The acting (aside from Jamie Foxx...can anyone say 'Jamie WHY did you do this movie???) was AWFUL...the camera work looked as though the director had handed out Sony Handycams to a bunch of hyperactive land-dwelling seals and sent them out on location to shoot the movie (or as my friend noted, there must have been an extreme shortage of tripods in Hollywood at the time of filming, almost as bad as Blair Witch!), shaky and extremely grainy.(side note...not all of the shooting was like this, only the shots that involved actual acting and/or characters in the shot. All the establishing and landscape shots were beautiful...too bad Michael Mann couldn't have let that influence the rest of the movie.) The sound editing was poor, you couldn't hear anything that the actors were saying, and they were mumbling the whole time anyway. That would have made a difference, if the storyline was at all interesting. There was ONE plot line, the whole painfully long movie, was about ONE event, and when the final huge gun-battle EVENTUALLY gets there, it is the most boring gunfight I've ever seen, as you have no idea who's shooting at who. There's no perspective, which is something that you could say about the whole movie.It was also exceedingly bizarre that there are at least 5, possibly 6 sex scenes in the movie, 4 of which have absolutely nothing to do with progressing the story, and 0 of which are actually sexy or hot or appealing in any way. It's just a bunch of grunting and a close up camera shot of some woman's head moving up and down.Bottom line: If I could make the whole world pay attention to me for ONE moment right now, I would use that moment to BEG everyone NOT to waste their money on this movie. PLEASE! DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF! That is all",Miami Vice
567,briangreco,How could people not like this film?,10,12 August 2006,"Like everyone else, I heard all of the rumors of the production problems that the crew faced and the early complaints of the lack of chemistry between the 2 lead actors, but I loved this kind of stuff as a kid so I saw this film with a lowered expectation. However, by the time that the movie had ended, I realized that I had probably just seen, by far, the best crime/cop movie ever! This had everything that I loved in crime movies (as well as the original series) but without the 80's sensitivity toward violence in movies & TV. In other words, this movie makes the 1980's Miami Vice look like the campy 1960's Batman, in comparison.Farrell & Fox, whom I am not big fans of, certainly changed my opinion of their talents (more so with Farrell as this is the first thing that I've ever liked him in).To touch on what else was great about the film I loved the music, the locations and the close-ups with the type of film used (some scenes were grainy, almost camcorder-ish, but this gave it a realistic, ""COPS"" kind of feel). The story was exceptional and my only complaint is that it should had been longer as there could have been more detail in the drug traffiking operations (guess I'll have to wait for a Director's cut DVD). Advertisements put the time at 2:26 but it definitely ends just under 2 hrs, so there is more story to be had somewhere, someplace.The opening sequence is a non-traditional one with no opening credits at all after the Universal Globe logo and it starts in the middle of another case but, Crockett/Tubbs get interrupted from that due to an informant from a previous case and this informant basically sets up the case for the movie. What I am trying to explain is that they put you right smack in the middle of these under cover cops' lives and you live their lives for 2 hours. This is a sign of superb movie making when a director can accomplish the feeling of you actually being there and Michael Mann succeeds in this.As far as talk of Academy Awards, not that they matter anyway, but I could definitely see a cinematography nod. However, this is just not the type of sappy crap that the Academy likes so I don't see a nomination for picture or screenplay. But that's a good thing.In closing, I highly recommend this film for anyone with an interest in these types of stories. If you talk to people and they didn't like it, they just may not have appreciated the complexity of the story line or the artistic visuals of this film. This may, in fact be the type of movie that people have to see 2, 3 or 4 times to realize that this a quality film with a new & unique type of film style. Either way, it is certainly worth a few bucks to see this 2 hrs of living art.",Miami Vice
568,mrhempel,"A long, drawn-out, boring movie",3,15 August 2006,"This movie is nothing more than a shoot-em-up, cops vs. the bad guys. If you like explosions, guns blazing, and tires squealing, you will love the first and last ten minutes of Miami Vice. If you like thrillers that make you yawn, you will love the middle two hours of Miami Vice.This movie was 2.5 hours long. And guess what happened. NOT MUCH. A couple of cops go undercover to bust the bad guys. That's it. There is absolutely nothing new in this movie. The special effects belong in the 1980s show, the acting is not compelling, and the plot is so simple but still somehow manages to be incomprehensible at times. Speaking of the plot, it was probably the movie's weakest point. I won't give anything away, but I can't believe it filled 2.5 hours. The plot of this movie could have easily fit into one episode of the ""Miami Vice"" show. It was predictable, it was laughable, it was a disaster.",Miami Vice
569,xtn-1,"a soft-core porno with the bad lines, but some pretty cool action to provide contrast",6,18 August 2006,"Many of my friends saw this movie and recommended it wholeheartedly to me, so I went into the movie with high expectations. However, I was not nearly as impressed with 'Miami Vice' as I was hoping for. Granted, I did enjoy some brutally great action scenes (especially the huge .50 cal, I could be wrong about that, ""sniper"" gun that literally tore people's arms off and blew holes thru a Caddy) but it seemed almost as if there was not enough consistency that kept my attention. I was perplexed when the score music completely cut out or there were missing sound effects. Maybe that was the intention, but I feel like it took away from the film. There were also certain scenes that just didn't seem to be edited well at all and didn't cut well into the next one. The ending just...ended! It was not very satisfying or strong, it was just a way to end the film. (Spoiler...sorta) Colin Ferrell walks into the hospital and 'Miami Vice' pops up and see ya and goodnight. I was expecting a much more fun movie than I got. I was expecting Bad Boys without the comedy, but instead got a soft-core porno with the bad lines to go with it. There were so many sex scenes between Ferrell and his Asian sensation that it was getting boring, and Foxx's steamy scene was not only unnecessary, but entirely too long. If you really want to see this movie wait for it to come out on DVD.",Miami Vice

571,Maximus_Aurelius,A realistic and gritty drama for the mature audience,10,6 September 2006,"I just came back from the screening of Miami Vice and I can tell you this movie DID NOT DISAPPOINT ME AT ALL. I was absolutely mesmerised by it.However, first and foremost, I need to tell you that this movie is NOT for everyone. If you are looking for the typical summer Hollywood pop-corn movie which features unnecessary explosions, car chase scenes, unrealistic firefights every 10 minutes in the movie, then this movie is NOT FOR YOU because you will be ""bored"" and disappointed.Miami Vice is a dark and gritty drama for the adults which tells the tales of two undercover Miami police officers (Colin Farell and Jamie Fox) combating global drug trafficking and internal security leaks by going deeply undercover in the drug trafficking operations in the US and South America. This movie is not a remake of the pastel laden Miami Vice TV series set in the 80s. This is a very serious and realistic drama set in the modern era about police officers engaging in undercover operations and how their professional lives interwind with their personal lives. The movie is so realistic that I find myself immersed into the world of tense and dangerous situations. It completely drew me in. Even though it is a crime thriller ""drama"" (as opposed to the label ""action movie"" because it is not), the action scenes in the movie just fall in the right places. They are so realistic and stunningly violent that they are, in my opinion, jaw-dropping.The cinematography of this movie is amazing and conveys a sense of realism to the audience. The use of High Definition Digital Video in this movie is a phenomenal achievement in modern cinema. The Hi-Def Digital Video sees deeply into the night and captures the night scenes so vibrantly that they are breathtaking . The city of Miami never looks so alluring to me at night. It is truly an eye-opening experience.I am not surprised that the opinions of the public on the movie polarise to such an extreme. Even though most of the major film critics give it a two thumbs up (such as Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine, New York Times, New York Post, Rolling Stone, Empire, Entertainment Weekly and Variety), the reaction from the general public in the US towards the movie is split. I think it stems from the fact that the general public go in expecting a nostalgic trip of the old Miami Vice back in the 80s. This movie is probably too gritty and serious for the average movie goers. This is a crime drama for the thinking men. You are required to pay attention to the movie and you will be deeply rewarded for your experience.Some critics say that this movie is an example of style over substance. I respectfully disagree. For Miami Vice and for me, its style is a matter of substance.",Miami Vice
572,thehotcorner7,Worst Movie I've ever seen in a theater,5,14 October 2006,"Miami Vice is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As a big fan of both Bad Boys 2 and Collateral, I was excited to see this. Let me tell you that this movie is very slow, and the plot makes no sense. It has a plot that they purposely have you not understand in the beginning of the movie, making you believe that they will explain more to you later in the movie, THEY DON'T. Why am I not surprised Colin Farrell looks drugged out in this movie? Because he was, went right into rehab when it was finished filming. I don't blame him. There are about 3 action scenes, and about 15 sex scenes, which don't even get you excited. The girl looks like she is 60 years old and the audience just waits until they are finished. Honestly, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. The middle hour of the story makes no sense at all, and you are just waiting for it to be over. The worst part of it is that they leave a cliffhanger at the end of the movie. DEAR LORD, Don't make a sequel. Michael Mann you have just ruined yourself. I feel dumber for watching this movie and am incredibly upset that I wasted 2 hours of my life on this trash. I recommend you not to make the same mistake I did, and the people that say this movie is good, well they should go back to the pole they are smoking.",Miami Vice
573,micacutaya,The Best Mann,10,23 March 2007,"I have only come to appreciate Michael Mann's films recently, with Collateral in fact with the fantastic shots of night time LA. I still had the same problem with his stereotyped male character and contrived storyline (the ending!), but there was something in that drifting through the night using real streetlights that interested me. And then there was Miami Vice and though i have since then watch, or re-watch most of Mann's precedent films and I have come to see much more in them that previously, I still think Miami Vice is the best Mann so far. Miami Vice abandons the controlled narrative and the cult to viril friendship to throw its protagonists in the disorientating flow of urban life (read the excellent article by Jean-Baptiste Thoret at sensesofcinema.com). Also for the first time there is a substantial female character able to displace the predictable centrality of the duo. The cinematography has gone one step further than Collateral in its use of HD digital camera offering an exhilarating variety of night light atmosphere. some images sharp and clean other fuzzy or murky. It's a feast for the senses. I think the digital technology has given Mann the possibility to push further his representation of the places of modern America which was always at the core of his films and let go of some of the cliché that burdened his previous films.",Miami Vice
574,claude_mayer,Between boring and annoying,2,10 December 2006,"What a disappointment this movie has been, not that I am a huge fan of Miami vice as such, but I believed there were some potential as an action movie. The issue with this kind of movie is that most of the directors fall into the trap of having way too much action, too much soapy love story to the detriment of a solid, interesting and unpredictable script. On the other hand, a bit of humor would have been welcome just to break the monotony of the story. I am usually good public but I got to confess that by the end of the movie, I was extremely annoyed by all these clichés (salsa, love, speed boat, bad guys, drugs and discos!!!Mercy! spare us!). Really with such a budget, there must be a way to build up a captivating story line!",Miami Vice
575,saboonoir,"Well, I liked it.",8,19 January 2007,"I'm not sure what everyone's problem is with this movie. I think that when one goes into a film with very particular expectations, i.e.; expectations based on another movie entirely, then one is setting themselves up for disappointment. No, Miami Vice is nothing like the show. No, Miami Vice is not a ""buddy"" movie (the criticisms in this regard in particular I fail to understand; the movie isn't about banter and bullshit, it's about something much deeper and darker; and if the main characters don't feel like talking to each other about their feelings very much, well, who can blame them? No one called out Jason Bourne for his laconic tendencies). Miami Vice not a red-blooded action movie, either; though there are enough visceral and satisfying action sequences to keep the more cerebral moviegoer intrigued. No, Miami Vice is about exactly what Michael Mann wanted it to be about: the danger of the protagonists' profession as well as the drug business in general, the conflict between two sides of the law, on both the ""good guy, bad guy"" level, and the interpersonal level, and, most of all, the sound and fury, as no one does it better. Mann's work is easily recognizable to those who know what to look for, and to those who don't, this is a perfect example of the kind of kinetic directing that Mann is famous for. I genuinely laughed at the reference to ""Collateral"", in which Jamie Foxx messes up some guy at a nightclub using his bare handsand not because it was funny, but because I LOVED the way Mann does this kind of thing. The action sequences are spaced out by dialogue, yes. But the dialogue was intriguing enough to keep me interested. And when said action sequences actually did commence, boy I loved every minute of them. The soundtrack does everything to compliment the kinetic energy of the tension, as is customary with Mannagain, I'm reminded (fondly) of ""Collateral"". And if the movie seemed to leave off incompletely resolved, so what? I liked the somewhat ambiguous endinganything else would have detracted from the movie's realism. Have I talked about performances yet? Oh, I loved the performances. I must admit, I was a bit skeptical about Jamie Foxx being cast as Det. Tubbs, considering his blundering and pathetic portrayal of Max the cab driver in ""Collateral"", but I was utterly convinced by the first scene, and it actually made me appreciate his ""Max"" performance even more, being given an example of the actor's versatility. Add an equally compelling performance by Colin Farrell, and Li Gong (who?) was actually very impressive as the loyal mistress of a cartel leader, torn between her work and her affection for Farrell. Overall, a great movie, one of the best I've seen in recent years. I really don't know what my friends were talking about. Maybe it's the ammonia.",Miami Vice
576,danys56,Enjoy the Movie....,8,28 January 2007,"During the 80's I was a big fan of Miami Vice. I always felt that the quality of the show was inconsistent and did not know what to expect from the remake. Colin Farrel struck me as an OK choice and Jamie Foxx was an improvement on Philip Michael Thomas. I was pleasantly surprised by Gong Li.This movie captured the essence of the original series quite well. Colin Farrel did a great Sonny Crockett. For the purists who miss the alligator and the houseboat, not a great loss. Jamie Foxx portrays Ricardo with subtlety and somewhat intense charm.Visuals are great, soundtrack is very enjoyable.Plot is fairly typical, but well executed.The villain was great, ""I'm a disco guy"" Another enjoyable movie from Michael Mann.",Miami Vice
577,simonsays8693913,What could've been and late to the party,8,26 August 2021,"Well all I can say that, it was perfect casting with Jaime foxx , Collin Farrell and the rest of the cast, but me being a big Miami vice series fan, it just didn't relate to the series at all. I understand that this probably is Michael Mann's baby the creator of the Miami vice. I had to watch this movie twice just to understand what I was watching and see my favorite show come back to life on the big screen and boy I really tried to love this movie and I still do after so many years lol, see, Miami vice was just more then a buddy cop get the bad guys, it was style, music, fashion, fast cars, get the girl and most importantly culture. Yes like other reviews stated not enough character development between jamie and Collin, but also car chase scenes was missing something that the show was good at and what Jamie foxx does best comedy ! The movie was too serious. The thing about recardo tubbs, yes he took his job serious when it was time to, but when it was time to party and dance he was there and let loose something Philip Michael Thomas did an amazing job at for this role, something that Jaime foxx is very good at and they didn't capitalize on his talent, I think Michael Mann was trying to connect the same tone like heat or maybe the producer and production company were to involved way too much in this film, like the Zack Snyder Justice league and Warner bros. Overall this film was missing big car chase scenes and a comedy tone, shoot! Even though all of that was missing, i still enjoyed this movie for what it was, but I have to say bad boys movie series is more Miami vice then this movie ever was compared to the series back in the 80s and it's sad to say because with no Miami vice there is no will Smith and Martin lawerence bad boys if there wasn't Miami vice series ever made and that is a fact, hopefully we can get a better cut of Michael Mann's Miami vice movie in stead of that extended cut we got when the movie was released on dvd in 2006 but I know he has a 3hour cut somewhere #releasethemanncut of Miami vice I'm positive it's better then what we got please!! And if that's not good enough then maybe Michael Mann should've let another director take the stage for this project and stick to being a producer since he never directed a episode of Miami vice. It's a sad thing to say Also I heard vin diesel is trying to make a reboot series of Miami vice hopefully hopefully that will redeem Miami vice fans.",Miami Vice
578,ubaidparkar,Disappointed,4,7 June 2008,"The movie was hard to understand, not because the plot was intricate - if there was one - but it gave you the sensation of being a retarded kindergärtner with the attention span of a toothbrush.There were times when you empathized with the director, producer and even the crew that held up the boom mike, because they furnished the intuition that they were threatened into making this movie - failure to comply would have ensured death. If I can tone down my discontent and absolute contempt for this sorry excuse for a movie, I can at best describe it as ghastly.The script and the subsequent plot emerged from pieces of crumpled Work-In-Progress scraps thrown out into garbage cans by directors who were too mortified to make it into a movie. But then Michael Mann had time to kill and lives to waste and audiences to mortify with redundancy. And yes, it was a typical Michael Mann movie, a lot of time for contemplation, for those who have seen his previous works, 'The Insider' or 'Heat'. But this was way too slow and agonizing. I did contemplate though, to watch the movie in Fast-Forward.Colin Farrell was screaming Goldilocks and Rapunzel with hair which looked as natural as a Red Indians prized scalp. I am pretty sure that he was to go in for a 'presence' look. And Jamie Foxx gave an appearance that was reminiscent of an actor who was working hard just to remember his lines. They made the Ferrari, the Bentley and the Mercedes look like props creditable of a banana peels. And if you have seen this movie, please do quench the thirst of my curiosity. I would like to know the precise time where Li Gong (Isabella) drove you up against the wall, with her sentences devoid of articles. Yes she did stay in character you may argue. Yes I do see my blood on the wall I may add.I cannot bother to go on further why this experience was so horrid as I had acquired the attention span of a toothbrush and I can only digress now with pitiless references of this movie to new and interesting diseases. All these thoughts came in the first half of the torturous audio-visual piles. However, there should be an evolving plot, a brilliant idea perhaps to a perfect end, as there was the other half of hope to develop, an artifact of amusement. But hope has always been a sin.A Stage, nay, it was a military institution where all the players were merely following orders, speculating when they would get their next pile of millions of dollars. You could actually picture this when Mr. Foxx was trying to multitask on remembering his lines and put up an appropriate facial expression to match the mood. He was a long way off, probably off in a yatch in the Pacific. And I would have no remorse if he had drowned. To make it interesting let us add Mr. Farrell in the equation and rewind to him making man-love to Mr. Foxx when they had their lungs filled with salt water. You see, not only do I digress but I sin.I have already had a word with God and he won't give me my two hours back. Save yourself, retribution is at hand.Not once did the movie imprison my imagination or sent my pulse racing. It did not present any prospect to me to be wide eyed, or give a jaw dropping effect.

579,cody-shepherd,Really good.,9,5 September 2007,"This isn't an action film, this is a good film.I was skeptical at first. Colin Farrell tends to play the same character over and over, and Jamie Foxx, despite his talent, is often cast as the new Wesley Snipes. Strangely, both of those tendencies carry over into Miami Vice, but somehow the movie manages not to suck. Quite the opposite. It's really really good.Over 130 minutes and somewhat thinly spread dialog means that an attention span is required. Also, it helps to have an appreciation of the visual and aural potentials of the film/video medium, as the movie is absolutely stunning in both respects. Furthermore, Mann uses a digital camera instead of celluloid, so the (narrative) action seems more real, or at least more apprehendable, somewhat like cinema verite, or the show COPS.What is truly amazing here is the feat Mann has accomplished, whereby the production - the shots, the soundtrack and sound quality, the editing - is so masterful, at once brand new in technique but nostalgic in content, that it manages to endow what would otherwise be another cop drama (read: Lethal Weapon) with all kinds of emotional layering, narrative originality and character dynamic; the things that make movies great.If you look for movies to appeal to your endocrine system rather than your brain, then maybe you'll be disappointed by Miami Vice.

But instead got realism which drew me in and made me feel every ounce of emotion these characters felt. Don't get me wrong there are moments of surreal romantic emotion to a great soundtrack, and there are speed boats and exotic foreign sports cars.This is one of those few movies that stays in your thoughts well after you have left the theater, which is a rare treat.

It's nice to look at and just the body is worth more than most cars, but once you get in and try to drive it, you realize it's pretty pointless. In Miami Vice, too much time is spent on fast cars cruising down the highway, jet boats speeding across the Ocean, and planes cruising the skies. The great dialogue we have seen in other Michael Mann films such as Heat is lacking in Miami Vice, and it leaves a stale taste in your mouth as you see this film fall so far short of its potential. There is really no suspense at all in this movie. Some gun battles happen, but your never in any doubt what the outcome will be.

The acting was very good, no real stand-out performances but Farrel and Foxx did a more-then adequate job of carrying the film. While there wasn't a lot of action, what there was - in particular the end gunfight - was great, although I felt this was the one part of the movie that suffered from overly-shaky camera-work, which made it a little bit confusing at times. I will say though: it has one of the most bitching death-by-shotgun kills since A Better Tomorrow II.I've seen some people complain about the story being hard to follow; at times, yes sometimes that was true but I found as the movie went on, those little questions I kept asking myself were eventually answered. As for the length, again speaking for myself, that didn't bother me at all - I was actually surprised to find out it was over 2 hours long because, although it's not a fast-paced movie, I was really drawn into it and just lost all track of time. There were also complaints about the hand-held photography, which I really don't think held water - this is a gritty movie and that was reflected in the camera-work.",Miami Vice

At least they could have given a believable back story (Mama was a Communist exchange student, or something.)Yero was slimy; he should be selling fake life insurance, not suavely running a nightclub and doing hi-tech intel for drug runners. the lieutenant - I knew not to expect Edward James Olmos, but would you trust this guy to cover you, much less give orders?There are plenty of comments about chemistry (lacking tension between just about any pairing, at least Alonzo proved the depth of his love) and plot (major story lines that vanished, like the FBI leak). But the movie really suffered because of these.Then there was the soundtrack - part of what made the TV show was the edge from the music. Okay, redo the theme song - as good as the original was, it is dated - but don't put us to sleep. When we rented it, I knew not to expect the original. Within fifteen minutes, I was just hoping for some decent cop drama, gave up on that and just hoped for some action and was still disappointed.",Miami Vice
587,PhotographerMN,A visually stunning action package!,8,16 August 2006,"Michael Mann, one of my favorite directors at the moment, does with Miami Vice what he does best. Action with a twist.Don't expect a great character drama with great dialog and a spectacular intrigue like in Heat. Miami Vice is an action film and it doesn't try to be anything else. But it's a very smart action film that avoids the typical Hollywood action clichés, like big pointless explosions and mindless shooting.Detectives Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs manage to infiltrate the operations of a Colombian drug cartel, disguised as drug traffickers. In the process Crockett falls for one of the cartel's leaders, Isabella.Mann is well known for always shooting his films on location and avoiding to use studios. This is very visible in Miami Vice. If a scene takes place in Barranquilla, Colombia, it is actually shot there. It ads an enormous amount to the films realism and credibility. Mann is also known for working with the characters very much. Who they are, were they come from, how they do things. This is also very visible in the film. You actually believe that Crockett, Tubbs and their team are cops. They act and move like cops.The action scenes are incredibly powerful and incredibly realistic. Mann spices up the very simple story with small detail's that makes the film interesting. Nearly all of the outside scenes are shot with hand-held digital cameras which makes the scenes almost look like a documentary. The backgrounds are real. The places are real. The action looks real.In conclusion, Miami Vice promises action and delivers it.",Miami Vice

I think this part would have been perfect for Selma heyick, or one of the many other beautiful Latin actresses in the biz.

589,m_antonioni,Best movie remake of a TV series ever,7,11 November 2006,"I have been surprised by the negative reviews this movie has received at IMDb. I happened upon Miami Vice at random while channel surfing in 1984 when I was in my early twenties, never having heard anything about it, and it instantly blew my mind. I was a consistent fan thereafter, although disappointed by the last season. As a Miami Vice fan, this film did not disappoint me in the least.I think the biggest mistake people critical of this film make is that they do not understand that this is not meant to recreate the series: it takes the series as given. Thus all complaints about lack of character development completely miss the idea of the movie. The original Miami Vice series created a very seductive myth -- nothing that happened in the show could ever be taken seriously -- and this movie simply brings that myth up to date. Viewers of this movie should already be familiar with the characters of Crockett and Tubs. I found the players of those roles in this movie consistent with those characters.A challenge in making this film is finding someone to match the animal magnetism of Don Johnson. I found that Colin Farrell more than solved that problem. When a country not only can't make its own cars, needing to import them from Japan and Germany (Ford and GM are going out of business), but also can't find its own actors that are sexy as they were twenty years ago -- so that it needs to import them from Ireland -- you know it's in trouble.On a first viewing, my only complaint was the shoot-out seen at the end. First, I found it hard to follow who was shooting whom, in terms of who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. Second, this was essentially a scene of military combat. But the sound was much to muffled to give you an impression of what hearing military grade weapons going off around you actually sounds like.If that shoot-out scene would have gotten to the level of Full Metal Jacket, for example, I would have given this movie a 10.",Miami Vice
590,ronniej962,Michael Mann has done it again,10,30 July 2006,"For those of you that remember the Miami Vice series will love this movie. It took on more than just a ""shoot em up and kill everything"" type movie. Although the kill scenes were very graphic - not that I was bothered by that, but if you are a little squeamish, then you may want to close your eyes. I think Collin and Jamie did a great job at Sony Crockett and Tubbs. In the original series, Crockett appeared to be the lead where most of the action seemed to center around him. But in this version, the action was equally divided between the two. To be honest, Tubbs may have gotten more that Crockett.The action was about 60% of the movie and there were a couple love scenes that were also pretty graphic as well. Nothing that would bother us adults but would make us feel uncomfortable watching those scenes around kids and even some teenagers.I HIGHLY recommend this movie.",Miami Vice

It wasn't nearly as corny as the original Miami Vice TV series.I can't help but get a little frustrated when there is a lack of detail in a movie. In one of the final scenes, couldn't someone have noticed that the speedboat operated by Sonny Crocket (Colin Ferrell) had their bow navigation lights on backwards? The red is suppose to be on the port (left) side with the green on the starboard (right) side. Obviously this was just a minor oversight.

594,krib7,Collateral Sequel?,6,29 July 2006,"Maybe I should have waited a little bit before writing this review but here it goes anyway. Miami Vice stars Colin Farell and Jamie Fox and what seems to be about half of the actors in Collateral. This movie is about cops going undercover (and off the radar) into underground drug-running. What seems to be the deal of a lifetime suddenly turns for the worse when suddenly the police get pushed around in their own game. Farrel and Fox's self-given assignment is to stay in the crime while trying to take them down. Miami Vice starts out like most Michael Mann films - slow but to the point. You get a lot of up-front action right away with no real direction; and it doesn't help any that as soon as the action starts, the movie cuts and you are in a different scene. This film is shot mainly dark with a homemade feel to it. A slow thriller with hints of action. I would not say this movie is ""action at its best."" When going to see this movie, expect this to be like rush hour traffic - 2 hours of it. Once you see opening and hope, you get stuck at another standstill. With plenty of sex and added 'violent' effects, this movie will barely keep you awake. You may as well stay for the ending - because afterall, you did pay the money. My last comment and I hope this will clarify things for you... Collateral + Sex x Violence - Jamie Foxx's acting = Miami Vice.6/10 stars - Mann: take a break and come back with a 'new' movie, not a sequel.",Miami Vice

I've seen it 2 hours ago (just released here in Belgium) and it's maybe the best blockbuster I've seen this summer. OK, there's a lot of crap. The story is quite predictable and we've seen it before like a thousand times. Jamie Foxx end Colin Farell are too cool to be believable and the little love game between Farell and Li is just badly implemented. But if you forget this crap, you see an extremely entertaining and thrilling film. Beautifully filmed, well acted and with a great soundtrack. The shootout at the end blows you right out of your seat, almost like the bank robbery in Heat did. This is no stylized, slow motion bullet ballet we see to many times.

597,GoldTurkey,The worst movie I've paid money to see.,1,1 August 2006,"Let me say this out straight. I am very easily entertained. It does not take a masterpiece to make me feel that a movie was worth my time. Likewise, it takes a pretty bad movie to make me regret seeing it. As a matter of fact, in 20 short years of life, only one movie thus far has made me regret watching it: ""Surviving Christmas"", and that was on HBO.""Vice"" and ""Christmas"" surprisingly have something in common other than just being bad movies. The scenes are incredibly disjointed. One minute they're in a club, the next they're halfway around the world. I mean, maybe Michael Mann was looking to create a movie that made you think, but this movie just made me confused.The stellar talent of Jamie Foxx and the considerable talent of Colin Farrell is wasted here. I don't know if Foxx will have another performance like he gave in ""Ray"", but if he continues with trash like this, I'm guessing he won't.The story is confusing, to put it bluntly. Not ""early M. Night Shyamalan"" confusing, but ""poor writing"" confusing. There's something having to do with a drug deal, and I believe there's a white supremacist group in there somewhere too, though they were mentioned only in the first few minutes and the last few minutes; maybe Mann forgot about them throughout most of the movie? Regardless, this is the worst movie I've paid money to see, hands down.",Miami Vice

The scenes in the Dominican and Cuba look very authentic. Supposedly they ran into trouble while shooting this in a bad neighborhood of the Dominican... all the characters looked great and the action scenes were well done.As for the bad: The lines and dialogue did not come off as natural and authentic- especially from Jamie Foxx. The lines seemed forced and it just didn't seem like natural speech, especially between the feds and Miami Dade guys. I had to really pay attention to get what they were saying the first time. Also, the plot is tough to follow at times and I think lacks direction a bit. The acting ranged from great to average depending on the scene and actors involved.However if you can overlook the dialogue issues then this is worth a look for its great scenes, toys, and action.",Miami Vice
603,deejayquai,Excellent in every aspect.,8,16 August 2006,"I read the reviews and then went to see the film and thought it was a truly excellent cinematic experience. I'm just confused to the reaction from so many people here. I'm not going to sound arrogant and I realise that film like any aspect of art is subjective but it seems to me that so many people seem to miss some of the basic elements of why this film stands out head and shoulders above the majority of Hollywood produced films.Structurally it runs against the formula- we're not meant to know about the characters before, we're not given a nice introduction, the dialogue isn't staged to make it easy to take in- the film is meant to be challenging. The cinematography is exquisite- and it's NOT ""grainy"" night time video- it's low resolution in order to capture naturally low level lighting, which gives a very 'documentary' feel at times. However this is a minor element, the detail of the shot during daylight scenes is a high definition treat. The sound is also very, very good.Miami Vice has a lot in resemblance to Heat/ The Insider- the themes of isolation, moral ambiguity, lost identity, space and contrasts of natural/artificial colour etc The acting is excellent too. The only faults- too short, not enough investment in developing the relationships between the two leads and their female partners (but not with each other as this doesn't need explaining) and the finale comes a bit too rushed.For me- this is mainstream cinema that for once doesn't come processed in easily consumable chunks, with all the blanks filled in. Miami Vice is intelligent, ambiguous, riveting and individual. I recall Heat was received in its home country in a very similar way- a misunderstanding- perhaps down to the marketing machine. But now look at its status. I'm fairly confident over the next 10 years Miami Vice will follow a similar path.",Miami Vice
604,GildedPickle,"A little more action, please",2,9 August 2006,"44 pages of comments on Miami Vice; roughly 1/6 of the contributors rate this as 10/10, the remainder hover between 1 and 5. And it isn't hard to see why this has produced such a split effect: I, like so many others, had high hopes for this film, and was subsequently disappointed. As I enjoy reviewing films in terms of three key points, I suppose these would be the following:1) Mann hurtles us into the seedy underworld of Miami without stopping to check if the seat-belts are fastened. Nor, for that, does he bother to check that people in the audience might understand the indescribably foreign slang of the street which (allegedly) pervades the crack-dealing world. This incomprehensible vocabulary, compounded with chronic mumbling of which most of the cast are guilty, makes it difficult to figure out what is being said and why. This causes: 2) A plot which is convoluted, complex, unconcluded, irrelevant in places, unoriginal, and has the viewer in a continual state of bemusement wondering how and why certain deals were struck. Indeed we begin to wonder who exactly are our protagonists; this is not something explored in great depth (except, of course, their numerous copulations)3) On a more practical note, in one of the inevitable gun battle scenes (this is hardly a spoiler) the use of cameras seemed to go awry: I thought I noticed an increased frame rate for such scenes... I am no opponent to using hand-held, as this can be of great effect. However when it appears that the scene was shot by a nine year-old playing with his dad's video camera, the grittiness which was sought is irretrievably lost to amateurish shooting.Overall a disappointment of expectations engendered by both Mann's previous work and the original series. The only thing preventing me from leaving the theatre early was the company of friends: for shame.",Miami Vice

I love all sorts of movies and since my favorite TV show was trying to make a comeback, I decided to take what I could get.This movie was terrible. It just started without even a title, throwing you head first into a confusing plot. Most of the movie is spent elsewhere and not in Miami. Then there are the pointless sex scenes (yeah that's right, sex scenes that were so pointless that you didn't care there was nudity). This movie really had no point to it. The only thing matching the show is the title and the characters. How is it that someone who was so involved with the show would change EVERYTHING around. This should not have been called Miami Vice if it has absolutely nothing to do with the show of the same name. As it's own movie (outside of being a remake of a TV show), it was poor. Not enough action and too much concentration on the stupid love story that also had no point. I would not even call it Bad Boys 3 because at least those movies had a point.",Miami Vice

Capturing the very detail of everyones eyesight and doing ""Verfremdung"" like Berthold Brecht in every possible unexpected situation - he attaches you to the situation, the frame, and then just lets you fall back again, slapping your face with astonishing realistic scenes, and grabs you back again... I have seen Collateral and I was really surprised by the way Mann could bring out things that other directors wouldn't even notice. Miami Vice was an even more intense experience of that cinematic excellence. I don't see how it could be possible to exploit the camera even more than this!

I must have been in the theater for an hour and nothing important happened. There was very little character development and their roles didn't add up. Thats about the time I walked out of the theater alongside ten other people. However, they did a great job advertising and hyping up the movie. I thought it was going to be sweet.

The dialogue is too fast and too complicated. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are disappointing and have no depth to their characters at all. There are random scenes in the movie that make no sense at all e.g. Jamie Foxx and his chick get it on... why? Is it just to show Jamie Foxx's body? Was it a narcissistic request on his behalf to include such a scene? The storyline is bad.

611,Mikehoop3,Went in with low expectations. Came out feeling good.,8,29 July 2006,"The drama behind this film is misleading. The online bloggers are skeptical, and I had been exposed to quite a bit of pre-release negative feedback. I went into the theater with no hopes. I expected a poorly edited, poorly acted, poorly shot film with a bit of action. But film making has changed. With a world flooded by reality television and celebrity scandal tapes, it was only a matter of time before it began seeping through to film. Michael Mann has developed a style which condescends almost anything that could be taught in film school. ""Nobody knows nothing."" Simply put, I think that more and more films will start to 'fake' this reality style. It is not quite documentary, not quite film, but now with digital video cameras appearing in shapes and sizes beyond our dreams, there is now less to know about successfully creating a film. Mann uses a plethora of cameras. From very low surveillance quality, to higher speed HDCam.Besides his unique style, the story was told with a grand view. Mann really humanized such a wide range of characters. From sadistic drug lords to creative cops. OK, well maybe the acting was not Oscar worthy, maybe it wasn't very good at all. But I for one could care less. Gong Li was very good, and very beautiful, and everyone else was just very cool. That is why we want to see a film like this anyway, is it not? We just want to see a bunch of bad ass cops get in too deep, and then take out every foreign smuggler.Yes the film looks poorly shot, but it was intentional. That is the whole point. It could be you holding the camera. Its just another voyeuristic technique. Have we forgotten Rear Window? I'm not saying Michael Mann is Hitchcock, but maybe he will find the perfect story which compliments his style. I sure as hell think Miami Vice and Mann go pretty well together.",Miami Vice

She had a fantastic presence in this movie, I'd see it just for her. Despite some critics' comments that Jamie Fox was trying too hard, I thought he was pretty good in this one, maybe even better than his partner, even though Colin Farrell had more screen time.The movie was mostly serious and gripping, but there was one surprise action moment when half the audience hollered with laughter. If you've already seen the movie, your audience probably did the same, but if they didn't, guess which moment I mean? Things I didn't like: What I didn't understand is how Jamie Foxx and his girlfriend could be on the same police team. A bit of a conflict of interest. She would've still gotten kidnapped if they weren't working together, but two cops working together on the same team, who are also lovers... that seems like an unrealistic scenario if you're trying to make a serious movie.There was a lot of violence, and several sex scenes. The latter was tasteful, no moaning or screaming, but it felt sort of too sexual alternating with the frequent violence. The sex scenes could have just been shorter and more romantic. If you're going to show intercourse, then go all the way and show it longer and with more intensity - that will change the viewer's focus long enough to accept the scene and digest it. But don't mix brief moments of intercourse with other people's brains getting blown out.",Miami Vice
617,hankyuloff-1,better than expected,7,27 July 2006,"Flashbacks of a white suit worn to the wedding of an ex-girlfriend's sister went through my mind when I saw that there was another Television show Turned Movie. Go ahead and laugh, but I am sure more than one of the men out there had an Angel's Flight suit or some other Don Johnson wannabe be piece of 80's kitch clothing.I was very doubtful of the outcome until I saw they handed Miami Vice to director/writer Michael Mann. Mann, who brought us Heat, Ali, and Collateral adds another action film to his collection of hits with this version of the Miami Police Department's vice detective team of James 'Sonny"" Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs. They're the guys who show up and make happen what the CSI folk figure out later.In this Vice story, our heroes are about to break up a prostitution ring when they get a call from a non-active informant saying that there is something major going down and he is leaving. That this first story line goes away is good because it will give you a chance to get up to speed with the movie which starts above the speed limit in the very first frame and you need to get ready for the ride. This informant leads them to be assigned to an FBI task force investigating a drug ring that is going to involve Russians, Skinhead Nazis, Colombians and anyone else that can be thrown in. But that's not the important part. What is important is that the FBI task force has a leak that is getting agents killed. And since Miami PD is not part of it, Crockett (Colin Farrell from Phone Booth, Daredevil) and Tubbs (Jaime Foxx from Jarhead, Ray, Collateral) can be trusted to help the Feds get to the bottom of it.Part of the charm of Vice, is that it doesn't stop to explain things to the slow kids in the audience. To Mann's credit, he doesn't dumb down the dialog to let us know the intricacies of what the main characters are talking about. There's no ""Gee, if there is a bullet in his brain he was probably killed by the impact of it"" pabulum that invades television cop shows. The characters all know what they are talking about and expect us to keep up or catch up during gunfire scenes. Also to Mann's credit, he does not throw in a stupid twist like Crockett and Tubb's boss is part of the conspiracy. That would have sucked. Don't worry, their boss is a good guy, like them.The violence of Vice is another thing that is not dumbed or numbed down in this film. You don't just see a man getting shot and flying backwards from the impact, you see his insides come outside as each piece of lead tears apart the body. This is an R-rated film and it earns it. A strong warning to parents here if you think that the kids have seen cop shows and this is going to be the same..... NO.... This is lots of violence and it's not hidden by quick cuts and editing. And for those parents who don't mind their kids seeing bodies being ripped apart sinew by sinew, there are people having SEX, too! Good sex. With a 228 mile boat ride full of foreplay.And speaking of those racing boats I have a quick side note here. This may be a plot problem but I am not sure. You know those Go-Go boats? The really fast racing ones? Do they have enough range to get from Miami to Havana? I didn't know the answer to that one and it might be something that needs 'xpalining. But by the time you see this scene, you will probably be completely entrenched in the story and can't wait to see the two characters in the boat get to Havana for a mojito and sex that you won't care.I had been dreading this movie because if Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx were expected to act at all like their predecessors, it would have been a long couple of hours. But that did not happen. Farrell gets more screen time than Foxx, but they are both terrific. In looking back at Foxx's career, it was in another Mann film, ALI, that his career truly turned and he began getting away from the dufus parts to the serious Leading Man roles that he has had since. It was good to see him team up with Mann for the third time. He is an actor who is honing his craft and has become a reason to see a film. The best acting in the movie is turned, however, by John Ortiz, who plays Jose Yero, a mid-level management type in the crime syndicate. He is smart, and not so much evil as ruthless in running the business. Yero has been a lot of crime movies - The Opportunists, Narc, Ransom - but never anywhere close to top billing. This film could and should get him a lot more work, higher up the cast list. The Farrell love interest (there always IS one - it's in his contract) is Li Gong, last seen as the bad ass hooker Hatsumomo in Memoirs of a Geisha. I feel she was a little stilted and tight, but that might be the language block. When she is in scenes where she does not speak - and just relies on her body language, we see more of her abilities The soundtrack and sound are also terrific. Gunshots are loud and jarring and the background music makes you feel the heat on screen.I enjoyed Miami Vice. It was much better than I expected and that does not happen enough for me. You need to like action flicks. Or watching Foxx and Farrell and Gong. But that is not difficult - Let it be your own little vice.",Miami Vice
618,mcblm921,The Director Hits His Mark,7,5 August 2006,"I saw Miami Vice this evening. I loved it, a total nostalgia trip for me (now in my mid-30s), but I heard lots of people in the theater grumbling after the show. No, it's not going to seem as innovative as it was 20 years ago, no the actors are not the originals, no there have been lots of good movies about drugs and undercover cops made since then, but damn does director Michael Mann still have his creative vision. The jump cuts and lingering camera shots still seem fresh, especially when shot with digital video as he did for much the film. The pastel colors are gone, but they are replaced by deep primary hues that seem more in touch with today's aesthetic sensibility. There was much opportunity for Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx to overact, but they underplayed their roles throughout. The characters' relationships come to the forefront, as they did in the television version. The whole thing flows like a two-and-a-half hour music video; the story is told as much with gestures and scenes as with dialogue and character. The villains are still bad bad bad, but they have gotten more high tech and more evil. Nothing and nowhere is safe, and everything hangs by a thread. I've missed that in entertainment, and I was glad to have a dose of it tonight.",Miami Vice
619,TheWoosp,sh*t as f*ck,1,12 December 2006,"One of the worst remake things i have ever endured. Total crap cheese. Micheal Mann has an amazing skill of getting people with talent in front of a camera then producing rubbish. He has some hot birds so we need two shower scenes in quick succession.The Conclusion is obvious from the start so I will not say a word and this is not a spoiler, if you have seen the trailer then thats all you need. Don't investigate further in anyway.The only redeemable thing was some cool lighting in a scene down by the docks, not that that will make it clear.Overall, garbage. Go watch some crap like Transporter 2, at least that piece of poops was so bad it was funny.Avoid.",Miami Vice
620,supergodan,oozes with cool,7,31 July 2006,"definitely not what i was expecting. i was also expecting tons of action sequences, but we only got three. the movie is slower than i expected, but definitely took a more realistic approach to the whole thing...no bad boys 2 in constant action and entertainment, that's for sure.the gun fights were unlike anything i'd seen before and i give Michael Mann props for that...he definitely takes you into the action. when there wasn't action, it felt over drawn. no humour whatsoever (except for one line Jamie Fox delivers), it is a very serious movie.what i did find different, was that you did get to see that Rico (Fox) and sunny (farrel) were good friends, but the movie didn't focus on their relationships as much as the relationships of their female others. usually in these ""partner"" films, they have a struggle with each other or some kind of conflict...all in all, it's a good movie, and i'm still a fan of Mann, but it probably isn't what you are expecting.",Miami Vice

First the script is badly written then comes the directing ... It's total chaos and the worst thing about it is the music it is so not in place. I expected to see a good movie especially with two good actors, but it was a total disappointment for me! I strongly advise everybody not to watch the movie, because it's a total waste of time. Collin Farrel is my favorite actor but the role they gave him for the movie doesn't suit him at all.

623,ferrarifan-75188,Watch Miami Vice for the atmosphere/cinematography! This movie deserves better than all those negative reviews,8,23 April 2019,"I wanted to see this movie for a long time but I was always held back by the negative reviews it got (6,0 here on imdb and 45% on RT, which is not good at all). A couple of months ago, I watched it eventually because I'm a big fan of Michael Mann (Heat, The Insider, Collateral) and his (handheld) style, I like it when a movie is set in Miami and I like crime/cop movies. And since I saw it, this movie never went out of my head! Not because of the story or the characters but because the truly STUNNING atmosphere and cinematography that Michael Mann (and of course cinematographer Dion Beebe, who also shot Collateral) brings to this movie. It's one the most beautiful movies I've ever seen!
A lot of the movie is shot in digital and this absolutely suits a movie like Miami Vice. As a result, the city of Miami feels like a character and it feels real, as you were there. Especially the night scenes have a look that you NEVER see in any other movie. This, in combination with a great soundtrack make for some great scenes you will never forget (the boat scene in the middle of the movie, unforgettable!!) And as always with Michael Mann, the shootout/action scenes are fantastic with sound design that you don't hear anywhere else.What holds this movie back from being an epic movie like Heat or Collateral are 2 things:1. The Story: it's convoluted and the dialogue isn't as good as earlier Michael Mann films
2. The characters: They are not well developed and you don't learn a lot about their backstories. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx do a serviceable job but they don't have that much chemistry.Also if you saw the original tv series, I never did but from what I have heard, don't expect this to be like the tv series. This is totally different (some characters have the same name but that's about it)!In the end, Miami Vice isn't a great movie in general, which is a bit of a disappointment coming from a director like Michael Mann. That said, I think Miami Vice gets more negative reviews than it deserves so I still gave it a 7/10 because the cinematography is sooooooo masterful and atmospheric! Normally they would say: ""Style over substance"". Well, with Miami Vice: ""Style IS substance""!",Miami Vice
624,aukew,What a blockbuster!,8,21 August 2006,"Michael Mann made Miami Vice as he thought that Miami Vice was meant. Its raw style, the beautiful locations and the action from the TV-show amazed him and tempted him to make it into a movie.And he did it great, Miami vice is a stylish and dark thriller. The cinematography is simply fantastic and the action is so intense that it makes you feel you are there. The plot is intelligent and interesting for a broad public. The main question, how far can you go undercover, gives us interesting answers.The characters are very well played, especially Crockett and Tubbs and opposed to what I read on other comments I do believe that there is chemistry between them.Its visual power isn't simply there to show Mann's muscles, but it contributes each and every time to the story. This is an awesome blockbuster that shows that it is possible to translate a 80's TV-show in a positive way, but I have to be honest, I didn't expect different from Michael Mann.",Miami Vice

I think that big screen adaptations of popular TV shows deserve to be critiqued on their own merits. But...I never woulda guessed that I'd walk out on the piece of crap after just 50 minutes. In short:--NO on screen chemistry between Farrell and Foxx; --OVERLY jerky camera movements (which, in itself, would be OK, but they truly overdidit to the point where I was getting motion sickness)...Did Mann recruita high school intern or somethin' for this? --UTTERLY Unnecessary and LOOOONG love scenes that served NO purpose; --STUPID DIALOGUE that apparently took no creativity or thought; --NO DEVELOPMENT of any of the characters. Into the first 30 minutes, I wanted them all dead so I could just leave and go home. --POOR transitioning between scenes...Between scenes you thinking, ""huh? what was that?!"", and ""where da hell are they now""?Save your money and see something else.

626,sid-91,Movie was amazing,10,4 August 2006,"First off this movie was based on the TV show as you should know. I think part of the problem is that a lot of the audience viewing this movie version don't even know what the TV show was. Michael Mann stated many times that this was going to be a much darker and more explicit and adult version, think if Miami Vice was on HBO not network cable back in the day. I felt that the movie worked extremely well, the exotic locales, the awesome Ferrari Spyder and boats, and the overall artful cinematography. The firefights were another major highlight, this movie is about the action and this definitely meets the ""Heat"" expectations. I'll say that the story was a bit cheesy, but it is based on an 80's TV show for crying out loud. Colin Farrell's performance was good but as most other people have said Jamie Foxx's performance was outstanding and he did a great job of bringing the Tubb's character to life. Overall this is a great movie and it's shortcomings (soundtrack and slightly cheesy story) are more than made up for by the excellent camera, directing, action, and acting.",Miami Vice

It was so bad that this was the first film I actually saw people walking out of without even seeing the half of it I can't really comment too much on the story --which I thought to be pretty lame-- I wasn't up long enough. The actors had absolutely no chemistry at all, thus not engaging.

629,GS0000,"Well Paced, intelligent and beautifully shot",9,11 August 2006,"If you have seen Collateral by the same director, you have already seen a film that is almost identical in stylistic approach to Miami Vice. In fact several scenes are very similar indeed. As well as the frequent use of the vocal talents of Chris Cornell from Audioslave on the sound track.The film is a ""re-imagining"", if you will, of the original TV series of which Mann was an Exec Producer. It is a Brooding and dark film that has no fear of the fantasy of giving two policemen a Lear Jet, a Ferrari, a speed boat, a Yaught and so on.It is this marriage of action and toys with a dark and sometime incomprehensible plot that somehow works. Even at times it is difficult to understand what the characters are saying to each other.All this aside this film is very good. The acting by Farrell and Foxx is first rate and some of the opening scenes are eye candy of the highest order. The closing gun fight is also worth seeing. If you think too hard about this movie you will see its flaws. But you won't care, and love it anyway. A unique trait that can perhaps be applied to the vagueness of the plot.",Miami Vice
630,adevaalvoxx,Manns hard-boiled opus to the genre electrifies those paying enough attention,9,5 January 2018,"A lot of bad reviews for this film, and as undeservedly as they are, the arguments have a sort of merit. Namely the spare and crisp dialog, which, with every word illuminates another twist, might leave some confused as to why the events unfolding are happening, but an attentive viewer will find nuance, style and machismo blending beautifully and epic, into a film that can be almost endlessly re watched if given a few months each time. Mann directs an absolutely mesmerizing Ferrell and even manages to allow Foxx not being made for the role to creep into our minds as a possibility, as he delivers a performance i think would have been far less impressive without judicious and liberal time on the cutting room floor. Formulaic? Nah, just something of a standard done so well, you can hardly remember it ever sounding so good.",Miami Vice
631,kennetht-wong,Miami Vice - Not Mann's best work,7,27 July 2006,"Miami Vice (MV) based on a hit TV series from the 80s. Michael Mann who brought us Heat, and 2004's Collateral directs MV. Jamie Foxx from Collateral fame starred with Colin Farrell and Gong Li. Li has a surprisingly large role in the movie (almost rival Foxx's screen time). The direction was good and the few action scenes was intense. However, the overall plot is not tight enough to be intriguing. I am mildly satisfied with the movie given the caliber of the people involved in this project.Plot Outline: After a tragic security breach in the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force (JIATF), the FBI ask for help from the Miami authorities, who are not part of the compromised group. This assignment goes to Detectives James 'Sonny' Crockett and Ricardo 'Rico' Tubbs. Going undercover as offshore boat racers and outlaw smugglers Sonny Burnett and Rico Cooper, they take on the narcotrafficking network of the mysterious Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono and his Cuban Chinese banker Isabella. The intensity of the case pushes Crockett and Tubbs out onto the edge where identity and fabrication become blurred, where cop and player become one - especially when Crockett falls for Isabella, and when there is an assault on Tubbs's loved ones Story (3 out of 5)  There are couple of plot holes in the script and the story cannot seems to decide what the focal point of the movie should be.Acting (3 out of 5)  I am not a big fan of Colin Farrell as I think he can be over-rated. He was good in Phone Booth and Recruit, but not so much in Alexander. Foxx's subtle performance is clearly more enjoyable than Farrell's ""can be hair and mustache be any cooler?"" self-absorb acting. In addition, Farrell and Li do not share the chemistry and passion you would want to see from two people on opposite sides falling in love.Directing (4 out of 5)  There are some resemblances from Miami Vice to Collateral to Heat. The action scenes are scarce in the movie but were all well done and realistic. Although only given a simple script to work with, Mann's direction was good enough to make me not look at my watch for over 120 minutes. The only complaint is that the movie is based in Miami, but we do not get to see a whole lot of beaches, sun and good-looking people Overall (3.5 out of 5)  Mann's direction and Foxx's performance are the highlighted of the film. Gong Li is pretty with little makeup, but her romance with Farrell just does not work. This is a decent movie to watch in the summer, but definitely not Michael Mann's finest moment.Box Office Prediction  Opening in ~3,000 theaters, I think it will perform similar to Collateral. Substituting Mr. Cruise to Farrell will hurt a little, but the remake of a popular TV series will certainly balance it out and more. A 31Million opening weekend and decent word of mouth and put this movie over the 100M threshold.",Miami Vice

634,melissaan-1,Where's the humor?,6,11 February 2007,"Crockett and Tubbs were great characters in the old show, and the characters' bond was often built through comic relief. By draining all the humor (where was Elvis the alligator?) the movie was missing a key element that would have helped us care about this iteration of Crockett and Tubbs and their relationships. The action, the cinematography, the music and the performances are all great - it's just missing the fun and joy that was in the original series. I mean, the show was built on a couple of ""good guys"" - cops - that get to live the lifestyle of the bad guys - drug dealers. They get fancy cars, boats, clothes and private plans. Yet, in this movie, they aren't even enjoying them. Except maybe for the one scene when Crockett takes off for day or two with his lady love.

If you want two and a half extra hours of sleep this is a great movie to waste your movie on.

I scoffed and replied how after the movie was over i only wished there was more. I am a fan of Heat, and especially Mann's delivery of Heat in which he made you care and gave you a lot of time with smaller characters and through in sup-plots that weren't essential to the story as a whole and were not part of the synopsis let's say, but gave the film weight. Having said that Miami VIce succeeds in a different respect in that it doesn't give you time to catch up with the characters that you're always chasing them and you're always searching and making decisions with them. I would have liked to seen more in depth observations of the undercover missions and more of the white supremacists and the Columbians but i don't really miss those scenes nor does their absence lower the quality of this film. I think people expected a rehashing of the TV show and not a reinvention, the thing Mann does best.",Miami Vice

639,mm1923,Miami Vice is Michael Mann at his finest !!!,9,5 August 2006,"I just saw Miami Vice and once again come away impressed by Michael Manns vision. He took something that is a so complicated to understand and immersed you in the world of an undercover officer from the first frame.First off I liked how the movie began. No titles, no graphics. You are instantly dropped into the undercover world. I liken it to being tossed into a pool and now having to find your way out. You don't know who is who except Tubbs and Crockett. All you do know is that they are there to watch someone and who that person is and why remains to be seen. I like that. It gives you a fly on the wall feel. The action progresses fairly quickly because you are in the day in the life of an undercover officer.One of the other reviewers complained that there was too much dialog. That however is the beauty of the movie. The dialog is there to set up the action that is set to come. It also helps to answer a lot of the questions that will pop up later. I don't know why people can't understand what the purpose of dialog is in a movie. It is all essential.Another reviewer said that Tubbs and Crockett didn't seem to connect or communicate or were very cold. This is not a buddy cop film. It's not Bad Boys or 48 Hours. It is Miami Vice. In the real world after you have worked with one another and understand you partners skill set words become unnecessary. These are two highly trained, exceptional skilled undercover officers.I love the sound effects on Michael Mann films. In fact I love the audio on his movies all around. He doesn't go through the trouble of overdubbing or wind shielding. You get to hear everything that is happening naturally in the surrounding area. The gun shots and explosions are a thing of beauty. He doesn't bother trying to beef up the sound of live fire. There is no need. Live fire has it's own unique sound. A lot of people don't know what a real gun sounds like because they are so used to what Hollywood Foley artist try to pass off as gunfire.Visually being a fan of Michael Mann films I enjoy the lighting he employs. None of the unrealistically well lit night scenes or artificially night scenes by using dark lens filters. The natural lighting I find to be refreshing.In summation if you are looking for a tense drama, without inappropriate comedic moments see Miami Vice. If you are looking for one of the best movies of the summer see Miami Vice. If you are a fan of the original Miami Vice, Michael Mann or realistic action see Miami Vice.",Miami Vice
640,maria_art_3,"Miami Vice? No, thanks...",4,13 October 2006,"Miami Vice is the most disappointing film I saw this year. And that's because of the great reputation it got, which made me expect to see a very well done film. And it is far than that..Watching that film, I got bored very soon.. It is the first time I really got sick of seeing Colin Farrell. And it's the first time I got glad for watching a scene of guns and shooting between cops and ""the bad guys""(because it was the scene that kept me from sleeping!).The film is not interesting at all. The dialogs don't give make understand completely what the characters say and do. It's like the creators didn't care about who's watching. Things seem too easy for the couple of cops and they don't seem to be afraid or anxious of the mafia they approach. Half of the film is ""Sonny"" (Farrell) having sex with ""Isabella"" (Li Gong); far-fetched and boring! The characters of the film are not real people and probably this is due to the scenario; they don't have intensive characteristics and differences. The whole film seems that was done in a hurry and without care and caution.When the film ended, I thought of ""so..what?"" It's one of those films that give you NoThinG!..",Miami Vice
641,murx,Uh... what was THAT?,4,26 August 2006,"I don't expect much when I go to the movie theaters these days. But even with this lowered expectation it's still possible to disappoint me.Foxx and Farrell are both good and universal actors. But I think they have too much respect for Mann and the old TV series - so they don't take heart to compensate the poor story line.Oh yes, the story... I'm sure there's folks out there that knows about the details of drug scene investigation. But I as a dumb watcher from Germany need introduction and explanations which I both missed in this movie. Things simply are as they are and happen as they happen. No need to tell the viewer why and how. Beside this, the plot was stuffed with many time wasting (sex) scenes which were completely unneeded in respect of the story.Mann's cinematographer did some really nice shots of sky, clouds, and water. If you need to do a commercial for aeronautic stuff he's clearly the guy of choice. But for the most parts of the movie, he switches randomly between 35mm and cheap looking/speckle HD imagery. This look is only suitable during chase and shoot scenes as it kicks the viewer right into the action.The action parts are well done. But compared to a Tarantino movie where killing people looks cool, in Miami Vice it's simply disgusting. Maybe I'm already too old for todays pictures, but I want my bad guys to die in a cool way! This is a feature film, not a documentary about the day work of secret service investigators.Last but not least: as a fan of film music I missed some more reminiscences to Jan Hammer's original Miami Vice sounds. That's why I gave it 4 of 10.",Miami Vice
642,scdgoofy,Great movie,9,21 July 2006,"Lucky enough to catch the Los Angeles premier last night. As a fan of the TV series I had high hopes for the film, and I was not disappointed. It runs a bit long and drags a bit during the middle, but action sequences are good and graphic. Between the camera angles and the sound, you feel like you're right in the middle of it. Plot lines were appropriately developed and balanced well with the action. The dialog was sometimes hard to understand...either thick accents or mushy editing. But, no other serious complaints.Overall, great cops vs. drug dealers movie. (Oh yeah, the after-premier party was pretty cool too!!)",Miami Vice
643,truth-10,Directorial Tour De Force,9,25 November 2006,"I'm usually don't write reviews, but the gross discrepancy between general opinion and what is actually on screen is too mind boggling for me to ignore.This movie does not pamper its audience. It demands your complete attention. You like your movies to hold you hand and spell everything neatly out for you? Look elsewhere chump. You don't deserve to watch real movies.The star of this film is the direction. It's lean and mean and so uncompromising is almost aggressive. They should use this movie as a teaching tool at film schools.The cinematography is also staggeringly good. Nearly as good as that of The Insider. Mann has obviously made some very sophisticated choices for each and every shot in the film. I don't think there is a director alive that is at his level in this regard. Possibly David Fincher.The weak point of the film is the premise. It's been done too many times to work on its own merit. The fact that the film reaches greatness despite its premise is a testament to Michael Mann's uncanny skill.In conclusion:If you are unable to follow the plot and are oblivious to the craftsmanship involved, the problem is not with the movie.It's you.",Miami Vice
644,Willem Otto,Did I see Action?,2,22 August 2006,"I saw Miami Vice last night and before I went I was convinced that I would see an action movie, but I was terribly wrong. As mentioned by others the action was about 10 minutes of the 2h20 minute movie. The rest was filled with terrible love-scenes and dreadful dialogs. I can't understand that Michael Mann can make a fantastic film like ""Heat"" and than can come with this kind of crap. After 20 minutes I wanted to go, but I still believed that with this kind of money, the director and two good actors that the movie at some point had to go to a higher level, but this moment never came. When ""the plot thickens"" the gaps in the script became larger and larger and the chemistry between Farrel and Fox never came.Please take my advice and save your money and time going to this movie. If you like Miami Vice go rent the DVD of the old TV-show. I promise you that you will have lots more fun watching any episode than seeing this flick in the cinema.",Miami Vice
645,marsep,Perhaps too far from the original to be called Miami Vice,5,28 July 2006,"I was a huge fan of the original series yet I read a lot about the new movie prior to seeing it so that I would know what to expect this time around. As I now live in Miami and the local media are giving this movie huge exposure, it has been more high profile here that in, say, New York or Los Angeles.I think Michael Mann generally is a great director yet, in this particular case, he has perhaps strayed too far from the original for his own good. Miami's colors are vibrant and beautiful yet, everything here, even when it's sunny, looks a drab green or blue.Even with a weak plot, it's very hard to understand the dialog overall, up to almost 50% of the time!!??!! The actors are so ""restrained"" that you end up not feeling anything for them at all.The chemistry between Colin Farrell's character and Gong Li is barely tepid and I was disappointed in both of their performances. Jamie Foxx is better but not by much. The whole movie is too.... depressing I guess would be the best word.Overall, I would say this is an interesting movie but not fun and the end result is very disappointing.",Miami Vice
646,arniiie,Friggin excellent as always by Mr Mann,10,17 August 2006,"This one completely took me by surprise! I had of course heard some of the moviegoer complains, ppl who expected ""more"". But therein lies the whole genius of the flick. It's a toned-down atmospheric, artistic and desperately beautiful film full of grit and drama. Thanks to amazing camera techniques the viewer is involved to a degree where you almost feel like you're a character in the movie.I think reading some of the user comments beforehand allowed me to have the best possible experience watching it. I came in expecting a different type of drama, with creative use of camera, music, colors and atmospheric elements, a genuine Mann piece. And boy did I get a mouthful! You have got to approach it as an alternative movie-going experience, a piece of cinematic art if you will, not as a balls-out summer blockbuster action flick. Then you'll discover even the little action sequences will take your breath away, and the movie is a vehicle for putting the viewer on a roller-coaster entertainment ride, getting involved to a degree where you grab the armrests in amazement of the realistic feel of the movie.I will not pretend to be an expert on movies, all I know is that this was one of the most entertaining and visually stunning cinema experiences I have ever had. It will take you on a thrilling ride, and for that alone you should see it. Don't buy the negative hype.Hail the Mann!",Miami Vice
647,goreus,Poor film,3,27 August 2006,"Actors mumbled, camera work was shaky and even out of focus at points (plus a shot towards the end of the film in the shoot-out is extremely out of place and just looked stupid to be there - the shot with blood on the camera lens)and the story was distinctly average.People who believe that viewers who mock the film just don't understand the 'intelligence' of are simply wrong as there is none and just prove their personal lack of intelligence!Save your money and don't watch this film.P.S is it just me or is everyone else fed-up of pure money making films?!

648,gregorylehor,Great Film,10,7 August 2006,"This film was made to be as serious as could be. No B/S here. The movie moves along with a pace that may be hard to keep up with if you leave for the bathroom. If you are expecting a return to the 80's film, then this is not your cup of tea. The movie establishes Sonny & Tubbs, no ""getting to know you"" setup. The story can get away from you if you don't pay attention, it hooks you & reals you in. My only nitpick is that most of the story centralizes around Sonny more than Tubbs, but this is a small nitpick. I've seen some really great reviews of Miami Vise by people who sound like they know what they are talking about. The poor reviews are from those folks who either couldn't keep up with the story or as one critic said, ""It didn't even have the theme from the show."" I mean come on how shallow have critics become. I couldn't believe what I was reading was coming from someone who is paid to review movies! In closing I loved the movie and as far as I'm concerned it's the best movie I have seen all summer.",Miami Vice
649,franzybelle,Miami vice-does the job,10,17 August 2006,"OK OK, so we know that people are going to Diss this movie...straight away. maybe they don't like Colin Farrell? maybe they never liked the original story. Well, i've never seen the series..so my review is from scratch really.The movie kicks off in a buzzing nightclub in Miami, they extremely attractive folks are met with a hopping soundtrack. We are greeted with the presence of Farrell, Harris, Foxx and Rodriguez almost straight away, and so it begins. we see the boys in action. but that's not the best of it.the whole movie is full of action scenes. lets say the director was not afraid to turn the camera away when a person was shot, but it's not like ""Tarantino"" it's a civil death without the blood and legs flying galore.the camera style, like Colateral, was fantastic. gives you a real ""i'm there"" feel to it. you can sometimes even hear the camera man's steps.it reminded me of an art movie. with better action scenes. the flying scenes blew me away.as did Farrell. i think he surpassed himself, taking on a ""big boy"" role. he brought out himself in Sonny i felt. but that made me love the character even more. Foxx was outstanding as per usual. *thumbs up* so for me, i say it's a film to watch",Miami Vice
650,luiseflores,Sorry people but this was a let down,1,28 July 2006,"I just finished watching this movie if it can be called that, was this thing shot with a camcorder or really low end camera. I understand that directors want to bring in their own ""style"" or change the style of the norm, but this was awful. The Movie starts out intriguing, nice scenes followed up by some decent movement in the story, but then it just fails to take off. I feel that this film didn't have any momentum, just a dull story line which could have been great given the correct scripting but just falls very short and is left sitting in the water with no gas. I was looking forward to see this incarnation of a very cultural staple of 80's TV and left feeling empty. The trailer for the movie had more action then the actually movie. Both actors ( Foxx and Farrell) are very good actors i think their chemistry on screen did shine, but other than that i feel everything else in this movie just lacks; and by no means did i want over the top explosions or chases, just something to make this movie move faster.P.S: Who ever reviewed this film and gave it ""movie of the summer etc. etc."" has never seen a good movie or film, i dunno maybe it was some poor interns chore to see this film and hype it up for the studio or something but this is misleading both in reviews, and the trailer for the film in my opinion, sorry that is my rant about the movie.",Miami Vice
651,nottellinu-2,"no plot, bad acting and boring!!!!",1,29 August 2006,"Do not bother going to see this movie. I fail to see 1 good thing to say about it. Jamie Foxx must be one of the worst actors I have ever seen. I went in expecting to see an average film with my mates, but I almost fell to sleep in the first scene where the seem to play about 2 songs with the two guys walking around a bar. Half the time the 'actors' mumbled their lines so I consent understand what was being said and as for the plot. What Plot? Half the people walked out in the first hour. The worst film I have ever seen!!!! Oh and by the way the only bit of action lasted about 4 minutes and that was not even very good because they couldn't manage to hold a shot for longer that a second so you had absolutely no idea what was going on and who had got shot.",Miami Vice
652,Malgon,"Terrible, terrible movie",1,11 August 2006,"I really don't know what to say, this movie didn't even live up to the expectation that I didn't even have. Plain and simple it was the blandest and most unexciting film I have ever viewed. I reckon Heat was quite a good movie, but absolutely nothing in this movie showed any oomph, as it totally lacked any sort of enjoyment.I just didn't understand why people would see it to be any good, as almost every person walked out of the movie with a stunned look on their faces, as they had no idea that what they had just viewed made no sense at all.Severely stunned that a movie could even be so boring or bland in its execution.10 out of 100.",Miami Vice
653,nthorup-1,Was expecting nothing better!,9,13 August 2006,"This movie was amazing... Ever since I first saw the trailers I had been eagerly waiting for the release. If you expect to see a non stop action movie you will be disappointed, in fact not a single gun was fired in the first half of the movie (This didn't have a negative affect on the movie at all). However, if you can appreciate great directing and acting you will love Miami Vice.The camera work in this movie was simply fantastic. For the high intensity action scenes, Mann used a regular handy cam which added realism to the whole film. Mann also filmed scenery especially well, capturing the beauty of the Miami coast line. Also I just have to point out how awesome the boats and cars in this movie are. Despite this excellence I believe the film lacked emotion. I would've liked to see more of a bond between Foxx and Farrell. I would definitely like to see a sequel to Miami Vice, the ending certainly left Mann with this opportunity.",Miami Vice
654,gridiron18,Great,10,29 July 2006,"It is not exactly character-deep and the plot isn't easy to follow, but it's easy ENOUGH and doesn't treat us like dumb-asses nor like attention-impaired kids. This is a great adult movie, not gonna be mainstream but that makes me respect Michael Mann even more for his risk taking. It is dark and the look and feel is mesmerizing. It is about authentic undercover police work, NOT ""look at me"" 80's nor should it be compared to the masterpiece HEAT nor Collateral. Great stuff. Ugly and beautiful at the same time.No, Farrell and Foxx aren't going to win any Oscars but that is fine. What is important is the intensity of the film and the authentic, surreal, dangerous world that Michael Mann has created. However, though frustratingly miscast, Gong Li is mesmerizing.The film is not cute, maybe not even especially fun a la Bad Boys, but it is unique in feel, fresh in style, beautiful in scenery, ugly in content, and intense in emotion.",Miami Vice
655,bostonsheik,Definitely (Not) Miami,10,23 August 2006,"Except for its dark, gritty style, this big screen version of ""Miami Vice"" is very different from the classic TV series, which had the right balance of style and substance for most of its 5 year run (1984-1989). While the TV series was more classy, smooth, and glamorous, this film is more rough, primitive, and cheap by comparison. Also, there is less style and far less substance to go along with it.On its own, this film is solid and entertaining, with excellent action sequences. The photography also contributes to its realistic feel. However, many of the TV episodes were more cinematic than this film. The boat ride to Cuba is the only sequence in the movie that recaptures the cinematic brilliance of the show, with its excellent photography and the Moby song playing in the background. In addition, some of the orchestral music, including the romantic score of Crockett and Isabella, is somewhat similar to Jan Hammer's style. However, most of the film is dry and choppy, in a contemporary way. It seems that Mann is experimenting with a new form of story telling in this movie, with its extreme and turbulent close-ups. But its appeal with audiences may be questionable for now - unlike the revolutionary style of the series, which captured audiences instantly.About 20 years after his television series, Michael Mann never bothers to reintroduce us to the characters, who are reinvented here. The sudden beginning of the film reminds you of the pre-title sequences in the TV series. But once the ride begins, there is never any pause for the audience to get to know the new Crockett and Tubbs, in addition to the supporting characters, who had interesting background stories in the series. Farrell and Fox perform well in their roles, but fail to recapture the magic between Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas.Farrell's Crockett is intriguing in this version. Unlike the moral hero portrayed in the series, this Crockett is seduced by his undercover life too easily. He also looks more like trailer trash in this movie, compared to the stylish, sophisticated portrayal by Johnson in the TV series. Therefore, while these differences are interesting, Mann does no justice by leaving this character without a background story. The same applies to Tubbs, whose experience as a pilot is never explained.The cheap sex scenes and bad language also hurt this film greatly - taking away from the class act that used to be ""Miami Vice"". Gong Li's English is hard to understand and her character is too morally questionable to be liked by the audience. It is hard to believe her romance with Crockett when she is sleeping with multiple men behind his back. This ruins the director's attempt to recapture ""Casablanca"" at the end -- although he does come very close, to his credit.Overall, this movie is worth seeing for its entertainment value, but it is not ""Miami Vice"". The 2 hour series pilot in 1984 was far superior to this film. There was much excitement when Mann announced that he would write and direct this big screen version. Fans felt secure that he would save his creation from getting trashed by other film makers, who would likely do a comedy spoof of the 80s. But, ironically, it seems that Mann ruined the franchise himself by running too far away from it. Time will tell. I would like to see a sequel with more substance. But for now, I will give this film 10/10 for the ""Miami Vice"" name alone.",Miami Vice

Jamie Foxx is excellent, as is Colin Farrell, an actor that I don't normally enjoy watching, is actually quite well suited to this role.The only downside is that the movie is quite long, and really feels it...In general I would say that this movie is good for a Saturday night, with something in for the guys and the girls alike.

Do not waste your time or money with this hunk of useless crap. There are points in the movie when you will find yourself wondering why are they here? They just mentioned something about x location and they are doing what they said in y location. The camera work is horrendous, half the time I felt like I was on a boat with all the rocking and such. The so called ""police"" look like they have never been to weapons training at all. I usually like the two lead actors in whatever role they play but they didn't make me want to even care about what was going on at all.

First of all, I was falling asleep but kept myself awake in hopes of some shooting or fighting but of course, there was nothing. Anyone who wants to watch this, I am warning you, do not spend money to do so, i.e. rent, or order it on digital cable, etc. You will find that it is the biggest waste of your life - it definitely wasted 2 hours of my life.

Yes, the plot is hard to follow and the voices are muffled but that is all part of the experience and the plot line being shoved down your throat all the time. Its a shame people can't start to appreciate this film rather than just thinking 'the older one was better'.The fight scenes, though quite few and far between really hit the spot in the classic 'Michael Mann' way.

As much as I liked the TV series, it is very outdated and almost campy, as most 80's shows were. Don't get me wrong, MV will go down as the #1 TV show of the 80's in my book, but be honest with yourself, it is the 80's.The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 10 is the scene changes. They seem kind of abrupt and you can really tell where there should be more of one scene. Hopefully the Director's Cut DVD will run a little smoother. Other than that, I have no problems with the movie whatsoever.I only hope that this movie is uber-successful and sparks a MV franchise along the lines of Spiderman and Pirate of the Caribbean.",Miami Vice

Farrell and Foxx were good, although I think Farrell was trying so hard not to be Don Johnson, his acting sometimes suffered. The film has obviously moved into the present day, but for some reason, the overly intrusive soundtrack has been left behind in the eighties and it sucks.

On top of which the film was shot deliberately grainy...I guess it's built in quality degradation for when they sell it on ipods. The film trick worked great in Traffic...but it was just one more lame part of this movie.Where's the music? Actually the music was good, I owned most of the songs in my music collection. But here's the thing. The TV show was a pioneer in introducing us to the best music of the day. If you song made it onto the the TV show, you were laughing all the way to the bank because it was sure to be a hit. The sound track was a re-hash, or maybe some new covers at best.

The plot, or lack there of is completely confusing. There are so many bad cuts its ridiculous. One minute it will be daytime and then they will walk out of a building 5 minutes after they walked in and its pitch black.

Dialogue was good and smooth, the cinematography was amazing, and the sound - just wait till a gun fight, you will see what I mean. The choices of Foxx and Farrell as Tubbs and Crockett was a good choice. It took me awhile to warm up to Farrell, but, he does a good job of portraying Crockett. Foxx does an excellent job. The supporting cast for this effort, especially the C&T's boss, were also good choices. Michael Mann movies, overall, are long and have very comprehensive story lines.

There is some quality action shots as you would expect of a Micheal Mann film but I think he was too busy trying to show all the expensive toys the drug dealers use to actually allow a plot to develop. The film just wanders from start to finish like the average episode did but as if it had been strung out to 2 hours especially the trip to cuba which seems to serve no purpose except to have a different backdrop and an excuse to use his speedboat. The final gunfight was entertaining with more realistic gun noises but was still not up to the quality of the one in Heat. It looks like it left an opening for a sequel which depending on if they discover the razer and acting classes could still be a good thing Lets hope Colin returns to his acting more on a par with Swat or the Recruit where he looked promising rather than this or Alexander which have been poor,Miami Vice

About 9 relatives of mine have seen the movie and the show was sold out. Watching this film was a shock to see how much the acting was horrible...I mean I am really good at judging films, and I'm not hating because I'm pretty laid back when it comes down to movies...Its pretty obvious when you watch a good film or a bad film....but seeing this film completely shocked..because of such a great title, and great actors....especially Jamie Fox, it really confused to me to see a movie that just dragged on with ""Love scenes"" and Colin Farrels girl-friend who could not act at all. The story line was horrible, and just by looking at the audiences faces you can tell they where all sitting and watching with confusing looks. Almost half of all the characters I didn't even know the names of. I honestly tried to find some good outcomes of the movie, I'm not being shallow about this...Im just speaking my mind and so are 9 people...to be honest the only good thing we pointed out from the movie..is the Raw camera looking footage, and nice death scenes...thats about it. This movie had way too much love scenes..and no good message to me or probably 90% of the movie theater. To tell ya the truth, anyone i talk to who have seen the movie, i would ask them if they remembered anything from the movie....all they can point out is the action scenes..and that speed boat...then i ask them if you understood the plot..the story and the characters...and they seem to have some trouble remembering it...pretty weird huh?",Miami Vice

I also haven't seen the series ""Miami Vice"" but as far as I can tell there isn't much relation. I remember hearing the series was sort of corny and silly with some jokes and over dramatic music and action, this film is much more serious, and, violent. There's a scene where you see a guy's arm rip off from sniper fire. The film overall was very good as I said before. There's only one shootout that I can recall but the dialog and suspense of ""What's going to happen in this scene"" is enough to keep it going. But if you're not one for suspense of dialog and emotion and only think it's interesting if something is blowing up or being shot at you might not like this. As I said before there's only one shootout in the 2 hour and a half long film, and it's near the end. But it's a good one, there are a handful of turns in the film as well which keep it interesting, and although some characters barley get any screen time (""The Man"" has three scenes) you feel like you know who they are none the less. All the characters are well developed, the only thing I disliked was the ending, but that's because it's not what I'm use to. And that's all I can say without ruining it. Yeah so it's a good movie, if you like Thrillers you should see this, if you only like explosions and shooting at people, probably not for you, but there's always a chance to give something new a shot. Which you should, I haven't seen Heat or any other Micheal Mann films, but if they're like how I described, and you liked them. You'll like this too.",Miami Vice
672,trigunmmvi,Did Michael Mann Want To Do This Movie?,4,29 July 2006,"I waited almost a month since I first saw the trailer to this movie. I even bought the second season of Miami Vice on DVD in expectation for this movie. I was expecting the same character development as Heat and Collateral and the same fresh style as the movies mentioned. Yeah, Vice has almost all the style of the other two especially the tinges of blue in almost every scene but the character development was missing and what was going on the with plot on this movie. I would have loved to have seen more involvement from the rest of the Vice team (the guy who plays the Thing in Fantastic Four was in this movie)Instead what I get is a movie that underachieves to the point I question if the director even wanted to do this movie. The movie doesn't even have opening credits. The television show has not been on the air for at least a generation and I guess the viewer was expected to be familiar with the characters. Collin Farrell looked more like a stylized trucker than someone who is undercover. Jamie Foxx is, well, Jamie Foxx. Foxx's performance was not nearly as good as Collateral but then again Michael Mann probably put more effort rt into the movie as far as dialog and plot. Gong Li's broken English was killing me and her eyes were more like a zombie than a somewhat attractive movie. I would have been nice to see a rift between Crockett and Tubbs but that would be like doing a good movie in Mann's case. I would love to see another Miami Vice and forget this one ever existed. My rating is mostly based on a comparison to the other Michael Mann movie that are really good and have so much depth. I guess Mann just wanted to get his TV to Movie pop culture reference out of the way as soon as possible. I hope he does better than this!",Miami Vice
673,asheikhfm,Sucks!,2,31 July 2006,No cohesion in the story - the plot is all over the place.The characters are not well-developed and the love story between Farrel and Li Gong is confusing and not developed at all.Poor screenplay and not enough action or direction.This movie's action scenes were boring. There were two gun fights that were pretty poor.The love scenes were repetitive and drawn out too long.The original TV show had some color with the characters. No such thing here. There were so many loose ends in the movie that your head is spinning by the end and you just want to claw your eyes out.,Miami Vice
674,mkarbani,Another Michael Mann Masterpiece,10,9 August 2006,"What can be said about Michael Mann's Miami Vice other than, Masterpiece. Mann has taken a good TV show and added his artistic stamp to create a work of greatness. Why is it great. First off, every frame of the picture has the expert precision and craftsmanship of a visual genius. Though some may dismiss the minimalist dialogue of the film, remember that film is visual storytelling, and when in the hands of Mann the story comes full force with strong characterizations through the pure visuals. Mann is not an all-style and no substance director, rather his visual form works perfect for the content. Shooting in High-Def may just be another tech fad for another director, but Mann uses HD to see into the nights and create a unique sense of gritty realism. Mann has also not just created another all thrills action movie, he takes us into the depths and darkness of real undercover police work, including the appeal. This is the place that movies were made for, where we can sit in the safety of our theater seats and go to a very dangerous place and have a great storyteller to show us that world. The realism in Miami Vice is the major breaking point from the TV series. This is far from a flaw but rather the best direction to go in with this material. Overall, every aspect of the picture is great due to the various directorial intuitions. So, what's my verdict, you guessed it - 10/10. Approach to be amazed.",Miami Vice
675,GrahamBruce10,The Coolest Film this year!,10,5 August 2006,"As those who know me are aware, i am a big fan of the 80's TV series. When i first heard rumours of a new MV movie my initial reaction was GOOD GOD NO especially after the tripe that was Starsky & Hutch, Charlies Angel etc. Then when further news was released that none of the original cast were in it i thought THIS IS GOING TO STINK but then Michael Mann was confirmed as Director, and Farrell and Foxx were signed up to play Crockett and Tubbs and my mood changed to THIS MIGHT JUST WORK. Well last night i took my current wife along to the cinema to watch this movie, and all i can say without spoiling it for others is GO SEE THIS FILM! I loved (and still do love) the TV show, but this movie is just awesome. The cars, the clothes, the locations, the acting, the story, the gunfights, the music. So if you liked the original show, go see this. If you liked Heat (the movie, not the magazine!!) go see this. I LOVED IT! Just to prove it's not just a bloke thing, my wife loved it too!",Miami Vice
676,donaldesmail,"Audience applauded film: intense, real with strong emotional undercurrent",8,31 July 2006,"The devil is in the details and Mann blends Miami Vice drama and action into a fine solution.Sometimes I want a smiley face buddy cop film. This isn't it. I like the real deal. Miami Vice offers feel real partners in a credible situation. Character development is taut and succinct. Because of the strong emotional undercurrent of the film the actors fill the screen with intensity without being broad.I have heard that a film should be seen without sound and be appreciated. Miami Vice is dramatically such a film but, then the SOUND!An excellent update of the TV show.",Miami Vice
677,eddythetrooper,am i in the minority on this one...terrible,1,4 August 2006,"I'm not altogether i actually saw a movie when i paid my 10 bucks to see ""Miami Vice"", there is more action in watching the British Parliment or the senate hearings on cspan. Good lord what a disappointment. I firstly must say that i do not think Colin Ferrel is worth having an acting career b/c i have seen tax auditors express a wider range of emotion than this guy. The whole 2 + hour movie is nothing more than Fox and Ferrel and the whole rest of the cast acting like they are waiting to see the doctor or the dentist-- as in no emotion at all. the best part of the movie was the wise cracking man sitting behind me and that inherently means that the movie was a flaming bag of dog poo. I want my money back",Miami Vice
678,Maxopoly,Walked out,1,28 October 2006,"This movie was so dumb I actually walked out of it. I got bored, and kept wondering why the editing was so bad. There was no smooth segway between scenes, it was like *poof* we are here *poof* now here. Ugh The dialog also made no sense for most of it. I don't mean to knock what must have taken forever to make, but jeez. I guess I just hope they don't make a second one. I usually like the actors that were in this. In this case tho...not so much. I also asked people who had also left before it was over what they thought, and they agreed with me. When I walked out there were five other people in the lobby just shaking their heads. Too bad Miami Vice can't do a ""do-over""",Miami Vice

Hollywood cant' make a good movie anymore. They have totally lost their way. Miami Vice is a mess from start to finish. However Colin and Gong do a great job and their love relationship was the only thing that keep this movie from being a total failure. Nothing works in this movie and most of the acting? was poor, disjointed, and over-scripted. Some of the cinematography was great but other parts where horrible and hard on the eyes in a big screen theater. Bottom line this is NOT one of Michael Mann's better movies. He could have done so much better in making Miami Vice 2006. Sad",Miami Vice
680,cparkes14,Miami Vice 2006,8,27 August 2006,Michael Mann director of Collateral and Heat brings us Miami Vice the film. We are introduced to Vice cops Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) in a modern Miami The characters of Crockett and Tubbs are much darker and exciting and a thrilling shootouts during the film.There is brilliant performances from both Farrell and Foxx. I could not think of anyone else better to play Crockett and Tubbs than Farrell and FoxxIf you are expecting the 80's TV show you are wrong this is a modern film not based on the TV's series only the charactersMiami Vice does not disappoint so don't listen to all the bad reviewersI hope there is a sequel,Miami Vice

682,statostatostato,80's re-trend,10,29 July 2006,"Just got out of a screening of the movie there and i must say that Michael Mann has served the TV series well. Cinematography, directing, acting all top notch stuff but i am disappointed about several things...1. Jamie and Colin speak, at most, a dozen lines to each other (but the movie isn't a buddy movie-like Michael Mann said in several interviews, it about their relationships with other people and their chemistry) 2. Plot isn't v. great (even one as thin as this) 3. Lack of the goddamn boat-race sequence.4. Gong Li and Colin's chemistry isn't what it should be, but the sexual tension between the two is amazing.why give the film 10/10 when there are flaws, well, BECAUSE MICHAEL MANN GAVE US HEAT, ALI, THE INSIDER AND COLLATERAL. This will probably do well at the box-office and i hope a sequel will go ahead, that and Michael Mann will go all commercial and do a franchise. Either way it won't do him any harm returning towards the dark seedy underworld that is ""Miami Vice""",Miami Vice
683,tmrussll,Miami Vice,1,1 August 2006,"Perhaps it was the shaky hand held camera effects or the random poorly shot mild porn scenes. It could have been that I wanted to scream at Collin Ferrel ""Hey! Its called shampoo and haircut and a razor! Jesus!"" or yell at Jamie Fox ""Please shave your nappy pointy beard thing!"". Either way, the two co-stars did nothing but recite boring lines and stare off into the oblivion. The only bright star in this film is....nothing. It is a dark and depressing waste of your life. There were no exciting car chases, little to no plot, and a craptastic ending that leaves you feeling a little nauseous knowing that that there will more than likely be a sequel.Save yourself and do not see this movie",Miami Vice
684,italiankingofhearts,Colin Farrell is definitely not Crockett,3,26 July 2006,"OK for those true Miami Vice fans like myself. This movie is an insult to us. We all know that Don Johnson is the one and only James "" Sonny "" Crockett and that his character played a beach bum cop with the football lingo and the quick witted street smarts.. One who always introduced a 15 letter word each week in his dialog and may appeared unorthodox to the untrained eye but was always strictly business. He could always tell the players without a program. He also made a fashion statement with his wardrobe even if it looked like he slept in them and then rolled outta bed and went to work without a shave. Colin Farrell in this movie does not resemble that character what-so-ever.Jamie Foxx however did make for a good Ricardo Tubbs if only he had the $500,000 a week wardrobe budget that the TV show had I would of been totally convinced. Then again Jimmy Walker or Snoop Dogg could of played that character too.It was hard to follow the plot because it seems like they took 25 old episode plots and tried to cram them all in a 2 hour movie. I did like the action side of this movie, Micheal Mann never seems to disappoint in that area. I wish they would of took more time and effort in casting the Crockett character. After all the TV show was based on his character. This movie reminded me more of newer BADBOYS movie with a pulse. I gave this movie a 3 out of 10 vote for effort and action. But as Crockett would say ""This movie left me off at Sears and I cried all the way to WalGreens.",Miami Vice
685,nancy-nighswonger,A poor remake of a classic TV show,4,2 August 2006,"Consider this a very poor remake of a classic TV show. Michael Mann is back, but fails to deliver this time. Michael focused on shoot them up graphic (and I mean blood dripping off a wall) violence and failed to develop the characters. Michael missed the best part of the original TV Vice -- the incredible ""best buddy"" chemistry between Crockett and Tubbs. I find it sad that Michael Mann feels that blood dripping off a wall is more interesting than watching well developed characters. I like gun fights and violence just as much as the next guy....but a great movie is not all gun fights and violence.Crockett and Tubbs had no interesting or witty dialogue. Somebody must have told Colin that Crocketts character spoke w/a mumble--because his dialogue is very hard to understand and sounds at times like he has a bag of marbles in his mouth! Colin looked the part, however he failed to deliver the Southern drawl and charm and charisma that Don Johnson gave his Southern Born & Raised Sonny Crockett. Simply put, Don Johnson is a far superior actor! Jamie Foxx looked the part and did a much better job with the Tubbs character.The music and visuals were ""updated"" for the movie, but gone are the cool instrumentals from Jan Hammer -- they have been replaced by modern day ""Linkin Park"".I also found the movie to be plot less. It really dragged thru the first half. I also felt it strange that Michael Mann felt the need to have 50 different ""bad"" guys in this movie? There was a ""bad guy"" that represented almost every country in the world? China, Japan, Russia, Cuba, Mexico, Columbia, etc. He should have stuck with just one bad ""Columbian"" or perhaps 2. It was confusing and unnecessary to follow that many bad guys. These ""bad guys"" were incomprehensible at times -- the thick foreign accents were at times impossible to understand.Sum total= this was a mediocre remake attempt at the Original Miami Vice TV show. I was disappointed! The 80's television show Miami Vice was hot and trend-setting, this movie fell way off that mark. It was however much better than Pirates of the Caribbean II.",Miami Vice
686,ramsfan12889,Why?,1,31 July 2006,"This film had a lot of hype and I was very enthusiastic towards seeing this film. However by the end of the film my feelings towards the movie were far from what I expected. I felt disappointed, confused, and angry. First of all this action movie lacked any action. I felt like nothing happened until the last 30 min. The whole movie was random sex scenes, not that theirs anything wrong with sex scenes,however there is a limit. This film reminded me of a porno with its random unrealistic sex scenes and horrible music. Colin Ferrel seemed robotic and fake. The only thing good about this film was Jaime Fox and he was even in it enough. There were large gaps were he would just disappear. This film would have been better with more action, more Jaime Fox, less Colin, less sex scenes, and better music or none at all.",Miami Vice
687,Guybrush_Lechuck,"Classic Mann, a realistic portrayal of the Vice/Drug world.",7,7 August 2006,"I watched the TV show passively as a kid, so I had no expectations that this film should follow any pre-existing formulas or character templates. Mann himself stated that this would NOT be a rehash of the 80's series, but a re-envisioning for 2006, so I really don't see why fans of the series continue to gripe about the film's departure from the hammy/comic relief-laden format of previous.Mann is one of my favorite directors, and again, he delivered on all levels. He immediately drops you into the story, and leaves it up to you the viewer to follow along as he shows you a small slice of the lives of these Vice cops. This was a refreshing change from the current Hollywood trend of force feeding you every bit of information and pandering to the most dim-witted of audiences.People claiming they couldn't follow along with the plot or had no idea what was happening either have poor comprehension skills or a short attention span. The film was not hard to decipher in the least. The police jargon was portrayed realistically without excess explanation, as Mann was keeping with the realism and succinct nature of the dialogue. I suppose this caused confusion among the less knowledgeable audience, but at the same time I'm glad he didn't compromise his vision/realism just to ""explain"" every nuance of the film to those who wouldn't appreciate it anyway.To truly appreciate this film, you really need to have some cinematic literacy, as the technicality and deftness of the direction goes unnoticed otherwise. Mann clearly has a strong grasp and knowledge of cinema history, and influences of French New Wave, German Expressionism, and a variety of other styles can be seen in frame after frame, as well as the minimalistic approach of Melville at times. Perhaps this is why the movie has had such lukewarm to negative reception here in the States. It seems Mann has overshot much of the American movie-going public who are generally not so film literate and care more for cheap thrills than substance.Regardless of how this performs in box office, Mann should be proud that he stuck to his guns and didn't change his vision to play to the lowest common denominator. Vice was the best film of this year by far, and while popcorn films like Pirates and Superman may rake in more at the box office, I feel time will show that Vice is the far superior film.",Miami Vice
688,mcat_bookssale,Doesn't meet the Mann Standard,1,29 July 2006,"The cinematography was amazing, but I had issues with the story (concentrated too much on Sonny and Isabella) and at times it was ridiculously slow. Going into this film I expected a lot, after all it's Michael Mann, but it didn't live up to his caliber at all. It had the colors and feel but not the writing or pace. Gong Li killed it, and in the end Mann is to blame for casting her. No chemistry with Farrell, terrible English and Spanish (again, she's not to blame), seriously she didn't belong in this movie, she was totally out of place. I could see he was trying to go for the same type of forbidden love theme which he executed masterfully in Heat, but fails this time around. Is it me or did his his direction of action scenes weaken this time around (see club scene Collateral/Heat finale)? Take the Michael Mann title away and my interest slightly goes up, but since this is the same director who teamed up Pacino and De niro and gave us one of the greatest scenes in film history, I expected more and ultimately came out disappointed.",Miami Vice
689,ameadows252,Easily one of the greatest action movies of this generation!,10,29 July 2006,"Every detail of this film was excellent....I lied, the romance aspect of the movie felt slightly unimportant and was kind of corny, but that was the only downside to the entire film! As an aspiring film-maker, I was inspired greatly after seeing this movie. Micheal Mann proved that making a good action movie was possible. Let me start with the cinematography.................ummmm..............flawless, every single frame was eye-candy. The sound............also, flawless, every single gunshot felt important and had a purpose. The music fit each scene perfectly and never went unnoticed. It must have been researched well, because of the fluid use of drug-related slang terms and such. The characters each had a motives and although they lacked a background (which usually creates development) it only made the characters develop that much more, because they revealed who they are more and more as the story progressed. Overall the movie was gritty and as realistic as an action movie can be. It was intense, humorous in some scenes just enough to keep the movie from feeling serious the whole time. It was dramatic. It was overall a beautiful film. It's frustrating to me that most of my friends found 'John Tucker Must Die' to be a better movie than this.............by the way..............it's not, its mindless, temporary entertainment filled with filth that American cinema has seen at least 18,000 times.",Miami Vice
690,gust-7,Sucked Incredulously,1,7 August 2006,"This movie sucked awful, It is the first one I have actually fell asleep during. It had no real action at all for the first 89% of the movie. They should have advertised it as a documentary on Vice cops due to the way it was laid out. This is honestly the worst movie I have ever seen and if I could, I would rate it like -10 out of 10. It just sucked so hideously much. They need to make this movie suck less. Maybe sucking less would have made this movie better. I think if they made the movie 10 minutes or so long from where I say the action starts, It might be worth time as a short on a Public Broadcasting channel. This movie is way too over-hyped, they need to rename it from Miami Vice, to Miami Worst Movie Ever Vice. This movie should seal the writers, producers, and actors fates as failures in life and in cinema. It is completely trash and shouldn't even be allowed in cinema's. Heck, it shouldn't even be allowed in little back yard 5 year old kids playing pirated DVD's on a really tiny 40 inch display. It's a complete waste of the 50 foot screen's time to show this movie.",Miami Vice

The story was abysmal and I wonder about the voting on this site when I see so many votes for 10.The acting was uniformly painful to watch, with the odd exception out of Jamie Fox.The filming style was a failed attempt at reliving the graininess of Collateral and the costumes left certain characters looking like shaggy dogs.Mann tried to make a DARK movie in Miami. Clearly not his best effort.The entire audience in the theater I was in was muttering throughout the movie and numerous people walked out.The only reason I can give for staying myself is that I also sometimes find myself staring at highway accidents.",Miami Vice
692,rooita,One of the worst movie I have ever seen,1,9 December 2006,"This movie was embarrassing to watch. I was very excited to see it being a big fan of the series, and I was wholly disappointed. It was not due to the fact that it was unlike the series, it was due to the fact that the movie utilized two big name actors to draw in fans and they both phoned it in at best. Everything Jamie Foxx said was a one liner that could easily have been stolen from another cop movie. At one point he had a phone conversation with his girlfriend that went something like this ""What's up?"" ""Nothing"" ""I just call to see what's up with you"" ""Nothing is up. What's up with you?"", I hope they got that on the first take. And Colin Farrell should have stuck to the one liners, every time he said 4 consecutive words he stopped for like 3 seconds then said 4 more consecutive words. Don't give me any of the dramatic pause crap. Don Johnson probably wishes he was dead after seeing this so he could turn over in his grave.I will end with that and await all of the replies I am sure to get from people who tell me I am stupid and this was a brilliant movie.

It was really confusing and long..it was like lord of the rings i thought it would end like 10 times..Don't be fooled by the previews, every action scene was shown in the previews making it looks like a action packed film.

Good shootout scene at the very end but by that time all your popcorn is gone, your butts numb and you're wondering if they're re-running the original on TV any time soon.

Some really excessive violence in several scenes.. usually you just see a guy get shot, but here you see lots of blood spray on to walls, and chunks of people after getting run over by cars. However in the midst of all the gore, they tried to intermingle a few romance plots into the middle.. a few too many.. and to top off this (sarcasm) excellent film (/sarcasm) they hired the handy-cam operator off the set of Blair Witch.

If you went expecting over the top, say like some people would think ""BAD BOYS"" does 1980's Vice you will fail to enjoy this film. This film makes Hollywood action films look like cartoons compared to this its dark and gritty realism - at some points I felt I was watching an uncensored episode of COPS gone bad-ass... Being Haitian the few little touches with the untranslated Haitian Creole added to this film for me.I think even after all the hype this movie will still go as the most underrated Mann movie, too bad I think Farrell/Foxx worked well, Vice 2 would have been nice.",Miami Vice
699,angelo20995207,** You Get More Actions Watching COPS on FOX TV **,1,28 July 2006,"This movie was awfully slow and boring. Like i said before, you're better off watching COPS on Fox TV Network. The action you saw on the trailer is pretty much the only action you'll see on this movie which occurred at the last 8 minutes at the end of the film. This movie was just terrible. I should have known how bad it was going to be since Jamie Fox and Colin Farrel were paired into this movie. These two actors never had any type of chemistry at all throughout the whole movie. Jamie Fox was funny from his old TV sitcom days. After that, his music and his movies pretty much sucked. And then there's Colin Farrel who i think was never a good actor to begin with. I believe these two guys just accepts whatever movie is offered to them just to get paid regardless if the movie is gonna be a blockbuster hit or not. This movie is nothing like the real Miami Vice from back in the days. Watching this film is more like watching a soap opera like Days of Our Lives or As The World Turns. As a matter of fact, you'll probably get more action watching a soap opera. There was nothing memorable about this movie at all. At the end of the film, everyone was just silent. No clapping. No happy faces. Everyone was just exhausted from having to sit throughout the whole time feeling like they have been punished. That's how bad this movie was. If you don't believe me and you end up watching it, don't say you were never warned. People who will say that this movie was good are only trying to fool themselves so they won't feel bad about wasting their time and money.",Miami Vice

Despite the fact that I'm a big fan of the original TV series, this movie couldn't stand on its own even if the TV series never existed. There was no chemistry between Farrell and Foxx; no character development at all of any character in the movie; and the love story was preposterous...I give up on Colin Farrell. I had such high hopes for him after Tigerland. But SWAT was awful, as was last year's The New World, and now this!!! I felt like I was watching a spy movie like Bourne Identity or James Bond. I was hoping for a great plot line with flowing action and street gangs and scenes of Miami. It's amazing that a show like The Shield (in L.A.) can feel like a movie in every episode, yet all the time, energy and money spent on this Miami Vice movie was all for naught. And I am a huge Michael Mann fan. I thought Heat and The Insider were both incredible!",Miami Vice
701,Tanya6,Just saw the film,7,28 July 2006,"Not the original. More dark but, considering what the cast went through to film it. i.e. hurricane, not so great filming conditions, injuries, etc. I think the filming turned out okay. Script, well yes, there could have been some more dialogue but, then the flow wouldn't have worked out as well. Seemed to work but, I'll have to see it again as the first time always goes by without much notice of everything else. Kudos to Colin and Jamie. They had big shoes to fill. Loved the boats, cool cigarillos and would have been a wild ride. Colin had Sonny down but, yeah, I still see the 'ole Sonny. Jamie played Tubbs, yes but, added more of his neat own tidy character and not the suaveness, everything just perfect Tubbs of old. Good, depending on what you are looking for. Not for those who want a full story, more action. I liked it and well I think Colin is learning to stretch a bit more in his roles and not just all action. Definitely, a more mature different action type of film.",Miami Vice
702,undnet96,Give Miami Vice a shot - it has something for everyone,9,28 July 2006,"All in all, this was a good movie. I was skeptical because I watched the opening credits of Miami Vice in 1984 and will always remember the thrill. As this movie stands, it is not the Miami Vice of 1984... and that's okay. Times have changed as have the players. This film incorporates many of the popular plot arcs of the original with the gritty details that would not be shown on TV. Additionally, the cinematography and music complete the package.As a fan of the original I was pleased to see that Mann clarified his vision of the show by giving us the picture of what happens when undercover becomes real. My husband did not watch the original and he was still able to appreciate this as a stand alone action film about a group of undercover cops trying to infiltrate a cartel and attempting to do the right thing but also having to deal with problems from the supposed good guys. My suggestion is to go see the movie with an open mind. You will not be disappointed. If anything, it's a great action movie. For the die-hard Vice fans... you will ultimately find something that you will like. It may not be Don Johnson or Philip Michael Thomas, but it respects the original fans and really tries to give us the feel of Miami and of the series we fell in love with.Remember that Miami Vice was known for the music used in the series, the cinematography, the scenery, and being cutting edge. This movie payed homage to that by portraying elements from the series. The locations used to shoot the film are incredible, the camera work is excellent and the soundtrack is good. I won't say great because ""In the Air Tonight"" is not used to its full potential. However, the opening bars of ""Crockett's Theme"" seems to be the inspiration for a portion of the score which is a great way to help fans reconnect. Audioslave has two songs in the movie and Chris Cornell's voice supplements the score in a scene. I really enjoyed the music in the film... it has a little of everything.I hope people give this movie a chance because it has a lot to offer new and ""mature"" fans alike.",Miami Vice
703,DCombs1988,It was an overall great movie!,10,28 July 2006,I thought this movie was great even thought it didn't really go with the TV series. It was explosive and action packed and exciting. What more can you ask for out of a action movie! Colin Farrell portrays Sonny actually pretty well with his toughness and love for the asians! Jamie Foxx displays Ricardo Tubbs good in the point of he is more smooth and doesn't talk as much but gets things done just as Sonny does! I do not recommend this movie for the youngsters however! It contains some language that is not suitable for the younger crowd. This movie definitely earns its R rating and pushes it to the limit in some scenes. Again I think this is a movie that anyone that likes action movies needs to see and it is well worth the money! Michael Mann I think has got himself another movie that people will be talking about for another couple of years. Thank You for reading this comment!,Miami Vice

Speaking of missing. ...why didn't we see opening credits in the format of the TV show open. ...what a missed opportunity. Farrell is no Crockett and Foxx is no Tubbs. ...the story is nothing new. ...this script has been done a thousand times over. ...boring! This should've been a made for TV movie, and I think it's unfortunate none of the original cast made an appearance in the film.

706,gnychis,worst movie I've ever seen,1,28 July 2006,"I signed up for an IMDb account, after using IMDb for over a year now anonymously, just to comment and rate this movie. I literally walked out of the theater an hour into the movie. This is the only movie I have ever walked out of. The sex scenes were un-necessary, in fact, I'd say only 5 minutes of the first hour I saw contributed to the story. It was not worth my money, nor will I ever watch it again. It was extremely hard to follow, the acting was horrid, and the camera liked to move around as if it were a ""reality"" movie and we were watching live footage, which made me noscious. Sadly enough, the movie sold out. I heard at least 10+ laughing AT the movie throughout it, not with the movie, AT the movie.",Miami Vice
707,audreymc,One of the worst movies I have EVER seen,1,29 July 2006,"This was one of the worst movies I have EVER wasted my time on! Slow, long and disgustingly violent. Cheesy music, cheesier love scenes and the actors did nothing to save this movie. Colin Farrell is a slimy, unlikeable middle aged loner, and Jamie Foxx's weak character is 'Sonny's' yes-man sidekick. The film gets off to a slow, but promising start. Sonny and Tubbs travel the world uncovering a network of drug smugglers, but it's all down hill once they return to the US. The rest of the movie consists of endless chase scenes peppered with unnecessarily explicit violence, forgetful dialogue...and did I mention the music? The ONLY redeeming quality of this movie is the beautiful Li Gong, who manages to keep her character intriguing in the midst of this horrible creation. Life is short, don't waste your time on this movie!",Miami Vice
708,ElCalculo,I wanted to count the ceiling tiles in the theater,1,29 July 2006,"It was one of the worst movies I've been subjected to. I registered this account just so I could maybe help save some people from a fate worse than death. After I saw it, it felt like a starved rat was gnawing at my soul. No character setup. No resemblance to any TV show of the same name. Few action scenes. Just a bunch of crappy dialog. This movie gave me the desire to fight the theater manager for a refund. I needed someone to hug me after I saw it. I'm truly not exaggerating with any of these claims.(I wish I could put size 2,097,152 font here, or had the resources to print it on the moon with a laser:) AVOID THE Miami VICE MOVIE!",Miami Vice
709,elbert87,Some redeeming qualities,3,29 July 2006,"This movie serves as an excellent time to catch up on your sleep, or provide one of those memorable nights with friends where it sucks living through but is great fun recalling how horrible the night was 10 years later.This movie is a just a compilation of all the cool protagonists Mann has thought up that have yet to make it into his previous works. Honestly, how can every character in the movie be a smart talking, tough guy attitude having, genius criminal mind possessing or interpreting badass? Seriously, every, EVERYbody is a cool mother freaking badass. No comic relief, no foil, only badasses.Now that you know everything there is to know about the characters, I'd sincerely suggest buying tickets for another movie and hope you can sneak in for the last 30 minutes of Vice. It's got a great ending like all Mann movies seem to have, and you will have missed no characterization or plot/suspense build up you'd expect from a decent story.",Miami Vice
710,gallagherlaw,A Great Film - Miami Vice Delivers,10,29 July 2006,"Miami Vice is a great film. Top notch writing, directing, and acting. While it does not have nearly the music video, fashion and stylistic feel of the popular '80s television series -- still, it has just enough style to make the reference. Instead of aping the television series, which could never be duplicated in today's world anyway, the film speaks to the intelligent, modern audience.Less is More.The film does not spoon feed the viewer the story line or the character development. Instead, the film respects the viewer's intelligence, and assumes you are smart enough to figure out what is going on, or what will happen, without making it incredibly obvious -- as so many, many films unfortunately do. This adds tremendously to the fun of this film.The ""War on Drugs"" is a tragic waste of money and human lives.Although not overtly political, or even hinting loudly like ""Traffic,"" the film Miami Vice is appropriately dark and tragic about the characters' struggle, desires, and sometimes devastating events. The protagonist undercover police officers are engaged in a Sisyphean efforts -- to stem the tide of black-market drugs from flowing into the United States from poor countries, and huge sums of cash in the other direction. The more we look at the Prohibitionist approach to solving the problem of drug abuse, the more obvious it becomes that law enforcement only increases the price, the profit; and that this black market money increases the distribution networks, the corruption of government officials, and the violence needed to protect that big black-market money flow. The film never comes out and says this, nor does any character. It is, however, the inescapable conclusion from the films dramatic, but basically correct presentation of the set of problems involved in Prohibition and Smuggling law enforcement -- even in this high tech era.The Directing is crisp, fast, exciting. The story never stops. There is nothing in the movie that does not serve at least one purpose in moving the story and developing the characters and their motives.The acting is strong. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx were completely believable as cops Sonny Crocket and Ricardo Tubbs. The entire cast did an excellent job in this film. Chinese actress Gong Li was striking not only in her great beauty, but also in the wide range she showed in developing her character Isabella -- a Cuban Chinese associate of the heartless head of the cocaine producer in the film. Gong Li showed two quite different characters -- one as a ""business woman"" in public; the other in a private relationship with another character. I want to see more of Gong Li! A Warning -- Graphic Violence means don't bring the kids. The violence is brief and furthers the story and the drama, but is graphic. An excellent film - don't miss it! I loved even more the second time!",Miami Vice
711,rnw077,Not too bad one of the better movies this summer,8,29 July 2006,"Plot OK. Characters not well-developed, but I think a major part of that was the point. We already know who they are as it seems to play right of the show to some degree. Foxx fantastic as usual and after a little getting use to Ferrel grew on me. I love Mann's use of music in his films, and I think he does a marvelous job here. His camera angles at times can be dizzying as it seems he is just walking with the camera bobbing up and down. Overall based on this years movies I gave it a 7. A should see film, with lots of guilty pleasures abound. This film is definitely catering to the adult audience. I walked away from the movie feeling good and thats all I can ask.",Miami Vice
712,chancesmp1008,horrible!!!,1,29 July 2006,"When I went to see this movie I thought I was in for an action movie. It was more like a low grade wanna be porn movie. Although I do like senseless explosions and violence in my movie's, there was almost none! And to make matters even worse the plot line was stupid! I overheard several other audience members present along with myself make mention that they too could not understand the actors accents half the time. So let's see here, bad plot, couldn't understand the dialouge, stupid time wasting sex scenes we didn't want to see, one explosion and the minimum gun play allowed to be classified for an action movie! yep this definitely qualifies for possibly the worst movie i have ever seen! I really wished we didn't waste our money on this flick. It was so bad the person I went with fell asleep! Do not waste your time with this movie!",Miami Vice
713,dom-167,Lacking film that will lack in the box office as well,1,29 July 2006,"This movie puts you right in the middle of the action. Too bad there is so little action that you will be bored almost the entire movie. This movie lacked action in a big way. There is one big action scene that was worthy of praise, other than that there is only one other gun shot in the whole movie. If you're an action junkie, this film is not for you. The characters in this movie failed big when it came to drawing in the audience. I left the movie wondering ""Why was this movie made""? I stood and payed attention to the conversations after the movie was over and didn't hear any of the usual ""Man did you see that"" or ""I couldn't believe that happened."" The story line was sub-par and absolutely did not live up to the hype. The big name actors could have been Jay and Silent Bob and it wouldn't have made a difference (hyperbole). If at all possible I would like to get my $6.50 back. If V is for Vendetta, then F is for Miami Vice",Miami Vice
714,lexusc300,Good action movie.,9,29 July 2006,"I had never seen the TV show in the 80's because I'm to young. I cant make any comparisons between the two but how can people make comparisons between the TV show and this movie that are twenty years apart? One complaint that some people have is that the movie does not flow well and they cant hear the movie dialog. I'm by no means a movie critic but the scenes interacted well with each other. The director did a good complex movie but not to complex for all audiences to follow along. The story was intoxicating. A lot of the scenes in the movie were just pure genius, a lot of the scenes made me feel as if I were part of the scene myself and I cant remember a movie in recent memory that has made me feel like that. The sex scenes were not to hard core but its not as if you can have a porn that is rated R. The music in the movie just flows throughout the movie. I've seen the movie twice and the second time I took more appreciation in the story. In conclusion I would have to highly recommend this film to anyone that enjoys a good plot, action, sex, cars and the aspects of the drug world.",Miami Vice
715,firestar4545,Don't waste your money!,1,29 July 2006,"This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have seen. It does total injustice to the original Miami Vice TV show and all that went along with it. It is too slow paced, too predictable. The transition from one scene to the next is choppy and doesn't blend well. Each new scene you can tell almost from the beginning where it is going to go. With the exception of a couple of blood and guts scenes it verges on being a ""chickflick"". Collin Farrell looks like a hurt puppy dog about to break out into a whimpering mass at any time through most of the movie. Jamie Foxx is just boring in his portrayal of Rico Tubbs. If you really want to see the movie, wait until it comes out on DVD, rent it and watch it at home. That way if you feel like walking out you won't have far to go.",Miami Vice
716,theatre-8,"Boring, boring, boring",3,29 July 2006,"We saw this film on opening night. The audience was jam-packed. The travelogue-esquire shots of Florida are fine. But we didn't come to see a travelogue. We came to see action-adventure. We aren't hard to please, and didn't really care if the film stayed ""true"" to the original series or not. But what we were not expecting was an interminably boring, cliché, banal plot (if it an even be called that), one that has been explored much more excitingly in every cop TV show in history, plus about a gazillion action movies as well. I kept falling asleep. I'd wake up and ask my husband, ""What did I miss?"" And he'd sigh and say, ""Nothing."" About two-thirds of the way through the film, the sound went out. The audience started grumbling. Soon comments could be heard like, ""Do you want to wait and see if they fix it?"" ""Nah, it's not worth it."" ...and... ""Do you like this film?"" ""Heck, no. Let's leave and get our money back."" We decided that if there still was no plot, no action, no excitement after one hour and forty five minutes, we might as well join the exodus. When all was said and done, only about thirty people were scattered about the theatre. But we were lucky - we get to see another movie for free!!",Miami Vice
717,jimrich3,Miami Vice is a superb crime drama. This will become Mann's masterpiece.,10,29 July 2006,"Miami Vice was the perfect showcase of Mann's outstanding talents. The plot moves well, the characters are interesting, the story is superb (true to the original Miami Vice plot lines), and the cinematography is outstanding. For fans of the original series (I am was huge fan), expect to see a movie that has taken cues from a classic hit and improved them. For those youngsters who are new to Mann's famous cop drama, prepare to be introduced to the seedy underworld of Miami crime (or at least Michael Mann's interpretation of it) and taken on a wild, violent, intriguing, entertaining ride. Before viewing Miami Vice, Heat was probably my all time favorite movie. After tonight, I have a new #1 but it's still a Michael Mann movie.",Miami Vice
718,millernp,I want a refund,1,30 July 2006,"The previews made this look like an action-packed, exciting movie. In reality, every scene you saw in the trailers came from the first five minutes of action, or the last five minute gun fight. The middle two hours were pure torture. The plot line didn't make sense, the conversations were impossible to follow, and nothing happened. This movie was not riveting, it was boring beyond belief. If I had driven myself to the theater, I would have walked out of this movie it was so bad. Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Mann's work. Heat and Collateral were both excellent movies. But those movies had stories that made sense and didn't drag in the middle. If you compressed Miami Vice into a twenty minute short, it could have been decent. As it is, it was just painful. Please save yourself the money and pain and don't see this movie.",Miami Vice
719,triddell-1,Unbelievable!!!!,10,30 July 2006,"This is a movie you must see in the theater. Wow! Incredible sound, visuals, action sequences, and music! A movie that stays with you long after you leave. Definitely Michael Mann's best picture (yes, even better than Heat and Collateral). Re-creating the 80's ""Miami Vice""must have been tough. So many attempts have failed. He could have gone the silly route taking on silly clichés, giving lengthy explanations of plot lines, etc. Instead Michael Mann keeps it real.We get an honest look at the ultra-dark and gritty underworld of America's drug war. Some people have mentioned the pace. I think it is perfect. Nobody knows how to approach a shot like Mann. Think back to ""Heat"" and ""Collateral"". Well, this is even better. He takes us into the underground world of Miami's drug cartels, in nightclubs, back alleys, kick-ass cars and boats, etc.. Beautiful colors, especially the evening sequences. Nice music, with Audioslave, various techno beats, JayZ/Linkin Park, and such. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx play their parts to near perfection - taking their own approach to Crocket and Tubbs. Other actors are great too. Sex scenes are realistic. As is the dialog. Yep. Michael Mann has great respect for the classic 80's show he produced. Will see it again for sure! 10/10",Miami Vice
720,greg-1054,Great Movie and an excellent continuation,9,30 July 2006,"Although too slow at some points (thus not having a 10), the movie is an excellent continuation of the Miami Vice story started back in 1984. Like the shows in the past, the movie had its ups and downs, slow and fast action spots and its thickened plot line. I hope to see more sequels to this or perhaps a newer TV show of Miami Vice. All in all I was thoroughly impressed with Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrels portrayal of my favorite 80s undercover detectives. They obviously worked very hard and very long to perfect their imitations. Miami Vice is an excellent, and romantic look, into the ups and downs of the illegal drug trafficking trade. I definitely recommend watching this movie!",Miami Vice

This was even more disappointing for me, being one of the biggest Miami Vice fans out there. I thought it was perfect; one of the best crime T.V. shows ever made into a movie, how could it go wrong? Well, one way was making it modern times. The second i saw the Range Rover I shook my head in disbelief. Also, they never even touched on how Tubbs and Crocket met. Then I thought, wait, maybe in the eyes of someone who never saw the show, it may have been good. That was wrong.

Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell could not call it acting-More like get me to rehab on time Tubbs!!!! Jamie how could you allow that movie to go to print like that?

Firstly, i saw the trailer of this movie and thought of it as a real action movie, which the trailer seemed to promise, but as the movie went on... mind-less sexuality bored me to death and my group. it seemed that only the last scene and the the one where Farrell blows up the two boats (all of it)was added to the trailer to make it LOOK LIKE worth while but as the movie went on it seemed a lot boring than a usual action movie. Secondly, this is NOT an original idea C'mon why are we waking up the dead again!. I know one thing that the new age for sure want to see what is NEW, not something more than 20 years old.The only positive thing that this movie had was its locations and Scenes, but lets face it technology is advancing by the minutes, and for sure in the future we'll have tons of that stuff.One more thing: one of my group member slept in the theatre until the last section.",Miami Vice
724,sarah_black84,Terrible,1,31 July 2006,"I thought that this movie was terrible. The plot was very hard to follow, there were way to many sex scenes (3 sex scenes in an approx. 10 min. time span) and the movie just didn't make sense. The movie starts off with Jamie and Collin being in a club and getting a phone call from someone saying that a drug bust is about to go bad. The drug bust ended with the undercover cops being killed so Collin and Jamie go in as undercover cops to bust the ring leader of the drug lords. That was the only part of the movie that made sense. After that it just got weird. People were being held hostage (the people holding them hostage had no reason to lash out, it was just a random act of violence) and the ending left it completely open for a sequel. The only thing they could've done to make the movie's ending more abrupt would've been to end it mid sentence, wait, it did end on a gasp between sentences.",Miami Vice
725,zedman2,Must See!!!,7,27 August 2006,"A die-hard Michael Mann fan, I deeply respect all of his prior work and hold ""Thief"" and ""Heat"" in the highest regard. I essentially went into the theatre to watch Miami Vice expecting a reaction similar to when I viewed ""Ali"" and ""Collateral"" on the big screen. I expected to see the big Mann pull off what I didn't think anyone else could pull off... restructuring the perception of a specific actor and producing an engaging and resonating plot in an otherwise sceptical script idea. In ""Ali"" I didn't believe Will Smith was the right choice but he worked and Jamie Foxx as Bundini was amazing. In hindsight I understood why he focused solely on the height of Ali's career. When ""Collateral"" was announced, I had severe doubts as to the believability of the plot, the choice of Tom Cruise as a villain and the decision to shoot on High Definition video. I've watched those two movies several times over and love them both.The ultimate hard-men feature in this film and the action scenes are nothing short of spectacular. They are intense and electrifying as both Colin Farrel (probably the only man in recent times to pull off a handle-bar moustache) and Jamie Foxx use their full acting talents in this ferocious thriller.During the film I could barely contain my excitement as Farrel and Foxx blast around in Ferrari's, fast-boats and much more.The acting is flawless, the directing superb and the camera-work has exactly the same effect as Collateral, but with added sting.Undoubtedly the best film you will see this year. At least.",Miami Vice
726,skbuyers,Don't listen to the negative reviews see this movie,8,31 July 2006,"First of all let me start by saying...This is not the TV Series Miami Vice so don't let reviewers who compare this movie to the TV show deter you from watching it. If you loved Miami Vice the TV Show then you will still like this movie. It has all the content the TV show did the Boats,cars,guns,drugs and stunning women BUT this is a serious movie about Miami Vice it goes deep into what it is like to be in undercover operations. Of course your going to foresee the story they go after drug dealers and so on but give me a break thats Miami Vice. This movies use of camera angles and music are just as moving as Heat and Manhunter. Michael Manns touch is all over this movie and I expected nothing less. I have read a lot of negative reviews about the movie and was upset to see people could not get it out of their head Don Johnson was not in it. See the reason why Colin is Crockett and Jamie is Tubbs is because they are planning two more Miami Vice Movies. They need lasting actors for this Don Johnson was outstanding but this is not the TV SHOW GO SEE THIS MOVIE IT'S WORTH IT!!",Miami Vice
727,vildan-1,Slow love story with a strong ending,6,31 July 2006,"I thought the movie was slow in the beginning and viewers don't always know what is going on during the movie. The movie just jumps right in and keeps going with no introductions or getting to know the characters and who they are. Then it takes off on this love story between Colin Farrell and another woman. The Action sequences are great but there are far too few of them. Some of the shots in this movie are taken with hand held cameras and will make viewers dizzy at times. I think my problem was going in to the movie and trying to compare it to ""Bad Boys 2"" which was an outstanding action/comedy and not a lot of movies can live up to that hype. All in all it was a ""good/decent"" movie that I would wait to see at the cheap theaters.",Miami Vice
728,oshun-2,Good Try,7,31 July 2006,"I think this movie is getting a bad rap. I am one of the biggest fans of the series and after reading all the awful reviews I thought twice about going to see it but it opened on my birthday and decided ""what the hell"". I enjoyed it. It was funny, full of action and I don't think Farrell or Foxx did such a bad job. They played the characters but brought their own individuality into the acting. I left the theater glad that I didn't see caricatures of Sonny and Rico, that would have made me mad. The chemistry between Sonny and Isabella left something to be desired even though I did enjoy all the steamy scenes. Could it have been better? Of course but I think Mann didn't do such a bad job of bringing Crockett and Tubbs in the new millennium.",Miami Vice
729,ehsfootball_75,Miami Vice is a 2 hour television drama,3,1 August 2006,"I went to see Miami Vice this past weekend and to be honest it was quite possibly the longest two and a half hours of my life. This movie should have been either straight to DVD or a made for TV special. The only good thing in this movie was all of the holes people's head. The only differences between the movie and the show are the sex scenes and the use of socks. You cannot take a sub-par television show and make it into a great or even good movie. Jamie Foxx was amazing in this movie just like every other movie he is in, but Colin Ferrell seemed to be trying too hard. I recommend that people do not waste their money and just wait until it comes out on the movie channels.",Miami Vice
730,naterizzle,"Miami Vice: Adrenaline Rush on Land, Sea, and Air",9,1 August 2006,"This movie was awesome. It is shot almost like a documentary. The action is right in the camera's lens, and the (camera) shooters are always on the move. Although, this makes some of the more intense scenes have some rather unstable shots, I think it actually adds to the film by making it even more gritty and real. Overall, it is a really great movie that everybody who is into action movies must see.And then there are the toys.... Ferraris, Bentleys, BMW 6 series, Dodge Charger on TIS 22s, and that's just the beginning.Also, for whoever was wondering about the fuel range on those boats, yeah, they can make it to Cuba. The big, bad ones have fuel tanks that can be around 200 gallons, so even if they are driving pretty hard and not just cruising, 250 miles is in range. (Remember that boats are measured in gallons per hour, and these beasts probably chug through it at a good 40 g/h when they are moving.... For example, that gives them 5 hours at 50 mph to go 250 miles. P.S. those are all pretty rough estimates. And they were probably doing 70 or 80 in the movie.)",Miami Vice
731,senderosdiaby23,"Colin Farrell, who gets a little clumsy when he has to do speeches with his American accent, gives Mann exactly what was needed when we feel the moment in his eyes or gestures",10,1 August 2006,"second big variation is the storytelling which, unlike MVTV, or really any television series, doesn't spend much time telling us where the ride is going. Basil Exposition is on permanent vacation no need for Sir Ian here. Mann's characters - he wrote the script also - are people of actions, not verbosity. They live what they are feeling, thinking and doing on the screen. This may be a little jarring in the first 15 minutes, as you try to catch up with exactly what's going on. But you will catch up. And, by the third act in particular, the pay off will be that you feel like you are in the experience and not watching the experience. Mann has dealt with sex before in his work. Most of his movies have an interesting sexual undercurrent. But here he lets his character get down to business. As a result, we get to learn a lot more about Jamie Foxx than I ever expected to in his scenes with Naomie Harris. (Seeing Mr. Farrell and Ms. Gong exposed is not such a surprise.) But in the Foxx scenes, we also get one of the most beautifully shot acts of intimacy to be shown on screen in a long time. Mann, as is so often the case, gets to the heart of getting busy without needing to reach for the more graphic imagery. On the other hand, give the guy a gun, and he'll blow some holes in people. My greatest surprise pleasure in this film was Mann's casting choices and the execution (figurative and often literal) of his actors. It's always fun to see Barry Shabaka Henley in Mann's projects. But here Mann came up with a whole new group of players. The brilliant Ciarin Hinds is here, subverting his Irish accent for a somewhat southern one. In fact, Mann has a bunch of English and Irish actors (Tony Curran, Eddie Marsan) playing Miamians. He also has Me, You & Everyone We Know's and Deadwood's John Hawkes on board. And even Domenick Lombardozzi, who is suddenly familiar after a multi-show guest stint on Entourage. Elizabeth Rodriguez is a terrific surprise as the Gina Calabrese character, neither brunette nor hips-Dalian. She doesn't get a load of lines, but she can handle a gun and when she gets a line, she can handle that too. But the biggest joys were, first, Gong Li, in what is easily her best, most raw performance yet in English. Mann didn't just want a beautiful woman, but he wanted a performance that stripped her to her freckles. And he gets it. It starts a little chilly and accent distracting. But as the movie progresses, this turns into a really lovely and intimate piece of work from this actress. Even more surprising were Luis Tosar and John Ortiz as the baddest bad guys in the piece. Tosar is known more in Spain and Ortiz hasn't really gotten The Break before, but Mann's choices with both of them were to take characters that could have been over the top and ratcheted them down to dry, smart, scary performances. Tosar plays the Kingpin, Jesus Montoya, who doesn't move much, has a fifth level of hell beard and facial hair (the most powerful on-screen eyebrows since Belushi) and an absolutely terrifying calm. And Ortiz, who plays the Local Guy who runs operations for Montoya in Miami, has the showier role and works it with real glee, but never becomes an evil movie caricature. It really is a brilliant performance. Early on I was thinking, ""I guess Bardem (who loved working with Mann in a tiny Collateral role) was busy."" But by the end of the picture, I was glad that one of the world's greatest actors wasn't there because these guys were so brilliant and so unexpected. Telling you too much about the storyline is not only a spoiler, but an irritant. You kinda know already. They go deep, deep, deep undercover in the most dangerous possible situation. Romance, guns, drugs, boats, planes, and trouble ensue. In the meanwhile, Mann & Beebe get some exterior images that literally took my breath away. The digital look of the film becomes familiar within 20 minutes or so and offers imagery of the streets of Miami, South America, and Havana in colors that speak to the real beauty of those places, not the movie dream of them. You know you are the hands of masters. The first acts drags a little, though I suspect on second viewing it will go down more easily. And then there is the great feeling I had walking away from the screening room. This movie will play and play and play and play. No, it's not quite Heat. I do look forward to Mann working in this digital format with stars as iconic as Pacino and DeNiro. Foxx is solid as a rock here. And Colin Farrell, who gets a little clumsy when he has to do speeches with his American accent, gives Mann exactly what was needed when we feel the moment in his eyes or gestures. For me, this a big step from Collateral, which was a gimmick movie a good gimmick, some good actors, a great visual styling (the digital production is not the gimmick I mean), but ultimately it is a clock film with a forced relationship that has to stick to that clock and a massive movie star playing an ice cold killer. Miami Vice is more free to roam. And because of it, the box office might not be as strong. On the other hand, it might be stronger, because this, to me, is a much more interesting, challenging, better movie. I kind of expect it to split critics and audiences. But I also expect it to age really well over time. And that is the price that Michael Mann so often pays for being Michael Mann. Thank goodness he is willing to do it for all of us.",Miami Vice
732,paulsugs,Response to negative critics,7,2 August 2006,"Having just seen Miami Vice, I have to confess I'm confused by some of the reviews I've seen scattered over the internet. I can easily ignore those reviews from fans of the old TV show, who were hoping that Miami Vice, like other remakes, would just deliver up something familiar and comfortable, but some of the others I feel like dealing with. I'm wondering if my liking the film had anything to do with where I sat in the theatre in which I watched it. I sat right in the middle, close to a screen that was somewhat above me. Almost from the outset the film enveloped me, but at the same time it did not drown me in the chaotic twists and turns of a summer blockbuster. I found myself alternately picking out and being impressed by different aspects of the film, beginning with the cinematography. I realised only part way through that the film had been shot in high definition video, and only afterward that it was a form of video and a camera patented by the director himself. I've seen other films shot in video, and if this is an indication of the advancement of the technology then we can expect great things in the future. From where I was sitting I was constantly being forced to examine different parts of the screen, so that my head was moving almost as much as in an imax theatre. Many shots had the principle action shifting, or cutting in and out of different areas of the screen. The colour was beautiful, and the locations perfectly chosen. Even the ornamental cars and boats, though fantastic in their extravagance, were introduced with more realism than I've seen in many a recent film. This perhaps had something to do with the film being shot in video.Equally impressive were the love scenes (and they were genuine love scenes as well as often being sex scenes, somewhat contrary to what has been reported by those connecting this aspect of the film with its rating). I think, mainly by the device of the tightness of the script and the ability of the actors, the characters were developed fully enough for me to care for them quite early on. Gong Li's performance and her relationship with Colin Farrell's character were particularly poignant. In fact, the meaning and depth of feeling contained in all of the central relationships in the film were successfully conveyed despite the minimal dialogue, and without the usual device of adding sentimental arguments in favour of the characters.As for the action and violence, I can only say that it was coolly done, edited superbly and integrated well enough into the other parts of the narrative. We could always see the action coming, but as with other elements of the film, the drama is delivered via wonderful choreography and in a range of peculiar perspectives that feel quite unfamiliar to the genre. In this the film reveals a part of its nature, which is not to provide a roller coaster ride of suspense, with the customary and increasingly deceptive but pointless plot twists, but to focus our attention on the aspects of a film which are normally laid waste by such techniques. For example, the relationships between the characters that care for each other are handled with a lightness of touch rarely seen in overtly action movies.I recently watched collateral, and the only reason I could see why so many people would prefer that film so heavily over Miami Vice, would be in the character played by Jamie Foxx in the former. He's so much more upright and innocent than anyone in Miami Vice, and his role in ending the film satisfies our habitualised preference for the underdog hero coming good against all the odds. In Miami Vice it's clear from the start that Crocket and Tubbs are good at what they do, and although we know they must prevail, they also look and sound like they might. However, those who like neat resolutions, especially when they're entirely in favour of the good guys, will be disappointed by the way that the film cuts in and out of its telling, leaving loose threads dangling. If it were a detective story or typical suspense thriller then we would have to feel short-changed, but the film is more complex than that. There's no one big thing to hook us, but so many of its parts are beautifully and subtly created, and so available to us as we watch, that we have time to enjoy this film, and I did.",Miami Vice

A lot of plot holes combined with a crappy script that made u laugh when it was clearly intending to make you feel the ""drama"" this movie clearly didn't provide. By the last thirty minutes all i wanted to do was get up and leave, i could have cared less if jamie foxx's girl died or if the ending had 5 minutes of colin farrell and his chick looking back at each other with tears in their eyes.

Jamie Foxx is not much better. Li Gong, seriously. No. Don't make movies like this. They suck a lot and are definitely not worth it.Did you know that the character's names were Sonny and Rico? No? Either did ANYONE IN THE DAMN THEATRE. Unless you knew Miami Vice from the past, you could have thought neither of them actually had names. Or personalities for that matter.The best part of the movie? There wasn't one. There wasn't even a part that didn't suck. If cinema was a supermarket, this film would be the crazy old man outside busking for change who smells like an awful combo of poop and aftershave.

737,tiernanbambam,Disappointing,4,3 August 2006,"I have always felt that director Michael Mann never gets enough credit, always being brushed off as the 'action scene' director. Whilst 'Heat' and 'Collateral' have exceptionally well constructed and engaging action sequences, the films themselves reach satisfying emotional and atmospheric depths. Take Robert De'Niro's troubled and lonely soul in Heat or the brief glimmers of sorrow in Cruise's character in Collateral. Miami Vice looks like a Mann film. It is beautifully filmed, slick and eye catching, yet the action scenes demonstrate that if the audience does not engage emotionally with the characters we couldn't care less if a drug baron managed to blow the heads off Foxx and Farrel. They are so wrapped up in looking cool and disinterested that their monotone expressions never give a sense of urgency or concern to plot developments and so one scene leads to another and your concentration on the mess that is the story fades. Not a single character was interesting, not a single scene truly engaging (save some beautiful shots of the sky and cities). It is a letdown of a film and a shame for such a talented and meticulous director as Mann.",Miami Vice

My mates and I walked out at 3:30. There was a complete lack of storyline or plot to the film, leading to us looking at each other and saying, 'What the hell is going on?' We never found out, and I don't care. It's a shame for Jamie Foxx, an actor with talent and a potential to be a great actor. But he really picked a dead duck with this one.

This ""movie"" has inspired me to register with IMDb just so I can bash it to the public and let some frustration out. I felt dumber after watching this film...no movie has had a worse cast, worse chemistry between actors, worse acting for a major motion picture, and a worse script. What Michael Mann has created is actually his first comedy. Silent films have better scripts than this movie. I know the people who were paid to give this movie good reviews thought the same - because it is not my opinion that this is the worst movie ever - it is a FACT! Human beings are not THAT dumb. Are we supposed to believe that this was quality? This movie made me laugh so hard at so many points where the audience was not meant to laugh that I cried, but it is listed as an action film. I literally turned to my friends and they all had tears in their eyes too. There were points where I felt Michael Mann was just mocking me. Mann jumped from scene to scene out of nowhere, introduced terrible characters consistently throughout the film, and ladies and gentleman, this action movie had 2 action scenes - in the first 10 minutes, and then 2 hours later in the last 10 minutes. It was boring, led nowhere, poorly acted, and there might as well not have been a script at all. This was the recipe for the worst movie of all time and of the future generations of films. 0/10",Miami Vice

What happened to the big drug lord, Montoya it never showed him being killed or arrested...I wonder if the making of Miami Vice 2 is in the works. I gave the movie an 8 because of the fast women, cars, boats and planes but there is room for improvement and its nowhere close to Michael Mann's best movie.

Some scenes were very predictable: I recognized ""victims"" within minutes of their first screen appearances; I knew which characters would end up in ""tight"" spots; ""don't go in that room, you idiot"" moments; and more. However, I'm still recommending the film because Mann uses strong female characters and it's a well paced affair with a great soundtrack. Sound is always a considerable factor in the enjoyment of Mann's work.This is probably the first film I've ever paid to see that is based on a TV show -- another tribute to Michael Mann. Of course, except for the names of the characters and the location, it didn't really resemble the Miami Vice TV version. Gawd, what a horrible TV experience. Excellent bad guys.

The start of the film was abit muddled and hard to follow but the acting performances of the two main characters Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx made up for any inadequate explanations of the plot at the beginning. Even the small roles, eg people on the swat team and the Commander were excellently written and added to the crispness of the plot and helped me to really believe it was happening.This film goes into my 'will see again in the cinema' category. One to watch out for is the performance of the leading lady on the side of the baddies. I think she will be in a lot more films, including the inevitable sequel of this film. All in all I thought it was a well written, excellently directed film with the use of some real life filming, the type you would some in 24 which made me dizzy at times but was appropriately used.My only criticism would be I needed more information on the background of the characters, in particular Colin Farrell's - Other than that go and thoroughly enjoy this all action thriller.",Miami Vice

With that said let me state the bad and believe me when I say bad...from the second the movie starts the main characters Sonny and Ricardo of which you absolutely know nothing about are put into this plot that is difficult to follow because the scenes jump around so much that it makes you lose interest faster than it took to get into the movie. There is a love affair that I thought was pointless which in turn almost made me go to sleep. Two of my buddies came along and they left before the first hour even ended. I tried so hard to like this movie but my efforts became vain do to it's biggest downfall which is merely expectation. Previews do this movie too much justice. I'm sure you expect an action packed film that you won't be able to take your eyes off of which is in fact what everyone should expect from most Micheal Mann films but alas this is anything but the case here. About the first 75% of the movie is nothing more then idle chit chat which can only be described as BORING. The only excitement I got from this film was from the climactic part in which you have your usual showdown. The final verdict is that this isn't a horrible movie just mediocre at best and I would recommend to everyone to just wait because this is only a rental.

I was disappointed in how the movie started and needless to say, I did not stay until the end. In my opinion it never really gave the audience a clear picture of what was about to take place for the next 2hrs. It was a hard movie to follow. Jamie was trying so hard to be cool that you had a hard time making out what he was saying and I never could get with Collin and this fake James Bond voice he used throughout the movie. As I sat in my seat wondering when would be a good time to make my grand exit I noticed the couple in front of me where asleep and some guy on the other side of the theater was SNORING! That should tell you a lot about this movie and I hope America will read this message board BEFORE paying to see something that TOTALLY SUCKED!!!!! PS.

The movie contained very little action and mainly consisted of characters come and go from place A to B. You don't really even get to any of the characters in the movie during the whole movie and when they're not moving between places they're kissing someone. The actors didn't fit in the movie and characters really annoyed me. Some of the stuff they do or say is just so ridiculous. Nobody would ever do it like that and I don't care if its a movie, its plain annoying.Now the plot then. It took me good portion of the movie to realize what is even going on there. People just run around and movie keeps rolling. Confusing to say at least and I don't mean it in good way like in ""Lucky number Slevin"" for example. I mean the way that you just see soulless characters running around. The end part of the movie wasn't at least as horrible as the beginning, thats why 3 but overall this movie is just horrible and if you think, ""Well its Miami Vice, I knew the series, it can't be that bad"", think again because this movie is garbage.

Very predictable and boring - gun fights and big bad baddies does not make a good action movie - it was dull dull dully - very moody and dark atmosphere, matched the overall effect! Please .. some of us movie goers do have some intelligence, if you want to blob out and have mindless movie-watching, this is your movie, if you want something with substance well give this a big miss and don't waste your time .. :-(",Miami Vice
758,abrute,Awesome!!! An excellent compliment to the series!,9,12 August 2006,"Fans of the series will not be disappointed. Michael Mann shows tribute to the original creation through cinematography, while still creating a unique story. Some of the characters changed a little. They are all more serious. Also, the two girls, Gina and Trudy, have much more kick-butt attitudes.Overall, It is very intense, and constantly suspenseful. The plot is full of twists and keeps you guessing. The only thing it could have done without are the extended sex scenes. Otherwise, I think it is a great compliment to the series.A big thank you to Universal for bringing this to the big screen!",Miami Vice
759,punsies,close but no cigar,6,12 August 2006,"Well here we have another mean and moody piece by Michael Mann.Checklist complete-Moody leading men,scenes filmed on DV,lots of neon lit nightlife.So far so Mann.The rather misleading title-no actual ""Vice"" in the film apart from a brief intro at the beginning of the film-aside this had all the makings of a classic,but,,,it ain't.First off as i've said the films main thrust is not vice but drugs,lots of drugs,secondly the dialogue mix makes most it inaudible-either that or everyone was mumbling.Thirdly-spoiler alert-why have a major part of the film revolving around an informant and then not tell us who it is?With stereotypical drug dealers,Nazis and underdeveloped(ie never introduced or named)part players this is not one Manns best.Plus points includes (no surprise here)some great action scenes but overall i kind of wished for some of the TV series humour.Oh and when will directors stop trying to convince us that cops drive round in Ferarri's and top of the range bmw's.Overall--could do better.",Miami Vice
760,nicole_something,"Women in Action Films, Waterfalls & What was Michael Mann thinking?",2,7 August 2006,"It's been 20 years or so since I saw Miami Vice on TV. Although I wasn't a big fan, the things I remember that made it a fresh, different TV show were the use of color (the clothes, the sunsets), the Miami locations, the use of pop music and the musicians in the show like Phil Collins, the expensive cars and boats, the stories digging into the international drug trafficking, and the relationship between two undercover cops in that world.Now, looking at the 2006 movie, Miami Vice, I wonder why Michael Mann re-visited it. Things we think of as iconic Miami Vice, he left out. Maybe they were just things the TV bosses wanted at that time to have a stylish, marketable show and Mann didn't want them in this movie. So, gone are the color and the flavor of Miami. The cars, boats and music are there, but not featured. The plot focuses on the international drug trafficking... but fails to produce a fresh approach to the topic that has been explored for 20 years in other films and TV shows. Colin Farrell was better than I expected (my expectations weren't very high though) and a pretty good fit for Sonny. Jamie Foxx didn't have much of a role, and didn't do much with it. I expected more since his roles in Collateral & Ray.I went to see this film hoping for something similar to Mann's more recent films. A film that is fresh, stylish, and fast-paced but takes us deep into the characters, like his movie Collateral did. But Mann never delved too deeply into either main character.... What are their motivations? I really didn't care about any of the characters in the movie, and judging by a few yawns during our screening, my friends didn't feel too engaged either.There are two things I found interesting in the film. One was the beautiful waterfalls featured near a drug-lord's mansion in South America. It's Iguazu Falls, on the boarder of Argentina & Brazil, and apparently they are featured in other films  Moonraker & The Mission. Check it some pictures online - it's truly amazing. Another on my list of places I want to visitThe other thing that interested me was the character of Isabella, played by Gong Li. She is a Chinese actress who was recently in Memoirs of a Geisha as Hatsumomo (the mean Geisha in the Okiya). There aren't many women in this type of picture usually, and why a Chinese woman in South America? She was one of the few characters that Mann took the time to develop. She plays it very cool and professional, and is believable as a trusted lieutenant to a powerful man, (and their matching expensive watches hint at a personal relationship). Yet, when Sonny asks her out, she immediately jumps in a boat to Havana for a Mojito. I guess not enough excitement in the drug trade (Spoiler Alert!! Don't read further if you haven't seen the film) As the movie neared the end, I was afraid for how Mann would treat this character of Isabella. She is presented as a strong woman who has made it up to 2nd in command in a tough business & seems respected by her 'colleagues' in a macho, male-dominated culture. She is strong enough to tell her drug-lord boss/boyfriend that she got physical with Sonny, and not be apologetic. In action pictures, targeted for men, female characters usually aren't given balanced, realistic roles. Also, women are very rarely portrayed as ""bad"", powerful, and/or sexually liberated and not get killed or have some other tragic ending. (Just like in horror flicks, the slutty girls always seem to get killed first by the crazed serial killer) I was bracing myself for her to stand up in the middle of the shoot-out and start wailing about how Sonny had deceived her & how she had lost the will to live and walk into the path of a bullet. They didn't do that, but Sonny did save her from such a fate & instead of turning her in, he takes her away & arranges for her to get to Cuba. Was she so in love with Sonny that she reacted that way to his real identity?Overall, there are better films out there. Rent Collateral or Traffic. If you are a Miami Vice fan, get hold of the old series on DVD. I'd give this version a 2/10.",Miami Vice

I cant believe Jamie Foxx and Colin Ferrel would even sign up to a movie which had so much dribble that its scary. Thats 2 bad movies with Collin Ferrel in them ""Alexander"", and Jamie Foxx ....shame on you. I was hanging to see this movie and then they pull this out of there bottoms, i was expecting exceptional with its cast, filming and story. Listen to any of you directors producers etc etc, do not, i repeat do not let your movie get a place at the box office if you know its bad and your just trying to produce some bucks.

They cruise in Ferraris and BMWs(from a cop salary) and they know how to fly planes(but they fly like 007) and drive speed boats... so i didn't like this movie... This movie is taken to the extreme: FBI and Police take them to meet the drug leaders with a private jet.. and give them the possibility to do everything.. this is a little bit to outrageous.

Instead, I saw the best film I've seen in ages. It's slick like all Mann's films, all grime and testosterone and urban night. The story thrills from start to finish. Foxx and Farrell get this really convincing, die-for-each-other loyalty going, while still coming over as very different, separate people. Farrell's relationship with Li Gong is just as convincing. The entire cast is mesmerising... while Foxx and Farrell's fellow cops aren't fleshed out very much, the bad guys are brilliantly menacing, in that convincingly ordinary, stone cold way that Philip Seymour Hoffman did so well in Mission Impossible III. Great people, great pace, great plot... and that three-dimensional machismo that Mann does so well. As far as I can see the critics are doing their usual thing of following each other like dominos in their lazy reviews of this great, great movie. See it before it leaves the big screens. The reason I think it's a 9 rather than a 10 is probably a bit mean, but for about two minutes in Havana Farrell drifts into Chuck Norris, which does neither Norris nor Farrell much good.",Miami Vice

Did they wake up one day and decide let's take an awesome cult TV show, add Alexander the Great and Ray Charles, a gun-metal grey Ferrari and then just throw it in the paper shredder and produce whatever comes out? This was one the WORST! movies I've ever seen. How did it get an overall 6.2/10 on IMDb? Maybe by a few stoner's with too much free internet time...how did these actors make this?

It may have had the same characters, but that's where the similarities ended. Virtually non-existing action and poor casting in Colin Farrell, who to be honest is a pretty awful actor.I was expecting some classic 80's action, awful clothes, amusing action packed film.

The film is poorely shot, has a paper thin script, bad supporting cast and mostly plays in the nightly hours. The action is minimal and the dialogue is bad. The only positive thing is that Colin Farrell en Jamie Foxx offer a good acting performance portraing a believable Sonny Crocket and Ricardo Tubbs.

Here we are told that Sonny and Tubbs are good at their jobs, ""I don't like the Americans. They are too good at what they do."" I did not feel that there was a need for Miami Vice movie.

I didn't really care for the characters in the film, so I really didn't care who lived or died. I lied, the only guy I really wanted taken out was the dude with the chewing gum.

Almost 60% of the voters voted 7 or higher. My guess is that most of the ones voting 1/10 were expecting a movie in the tradition of the original TV series, which it wasn't. Actually, the only thing the movie had in common with the original was Miami and the names of the characters. In a way, Michael Mann did to Miami Vice what Frank Miller did to Batman, creating a darker, different and modern version of the original.If you liked Mann's earlier movies Heat and Collateral, then you will almost certainly like this one, too. I think Michael Mann is one of Hollywood's best directors currently, creating a new tradition in American storytelling. He's beginning to reach the same level as Raymond Chandler, Ed McBain and James Ellroy. I certainly hope that producers will give him creative freedom he deserves in the future.

I'm not going to try to be intellectual but, as far as i was aware, films/movies are designed to entertain, not as a social experiment of how two people can parade around various locations pretending to be people they're not and how they interact fully...This movie is very well directed and the ""storyline"" is existent unlike another movie i recently watched (cough, cough....MI3).I love the soundtrack and i actually the ""relationship"" between the two main characters is portioned well, 'Sonny' (Farrell) is more interested in the beautiful, if not misguided character 'Isabella' (Li Gong), than he is in his own partner which makes the sentence ""What? Do you think I'm in so deep I forgot?"" all the more poignant.Anyway, the jist of my conclusion is that it is a very enjoyable movie, it does what it is supposed to do and engrosses you, despite those who look through the movie itself and concentrate on the actors and finite details which the average joe does not see, nor care about, i would go as far as to say that Miami Vice is excellent and is well worth seeing.Don't listen to what we say, if your an intrinsically pedantic person you may not enjoy it, but all others should find it thoroughly enjoyable 2 hours.Thank you for reading, and Adieu :)",Miami Vice

Gong Li's bad teeth. Somebody should send her to the dentist. But truth be told, she IS in all other ways an Asian beauty and the love story incorporated in the plot is hot, trustworthy, desperate and makes this something other than just another action movie.

Along with my two amigo's, I was shocked by the dearth of quality in this film. The first thing I picked up on was the lack of lighting. It was scarce throughout the film, leaving faces indistinguishable. As such, facial expressions were rendered completely useless.Next, I come to the completely inadequate dialogue. For a start it was entirely in another language. I don't speak gangsta, and relied on my friend who is a fan of rap to translate what rare segments of speech were audible. One man had only two lines I heard and comprehended. ""Still no shooter,"" and ""Calm down!"" were the sole words I understood from the mouth of the police chief.Finally, the plot. I am still speechless as to how to two ""undercover"" police men managed to infiltrate the biggest drugs cartel in the world on what seemed to be a whim.

Luckily I am young enough for not to remember the 80's Miami Vice very well, so I can't compare them. I went to the cinema as tabula rasa.What I liked about the movie was the fact that although it had numerous chances of becoming a cliché, it didn't. It could have turned into a movie of world savers or romantic gun heroes or good guys revenging bad guys for hurting people or it could have turned into a fight between good cops and bad drug dealers. But it didn't. the movie was in a may cozily gloomy and honest, in my opinion. I liked the actors. I liked that it didn't get boring and that I can actually ""believe"" this movie -- meaning, the events were real, not made up.

781,kaulex,Suspense traded for in depth character profiling.,8,30 August 2006,"In slight disagreement with the previous poster I could not resist to add my view of the movie.Agreed, the characters seem shallow, since not much time is spent on developing neither Ricardo's and Sonny's relationship nor their personal thoughts and motivations. But I think the aim of the movie had not been a character study of the cops in the first place.The movie starts more or less right into action, gripping the audience's attention (at least that of me and my friends) from the very first seconds. (Very minor spoiler here) There is NO title scene (saying Miami Vice) - the movie continues at the same pace until the final score. From the very first minute tension builds up along with the impression of facing an overwhelming force. Not only for the characters, but also for myself feeling with them. There is barely a moment when you can sit relaxed in your chair, munching away on popcorn and beverages.Even though the storyline does not go into depth about the characters, the acting of Jamie Foxx and especially Colin Farrell is impressive. With only a few camera shots you can actually read their characters (agreed 'shallow') minds. I was never been a fan of the latter actor, having seen none of his movies before. But his performance in this movie convinced me of his potential.Adding to the flavor is not only the ambient musical track, but also the choice of light and camera shots with the 'reality-like' style seen in the more recent war movies (unshaved faces, non-flashy make-up or hair-styling).Finally, I consider myself a fan of the 80s TV show. Luckily though, the movie has neither the looks nor the feel of the series. Michael Mann obviously never tried to create a copy of something which could only live a during that period of time. He made a new movie, that fits today's expectations of (male) action movie viewers: No need for drama, we want fast cars, stylish girls and guns. And there is lots of it in this move. Therefore I rate 8/10 (Miami Vice Fanboy).",Miami Vice

783,bluemoonmedic,"Intense! Subtle! Real! If you want simple, obvious, childish action and emotion...stay home.",8,2 September 2006,"This is not the original series, but it does have the heart of it. The basic characters, the stunning visuals, the music.Yes, you get dropped in the middle of the story without a lot of set up. We know these characters. We don't need the back-story or an explanation of their relationship. Sonny and Rico can work together with little talk because that is what happens with real partners in stressful jobs. You know what to expect, how your partner will act and react without laying it out before hand. When Sonny gets in deep with Isabelle, Ricardo pulls a simple gut check and moves on. These two guys are on the same page. The team has briefings before the action, we just don't see all of it. I would like to see more of the other members of the team, but a movie can only be so long. This movie is about being deep undercover; your team is there to back you up in the big plays, but for most of the prep work you are on your own. The dialogue is strong and a bit minimalistic...not wasted on explaining the details to the audience, you either get or you don't.I found the acting and emotional interaction of the characters stunning. These are people who have to play it close to the vest, not wear their hearts on their sleeves. If you've never had someone express their thoughts and emotions in just a look, then I feel sorry for you. Colin and Jamie do this amazingly well. In fact, I can't imagine any other actors today playing Sonny and Rico. It was understated, subtle, and yet very intense. The love stories involved were more real than anything else I've seen lately. Rico and Trudy both understand the work they do and how it can effect their relationship, they both get it. Someone outside their world could not relate, and a relationship would be less complete than it is with each other. For Sonny and Isabelle, it starts out as part of the game, and becomes more real than either of them expected. They try to pretend it's casual, but right or wrong, it is real. That their lives pull them away from each other, adds a level of raw pain you can feel. For Sonny, it's about being true to who he is and what he believes in, even if it means sacrificing true love.The action was also stunning and yet not over the top. Graffic without being drawn out. As for dark and confusing...for others who listed this as a negative, they obviously have no concept of the reality of these situations. Dark and confusing is exactly what they are. The team is operating on experience and training and pure gut. Caos is the norm in a shootout.This is the first movie I remember seeing where the violence serves a purpose. Criminals use violence to gain the upper hand when needed, but too much would effect their bottom line. The cops use violence when forced to, to protect themselves and others, or to establish their cover, and though it is a last resort they do not flinch from it.The look of this movie is even darker and more sweeping than the TV show and I would expect nothing less. The world is more global than it was in the 80's, and moving some of the action out of Miami makes sense today. I found both the gritty slums and the vast natural vistas equally stunning and an integral part of delivering the mood of the location and action.Miami Vice brought to TV a new emphasis on using the music of the time to add a layer of emotion to the action on screen. While, I didn't find as many recognizable tracks as I thought I would, the songs used fit perfectly, further developing the mood of the scene. I will be buying the soundtrack very soon.This is a movie for adults. I don't mean just age. I mean attitude, sophistication, and most importantly, an appreciation for more than snappy dialogue that leaves nothing a mystery and gratuitous violence where stuff is blown up just because it's there.",Miami Vice
784,doubblle1,Unique,8,2 September 2006,"I think that in this way Michael Mann made a great 21th century movie and still updated the pop felling of the series to a more ""i'm not retarded"" kind of way, this movie uses image and space the way mainstream movies never would and Christ..movies are images. The flow is different, but it couldn't be any other way..the movie makes his strenght out of omitting the more literaturesque character development and plot, just showing images of events mostly silent that do that work..just like a painting dosen't speak in words or literal explanations but out of power of the image and gives a sublime feeling out of the power of omitting..witch in this age of the dumb raised by the words written in balloons of politic campaigns..is the best way to say something. because it makes us feel and think. The worst thing is that i don't think that this movie is made for action and retarded and ""i wish i was van damme"" type of person, it's made for the other film lovers..and it's a shame that most of these other film lovers don't know about this. i saw the movie again with my girlfriend who hates action movies where she gets bored to death because i felt she had to see it...and she loved it.",Miami Vice
785,mm981,Classic Mann,9,17 January 2007,"Miami Vice is very much in line with Mann's earlier crime epics, Heat and Collateral. High end suits, high end firearms, unconventionally beautiful women, skyline shots. The deep focus cinematography is epic. Mann's most visually stunning film to date. The storyline meanders a bit. Much of the dialogue is subdued and quiet, almost an afterthought. But to the avid Mann-fan both of these elements add to the allure. The film conveys as much via visual cues as it does by dialogue. The musical score is powerful. Mann favors Audioslave (again) and I am not one to disagree. Mann's genre consists of cutting edge cinematography, an explosive soundtrack and ultra-realism within method acting. The final gunfight was a let-down, however. It was a bit of a dim-witted standoff. Where the rest of the film excelled, this last ""action"" scene came up a bit short.",Miami Vice
786,keng612,Great movie from series,10,5 December 2006,"Without giving too much info on the movie. Usually movies adapted from TV series are not that great and I am usually very critical.I heard from friends that I would seriously like the movie if I was a fan of the series. Michael Mann once again produces the movie, and comes thru with a true feel for the original Miami Vice that the fans could expect.This is an absolute MUST SEE for dedicated fans of the original Miami Vice series. Granted there are different actors and such. But I think one can feel that that direction of the film knew they could not fall short on this one, and they actually pulled it off.I have to give it a 10 out of 10.",Miami Vice

Li Gong was a surprise, she if anyone played her part well enough. The opening of the movie is also promising but then the long transport of nothingness to the end begins.134 min of absolutely nothing, mixed out poorly with some speedboats and nice cars as in the TV show. I know its hard to make up for the reputation that of the TV show had but it could have been done way better than this. I almost voted a 1 as 12% of the votes already done but out of respect for the kick ass TV show i will give it a 2 ;)",Miami Vice

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy a good action movie, I like suspenseful, dramatic crime movies, this was none of those things. Interesting camera work, who cares, there was nothing interesting to see. Stylish, maybe but an extended montage of fast boats and cars does not make an entertaining movie, even the sex scenes were boring! A real wasted opportunity and a real waste of your money if you go and see it. Stick to the original series, it wasn't that great and it is very dated now, but it was a lot more entertaining.",Miami Vice

Do they not know better than to believe what the read in the press? For year, Hollywood has tried to inflict Colin Farrell on an unsuspecting public, and for years, Mr. Farrell has shown why he needed desperately to stop drinking and go back to acting class.In the same vein, I don't care how many articles camera manufacturers plant to hype their product, video cameras just don't deliver consistent high-quality imagery.The proof is in watching Miami Vice and its cruddy images.OH, and by the way, avoid at all cost.",Miami Vice
790,delta-39,The movie and now the DVD,7,31 December 2006,"Michael Mann has good ideas, great execution and the Miami Vice DVD that I just saw wasn't as bad as the theatrical release. Why? Mainly because I truly believe that the studio version, the one we all saw in the theatres wasn't the true hand of Mann. The DVD was a little better, the cinematography and the utilization of digital shooting made it very pleasing to the eye especially on the DVD version but the script that Mann wrote was too complicated to watch, too complicated to keep up with and the dialogue was garbled, the accents of Gong Li didn't help and Colin Farrel's low, ""check me out I'm a bad cop"" choices didn't work either. Jaimie Foxx was good, as he usually is, but I don't think there was that much story to work with or maybe there was too much story to tell in this amount of time. All in all it's more watchable than the theatrical version, but it's still not the best Michael Mann to watch. Visually, nicely done. Should you rent it, yeah, mostly because the filming of it is worth a Saturday night to sit at home, drink a glass of wine and watch pretty pictures go by.",Miami Vice
791,kenllee,Introduction scene,8,16 December 2006,Great movie...have to watch it with an open mind. You will have to watch it on its own merits and not compare to the series.I considered the final shoot out scene to be one of the most accurately captured in movies with the gun shots sounding very real.The characters is a very true reflection of Michael Mann's work and had lived up to his reputation.I also like the introduction scene very much that prepares the audience of what is to come. Does anyone know what is the name of the artist and music that is played in the nightclub in the introduction scene.I think there are 2 pieces but then it could be one.,Miami Vice
792,alexsanchez-78500,"Not one of Mann's best, but something keeps pulling me back to this movie.",8,27 February 2021,"Huge fan of Michael Mann after watching Collateral last year, then I saw Heat so you could say I had high expectations for this one. I bet everyone else did back when this was released in theaters in 2006. I watched the trailer on YouTube and it pumped me up despite the rotten tomatoes rating at 47%. So going in this film, I said this couldn't be that bad. The movie starts off very strong and the imagery is his most stunning ever. But towards 30 to 40 mins in, it really gets boring and i'm wondering where's the action? And then we get one cool hostage sequence but the shootout scene towards the end felt too generic with some odd music choices except Linkin Park and when the movie stopped I couldn't have been more disappointed and frustrated at the same time. I'm wondering what the hell happened? The TV show I heard is pretty good. So why didn't Mann focus on the characters depth and chemistry? That's what makes the show good and I know this without watching it. I heard Jamie Fox was a big diva so I believe he was deeply miscast for this role. The hurricanes and a shooting incident can be tough on the crew so I admire the hard work they put in this film. Without all that going on, you can replace Tubb's character with different actor, cut out the romance which you barely give a crap about, focus on the two main characters and give a somewhat interesting story because I know Mann likes to dive deep and explore the criminal underworld that leaves you feeling connected like his other great movies. I only watch it again for the cinematography and for inspiration. I also read that director Harmony Korine loved the visuals that inspired Spring Breakers which I is a film I adore after several rewatches and I believe is extremely underrated. I know this could've been a great film, it was just very poorly timed.",Miami Vice

Its not the happy, flashy, pastel, never going to get hurt Miami Vice of the 80's. This is basically the REAL Miami Vice...And if you like realism, then its for you. I wish they would have allotted an extra 20 minutes or so to clear up some question marks, but i cant help but get the feeling that Mann did that on purpose, setting us up for a sequel possibly? I sure do hope so, because i was left astonished. I LOVED it.The characters are for the most part, quiet and not much dialogue. it adds to the serenity of the film. Then you are hit with a love affair between Gong Li and Colin Farrell, but then you find out that she might be playing him on purpose, but it turns out to not be so...Really left you guessing.The cinematoghraphy was excellent, the gun fights very much realistic. Just everything movies these days Don't have..And its not a ""happy ending"" either, thats what makes it more realistic..i don't know, it was just hypnotizing for me",Miami Vice

The movie was some what confusing and the plot and characters developed poorly. It was pretty slow and not much happened and seemed very long - it almost made me sleepy. There is nothing new or exciting this movie brings to the table that hasn't been done better by some other movie. I can think of plenty of other movies that I would rather watch. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx both deserved better writing than this. If you are a fan of Miami Vice, beware you might be let down.

No wonder they used the record by Phil Collins ""In Air Tonite"" which wasn't the original version might I add,but in the TV series when Phil Collins was guest starring it had to be the best episode ever,and I never missed one episode.Damn streets in Toronto would be empty every Friday night when the show was airing new episodes,bars half empty ;probably the only good thing that happened in the 80's and now with the movie version they had to screw it up.What about the great clothes Crokett and Tubbs used to wear? Not in this movie that's for sure. at least they did include a fast car a a couple of fast boats,the TV show put Ferrari and Hugo Boss on the map in North America.",Miami Vice
797,ukodiak,The Vice is for the Eyes,8,5 December 2006,"Its plot is very slow developing, but this movie is worth seeing for It's cinematography alone. This movie embodies many of the old theatrics combined with new. Don Johnson should be very pleased at how charismatic his character is portrayed. This movie really does justice to its setting, makes it out to be a paradise. Combined with that imagine every cool toy a police officer could have, by land, water and air. One of the criticisms I do have is that the plot tries to be too complex when a movie like this could have settled and been more successful with a simpler story. I thought the character development was great, you got to learn each of the two main stars personalities. And they fit them well. I do feel the script also held them back on how far they could take their characters. If handled right I fell this could have been one of the best movies of the year, instead it will have to settle for decent dialog and a feast for the eyes.",Miami Vice

The reason everyone seems to hate it is because we somewhat expected the Vice of the 80's. If you compare this movie to other Mann movies, the yes it does lack something. However, compared to other movies out this year, Vice is better. The movie, in my eyes, lacks action, and is a little boring at times, but the movie's plot was complex and needed time to set up.Jamie Foxx and Coiln Farrel gave good, however, stiff performances and the supporting cast was serviceable. If you want to see a crime drama that is a realistic representation of the life of undercover police officers, then Vice is for you. However if it is shootouts every ten minutes and high body counts, then yes, this movie isn't for you.",Miami Vice

I was excited because of the actors and a plethora of old TV plots to choose from. I was sorely disappointed.Both actors were fine, but were given almost no characters to live out. There is very little dialogue in the whole movie, and what you do hear is hard to understand.The worst part about the movie that the plot is disjointed, fragmented and incomplete.Good luck following it. Some of you may take that as a challenge, but there is no ending or climax worth the effort. I got bored 47 minutes into the movie from not being able to piece anything together.

I started getting confused within the first 1/2 hour, and figured it might all come together later. There were too many people to keep track of. Who is a good guy? Who is a bad guy? The DVD extras sucked too. Miami shooting on location had nothing in Miami. It's not often i shut a movie off without finishing it.

802,elias917,"This film would have been great if it wasn't the ""Miami Vice Movie""!!",8,9 December 2006,"This film was good for what it was, but bad for the Miami Vice movie. Being a Miami Vice fan, and an extreme admirer of Michael Mann's work, I was looking forward to seeing this movie for almost a year, but I was so disappointed with the outcome of Miami Vice that I couldn't believe Michael Mann was responsible for it. I mean I almost felt like crying after it was over; it was so terrible. There was no real believable chemistry in the relationship between Jamie Fox and Colin Farrell throughout the movie and not enough time to show the power of their partnership. Also, where was Miami throughout the film anyways? Half of the film took place everywhere but Miami. The film was basically a boat ride here to there and there and back. I think Michael Mann should have showed off the nightlife of Miami much more than salsa dances in Cuba and airplane trips over Columbia. Furthermore, and nothing against Li Gong which delivered in what she was given to perform, but i think that Li Gong's character would have been more believable if it was played by a Latina since Miami holds nothing but Latinos. The original Miami Vice was phenomenal, and to make a movie after it like this one, and especially by Michael Mann, failed dramatically to meet great expectations. Maybe if the film was 20 minutes longer, it would have worked by providing missing pieces, rather than the amount of time it turned out to be. The film had great deliverance from its extraordinary cast, awesome camera work, and good direction, but the story and script killed the movie. So like I said, the movie could've been the best flick of the summer if it were just an undercover romantic cop story instead of being the Miami Vice movie.",Miami Vice
803,berhsu,Plot was terrible.,1,9 December 2006,"The plot made no sense. Crockett and Tubbs goes undercover in the attempt to find an informant who caused the murder of two FBI agents. For some reason they immediately escalate their undercover work to major drug deals (hundreds of kilos worth) with some South American or Cuban drug lord. To what end its anyone's guess. Quite frankly, there seems to be no purpose to their undercover work. Are they plotting to bring down the drug lord or arrest one of his top lieutenants? Or are they trying to cripple their drug operation? If so how? Neither Crokett nor Tubbs reveal their end goal or how they will attempt go about it but somehow they get continual support from all the law enforcements agencies that are involved (Miami PD, FBI, CIA, Coast Guard and whomever). In the end, Crockett falls for a drug lord and personal sneaks her out of the country so that she can deal drugs another day. You got to be kidding me! The real Crockett would never do such a thing! And the whole informant story conveniently gets swept under the rug and forgotten. This movie was terribly conceived.",Miami Vice
804,ethanirogers,Terrible,1,22 December 2006,"Miami Vice is a terrible movie. Completely boring and there was only one action scene and it was mild. They call it a 'Super Action' movie but it has barely any action and somehow they turned it into some boring romance story. The plot was very weak and hard to follow and it was all just a bunch of random events. They carried the movie out for too long and just made it go on and on. It isn't that I don't like serious movies, but this movie was painfully boring. If you ask me, this gave Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx a terrible reputation as actors. Jamie Foxx was awesome in Collateral and he could have been in some amazing movies but Miami Vice was a real left turn. Do not see this movie.",Miami Vice

I mean, you know what you're getting into here right? You're pretty much going for boat chases and explosions...but the action sucked! and the music was AWFUL!! i mean really moody piano music during boat chases?! Not so much! They say that music can make a film and boy they weren't lying! Its pretty hard to be on the edge of your seat when you feel trapped in an elevator. I have never seen a film before where the music was THAT much of a distraction! Not memorable? Sure. But not stand-out, ruin the movie. Wow! If you're looking for pink coats, Jan Hammer synthesizer music, and action,action,action you should be content with the TV dvds. if you are looking for a smart remake...keep waiting. the only reason to sit all the way thru this movie is Gong Li...now there's a good WOW! she is breathtaking and smart and the only real intrigue in this movie.",Miami Vice

The characters wasn't so bad, but than again I had expected more of them, the one character I didn't like was Crockett, he looked like a biker'porn star and him together with Tubbs, just didn't seem like a good/thrust worthy partnership. In some of Mann's earlier movies we have had a flash into the characters psyche, which is something i enjoy, but here this only occurs one time in the scene where we see Crockett/Farrell look towards the horizon, on Nicholas poach.This movie is pretty long, but even thought it seemed like the storyline was rather short, the scenes where simply too long. Normally I enjoy sex-scenes, but in this case 1/3 of the movie was about Crockett's affair with Isabella, which is to much. that wasn't what I came to see....The movie had a touch of darkness and the atmosphere was great.

Cool action as well.Unfortunately, character development really limited. We don't really find out much about the characters' backgrounds at all. The result is that you don't become emotionally vested in there well-being at all.I think the dialogue was mediocre at best. Often hard to understand, and attempts to sound slick came across as unrealistic. Overall, the writing just wasn't that good. There was actually not that much dialogue...which probably contributed to the problem.Unfortunate, because we've come to expect greatness from this director. I give it a 6, because it was visually stimulating, and the last 45 minutes were pretty decent.

There's not enough pathos and the adrenaline seems a bit diluted. Great Jamie Foxx, Colin you could have done a bit more but maybe you all didn't get the right focus.

809,gja-4,Review,5,11 March 2007,"This film was a hotchpotch. It tried to squeeze 10 hours of material into 130 minutes and the result is a confused mess. There just was not enough time to introduce so many characters, develop those characters in a believable way and explore such a complex plot.The theme of living the undercover life and whether it is possible to live a false life without your private life and personal feelings becoming involved has been done many times before but there is still plenty to be explored within that framework. However, we did not get to know the characters so we could not judge where the boundary between personal and professional lay and when it was crossed. The characters were one-dimensional and experienced no real progression. Colin Farrell in particular was wooden and dull.The plot was overcomplicated, contained too many leaps and implausible elements and ended up as a mess. The source of the leak in the FBI, which was the whole reason for the undercover mission, was never uncovered. The politics within the criminal organisation were confused and implausible. It leapt around locations like a James Bond film. Considering Miami is mentioned in the title, a lot of the action occurred elsewhere.The romantic subplot was very hard to swallow. We were required to believe that Gong Li's character, a career criminal and the number 2 in this highly professional and well-organised, multinational criminal syndicate could be seduced in two minutes by an unknown drug smuggler and she would risk the syndicate's whole operation for a roll in the hay with him. In general, it was difficult to believe that the undercover cops penetrated the organisation so easily.It looks great, no question. A previous reviewer has mentioned the final shootout and indeed this is so realistic that it looks more like an episode of ""Cops"" than a movie. It was not enough to rescue the film though.Ultimately, I was really disappointed. If Michael Mann wanted to make this story, I think he should have looked at a new TV series, instead of a feature film (a reimagined TV series has been done before  look at Battlestar Galactica). He could have pitched it to HBO as 12 or 20 episodes with a Sopranos-level budget. HBO would allow the realistic language and violence that the material probably requires. He could have saved money by casting lesser known names than Farrell and Foxx and maybe keeping the action to Miami and out of the private planes and jungle locations. Then he would have had time to establish the characters and allow the key relationship to develop in a slow-burning and more believable way, with enough time to explain the details of the convoluted plot. Most importantly, we could properly explore the characters' journeys as they move through this strange world. Who knows, maybe ""Miami Vice: The Next Generation"" will be hitting our screens before long?",Miami Vice
810,davidpalmasano,"Boring, Really boring",1,4 February 2007,"No way should ""action"" appear to describe this movie. It's more of a love story than anything. And not a very good one of those either.

Even ""thriller"" should not be mentioned to describe this movie. It is very disappointing. And the love scenes went on forever. Even they were boring and made no sense to the movie. Whomever came up with the idea of this being a great action thriller, is misleading and should not be reviewing movies. I am remarkably surprised at this getting a 6 out of 10 rating to begin.

This show captures the continued imagination of Michael Mann. Colin Farrell easily captures Sonny Crockett's introspection, complexities, and arrogance of the man he always was. While I agree that Jamie Foxx as Tubbs was underutilized in his role, the continued layers of the story showed definite remnants of old shows. I was unsure who some of the characters were, if I did not know the show from the 80's I could not have known who Gina and Larry were.

I felt no chemistry between any of the actors and wonder if Jamie Fox or Colin Farrell would ever do another picture together it was as if they had a lack of chemistry between them. Although the academy award winning cinematographer is well known. The look of the picture was very flat with no depth or color. Shot digital only no film was used.

In ""Ali"" I didn't believe Will Smith was the right choice but he worked and Jamie Foxx as Bundini was amazing. In hindsight I understood why he focused solely on the height of Ali's career. When ""Collateral"" was announced, I had severe doubts as to the believability of the plot, the choice of Tom Cruise as a villain and the decision to shoot on High Definition video. I've watched those two movies several times over and love them both. So it was with Miami Vice that I didn't think Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx as a team were right for the roles. I also believed that the idea of recreating Miami Vice was a pure marketing scheme. I gave Michael Mann the benefit of the doubt considering he directed the TV series that I barely remember since I was only an adolescent. My only knowledge of Colin Farrell was that he was an Irish dude in ""Minority Report"". I was afraid Jamie Foxx would be a continuation of his ""Collateral"" ""Max"" character after he finds his balls.Sure enough, for the first time, Michael Mann didn't sidestep my opinions. From the first scene in the nightclub, Jamie Foxx has taken over the actions of Tom Cruise. Break a bodyguard, step on him and look up past the camera. That was a great maneuver in Collateral, now I think it's cheese. So he's a tough dude. Colin Farrell is a charmer we learn immediately. So we'll expect sex scenes. Yeah. Too bad the characters are in the same camera shot but miles apart chemistry wise. It's just emotionally cold sex. There's no sense of a symbiotic relationship between Farrell and Foxx either. Both of them just seem to immediately know how to get things done and don't really do anything together that one couldn't do alone or with a randomly assigned partner. Their characters dominate every scene of possible tension and diffuse it immediately. Which is what I consider to be the film's second greatest weakness, the lack of tension and drama. We have to watch talk scenes. Characters talk to characters. Deceive characters by talking. Talk about deceiving by talking. Then fly or pilot a speedboat to talk somewhere else and talk over the phone. All quick witted and distant. It's all supposed to keep the audience wondering and guessing. Which is what it does, makes you wonder why any of it matters and try to guess if there will be any action or resonance with a character. Which is the film's greatest weakness. You can't relate to any of the characters. All you are watching is a bunch of ethnically and gender diverse bad asses with cool cars, helicopters and boats go about being bad ass talkers and shooters. All presented in very fantastic heroism jumbled by dialogue, dialogue and more dialogue. The only excitement comes from basic shootouts with shock value due to the timing of action and subsequent gore. But I'm not sure they're exceptional other than how they effectively remove you from the slow anxiety of watching the film not mean anything. The final one in particular seems like a low budget night rehash of the Heat shootout in the dark on grainy video with subpar sound effects. There's no need to care for the characters. Gong Li is the film's only redemption. She acts with her body. Probably because she's not very good with English. It seems like one of the movie's major intents was to instill minority actors into invincible heroic roles. The white FBI agent is incompetent. White trash and jealous Latino dudes are the baddies, a random black pimp is just left to be. Come watch them get graphically shot to pieces by men and women of color. There's no internal development or conflict. They all talk and stare like Max at his turning point in Felix's club in ""Collateral"". There's no fear. Come in get the job done. Get er done! And we as the audience have to admire them for their cool cars and cool actions. Maybe only cool people like this movie. There's no depth or passion to any of it. Just cool people being cool in coolly stylized shots. And you won't even care about the questions it leaves unanswered cuz it's not cool to stress out over it. You might feel jealous or passionate and get shot in your ""inner medulla by a bullet going 2750 feet per second"". I hope this isn't the start of Mediocre Michael Mann. The idea pains my heart.",Miami Vice
817,Vinylgroover,Not Good,2,15 January 2010,"This is my first post on IMDb, but I thought it prudent after last night's letdown- My friend had recommended this movie to me several times, so I brought it for a measly £3 from my local HMV- What a waste of money that was- Now don't get me wrong, I'm a massive movie fan- I think it's fair to say I watch a movie every night of the week, But honestly.This movie lacks everything a good film should have- Good acting, good plot, and continuity. The storyline is all over the place, I found myself hating some of the characters after just 20 minuets. I think the one good thing you can praise in this film and I only mean one thing, is the scenery- It's beautifully shot. That's it!!!I will not be recommending this movie to anyone.O M GEEEEE",Miami Vice
818,JaneWilde,"all style, no substance",5,14 August 2006,"It's good to be Michael Mann.This film is, without a doubt, a slick action packed ride through the night. it's fun to watch, particularly in the volume is jacked up as high as possible, as it was in my cinema. I was entertained to an extent, i admit it.But it has to be said there is a lot lacking. There's not a great deal of plot there to sink your teeth into. Nor is there adequate representations of character. At any point Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell could switch characters and you would not notice, but for kissing the wrong woman.Also, Mann's film style hasn't advanced much since Collateral. In fact, it looks as though they were shot on the same night. Nothing new is brought to the table stylistically or cinematographically. It's identical. But maybe that' Mann's intention for his whole opus of work, i dunno.Overall, if you want to see a movie that gives you a good ride, go and see Pirates of the Carribbean 2. That's a real ride.",Miami Vice
819,jaguar4192,Michael Mann has let me down.,4,6 December 2006,"I've only seen 4 Michael Mann movies, so I suppose I can't say he's really let me down, since I've only like two of those 4 movies (I've seen The Last of the Mohicans, Heat, Collateral and Miami Vice. I like Heat and Collateral.) Of all of Mann's movies, you can expect good camera work, as well as accurate guns. The gun fights prove to be good, if not some of the best I have ever seen.The reason I don't much like this movie, is that it is VERY slow to develop. I had known ahead of time not to expect anything really spectacular, but I was still very disappointed. The overall story could have been fit into a movie 90 minutes long, not 2+ hours long. The love subplots prove to be pointless, and poorly done (they don't even develop well.) As far as overall character development, there isn't any. I've never seen the TV show and I am thus looking at this as just a movie, so I can't compare how well Foxx and Farrell measure to the original actors. All in all, I thought Farrell did a TERRIBLE acting job, and Foxx was mediocre.The main gunfight towards the end was underplayed, and could have been much better. A good trade off would have been an extra bit of time in the gunfight, and one less sex scene.As far as music goes, its not really that good. All it consists of is some poorly done thriller music, as well as some remade recent popular music (Collins, in the Air Tonight, but a remade crap version for example.) All in all, even though this was a free rental for me, I feel robbed...and I want my 2 hours back. The more I see of Mann's work, the less I think of him, sadly.",Miami Vice
820,Tank025x,saw it last night,10,26 July 2006,"Don't worry, there are no spoilers here. I just saw Miami Vice in Albany, NY at Crossgates mall. There was a sneak preview Tuesday night at 700pm and I was one of the lucky guys that got to sit in the 1st row of the theatre to see it (thats how packed the theatre was...and I got there 30 minutes early too.) I am an avid fan of the TV series and despite the bad seating, nothing was keeping me from seeing it, especially because I drove 20 minutes out of my way to get a free ticket promotion. Anyways here's a review...Do not watch this movie expecting it be like the TV series, because it really is not; but Michael Mann does not disappoint. The film is carefully crafted from the things that worked from the TV series. The biggest change from the show that you will undoubtedly notice from the beginning is the difference in characters...especially Tubbs. Tubbs is smooth in the movie and focused on his job. Not to say that he wasn't in the TV show, but Tubbs draws on a certain dynamic that was not in the TV series for his character. He is fast, smooth, conditioned and no nonsense when hes undercover and when he is not. There is no comedic humor from his as there was in the TV series from him. He is no play in this one. Jamie Fox surprises me in this...Phillip Michael Thomas would be proud! Fox as Tubbs is cool and it worked out. There is not much character development in the movie (especially among Switek, Zito, and even Tubbs and Crockett); but after the movie you will see that Michael Mann is trying to make a point about his characters. The point is the same one he tried to make in the TV series; which is that these detectives have no personal lives...they have no character aside from who they have to pretend to be on the street. It gets to the point that the detectives, (Crockett in particular) don't know where the job and themselves begin and end. They become intertwined as they swindle themselves deeper and deeper in the abyss of crime they cant see their way out of.Collin Farrel as Crockett also does not disappoint. His rugged look fits the character well and he makes the character his own; while still keeping the same finesse, and sexy swagger that made girls want him and guys envy him in the 80's. His love interest in the movie does tend to get a bit annoying but is still all the same necessary for the story I suppose. Switek and Zito have almost no character development. They are not comical at all in the movie. In fact I don't even know is they mention their names until the end. But just their presence alone is riveting, cool and you're glad they are there. (especially as fans) Fans will know who they are; as they vividly role with Crockett and Tubbs to formulate a tight anti-crime crew completed with Trudy and Gina. Lt. Castillo is absolutely nothing like Edward James Olmos so do not expect him to be. He is still cool and has his detectives back when the sh!t hits the fan toward the end.In all the movie is good. I loved the TV series but I have to be honest with my fellow fans. In my opinion, it could have used a couple more action scenes, particularly involving Crockett's car. As far as the music, I would have also liked to have heard some more dramatic scores in the movie, but it still worked. If you're looking for the fast, blow it up, stupid tough guy, Michael Bay flick; you'll be wasting your time. But to the fan, who loves Michael Mann's work, you'll appreciate the landscapes, the action, the witty dialouge; especially between Colin and Jamie and the good crime story line. There are def. a couple of awesome scenes; especially one involving Gina and Tubbs (I wont give it way but you'll know it when you see it). The ending will remind true fans of the ending to the pilot, Brothers Keeper. The ending is both realistic, stylish, cool and classic Michel Mann.Best Parts: Michael Mann directing and producing, the witty dialogue, Jamie Foxx as Tubbs,Collin Farrell as Crockett, Michael Mann directing and producing, the clear focused suspenseful (and graphic) action scenes, and Michael Mann directing and producing!!!Worst Parts: Needed a better boat scene, and one more cool car chase or action scene, no Phill Collins, no Calderone (although the villain is dreadfully; similar to him).Thats my piece, I'll def. see it again before it comes out on video.4 out of 5",Miami Vice
821,LeavingLasVegas,very good movie!,8,22 August 2006,"I read many bad reviews before seeing Miami VICE. But I've seen the movie three hours ago and I think its great! The realistic way of filming and acting gave me the feeling that I was undercover with Sonny and Ricardo. I think this movie only suffers from being called Miami Vice (in my opinion it has almost nothing to do with the series) and perhaps its also a bit slow a few minutes before the intermission. But,the acting (also on the smaller parts) is great and for me the big thing about this movie is the cool style of Michael Mann. He makes the story look very cool and gritty/dark. This is not just another action movie. This is about people on the edge and at great risk. So,if you liked the gritty High Def look of Collateral, you are gonna like this one too! I,m already looking forward to Michael Manns new project!Pieter.",Miami Vice
822,jdfrit-932-570092,"Not a movie, a video game for couch potatoes.",1,14 August 2015,"this was a video game more than a movie. shallow directing, predictable gunfights, etc. etc. also i did not relate to the cast as an American who has lived and died in Miami. LOL. why didn't they get don Johnson and do the Miami scene? this was a dark scene movie that could have been filmed at the vault in New york city. i fell asleep thru most of the predictable undercover script. when i woke up to the sounds of gunshots, it looked just like any first person shooter computer game that i have played. also, the simplistic video clues were right out of a video game as well; for example, the skinhead with a swastika tattoo is a video game cue that we, the dumbed-down audience, are being introduced to one of the movie's ""bad guys"". A very cartoon-like development of characters, plot, and a not quite authentic Miami scene that strikes most Americans as foreign, i.e., alien, like the Irish actor who is about as American as Vladimir Putin.",Miami Vice
823,avasumaan,Stupidest movie ever made,1,8 January 2011,"I would have given a -10 if there was such a rating. Jamie Fox and Colin should have been ashamed to have been in this stupid movie with everything going there way against a huge well oiled organization. And as usual, the top girl falls for the cop in disguise ??? Cmon...how much silly and cheesy can this get ? Stupid Stupid Stupid !!!! And the plot is written such that a organized mafiaso is so impotent and helpless against two guys ?? who can seemingly aim from under cars into people's heads when a 10 guns are firing at them at once ? What kind of a silly stupid movie is this ? Someone's pet dream ? Again implying that an Asian or non gringo girl will eventually swoon into a white guy's arms ?",Miami Vice
824,Basiclife_0,Sorely Disappointing,2,6 August 2006,"The cars were shiny, the boats were fast and all in all, that was about all I can say about the film that was positive. The camera-work was awful (and no, I don't mean ""stylishly gritty"", I mean awful!) The plot was non-existent and the characters were very 2-D.The music although, in itself appropriate to the type of film, was badly mixed. To the extent that it made a number of people stop and look around.The gun fights were too long, drawn out and boring. Again, the cameraman comes in here by (presumably) holding the camera while he runs around making it hard to concentrate for the shaking I'm not normally this pessimistic about films, but The general response of the entire audience seemed to be ""Good god that was sh*te"" All in all, thoroughly disappointing.",Miami Vice
825,timmy9313,Not Great But....,7,30 July 2006,"I went into this movie with minimal knowledge of the show, and based on the trailers not the best expectations. What I got was a very good police drama. Not a police action flick, which is what the trailers depicted.This is not your typical police movie. Like Heat, the filmmakers really pumped up the realism while keeping the cop flick clichés to a minimum. At certain points you will think you are watching COPS.I was able to see this movie for free so I thought I'd go back and give it another go. The second time through was infinitely better because I knew not to expect a guns-blazing action movie. The action scenes, although few, are very well choreographed. Not to mention graphic.So, all in all, I would recommend this movie to those looking for a very realistic, dramatic cop story with all around good acting.7/10",Miami Vice
826,johnnybmailbox,A rare masterpiece,10,24 June 2019,"I still feel the sense of this movie, even after so many years. My English are poor to describe the details but the way Mann filmed a simple cup story makes him one of the greatest directors. I am graphic designer, photographer and a DJ. I don't wait people to understand all these deferent dimensions of this film. But the feeling of this film is so strong!!",Miami Vice
827,Thrusthamster,Just bad,2,14 August 2006,"I really don't know what to say. The camaraderie between Farrel and Foxx is non-existent, it's been a long time since I have seen so bad characters in a film. All they did was stand around, looking bad-ass and trying to be cool. The music was bad, the cinematography was as if a diabetic had filmed it during a seizure. I mean, maybe it was meant to be experimental, maybe they were trying to copy 24, maybe they figured ""It worked so well in those action sequences in Heat."" All I know, is that 2 hours of constant zooming in, zooming out and shaking is too much, way too much for a film with just a few action scenes. And I'm not saying that I'm one of those kids who just go to a film to see action. I'm saying that if they had used that style of filming for the action scenes it would have been good, Mann-esquire if you like. But it was just bad.And the worst thing is that there is hardly any character development at all, and that tiny bit of it that exists was clichéd. You didn't care for the characters at all. In the final scenes, they were talking about the risk of the assignment, I was stunned at how little I cared for these characters. I mean, after 1 and a half hour, a script writer or director should be able to establish that.This film wasn't understated, smart or cool. It was none of the things it tried to be, except realistic. And that's the least you can expect from Mann. It didn't succeed at anything it tried. Colin Farrel was horrible, Foxx had one decent scene. And in the final scene, when Farrel pulled that ""pretty boy/bad-ass"" look one last time, I really didn't care. I was just glad I could go home.",Miami Vice
828,ron-353,Great film Mann surpasses my expectations,9,10 August 2006,"This is the best film I've seen this year. The pace, the landscape, the cars, the boats, the music all combine to create an awesome thrilling ride.The movie starts with no intro, we get slam dunked into the Miami Vice reality and it goes right to the end with no hiccups. The story and characters are good and do not waver from what would be expected as normal behavior for the situations they are involved in. The sound in the gun fight was absolutely incredible, bullets rattling all around. I enjoyed the film Collateral, this is better.I go to movies for entertainment and seldom come away with the feeling I got my moneys worth, in this case though I definitely checked out for a couple of hours and did not come back until the credits rolled. I am looking forward to adding this film to my DVD collection.",Miami Vice
829,King-Leonidas,Mann wins again! (no spoilers!),7,4 August 2006,"A short and neat review:Firstly, despite any negative feedback you may have heard, this is one roller-coaster of a ride! Both Foxx and Farrell are brilliant leading men, backed up by a great cast of supporting actors The action is spread evenly throughout and is balanced out with actual plot development and should not be confused with some meaningless shoot 'em up! *cough* VanDamme *cough* Those who claim to have walked out must simply be comparing it with the TV series and, therefore, a word to the wise: DON'T! No one will truly be disappointed by this new entry from Mann and it shows once again how great he is at making crime films. In short: A great, speedy, plot filled movie which will leave you begging for a sequel! One of the best blockbusters of the summer - 10/10",Miami Vice
830,Xotic,The Film-Noir Movie for 2006,7,29 July 2006,"When I had first learned that Miami Vice was going to be made into a film I was puzzled with the question of 'How can this movie be told?'. I was a bit skeptic, if people would buy into it.Getting into the movie, they showed a mixture of both the hip action and gritty dark reality. With the fast cars, women, and action. As well as with informative detail as how criminals think and work as well personal struggles. Now I was a bit irked since there was much sex involved, but I realized that this is a form character study, we see how Crockett and Tubbs life are mixing their work and real life. I was looking at how well Farrel performs, and to MY surprise it was quite good. (you have to see it)Bottom line is to me, Miami Vice keeps the elements of their original show. It won't superceed Michael Mann's previous films, but should rank as one of his best. Mann had intended of creating this as a movie and heres the way he does it. It isn't much for popcorn enjoying movie-goers that just want action. You have to listen to their dialouge as the movie focuses on complex issues. This movie is a good Film/Neo-Noir movie and a great action film for the summer. This is definitely no.4 on my Michael Mann film (HEAT,Thief,Collater) list. Enjoy it.",Miami Vice
831,Mistress_Lainey,Schmeh,4,4 August 2006,"Inconsistent direction - is it arty? is it an action flick? A potentially brilliant gritty film ruined by Hollywood glitz.Could have been brilliant if Mann had used 1st person perspective shots throughout the film, i was confused by one minute being in the scene and the next blinded by stunning and colourful pan shots.A poor love story which is supposed to hold the film together.... either that or the lame plot. Lack of chemistry between all the characters and a romantic relationship between Farrell and his lead is forced upon you leading to disbelief.Fantastic action scenes though, not afraid to go for the gore and a bit of reality.And it all ends happily ever after..... yeah right! And don't get me started on Farrells tache!",Miami Vice
832,WYSIWYG-UK,very disappointed,4,8 August 2006,"I did read the other reviews before going along and of course knew from those what to pretty much expect. But I had unfortunately booked it before reading them.As confirmed by the majority Miami vice turned out to be an over long tedious movie.I don't know if it was the sound quality or not in my local cinema but I could hardly understand a word fox or many of the other cast were saying they seemed to mumble all the time and the times I could understand them it was pretty dire dialogue. I was extremely bored during the ""love"" scenes and found myself nodding off which was a first for me in a cinema considering I stay awake with the knowledge I may as well watch it after paying to see it. But my goodness did it drag on. Yaaaaawwwwnn The plot line itself has been seen many times in many other films and done better I may add. And what is it with the shaky camera work I find that extremely annoying and amateurish and I wish Mann and others would stop doing that I do not find that it makes it like a documentary just cheap. The film mainly seemed to be an advert for the cars, boats and plane. It could have been such a far better film. As I thoroughly enjoyed collateral and Heat I was wondering what the hell happened with this poor film.Rent it only I would say if there is nothing else to see.:(sorry mann.",Miami Vice

Oh, I guess it wasn't supposed to, then...""",2,11 January 2007,"OK, so we have Manhunter, we have Heat, we have Collateral, a bunch of high-class crime thrillers by Michael Mann. And then we have Miami Vice. Can't say when I've been so disappointed with a movie. With the budget and cast of such level we should have a masterpiece, but instead we get a movie supposedly based on a TV-series with which it has besides the characters nothing to do with. The plot was poor, merely a series of compulsory scenes that have nothing to do with each other. And what's with the actors? I've never seen Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx pull off such faceless roles. Let's just hope Farrell, Foxx and Mann will try again, but please, not together.",Miami Vice
834,pesinsight,This movie deserves an Oscar!,3,13 August 2006,"I just want to get something out way the immediately - this movie deserves an Oscar. Unfortunately for Michael Mann, though, is they academy award team don't currently hand out an award for 'Most Misleading Trailer'.Anyone who sees this movie after viewing the trailer will be expecting one of Hollywood's generic drug related action movies. But oh no! What you get is around 30 seconds worth of a non-explosive car chase, 3 minutes of naked shower scenes with fairly unattractive females, 12 minutes of decent (but totally unbelievable) shooting and 2 hours 10 minutes of confusing dialogue - just to pad things out a little.The movie, apparently, is based on the 1980's TV ""action/drama"" series of the same name. There are no opening credits to the movie, presumably to look cool, but it doesn't work. The opening sequence instead shows a pole dancer in some Miami club which quickly switches to a wider shot of the club. A couple minutes worth of the dancer though with some names flashing up now and again would of put me in a much better mood for the trash that was about to be shown to me.A brief summary of the film from what I could pick up from the obscure script. Detectives James 'Sonny' Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo 'Rico' Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are given an assignment to do some drug trafficking in the network of some guy with a beard and his obviously hot wife. Being the player that he is, Sonny soon ends up with himself inside of said woman, which complicates matters. Then Tubbs' not so hot wife gets beaten up for something (no idea what) and they have to go save her. People fire guns, people die, and that's it - roll the credits.OK, it's a little more complex than that, but full marks to anyone who could follow this movie fully on first viewing.The cinematography was not to my taste either, with switches from grainy (so called realistic) shooting, to perfect scenic shots. It wasn't something which I felt added any intensity to the scenes, in fact it just distracts the viewer from what's happening since they are too busy thinking ""Who's stupid idea was it to make it look like that?"". And Was the film actually shot with surround sound? Either it wasn't, or the cinema I was in had the side speakers turned off, because everything was coming from the front which made it very quiet - not that I was complaining by half way through.However, after losing 2 hours 20 minutes of their lives, the viewer is treated to a fairly decent final shoot out scene. If you can do so sneak into a showing of Miami Vice which is near the end (not that I'm promoting this). You really don't need to have seen the rest of the movie to enjoy the finale. If this option isn't available to you, though, just avoid the movie like the plague.",Miami Vice

Through Colin Farrell's mumbling and the thick accents, the only thing I could figure out was that there were drugs involved. Also, why did the very beginning of the movie have absolutely nothing to do with the end? I wish that we could have seen more of Jamie Foxx although I doubt that would have salvaged this movie...or if there had been more action/fight scenes. I really liked Collateral so I thought that this would be fairly good however, I didn't have very high hopes going into the movie and I only went because I got sneak preview passes for free. I guess Colin Farrell fans would enjoy this but otherwise, save your money.",Miami Vice

Good story, good special effects, and good music. It's not the TV show, which turns a lot of people off. But go in with no expectations, and just enjoy yourself. It's very much worth it, especially when you consider that it was filmed in HD.The acting was OK, as Michael Mann was determined to let the seedy, underground appeal steal the show rather than let any of the actors do it. You would never even know Jamie Foxx won an Oscar (good thing he did Ray before M.V.). But this is OK...I mean, who doesn't like an in-depth look into a drug cartel?

Watching Miami Vice meant spending 2+1/4 hours wondering if the story would ever become interesting. It didn't. The plot and it's nuances never really became involving and the characters were flat. Michael Mann has made much better films, a movie goer can only hope this is just a stumble in his career and that he'll do better in the future. Some of the actors are very talented but there wasn't much to work with in this one. Maybe they will all have better screenplays in their next films.

More time was spent showing long drawn out scenes of Colin Farrell's hair. Second, sex and comedy, rated R??? I didn't see any boobies!!!Did anyone watch Miami Vice before they wrote this?? I didn't see any pastels... noting that was Miami vice. I remember it to be filmed...with film not video. Now that digital video cameras have been used in ""big""films, like star wars, everyone thinks it is an industry standard. This film looks like a bad documentary. The frame rate is too fast, it looks like Matt Damon and Russell Crowe got hammered with a sony handy cam. 23 frames per second matt!! I think this film could have used a camera setting of 1 frame a minute. surface noise from real film and 24-23fps might have helped me chew through this film.Colin Farrell made around 10 million dollars for this film... they should have spent 9 million of that on the special effects, especially for the trailer park scene. I think Colin had some old models in his attic, and then lit them ablaze with some hard liquor.if you want to watch a remake of a duo cop team, watch the parody Starsky & Hutch.If you want to watch a movie that looks like a grade 12 film class project, then watch this GEM! Poor Jamie Foxx...did they hold you at gunpoint for this film??? Also where was Rico's Cadillac?? Come on!!! I agree with Special-K88 Ps: the war is on with blue ray and hd-DVD. In the beginning of the film, they have a great commercial for hddvd. On the DVD for Pirates of the Caribbean 2, they push blue ray just as hard... who leaked to whom??

Let's start with the cast/characters. You got Crockett, played by Colin Farrell, who for whatever reason has a handlebar mustache, looks like Sam Elliot and Brad Pitt had a baby. Then we have Jamie Foxx as Tubbs, who is probably the only redeeming quality of this movie, he was the only one that seemed to play his role more like the original character, but still added his own style, so I applaud him for that. You got Gina and Trudy played by generic Mexican woman and generic black woman, you got Switek, who looks like some kind of UFC fighter and only gets two lines, and Zito who is just some white guy who only gets one line. Then you have Castillo played by big black guy, which I was Luke warm about, some skinny Asian broad playing the love interest of Crockett, and don't forget the bad guys, Hispanic man with glasses, Hispanic man without glasses, and intimidating bald white guy with facial hair that looks like he just walked out of Super Street Fighter II. What would many people argue that Miami Vice the TV show is about? Well, it's about clothes, cars, music, just to name a few. This can hardly be called a film, it starts out in a club, no exposition, no nothing, we're just supposed to guess from experience who the characters are (I got them right first try). The plot is despicable, if despicable can refer to something that doesn't exist! What's supposed to be going on? They're trying to make a deal with a Colombian, in true Vice fashion (like I said, there was little to no exposition), then the only hint that Trudy is Tubbs' love interest is a very unnecessary shower scene followed by an equally unnecessary love scene (complimented only by an unnecessary love scene between Asian chick and Crockett followed by an equally unnecessary shower scene, good use of mirroring, Michael Mann). So, they go to South America for 2/3rds of the movie, which is a problem because this movie is called ""Miami"" Vice, not ""Obscure Spanish Nation Vice."" I didn't even like it in the original series when they left Miami, it's boring, it doesn't work for any show, it was awful in Dallas, it's awful in this! So, at some point towards the end of the film, Trudy gets captured and strapped to a bomb (kind of like the episode of the show where Trudy gets captured and strapped to a bomb), then (spoiler alert) they get her out and she gets blown up and falls into a coma, kind of like in Rocky II when Adrian falls into a coma. There's some skinheads, CGI blood that looks almost as bad as Rambo 4's, then there's a shootout at a boat yard and the movie's over. This film is over 2 hours, by the way. Over two hours and nothing happens. This isn't Miami Vice! Where are the pastel suits? Where's the character development? Where's the Jan Hammer!? The soundtrack is balls. The entire time I was waiting to hear Crockett's Theme, but only received a variation which uses the same first three chords and then goes into something else. I had faith in this, I really did. With Michael Mann directing and Anthony Yerkovich as executive producer, I expected a modern day adaptation of a classic 80's cop drama. Instead I got a sub-par modern day cop drama that they just slapped the Miami Vice logo on and named the characters after characters on the show that looks like the whole thing was shot with the lens cap on. So was there anything about this movie that I liked? Yes there was, as I said earlier, I thought Jamie Foxx did the role of Ricardo Tubbs justice, and I liked seeing the relationship between Crockett and Asian chick blossom...at least for the first five minutes, then we had some unnecessary exposition about her mother who's never referred to again and I went back to thinking how much I'd rather be watching the show. Someone needs to go back to film school, the style was alright, I guess, but what about important things like, I don't know, exposition? Character development? And the thing that's most important plot element in a movie, what's that called? Ummm, conflict!? Think about it, let's take a good movie series like Back to the Future. In part 1, it takes a while for the conflict to present itself, the beginning is all brilliantly done exposition that puts us in the mindset of what's going on, that way we can fully grasp and understand the conflict. But there's no exposition, it's just two hours of going around random Spanish nations, talking to guys who look like they're in a contest to see who can be the most threatening, one explosion, one driving scene in the Ferrari, and one shootout. This movie is awful. This movie is diarrhea coming out of my penis, this movie is as appealing as an ooze infected dirty sewer rat feces. I've had more fun playing with dog turds. Crockett's my anus, and Rico is my balls. This movie is an inside-out sphincter regurgitating putrid anal fecal matter, I would rather watch the third season episode ""Stones War"" while shaving Edward James Olmos' award winning mustache using a razor blade placed in between my butt cheeks, I'd rather drink diarrhea vomited out of a buffalo's anus. This movie sucks, it blows, it's a piece of crap, and I don't like it.",Miami Vice
840,maxcaulfield,Michael Mann does it again...Perfection!,10,28 July 2006,"There is a reason it takes Michael Mann 6 months to complete a feature film, its called perfection! My bet is that if the studio would have left Michael alone and allowed him the 180 minutes he obviously needed for this film, it would be perfect. For now, we will have to settle for the 146 minutes the studio grudgingly allowed. I have a feeling...more of a foreboding really...as in badness, that we're all going to have to wait for the Special Edition DVD to see the rest of Michael's film. Hey, speaking of film, there's one more upside to shooting this piece on HD digital...Michael won't have to bend down and pick up all those scraps of film he had to cut from his perfect movie to make our DVD's! Note to executives at Universal: Next time you pay a Director to bring his vision to the screen, leave him alone so we can see his vision instead of your vision! Having said that, I have to be objective about the movie that is here complete or not and even as it is this is a very slick, stylish piece with superb visuals and cinematography never seen in action films! Miami Vice 2006 is not the 80's television show, other than the title, character names and of course the Miami location it has very little in common with the old TV show. This film is fresh, gritty, sexy, accurate, realistic and exciting. Mr. Mann's casting choices of Colin Farrell, Jamie Foxx and Gong Li were right on the money, the entire cast came together perfectly. In every scene the pain staking pursuit of accuracy and attention to the minutest detail is evident. It is easy to get spoiled watching Michael Mann films, Thief, Manhunter, The Insider, The Last of the Mohicans, Heat, Collateral and now Miami Vice are all examples of this Directors obvious pursuit of perfection. Above all this film is hip, urban and very cool. Michael Mann also did a great job of showcasing Miami and I live in Miami! I just saw the film in a sold out theater in Miami and you could hear a pin drop in the theater, everyone seemed to really enjoy the film. All I want to know is when can we expect Miami Vice II? The only thing wrong with this film is the fact that its not two hours longer, I wish I was still there! If you have not figured it out by now, I freely admit I'm a Michael Mann fan first and Miami Vice fan second. I was hooked on Michael Mann the moment James Cann reached for his pistol concealed in the door handle of the ""work car"" on Halsted Street in front of L&A Plating in Chicago! For those of you that have never seen ""Thief"", go rent it, better yet, buy it because you will want to watch it more than once. After you watch it I think you will believe as I do...Michael Mann deserves a lot of rhythm and if Miami Vice 2006 seems incomplete or less than perfect, the blame for that probably lies elsewhere than with Michael Mann. Thank you Michael Mann!",Miami Vice
841,MenhirMan,A great but polarizing movie- as to be expected?,8,28 July 2006,"Let's one thing out of the way- if you are a die-hard fan of Michael Mann, you're good to go with Miami Vice. It may not be another Heat, but Mann's look, his themes, and signature ultra-violence is all here.So many of the criticism here are bewildering. For example, I would guess Mann opted not to include the signature Jan Hammer theme for a simple reason: Why reference a 20-year old TV show right at the start? The movie is not a kitsch fest, nor should it be. It is however most faithful to the TV show in the areas that matter. It is sexy, modern, and mysterious. It is also bloody, terse, and cold around the heart. The plot is elemental; actions and behavior of cops and criminals are barely distinguished, clouded loyalties abound, and romances are tortured. Sound like the TV show? It does to me. For any movie to simply ape a TV show is the ultimate waste. Can we please rate the movie we are getting, not the one we imagined from an 80's flashback?",Miami Vice
842,nils-crone,"Amazing quality of film, cinematography and action",10,11 August 2006,"Well, I just came back from seeing Miami Vice and I must say that it was completely awesome. I'll try to explain why: The first thing you'll notice (if you're a camera/movie geek like me ;)) is the amazing look and feel the movie has. It was shot using a digital camera using different lenses making the whole movie look real and almost documentary-like. Which it is since everything seems so well planned and executed. And the cinematography is also awesome, you could almost take every single frame and put them on the wall as a painting, that's how great it looks. But, you don't really go and see this movie because of the revolutionary cameras and shooting style they use, you go see it for some nice action (and maybe some one-liners as well ;)). Well, the movie delivers on both subjects, and it delivers good! The action sequences are extraordinary (even if there ""only"" is 3 or 4 of them) and the one-liners so ultra-cool it will blow your mind.What about acting? I can only say that it's much, much better then anything I expected from Colin Farell and newcomer Gong Li (she is hot too, which is a good thing). Jaime Foxx delivers a great performance as usual, and so do the other actors.So what's the downside of this movie? Firstly, it's really, really violent so I can't recommend it to anybody who doesn't like a lot of realistic gunfire and wounds. Secondly, it finishes. It should have continued forever! If you love action/drama movies this is the movie for you. To be honest I can't wait before I'll see it again, because it's by far the best movie of 2006 so far along with Mission: Impossible 3.",Miami Vice

I watched the movie 10 minutes ago and it provoked me to write something about it. Characters is not the same as the original series. Fiction is low. You have to fill in the blanks and guess what happened between scenes. Once they decide to go undercover then make a quick deal with bad bosses then again a quick drug job...It sucks...About the shooting scenes, (there is only one at the end, shooting sounds is worser than my first PC game Duke Nukem. And you have the watch again and again to understand who is firing who and what are police snipers doing who are located at the first place to cover good boys...I am very disappointed with Michael Mann. Cause he is one of my favorites in action film...What happened to the guy made Heat,Insider and Collateral? Finally, I can clearly see that no one can play ""Sonny"" but Don Johanson...",Miami Vice
845,kalik-1,Gritty action done with seamless artistry.,9,1 August 2006,"Michael Mann excels here. I must go see it again on the big screen - then DVD. The combination of gritty action sequences and spectacular cinematography in the shadowy underworld of Miami really is a vignette of our time - not to be forgotten. All my thumbs up! The performances of both lead actors are rock solid and the actresses are equally matched - tough, intelligent and dangerous. The ice cold drug czar is masterfully portrayed as well. The international ring that uses Miami as its capital demonstrates the importance of the new 'polis' of our era. Globally integrated cities and their globally effected problems - Mann captures that well.",Miami Vice
846,linadria-1,Excellent film!,10,3 August 2006,"All around great film - (spoiler alert) - The romance makes this film worth the price of admission every time. The action is also extremely good. But nothing beats real feeling between two characters displayed on the screen in such a lush and sexy style. I thought this movie was exceptional. Michael Mann is a visual wizard, who knows how to tell a great story. Mr. Mann understands what is important in a story, the connection between two people. He displays that knowledge in every interaction. From the visually dark undertones of danger, to the incredible romance between Sonny and Isabella. The pairing of Colin Farrell and Gong Li is a stroke of genius. They generate genuine heat, and have the best chemistry seen on screen in years. Colin Farrell's ability to display real feeling (just hinted at in ""The New World"") is not to be missed. Jamie Foxx and the entire supporting cast are all great. There is minimal dialog, but with a Michael Mann film  a picture is worth a thousand words. The movie is unbelievably watch able.",Miami Vice
847,shadow_kazuya,Waste of money.,2,10 August 2006,"Awful awful movie. It starts off rather interesting, two cops in a club looking for someone, then get sidetracked with a past situation. In the first 10 minutes you see a guy getting his arm shot off... Then you don't hear another gunshot till the last 5 minutes. (okay slight exaggeration there, but their was a serious lack of action in the movie).It had pointless sex scenes which really didn't contribute much to the movie, just wasted more time. Poor co-orditination during the action scenes. I'm not even gonna bother ranting about this movie - I'm gonna sum it up just now.Awful storyline, little & poor action scenes and the conversations lacked depth.Overall, I'd say it could be the biggest flop of the year.",Miami Vice
848,brynley05,what is wrong with you people?!,7,13 August 2006,"i cant quite understand how people seem to have such a problem with this film. it was very dark, gritty and brutal. all the things a good crime film should be. it could hardly be called Michael Mann's best work, but as a stand alone flick it was an exceptionally entertaining one. the acting was fine , poetically Gong Li, the photography brilliant and the screenplay kept me fixated. about the only negative thing that really stood out was the need to suspend my sense of belief. Quite how a pair of cops had access to such a large recourses budget is almost comical. despite this, this is an excellent movie and a rare thing these days, a big budget flick strictly aimed at adults that does not insult your intelligence.",Miami Vice
849,jamdrico,One of the best of 2006.,10,28 December 2006,"Miami Vice is a great film. People were already condemning it before it came out, hailing it as another Bad Boys. Now people are disappointed with it because it's not another Bad Boys, it's something else entirely.No film since Narc has shown just how dangerous it is working undercover. Of coarse there are flaws, maybe not enough character development for one, but the film is a living beast with its ever impending sense of danger and it's magnificent soundtrack that goes hand in hand with every visual. With Michael Mann your not going to get an action or adventure film, you are going to get a film maker's film. He shows Miami as this pulsating, beautiful but very dangerous place. It is alive and these two characters, Crockett and Tubbs are the lone rangers existing in the undercover stomach of Miami, trying to expose as much filth as they can. He captures their loneliness with simple shots of them with a beautiful massive Miami in the background. They barely speak in the film, which has annoyed a lot of viewers. There relationship is not about speaking to each other, making wise cracks about each other's wives or having huge explosive arguments....instead there relationship is one of entire trust, with their body language and slight glances at each other, Mann captures a REAL undercover partnership.So, yes people will criticize the acting, or the plot that hasn't been spoon fed to them, or the lack of action. This is a film where Michael Mann does all the work. Farrell and Foxx don't need to act, they just have to show up and let Mann find the loneliness and danger within them with his camera. Mann knows how to make things real. He knows how to show real people. The film is as gritty and beautiful a film i have ever seen, parts of which would look like a glamorous episode of COPS. Realism is what Mann went for, and its the most beautifully real film i have seen all year.",Miami Vice
850,ben_kelly83,Guess I'm not an 80's person,10,16 August 2006,Everyone seems to compare this movie to the original TV series and then proceed to say the movie sucked. I didn't want to see a cheesy or sleazy remake movie. I didn't want to see 2 hours of action or Id watch bad boys. I didn't expect to see hours of Miami beaches and good old detective work or Id watch CSI. I wanted to see something that didn't adhere to the normal material you see on TV or in the movies which is why I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.Maybe I place more importance on cinematography than most but I loved this movie because it was such sweet candy to the eyes and I loved the aura projected from the screen.An epic or classic movie no. But a great movie indeed.,Miami Vice
851,sopasonik,Best blockbuster this summer!,6,16 August 2006,"Quit whining about the TV-show, this movie stands very well on its own. The acting was a bit wooden at first, but after 20 minutes I was hooked. Its authenticity may be discussed, but I was very excited about the story. Jamie and Colin makes a nice pair, and Farrell's 'stache is priceless. Dialogue was mostly crisp, and the bad guys top notch. The (few) action scenes paid off, and Foxx shows some nice fighting moves, just like Tom Cruise did in Collateral. I really like Mann's use of scenery, it feels like you are really there and the different places gets to play a part in the movie. Like the three minutes in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, where 2/3's is just street scenery. Nice use of music too, though Mann should cool it down a little with the Audioslave-stuff. So where do I sign up to be an undercover cop?",Miami Vice
852,jeffreywarley,Miami WHAT??!,1,28 July 2006,"Over a year ago while on vacation, my son and I were discussing cinema and what TV shows were due to become films. Miami Vice was on top of the list! When we found out that the film was in pre production we were disappointed because we wanted to write the script; however, being a huge fan I was just happy it was being done.Disappointment does not begin to express what I felt when I witnessed this cinematic travesty of justice! I always thought of Michael Mann as a great director, and as the executive producer of the ground breaking TV series, I assumed he would bring the same energy and style to the big screen. In fact, Miami Vice the movie had none of the electricity of the series.Unlike it's popular predecessor which used Miami almost like a third main character, the film hardly uses the city at all here! Instead, we are taken to places like Haiti and Havana, leaving out the beautiful backdrop of South Florida. I would rather have been taken to Little Haiti and/or Little Havana. At least then the film might have included one Haitian or one Cuban. By the way, when did the Aryans move to Miami? Bottom line, it was a lousy script with terrible casting, no action and poor direction. It's as if Mann deliberately @#*%ed up this film. Maybe someone at the studio made him angry or something and this was his passive aggressive way of getting revenge. There was no chemistry between Crockett and Tubbs, no chemistry between love interests, and no depth of character to be found anywhere in this film. The villains are laughable at best and by the end you don't care who lives or dies, you just want it to end!!",Miami Vice

Colin Farrel, who was supposed to be the M vice man .. was very far of being else then a cup with muscles and guns.. I this he was really the bad choice for presenting to a spectator something related to ""vice"".. It is very sand because this aspect should have been a major point for the success of the movie. Moreover, I think you can call this movie like ""the two cups and the beauty"" or "" operation transport"" or "" mafia deal"" .. anything but Miami vice.. and this would not change nothing... The only scene that worth it was the trip to Cuba with this fast boat .. nothing else.. even the actions scenes who was supposed to be very real .. the director made some great mistakes specially when this skin head guy was shot with two bullets in his head!",Miami Vice
854,TheGeeeek,"Great, classic Cop-Thriller",10,1 October 2006,"To be honest, I have been prepared for a different kind of movie than the classic 80s TV- series. As I found out that the original series' producer, Michael Mann, is going to direct a movie about Crocket, Tubbs and the other Vice squad, I was expecting an 80s revival movie but was lightly surprised that he's not going to shot it like it takes place in the 80s. But that's really the only point that's different between the series and the movie. Everything else is completely the same. Like the series, the movie is about the two main characters, Sonny Crocket and Ricardo Tubbs and about their jobs as Miami police officers. The main point that I like about the movie is the fact that it focuses, by the way exactly like the series, on the position of Crocket and Tubbs mainly between right and wrong. And for me that's the main part of the series: The living on the edge. This can also be easily found in the movie. Besides, I very much like Mann's way of shooting: He very much focuses on the surroundings, mostly with ""shaking cameras"" which make the movie much more authentic. He somehow likes to shoot scenes which take place at night in areas which are colored in a main color. You can find this very much in ""Heat"" and in ""Collateral"" too. But for Miami Vice this helps to get an connection to the main characters and their work. So, as I walked out of the cinema I listened to several guys and their opinion which are mostly negative. But if you take your time to watch the TV series and the movie you find out that they are so very much somehow connected and ""the same"", that, if you're a fan of the series, you have to like the movie. Great work!",Miami Vice
855,yoyois-1,why is this movie bad?,1,31 July 2006,"Save your money and avoid this film. A buddy movie? Ha. No relationships between the characters, no buddies here. No action either (aside from fast boats and fast cars that appear and disappear for no reason). It's grainy at time (to give it a news feel?) but why does it happen in the middle of a scene? And what are they talking about? If you can decipher the accents, you don't understand all the abbreviations the actors are so knowingly using... Since you don't care about the characters, you don't care about their love life or hates. When Collin Farrell says to his love interest ""It was too good to last"" the audience started laughing. There was nothing good there, no attraction, no tension, not beautiful love-making, nothing. They just hop into bed and out of bed(in Cuba from all places. Why Cuba? can't they make love in Miami?) And when the head bad guy gets the news that his woman is sleeping with another man (he gets it from her) that is an excuse for another love making scene. Apparently that makes him hot. But when he is shown a tape of them dancing, he is ready to kill his woman. This is just some of the things that do not make sense in the story. Couple it with non-expression acting and hollow eyes, triple it with strange photography, and what do you have? An excuse for Michael Mann to have a good time, play with 'the boys' and do the things he always wanted to do as a macho man, on someone else's buck - (yours) but what YOU get is nothing, a waist of time and money.",Miami Vice
856,lithium_xy,Why did Mann waste money on Farrell and Foxx and then not use them?,1,27 July 2006,"My roommate happened to have two guest passes for the Wednesday night screening of Miami Vice. I decided that I would take advantage of this free offer and check out a summer blockbuster. I did not go in expecting a lot. I've never seen the Miami Vice TV show, but I assumed Michael Mann would dumb it down enough so that anyone and their dog (yes, even if their dog happened to be from Istanbul) would understand the movie without any previous background information. It turns out that I was right. I don't think this movie bares any resemblance to the TV show (although I have never seen it), and I'm basing this entirely off of the godawful script that was Miami Vice. I couldn't follow their convoluted, melodramatic plot. Seriously, this shouldn't be a complicated movie, but Mann somehow managed to confuse even the simplest issues by never following them up. Also, the script seemed like it was about ten pages long, but the movie somehow managed to squeeze a convenient two hours and ten minutes out of it.It's not that Foxx and Farrell are bad actors, they aren't, but they don't have anything to do in this script. It seems that Mann thought if both actors just acted tough and badass through the entire movie (while occasionally looking solemnly out into the Miami bay or something) that would make the movie. It is also apparent that Foxx and Farrell never talk to each other. I found this very strange for a buddy/cop movie. They do exchange words, but they consist of ""let's rock"" or ""I believe in you 100%"". Okay, so there was no strong performance (or even lines) from either of Foxx or Farrell, but there was some explosions right? Wrong.I think maybe three things blew up during the entire movie. Oh, and it's only three because in one scene you see two objects blow up simultaneously. I guess that's the third explosion. The movie kept trying to build to something but it was a jumbled mess of off-key romance (which didn't make sense since there was zero character development), a buddy/ cop story where the buddies, ironically, weren't buddies at all, and a very convoluted story about a leak in the FBI that was never resolved. I thought that at least someone would get arrested in this movie, but no.In conclusion I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. Not even the hardcore Vice fans, not the explosion addict, and definitely not the casual viewer. Oh, there is one last thing. I liked some of the cinematography that felt left over from Collateral. But, if you liked that movie, just watch it again and don't waste your time on this garbage. You can never have those two hours and ten minutes back!lithium",Miami Vice

I viewed Miami Vice in a digital surround theater,and the effects-gunshots,helicopters,speedboats,sports cars etc.were plenty clear but I found myself straining to hear most of what the actors were saying. Of course, the heavy accents and macho low voice tones didn't help. Its a good drug/crime action movie but very far from the caliber of films Mann is known for(Heat,Collateral).

The digital didn't do its job either. The dark scenes were almost indiscernible what was actually happening. I don't think I could even recommend this for video, even though it looks like it was filmed with an eighties era camcorder hand held! Mann you shouldn't rushed to meet the deadline.

I thought the dialogue a bit silly in places and the plot was hard work but this film looked amazing. I understand its all been shot in HD which to begin with has a unattractive feel to it. However, as the film progressed I really got into the feel. Great sound track until a very silly cover of In The Air Tonight (which as with all of Phil Collins work is tosh). I think it would be interesting to see if there will be a second film. Not sure what you could do with it.

Go to Donzi's website and you will see some kick-a$$ boats with some dope paint jobs. We had Crocket cruising around in a racing boat with weird logos as if he was a professional race driver. The intelligence levels would just conveniently drop and rise when needed. In the beginning it seemed so hard to get anything done. By the end it seemed like the Mystery Men could have handled these bad guys. There were hardly any key strategic moves. The only reason things went the way the ""good guys"" wanted is because Crocket would repeat himself ""it's my way or it's not happening"". That happened like twice. And the bad guys would easily just back down. The bad guys who were so smart in the beginning couple minutes become mentally challenged a short while later. Watch Heat, watch Collateral... and then watch Vice. There hardly even seem to be any trademark Micheal Mann moments that made his previous films so thrilling. The ""love"" scenes between Crockett and Isabella were just horrible. Not believable at all in that they would create the tension they did. Isabella was also very ugly. The ""romance"" was also very dragged out. It threw off the pacing of the film terrible. Are matching shower scenes really necessary? It was really tough to like this film. It became too simple and predictable. Even the opening scenes weren't so engaging. This film definitely didn't do it for me. Sorry.",Miami Vice

I must say that I have never seen the TV series (having grown up without a TV, that is). I didn't have any expectations other than ""A Micheal Mann movie HAS TO BE GREAT"". I am so disappointed. Really. A waste of money, a waste of time.The chasing scenes were too long and insignificant. The romantic side of the movie was simply not credible. And I have to say that Colin Farrell isn't my favourite actor either (even though I did enjoy that movie in which he was training to become a spy... can't remember its title though). Too bad.And I now suspect that just because this is a Michael Mann movie, people won't dare to dislike it.

863,Burnley-Swinny,Would have been Great if.................,10,6 August 2006,"Watched the movie this weekend and actually enjoyed it. I'm a big mark for the original series and expected this to be rubbish. The movie would have been a lot better if they'd have left out Zito's character, seeing as the guy was killed off in the TV series episode Down for the Count. Other than this You could have taken this as a continuation of the original series rather than a remake(and as long as you ignore switeks dodgy dealings towards the end of the series). And who thought it was a good idea to recast Castillo so off the mark. they should have cast the guy who was the FBI liaison bloke as castillo at least he looked similar to edward james olmos. anyway thats just my opinion. although the movie was a little bit drawn out at over 2hours I still thought it was cool and a welcome return to Miami law enforcement.",Miami Vice
864,pythonews,Scary to think that this director also made 'Heat',1,23 March 2007,"I sat throughout this film waiting for something to happen. Then it ended. I know this isn't supposed to be a Bad Boys style action movie, if anything I would class this as an 'inaction' film. Cosmically dull with phoned in performances from the usually good Colin Farrell (whose US accent roams countrywide) and 'Oscar Winner' Jamie Foxx (who at times looks like he's reading it off a piece of paper taped to the back of someone else's head).Michael Mann can be a great director, Heat and Collateral are great movies. But this, his big pet project, is up there with Ultraviolet as the worst movies I have ever seen.Unless watching regular shots of people getting into showers (sans gratuitous nudity) and questioning the fabric of existence by wasting 2 hours of your life is your thing, avoid it like the reaper itself.",Miami Vice
865,LRM-1,Disappointed,5,31 December 2006,"If the movie wasn't titled ""Miami Vice"" it was OK..but M. Mann should have had Don Johnson and P.Michael Thomas in the roles..made them current...and it would have worked...I was so disappointed not to hear the Miami Vice Theme song...Lets face it....There is only one Crockett and one Tubbs and it isn't Colin Farrel or Jamie Fox.....We want our old gang back..older.probably promoted...but still working crime in Miami.......Don Johnson is one of the finest actors we have...So many musical artists contributed to the TV series....they were missing...but they were part of Vice as the actors were....I am stunned that Michael Mann chose to make this movie as it was instead of trying to recapture the great Miami Vice of the 80's..which was edgy..always interesting and appropriate music...and how can anybody look better than Crockett in a t-shirt/linen pants and jacket..as i said above..all that was needed was to make it current and go with it...to not play the theme song was like going to the theater and not having popcorn..whats up with that??????? Michael Mann come on ..give u a true Vice movie...",Miami Vice

PLEASE think of it independently - try, you know ye can. finally - i was there when the 80's TV show hit the screens and frankly it was pretty groundbreaking in it's day. simply MICHAEL MANN is one of the very best - long may he continue. edinburgh festival is very good- nothing to do? well come along.",Miami Vice
867,SSRESNICK,Rolling the dice with ''Miami Vice'',5,9 August 2006,"True to the Hollywood tradition of the summer blockbuster, this summer's ''big picture'' is Miami Vice. And the fans of this type of big budget action film will not be disappointed . Miami Vice has all the usual and necessary elements of the summer crime spectacular....starting with the dark Miami club scene and it's even darker inhabitants, major criminal activities being planed and perpetrated, and various foreign and domestic crime czars and their clever minions are charged to execute both their grand schemes and business rivals. All this without regard for borders and our overworked and dedicated law enforcement heroes. To this director Michael Mann has added lush scenery and superb sound along with truly choreographed violence and sexual scenes...And Mr. Mann has proved he has what it takes to deliver great crime dramas and equally impressive characters, as in his unique films such as ''Thief''w/James Cann,''Heat''w/ DeNiro and Pacino and ""Collateral""w/ Cruise and Foxx. And, if that is not enough Mr. Mann was part of the creative team and executive producer of the original television series ''Miami Vice."" Many viewers of the latest ""Miami Vice'' will indeed , and with good reason, enjoy their over 2 hour trip to the gold and glitz state of mind and matter know as Miami...Surely Michael Mann is perfectly suited to create this and much, much more...However, despite the visual splendor and high-content action scenes of this well marketed movie, it is exactly what is not present that will disappoint some who roll the dice ,deciding to view ''Miami Vice.'' The only real similarity to the much loved television show is the title , location, and the names of the two major characters, detectives Crockett and Tubbs. No where do we see the teamwork that Crockett and Tubbs were known for..In fact Jamie Foxx, a superb actor, has virtually a supporting role relative to that of Colin Farrell who plays Crockett, and without the screen presence or personal history of the original Crockett as played so well by Don Johnson. The actual story is extremely predictable, and ,with perhaps one exception, you will often feel as if you have seen this film many times before...this film's journey and destination are never in doubt! ""Miami Vice''is a big budget film, it is believed to have cost 150 million dollars to produce, while the actual budget of the entire Miami police dept. is around 100 million dollars ! It is surprising , considering the cost and a great director, that true dramatic style and genuine suspense, not to mention a more credible plot, could not have been added to this exciting summer film and have made it a better film for all seasons and thus for more movie fans to enjoy as well !",Miami Vice
868,kodym,A Great Look At Miami Vice,10,31 July 2006,"Heading into the 4:30p.m. show on Friday I had my own opinion about Miami Vice. Being a Michael Mann fan and also a Miami Vice fan I knew that this version would be different from the 80's show. As soon as the movie started I knew that this would be a wild ride. There are no opening credits and this has had many reviewers giving complaints. Instead of complaints, why not just get involved into the story like a movie is supposed to do? To be honest, nobody really cares about who is in a film until after they see a certain actor or actress perform. The film Miami Vice had many things to say, of which about 50 percent of the people on here can have their own opinion... But I enjoyed it and i'm watching it again tomorrow.. Have a nice day.",Miami Vice
869,Christylou,Miami VICE,6,14 August 2006,"I thoroughly enjoyed Miami Vice. I knew going in that it would not be like the TV series we all loved when we were in college. It was very popular back then. Huge groups would watch it every week in the Student Union. The premise was kept the same, the two partner detectives/friends working undercover in Miami's drug community. I'm a big fan of Colin Farrell and enjoyed his performance immensely. I haven't seen serious stuff by Jaimie Fox and he didn't say a whole lot in this movie,neither did really, but the quiet acting was very intense. As for the plot, well, we have good guys and bad guys and drugs. It is the usual plot. I did NOT find it boring. The new toys were great. My expectations were met. Colin Farrell's new movie. I knew it would be different from the 80's TV show. I did kinda miss Elvis.",Miami Vice
870,The_Josh,Snoozefest,1,3 August 2006,"I just got back from seeing Miami Vice. I went in expecting a halfway decent movie, and wasn't even treated to a 1/4 decent one. There was no character development, or any sense of a plot. We were treated to maybe 15 minutes of action for a movie at at almost two and a half hours. Our ""villans"" only had 10 minutes of screen time, and were talked about in 3 lines, outside of the first and last appearance of them. There was no real connection to the characters, when the character of Trudy was kidnapped, and hurt, you don't really care. Story wise, it's all talk and meetings, with no action. And this movie was supposed to be just that, an action flick. What action we did get was bland and unrealistic. If they were trying for a perfect summer film that makes people think, they missed the mark. While I enjoy those movies, this one didn't even provoke a, ""Huh, why did Crockett do that? Is that the reason why she did that?"" Bottem line, this whatever this movie was going for, whether action, noir, or a movie that makes you think, it failed. Don't waste your money on this movie.",Miami Vice
871,kparedes,Why taking it on Colin?,4,16 August 2006,"I don't understand why some of the other commentators seem to be so unhappy with Colin's performance. I think it is pretty unfair to blame the results from a sadly poor script on a leading actor. Some of the scenes were ridiculous but wasn't Colin doing what the script expected him to do? I actually didn't leave the theater until the end of the movie (and believe me, it took quite an effort!) just because there was something in Farrell's representation of Sonny that made it attractive. About Mann's work, I only enjoyed the originality of the cinematography and how well it worked in setting up the mood. Now, on those sex scenes... It wouldn't hurt if Mr Mann would screen some avant Gard movies. Colin, you did good!",Miami Vice
872,Reserve7,Micahel Mann does it again folks.,5,28 July 2006,"Well, I walked into the theatre tonight not really knowing what to expect. However I had fairly high expectations due to the fact I loved two of Mann's previous films, Collateral and Heat. I was not let down, Michael Mann surpassed most of my hopes for the movie.The story revolves around the good Ole' TV show Characters, however they throw in a bit of something called character development which makes it all a little more engaging. Don't get me wrong, the film has it's action sequences, but it definitely gives you a feel for ""Sonny""(Farrel). Jamie Foxx's character, I thought, didn't get as much of a chance to develop, which is a little disappointing. In the mid section of the film they focus a lot on showing you the relationship and personality of Farrel and Gong, which is great, however, they sort of forget about Foxx.Don't worry, Jamie gets his moments to shine when it's back to business. The last quarter of the film really gets your adrenaline going, it's an explosive, yet not overdone, finish to an excellent film. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful in sections,which just helps even more with unbelievably ""cool"" feeling Mann seems to associate with his films.In summary, it's an excellent flick, and I recommend it for anyone who's craving a mid-summer action-drama. It keeps to standard with Michael Mann's quality of film for sure. The only cons I can give about this movie are the focus on Farrel/Gong relationship in the middle, I thought it was a little dragged out. Colin Farrel and Jamie Foxx do a superb job in the roles, however you catch some of Colin's Irish accent a couple times during the movie, and you can tell at parts that it was a tough role for him to pull off. 8/10",Miami Vice
873,ewbhockey,Confusing,2,6 January 2007,"A decent film, but I have never been so confused during a movie. The production and writing was obviously rushed, well at least I hope it was. Aside from the confusing dialog, a lot of things happened that completely ignored reality. Example, Colin Farrell chokes a guy to death in 15 seconds! 15 seconds??? The average person can hold their breath for at least half a minute, so how could someone possibly die after being choked for 15 seconds?? They also talk about how a hurricane is going to hit Florida, yet they're driving around in boats around Miami for half the movie! Where was the hurricane?? The dialog was incredibly confusing and I spent a good portion of the movie just trying to figure out what was going on. Whenever the characters talked it was very brief and they didn't seem to talk about anything. They would exchange a few words and then something would happen, and the audience was left trying to figure out what they just said to each other. The locations were also very confusing; the places were named only the first time they were there, and after that you were on your own trying to figure out where they were. It also switched constantly; one minute they were in Cuba, then Columbia, then Miami, and there were mentions of New York but who knows what happened there. However, the HD filming did give a different perspective on the action scenes; the filming was much more personal and put the audience in the action. It does take a little bit to get used to the HD filming technique but after a while you get used to it and I even liked it at some points. Overall though the movie was incredibly confusing and I still have yet to completely figure out what happened during it. Don't waste your time with this one if you're looking for another Traffic style movie.",Miami Vice
874,Rickster_33,Genius,10,8 August 2006,"The ultimate hard-men feature in this film and the action scenes are nothing short of spectacular. They are intense and electrifying as both Colin Farrel (probably the only man in recent times to pull off a handle-bar moustache) and Jamie Foxx use their full acting talents in this ferocious thriller.During the film I could barely contain my excitement as Farrel and Foxx blast around in Ferrari's, fast-boats and much more.The acting is flawless, the directing superb and the camera-work has exactly the same effect as Collateral, but with added sting.Undoubtedly the best film you will see this year. At least.",Miami Vice
875,silver_faerie4,Rent something else,1,12 December 2006,"I was expecting a fun, mindless romp with Hollywood with this film. What I got was a complete waste of time and money. I didn't turn it off because I kept waiting for it to get better.The movie plods along pretending to have a plot, but it never really develops. I feel like I've turned on the TV in the middle of show that has potential to be good but I have missed the beginning and can't catch up. Miami Vice jumps right into whatever it is turning to tell or teach us, but never actually tells or teaches us anything.Even the action scenes leave me wanting for more. At least in other sub-par action movies the action comes at you fast and furious (Bad Boys II and The Transporter II.Although I'm not familiar with most of the cast and crew, I expected more out of Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell. Both have shown great acting skills; Fox in Ray and Farrell in Phone Booth. Yet, they never develop their characters.What's with the way everyone was talking?

876,ben-728,Big letdown,1,30 July 2006,"I was looking forward to a big screen Miami Vice. Unfortunately, this ""movie"" was horrible from beginning to end. What should have been a simple enough action/thriller was bogged down by bad acting (Colin Farrell), convoluted dialogue, unnecessary deviations from the plot (gratuitous boring sex scenes) and no resolution to the most glaring plot lines. The pace of the movie was coma-inducing and what little action there was, was unbelievable even though it was painfully obvious Mann was going for realism in the gun fights. Bottom line: When you can't understand the dialogue of half of the characters, have so little attachment to them that you couldn't care less who lives and dies (aside from the likable Henley), and are continually glancing at your watch in dis-belief you know you just wasted an evening and 10 bucks.",Miami Vice

This movie was a little bit long and hard to understand what people are saying at times, but there's plenty of action, including intense, graphic gun fights.I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the film ""Heat"". This movie should get great reviews on this website and everywhere else. It's basically Crockett and Tubbs going undercover, trying to catch some cocaine dealers.There are a few scenes where Farrell would mumble, so it's hard to understand what he's saying sometimes, but there's not much to listen for anyway. I won't give out spoilers.",Miami Vice

Farrell and Foxx did not work well together i think someone should have told them they were suppose to act like they were a team, Farrell was great in S.W.A.T and fox was great in collateral and stealth and all the great films Michael Mann has done why bother with this",Miami Vice

He proves again that he is the master of crime drama/character study type films. This movie is slick and up to date with today's day and age. I am a huge fan of the original TV series and this film has met my expectations, which were pretty high. The characters of Sonny and Tubbs are updated for sure, but remain fundamentally true to form from the original characters in the 80's. The acting is first class and the cinematography is something to behold. I can only hope that Mann decides to delve a little deeper into this new and improved Miami Vice, and bring us a sequel. Highly recommended film, probably the best of the summer this year.",Miami Vice
880,sanchez_6914,Solid movie for those who don't expect Micheal Bay,10,21 August 2006,"In my opinion, Miami Vice was the smartest, darkest, and most realistic cop thriller in a long time. Those who expected the high octane car chases, phony shootouts, and cheesy dialog are to be disappointed. Vice is a movie that takes thinking, and is not a movie to be taken lightly. The plot takes a little bit of time to understand, where I think most of the people were turned off because they expected an easy-to-follow plot with senseless humor and action scenes every 10 minutes, like in Bad Boys. Most folks did not take the time to think and just enjoy the movie Mann put together. The movie-goers who gave the movie a 1 were simply people who cannot understand what Micheal Mann was trying to create, a REALISTIC film without all the bullsh*t you see in typical cop movies. Best Movie I've seen in a long time, and I don't care what anyone thinks. If people take the time to understand the movie, than you'll appreciate it. If you don't have the patients for using your brain while viewing a film, than Miami Vice is not the movie for you.",Miami Vice

883,mk2893,Disappointed,5,31 July 2006,"I'm a big Michael Mann fan, and consider his role in the original Miami Vice, I figured he would perfect the art form and deliver yet another great movie. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed.During the first 20 minutes or so of the movie, I could barely hear any of the actors lines; they mumbled a bit too much for me. After that, it seemed that the middle of the movie consisted of sex scene after sex scene , none of which really seemed to add too much to the movie (I think one sex scene with Farrel and that woman would have been sufficient to express that they were ""together"" and Foxx's sex scene seemed unnecessarily gratuitous). Though that in and of itself is not a huge problem, ultimately it became just one of many little reasons that I was let down by the film.I got the main storyline (the whole drug bust thing) but it seemed that the movie attempted to explore several various plot lines, without concluding them, or even giving enough information to the audience to draw their own conclusions. A few examples include the ""leak"" in the agency (it seemed like they explored that halfway), the dynamic between Isabella and Jose, and the whole Arian brotherhood plot.And though action alone doesn't make a film, it should play a key role in a movie like Miami Vice, and there was a disturbing lack of it. The end scene would have been satisfying, but it seemed a bit poorly shot, and telling who was who was difficult to impossible, due to awkward camera angles.I give it a 5/10 because I felt that there were some things Mann should be given credit for. He had a good cast, and there was certainly potential. The movie mainly loses points on the grounds that it did not effectively utilize its potential. It was one of my most anticipated movies, and I desperately wanted to love it.I would love to hear any opinions to the contrary that could offer me a different perspective on the film, or any supplimentary opinions that could expound upon what I've said.",Miami Vice

The acting by Jamie Foxx was not vintage academy award Stuff.He overplayed the character a bit.

885,GladiatorMV,One of My Favorite Movies Ever!!!,10,30 July 2006,"I have been excited to see this movie for over a year and after seeing it, I have to say that it was great. After leaving the theatre, I had the same feeling after I saw Collateral and Heat. I knew I liked the movie, but I didn't know how much I liked it. The more I think about it, the more I love it. This movie had great action, a great pace, and the story was great. The plot had some twists and turns in it to keep things interesting and the action was the icing on the cake. Being a fan of the show, I have to say that I am very pleased with the movie. Although Mann stated that the movie was not going to be like the show, there are certainly similarities between the two. Colin Farrell did a great job as Crockett. Michael Mann made the movie look beautiful with the different environments that he brings his characters into. This is certainly a movie that should be watched more than once. I have watched Heat and Collateral a bunch of times, and I keep finding new things in each movie. I'm sure that Miami Vice will be no different when the DVD comes out. I'm also hoping for a Director's Cut, since I heard that there was a good amount of footage taken out of the movie. Mann did a great job with showing the characters' feelings through action instead of dialogue. The reason Heat had so much character development was because it was almost 3 hours long. If Miami Vice added another hour to it, then I think it will be right up there with Heat. Hopefully, Mann puts in the extra footage on the DVD. I can't wait to see this movie again and if you haven't seen it yet, then you should hit the theatres right now. The DVD can't come out soon enough. ****",Miami Vice
886,arscully,Miami Vice comes back with a vengeance,9,25 December 2006,"First off I have to say the first time I watched this movie I was a bit skeptical of where it was going to take me. However this movie was the craziest, hardcore crime drama movies I had seen in a long time. Anyone who thinks that this isn't like the TV show hasn't watched the show in a long time.The pacing, and even the use of Mann's signature film grain can be seen throughout the series. Just watch the opening of the first episode. Miami has changed since the 80's, thank god, there are no more neon colors and crazy outfits. The club scene nails it, if anything there needed to be more seedy underbelly stuff and guns. Mann does just as a good job speaking about the ""soul of Miami"" now as he did then.Sorry to those that wanted a funny or carbon copy TV remake romp, this movie is as serious as they come, consider yourself warned.Over all an excellent movie, not Mann's best, but still worthy of 9/10",Miami Vice
887,patrick_foley,Nothing like the TV Series,4,9 March 2017,"If, like me, you thought this film would resemble the TV series of the same name you are very much mistaken. Aside from a select few character names this film bears no resemblance to the TV series and really should have been called something else. The film was long winded, meandering and lacking any interesting plot lines. Dull dialogue interspersed with explosions and sex scenes is what you can expect from this over-hyped flop of a film. The interaction between Sonny and Rico was stunted and underdeveloped. In the TV series they formed a real bond, in the movie they appear to almost despise each other. They have focused too hard on creating a 'hard-man' image and foregone the charm and wit of the original characters, making them seem very scripted and unbelievable. Overall this film masquerades under the facade of a fantastic TV series and will leave anyone who enjoyed the series thoroughly disappointed.",Miami Vice
888,lebernadin,This Miami Vice is sobering (spoilers found here),8,30 July 2006,"You already know, by way of the trailer and marketing campaign, that the hot cars/boats/planes are present as they were with the original TV series. But what may not be as blatant in the trailer is the level of seriousness that envelopes this latest Mann project. There is very little humor to be found in this film, aside from a few lines given to John Ortiz's character. Humor, if you recall, was a key element in the series' storytelling. Instead, the humor is replaced by Mann's trademark cadence and mood which has no time for light-heartedness.I've given this film an 8 because its not telling a story that's too big for its britches. We already know the main characters from years past, and are able to place these characters into the circumstances Mann has created in the present day.",Miami Vice

Every person working on this film should be ashamed. This film is a disgrace to the TV show that did so much to change the way we all view TV. From the opening of this garbage movie it was evident that I had just wasted $10. I kept waiting for one good chase scene or just one hot girl or a decent song but none were to be found. I kept thinking the film would turn around because I always loved the TV show so much, but I was let down in a big way.

890,khaled_yafi,Best of the year,10,4 August 2006,"Ever since Miami Vice was announced as a film in pre-production, people have been spewing rubbish about it and approached it with such negative preconceptions because of its cheesy 80's legacy. I got the feeling people were resigned to hating this film to make a point, to take a stand, to sound authoritative. Miami Vice is this years best film and like ""Heat"" it knows its subject matter. This is not a bad boys re-tread or even a modernised lethal weapon; this is a super-intense, powerfully gripping drama that is intricate in plot and unprecedented in cinematography. The story is straight forward but then again so was ""Heat"". What makes both films so exceptional is Mann's deep understanding and expertise of police procedure and his attention to detail towards law enforcement and moral malaise. One was the definitive cops and robbers film. This for me is the definitive undercover film. What makes it so gripping is it's relentless pull. The murky underbelly of Miami and south-American crime are so well captured. In many scenes you can almost breathe the moistness that engulfs the night air. It suffocates you and doesn't let you come up for air until the closing credits. A number of scenes stand out for me and which make this a breed apart. Firstly, the meeting with Yero and the sale crockett and tubbs pitch him in his undercover south American hideaway. The second pulsating scene is the one in the trailer park. And lastly the climax where you could smell the smoke radiating from bullet fire. In between you have a solid plot development set against a beautifully studied backdrop. The only complaint i had was the hurried relationship between Farrell and Gong Li. I did find it slightly implausible but there is only so many minutes in a film and not everything can be perfectly timed and executed. On the whole though, this was a superior film to anything i have seen this year. Highly, highly recommended. Grade: A",Miami Vice
891,Hit_it_BA,Miam Sh**e,3,15 August 2006,"I think its best to be blunt here. I did not like this film at all; for a number of reasons.1. The Make Up of the Film - The film was at least 2/3 dialogue with the larger portion of the minority being reserved for sex scenes and action a distant 3rd place. For me this was a major downfall, I like dialogue but I think that an extra 10-15 minutes instead (not that much considering the film was nearly 150mins long) would have helped keep the audience engaged.2. The Dialogue - Making up the majority of the film I expected good writing that would lead to a coherent plot. I got neither. When the actors are given lines like ""Probability's like gravity... you can't negotiate with gravity"" I can't believe they managed to deliver them with a straight face. There is also a short monologue during one of the action scenes (I'll hold off other details for fear of spoiling it) that I think should only be confined to B-movies.3. The Plot - For me this seemed to be a never ending labyrinth of minor twists and unfathomable subplots that really didn't contribute to the overall storyline at all. I'll admit it didn't keep my attention like other Mann films (Collateral is a personal favourite) and because of this I have held off on giving this film a 1, presuming that perhaps had I payed a little more attention there may have been another layer I could've tapped into (that said I'm not holding my breath).In short the film was bad, not truly dreadful but I had descended in to laughter at its flaws by the end. I can't place it in contrast to the series (being one of IMDb's younger users) but I didn't like it and I doubt many others will have it lined up for movie of the year either.",Miami Vice
892,jamielouise1,Disappointed,2,27 August 2015,"I was seriously disappointed in this movie given the talent lineup! The interaction / conversations between the characters really lacked luster. It seemed like no one memorized their lines and conversations were painfully boring. Very limited action, you would expect that Miami Vice would encounter more! I love a good action flick but I had to struggle to keep myself awake for this one. Michael Mann has such talent but this one really didn't meet up to the standard that he's more than capable of. I went in with certain expectations but was very very disappointed, being an avid flick watcher. I believe the best trick is for people to not have any expectations, that way you're not let down.",Miami Vice
893,AlfieMundes,Miami Vice is a mature movie.,10,18 August 2006,"I went to see Miami Vice, and I liked it. I like the style Mann uses to begin the film. No title-reel, just beginning with the movie. I mean, everybody who visits the movie knows the name, and the players. So, why always begin with the title-reel. I liked that hoppin' in to the scene.Visually it's good. Nice to see. Love those car-driving-night-shots Collateral-style. And the story is good. But the thing is though, the film is just too short for the story. Where Mann wants to go, what he wants to show, the thin line between being an undercover and being a criminal, hasn't emotionally not brought to the fullest. But the result of the equation of this movie is a big positive. Miami Vice is a mature movie. For real grown ups, who like to be entertained on their level.",Miami Vice
894,webontheweb75,Not the MV I was expecting..,6,28 August 2006,"I thought the movie was slick and stylish, yet Mann gave absolutely no nods towards one of the biggest t.v shows of all time, aside from the characters having the same names and residing in Miami.Where was the boat? The alligator? The ex-wife? The kid? Where was Miami? The scenes shot there could have pretty much been anywhere on the coastline of the States. Mann reportedly said a few years back that Miami isn't an interesting place to him anymore. Well he made that quite apparent with his new version of Miami Vice.I, against popular opinion, actually thought he made a good choice in Farell. I don't really like the guy but he seems to be convincing in most of his roles, and who's better to play a party hard, rough around the edges renegade than a party hard, rough around the edges, erm, renegade.. ahem. But as it's been stated over and over, Farell and Foxx had no chemistry whatsoever. They barely even looked at each other. In fact, Foxx's role could have pretty much been played as well by most African American actors, given the amount of screen time the guy had.I came out of the movie feeling like I wanted to hit a club, drink mojito's and pick up a model. Which I did, almost.Miami Vice was a slick cop story with a shaky plot and cool visuals. But if you're looking for any references to the series then forget it, aside from a crap cover version of In The Air tonight thrown on during the end credits (originally sung by Phil Collins in the series pilot).What was great about the series was the style, the attitude, the music. The film got one out of three of those right.",Miami Vice

Yes the story may be a bit simpler and we might have seen similar stuff before. But in terms of presenting some of the coolest characters and the most slick filming, in my book Miami Vice is still 9 years after at the very top. Opening scene, plane ride, Cuba trip and boat run still gets me googling for the clothes they wear, makes me consider salsa lessons and makes me wonder why i do not own a cool speedboat. What can i say. in terms of getting ""true universal cool"" right this movie is in my book as good as it gets",Miami Vice
896,nathan-224,Lol,1,16 August 2006,"This has to be the comedy smash hit of the summer! Okay First off, I love Michael Mann his movies are great... usually. What happened? No idea, maybe Michael was on crack when he wrote the script or something. I went to see this with five friends and we were all laughing the whole way through. The whole ""Go-Fast Boats"" gag literally seemed like it was supposed to be funny, but it wasn't. ""How fast does that boat go?"" ""It goes very fast."" I nearly died at that part. Colin Farell's attempt to have serious voicer throughout the whole movie made him sound comical as well. Michael also seems to have joined Tony Scott in thinking that making everything over exposed and hand-held with random zooms makes it look edgy, when really it just makes it look like a toddler was shooting the damn thing. I think I laughed the hardest when the Miami cop randomly had a jet plane to fly around in for no reason. Or maybe when he was accessing the internet from a freighter. The dialogue was horrible, stylistically it was idiotic and it had no consistency with reality. ""remember I said time is luck."" ""yeah.."" Lol man. Lol.",Miami Vice

898,azazelnyc,A New World For Miami Vice,10,11 August 2006,"Rating this film for what it is, an action flick, I give this movie a 10.The movie does lack some elements which might be considered standard like no comic relief, but it is essential to leave out these elements for Mann to achieve his vision as to what Miami Vice 2006 should be, a sexy, sleek, intense action movie that in should no way parallel Bad Boys or Lethal Weapon.Every scene which takes place in Miami is 100% Miami. Given, the Miami Beach back-drops you would expect in the T.V. series are absent but that isn't the only part of Miami. The Miami of 2006 is an urban city with four times as many buildings in it's skyline as there were in the 80's.Downtown Miami is sleeker and darker than South Beach and therefore a better fitting back-drop for for the slick, yet dark characters. I applaud Mann for bringing Miami Vice into a new world which is far more interesting than world of it's TV counterpart",Miami Vice
899,procreate-1,Mann what a letdown,1,26 August 2006,"OK, first let me just say that as a loooong time purveyor of IMDb it comes as quite a shock to me that my first post is to badmouth a Michael Mann film.Thief, Heat, The Insider, Manhunter (shoot me if you will, but I believe the most harrowing of the Lambs movies)...Brilliant films, well written, lovingly directed and beautifully engineered. Collateral, well different kettle of fish - I tried to like it but could not get past Tom Cruise, but I was willing to give Mann the benefit of the doubt on that one.Also, I am a massive fan of the Miami Vice series, particularly it's dark film-noir approaches, however Miam Vice the movie simply sucked. I'll start off by saying that I teach film production at University, I have worked in post production on dozens of films, I am a filmmaker & music video producer also, so I do have some credentials. Miami Vice should not have been made! Whoever was responsible for allowing that script to get produced should now be flipping burgers for a living & Michael Mann should be having a good, long look at himself for his role in this mess also.Rules of thumb that have been violated in this movie;1) Don't get too top heavy with dialogue...This point has been raised already, quite eloquently. The dialogue scenes, while by themselves were bad enough, when interspersed with moments of ridiculously engineered action did little to allow us to understand the characters and their relationships.2) Believable & sympathetic lead characters, who are well developed... While I realise that Crockett & Tubbs have already been revealed through the TV show, not many audiences are old enough to have watched the series and there is no excuse for such poor character development. In fact the whole 'set up' of the film did not reveal much about the characters, the world the film operated within or the dramatic thrust of the story. Honestly I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters or whether or not they succeeded in their goals.3) Film structure...This is a little loose but there were soooo many problems with the structure and pacing of this film that this list of points would have gone on for too long. While I believe that Mann may have had the best intentions for Miami Vice there is absolutely no way that the script was anywhere near ready for production. I cannot believe that this film rates a 6.1 here on IMDb, even dedicated Mann fans could not possibly believe that this film rates above a five, so in order to maintain balance I have given this film a '1'.Sorry to be so negative, but Miami Vice was a truly terrible movie moment. Let's hope Heat 2007 fares a little better (or a LOT better).",Miami Vice
900,rowdyknight4,Not Michael Mann's best,4,28 July 2006,"Had a chance to see this last night at Universal Orlando at 12:01. I have been waiting for this for over a year since they started filming the movie down in my hometown of Miami. I had very high hopes coming in being such a HUGE fan of the original series, but I guess like a lot of movies these days, I simply shouldn't do that.The way the film starts off is almost like foreshadowing for the rest of the way. They just jump right into the things and you're not really sure where you've been, or where you're going, or at least what the point is of the ride. The plot or substance is not intriguing at all, in fact its pretty much non-existent. A sad departure from Mann's two previous action gems Collateral and Heat. The chemistry between Farrell and Foxx simply wasn't there and I never was sold on them being ""partners."" The action sequences, especially one near the end of the film, are more graphic than necessary. That is why I loved Heat, which contains one of the best shootouts in movie history. They didn't overdo it in that film like they did here. But of course, about 80% of the crowd started to cheer when someone's head got blown off etc., so I guess they gave the people what they wanted.The one bright spot of the movie, which always is with a Michael Mann directed picture, was the cinematography. Much like many of his previous films, especially Collateral, most of the movie is filmed at night. The way that Mann films things, using High-Def Digital cameras, are first rate and really make it feel like a documentary much of the time. A lot of great cityscapes and wide shots on the water make for beautiful cinematography.Overall, an OK film but not up to Michael Mann standards in my opinion. Much like a lot of movies churning out of Hollywood recklessly, I would say wait six months for the DVD or for it to come on HBO so you can check it out in HD.",Miami Vice
901,MaxMarler,Why?,1,27 July 2006,"Miami vice the movie is a perfect example of today's popular films. What you have these days are producers who spend 2 million dollars on special effects and 20$ and a free case of beer for a scriptwriter. before I start I will let you all know that I did not pay any money whatsoever on this film, I was invited to a screening of it. Before the movie started people were deep in 80's nostalgia dressed in pink shirts and no socks while singing every 80's hits possible. The movie starts in a night club where every mean looking pimp in town is attending. This is where you meet the two most sleazy actors in Hollywood. Collin Farrel and The aspiring musician Jamie foxx. Ever since I saw Alexander, whenever I see Mr. Farrel I cant stop throwing up...I feel bad for my brother Lawrence who was sitting next to me during the 3, 5 minute sex scenes where the mullet bearing lack of an actor Mr. Farrel was painfully trying to further his status of sex symbol. Then you have Jamie Foxx who tries to establish the status of ""Cool Cat'. Ever since ""Ray"" people have thought of Mr. Foxx as a extremely talented musician. Unfourtenetly he is only a talented in the field of acting. I had respect for the guy until he released a C.D. Now back to the movie, when you hire a 20$ script writer you can usually expect a amazingly thin script with an even thinner plot and trust me you got whet you expected. With the amazingly ""original"" story of ""Two guys go undercover and try to infiltrate the ""Big Bad Business"". One guy falls in love with someone on the ""Big Bad"" side which just happens to be married to the ""Big Bad Boss"". Ridiculously realistic gun fights ensue and the good guys win with everyone except the one cop who lost the girl of his life and will be eternally destroyed."" The people who will enjoy this movie are the type of people that will buy 20 movies at Wal Mart for 8.99 each and enjoy every single one of them because they were cheap.

902,Kenobism,A realistic portrayal of 'Vice cops?',3,31 July 2006,"Whoever said that please kill yourself. Using the home video camera feel to make the movie seem raw is tired and extremely overdone cinematography. I have to say I am very disappointed in Michael Mann. I expected more. There was little to no character development (which is odd seeing as how absolutely nothing happens until the end), other than about 15 sex scenes. I don't know why people say this is nothing like the show, it is filled with tired 1980's buddy cop themes like 'help me save the girl' and arguing with the boss and breaking the rules etc. etc. The movie was filled with nothing. Absolutely nothing.The only thing that was well done in this film was the shoot-out sequence at the end of the movie. Very well done, and what you would expect from Michael Mann.This movie is definitely a renter if you have to see it. Even then, wait until you get a free rental coupon or something.*yawn*",Miami Vice
903,Pedroman2,Pure Garbage,1,30 July 2006,"Wow.. this movie was HORRIBLE. This is one of the absolute WORST movies I've ever seen. And thats pretty bad considering I usually go very easy on movies. Its rare that I see a movie I hate. I don't think its possible to write a comment with spoilers on this movie because there is nothing so spoil. Nothing happens! At least nothing important. For anyone who doesn't want to read my rant, I'll sum up this film in two words: LONG and BORING. Did I mention BORING? The biggest problem with this movie is its lack of EVERYTHING: Lack of story, lack of action, lack of personality (on the part of the characters), lack of depth, lack of dialogue, lack of emotion, etc. This movie is as bland as rice and a glass of milk on a paper plate in a snow storm. Seriously! I would of fallen a sleep had I not been so angry and disappointed. I've never looked at my watch more times during a movie.I can't believe some people call this an action movie! What action?! One gun fight and 2 explosions in a 2+ hour movie? You call that action? If you want action, watch 'Mission Impossible 3'... THATS action. 'Miami Vice' is just a bunch of random and seemingly pointless events that lead to NOTHING. A big boring mess. Long stretches of time are spent on things like riding in a car, boat or plane with NO DIALOGUE!!! I'm serious! You just see people sitting there with blank expressions saying nothing! Ridiculous! If I want to watch cars drive by, and people sitting around with blank expressions I'd go to a bus stop. The pace of this film is WAY off. The only reason I didn't walk out 60 minutes into this film was because I was waiting for things to finally pick up. Of course that never happened.The sex scenes were just as bad.. WAY too drawn out. I think after ten minutes of rubbing and touching the audience gets the idea... MOVE ON! But what I hate the most about this movie is the lack of dialogue and communication. People just don't talk in this movie. The characters have NO personality what-so-ever. Everyone is like a freakin robot. I saw more emotion come from Arnold Schwarzenegger as the 'Terminator' than from anymore in this movie. I HATED this movie. Watching grass grow is more entertaining than this piece of trash. Two thumbs WAY DOWN! On more thing: The TV show is WAY better. But thats not saying much.",Miami Vice

Unless you watched and was very familiar with the show, you'd have no idea what was going on. To me, this movie seemed like a 2 hour long episode of the show with new actors and subtle changes to the make-up of the show. Very ""thrown together"" movie that is not worthy of a Michael Mann film. It would have been nice to have the old theme song, Elvis the alligator, Tubb's Caddy, Izzy, pretty much everything that gave the TV show it's character. The action was very good but I'm very disappointed. Plus, Czito died in the show but was in the movie. Come on.",Miami Vice

This was the most UN-engaging movie I have seen in years. I tried again and again to get involved, but it was so bad I just couldn't get into it. The script was laughable, the acting was horrendous, the plot nonexistent and incoherent, Gong Li's English was just awkward, shoddily put together, horrible cinematography, and its overall execution was absolutely deplorable. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Save your time and money because it DRAGS for two and a half droning hours. It's a shame ""Scoop"" was sold out when we went, otherwise I wouldn't be writing this, but I'm happy to serve as a warning to others in this case.",Miami Vice
906,weisguy13,I don't really see what's really wrong with this picture.,9,31 July 2006,"I would like to start by saying that this was a superbly executed film from start to finish. Mr. Mann has proved that even at the age of 63 he can still bring the gripping storytelling that we expect from a writer/director of his caliber. His versatility in this storytelling is what really makes him great. Whether his films are visually stunning (Last of the Mohicans), have deep characterization (Manhunter, Thief), have superb dialog (The Insider), have visceral and believable action (Heat, Collateral)... they all grab the viewer and pull them right into the story. And here, in Miami Vice, Mann pulls us as close as we could get.To those who say it's terrible because it's not like the television series - it never tried to be like the television series, so why are you so disappointed?Say what you will about the film vs. digital debate. Bottom line, the digital cinematography in Miami Vice was integral in the story telling. Some complain that Mann's use of digital media was to ""save money"" or because he was ""lazy."" I disagree. I fell that it was done ""on purpose.""Due to the fact that a vast majority of the film was shot at night, the digital format proved superior. As well as the fact that the grainy-ness gives the picture a more realistic, gritty first person feel - which serves to pull the audience right into the action (or sexual passion). The action sequence at the end of the movie may seem jumbled and clumsy, but again this is exactly what one would experience first hand if cornered in the frenzy of a machine gun fire fight. Your head would be on a swivel constantly trying to stay out of the line of fire.But enough about the cinematography...The actual plot line to some was convoluted and jumpy to some, and I agree to an extent. Early on there did seem to be a few plot holes which made the story hard to follow, but by the end of the movie I was more than satisfied with the plot line that was produced.As far as the acting goes, I felt that both Farrell and Foxx gave taught and believable performances as Crockett and Tubbs, Gong Li gave great sublime depth to her role despite a her difficult accent. The rest of the supporting cast was competent and proved functional in holding Farrell, Foxx and Li firmly in the spotlight, but not to dull to be overshadowed by the lead cast.My only real disappointment with the movie was the audio mix. For as close as the visuals made me feel the audio tracks felt distant and faint, I often felt like I was straining to here some of the dialog. Music choice was adequate, in keeping with the modern, hard-edged feel of the film.Overall I gave the film an 8.5, but because IMDb makes one do round numbers, I rounded it to a nine. An entertaining and engaging story, combined with well-acted, believable characters, and a bold, highly effective visual style make this film a must.",Miami Vice
907,dynamitegelatine,Summer Blockbuster or Summer Bust?,1,29 July 2006,"Filmed sometimes in good quality, more often in COPS quality, the 2 Hour 2 Minute ""Miami Vice"" is a major letdown. The anti-climactic nature if this film makes the thought of another big-budget blockbuster a grievous one. With terrible camera work and equally terrible editing (lacking any transition) the non-existent plot is left unsupported by the flashy cars and pretty colors. The women in this movie play a majority of their roles in bed (or in the backseat of a car) and do an outstanding job delivering flat, muffled dialogue, as do the men. The Sonny - Rico bond is practically irrelevant to the story, and the characters have no background or development. All I can say now is, what a disappointment.",Miami Vice
908,ken-622,No action in the action - no drama in the drama,4,9 December 2006,"Having watched the TV series I had no choice but to come into this movie with some expectations of stereotype. The movie offers little or no introduction to set the characters in their roles, you're popped right into the middle something. What is that something? My wife and I couldn't tell right away. The dialog..and there is a lot of dialog..ranged from slightly difficult to follow to down right incoherent mumbling. After our third or fourth time of asking each other, ""what did they say?"", we decided it didn't matter because we weren't emotionally attached to the characters.I can get past all of that if there is action! Michael Mann means action, right? ""Heat"" was tense and edgy with explosive bouts of action. ""Collateral"" kept you wondering what was next. This one gave you plenty of opportunity for popcorn runs. What action there is was completely unsupported by the other media of the film. What was with the score? The TV show music popped! Play that kind of tune but show a guy walking down the street and you know he's one bad dude. In the movie, you get fast boats flying down the water but accompanied to music something akin to the Train scene in ""Risky Business"". It was the least dramatic drama and one of the most dull ""action-flicks"" I've ever watched. The characters were hollow and the love-scenes mechanical. Where was the chemistry? You don't have to fly off a building to have action but still..no action to be found.In the director's defense, I'm hoping that most of the movie ended up on the cutting room floor and when we get around to seeing a ""Director's Cut"" we'll get a movie that's more of what we expect from Mann.Bottomline? There are movies that I won't see again but I'm glad I saw. While I won't say this was a waste of time, I'm sure glad I saw it at discount rates. Without re-working, I'll not feel the need to watch it again.",Miami Vice
909,jdportp,What Were They Doing Here?,2,28 July 2006,"I must seriously differ with the acclaim some other users have given this trite film, for I have no idea what those behind it were trying to accomplish.First off, the film is a huge cliché. Okay, vice cops go undercover to see how these sophisticated drug dealers blew their department's cover. Brilliant! After the typical romance between cop and crook--with some surprisingly lifeless sex scenes--the cops' gals get kidnapped. In the final shootout, all the bad guys die, one good guy gets shot--but it's not life-threatening--and to close it off, Tubbs' woman wakes up from the coma and squeezes his hand, bringing back memories of Rocky II, 27 freakin' years ago!My next complaint is the pathetic Political Correctness of the film. Aryan Nation's drug dealers? Yeah, we have them all over Miami! Whatever the Aryan Nations may be, they are still strictly a social/political group. That would be like making the NAACP some big-time organized crime unit.Finally, the director couldn't figure out what to do with the action. At first, he shakes the camera so that we become so dizzy we can't see how pathetic his action directing is. Then, at the end, he puts us behind the shooters so we believe we're right there in the chaos. This isn't to mention how Sonny can fight off a girl and shoot a guy in the head twice at the same time.What can I say? Standard thin-scripted cop movie with the Miami Vice label on it.",Miami Vice
910,ericmcarter,A film for a small audience,9,28 July 2006,"Michael Mann has reached the pinnacle of his craft with Miami Vice; a stylized, gritty, and violent piece of film noir. However, only a small percentage of those who see this film will truly appreciate how Mann intended the film to be seen. This masterpiece does not spoon feed you. There is no character development, no story backdrop, just a 2 hr visceral ride that is smart, beautiful, and emotionally charged. The movie doesn't slow down for you to process... not even for a second. Not to sound pretentious, but it almost seems that every shot is a painting or mosaic for Mann. Some viewers may be frustrated at the lack of dialogue in some scenes and may even qualify it as ""bad acting"", but it is the emotions expressed and body language that really help you identify with and define these characters; and it's what also separates Mann from other directors. I have never seen another film like this and I actually found myself smiling throughout because I realized how far and few in between movies like this come along.A comment on the use of the High Definition camera... some people might be a little frustrated with the grainy, low budget feel to some of the scenes in Miami Vice. I would offer that it provides a certain degree of authenticity to the look and feel of the film.

911,Scoobii,whoosh! Was that the plot?,1,14 November 2006,"I can't believe i sat through that until the end. It starts as if it's half way through the scene without any type of intro. Farrel and Fox either filmed with a throat infection or other ailment as they had me checking the speakers or defects, only to find the defects were on the screen. Literally had to rewind certain parts numerous times just to hear what was spoken, and then it was a guess. Good thing there wasn't a plot or i might have missed something important.The premise is that a white supremacist group have killed FBI agents and have an FBI mole. Crockett & Tubbs are assigned to find the mole as they are unknowns. They spend the rest of the movie making love in the shower, boating to Cuba, dancing the Tango and moonlighting as drug couriers. Basically, everything apart from looking for the mole or identifying the assassins.

912,songbe,Don't Expect Bad Boys,9,30 July 2006,"This is one feast for the eyes. Based on a hit cop series by the same name from the 80's, this movie depicts Miami in all it's visual glory, while displaying some of the most taut and realistic action sequences I've seen since Collateral. The gunshots are loud and jarring, while the music completely absorbs the viewer. There are even scenes when you can see blood splatter on the camera lens, and though this may seem like an amateur's mishap, Mann's technique speaks veteran. Mann also loves using his HD-digital cameras to make his night shots grainy and unrefined. Though some may complain that these camera techniques can disturb suspension of belief, Mann uses them in such a way that brings in a sense of realism absent from most action films. Also, Mann doesn't cater to the ""slow"" audience here. You'll here a lot of jargon, fast-paced cop talk, and if you're not focused, you'll find yourself lost real quick. He lets his picture speak, backing the talk with explicit action sequences. Many people come out of the theater confused and complaining, but that's because they're expecting a spoon-fed meal like SWAT or Mr. and Mrs. Smith. This one has some depth and rawness, and just like the real thing, it demands a bit from the audience.

But off cause it is hard, or almost impossible, to find a actor like Edward James Olmos in the same caliber.Barry Shabaka Henley as Lt. Martin Castillo, was more like a tired hound dog. A little bit of more realism, have been sneaking into this movie version of Miami Vice. Because there are two chiefs (well, actually FBI Agent Fujima is not Tubbs & Crockett's 2nd boss. But FBI have to be placed in the movie, because of the crime is on a larger scale(since it is a movie version)).And the new Tubbs & Crockett have now some backup help, from other police-officers/detectives. But anyway, I just miss some things from the TV-series, in order to call this movie ""Miami Vice"". To be hard, the only things the movie, had in comment with the series, was the names of the two policemen Crockett & Tubbs, a colored and a white guy, and the set was in Miami. You could be cynical, and say ""well, isn't that Miami Vice was about?"". I'll say no, because Don Johnson & Philip Michael Thomas as Crockett & Tubbs could act both cool, and other times with great charm and a smile on their face. Miami Vice (1984) had both great action, and some funny lines, when Crockett & Tubbs ping-pong'ed to each other. In the new movie, Colin Farrel & Jamie Foxx as Tubbs & Crockett, is all about ""bling-bling"" and acting cool. So there no charm, or ""tongue in cheek"", no atmosphere as in the 1984 version. Colin Farrel is overacting, and trying to have a very deep masculine voice, as a bad-ass police-detective.The love-scenes of Colin Farrel & Jamie Foxx, with their lovers, are very long, and you get the feeling, that the producer had put in there, just to spice the movie up, and get the movie a bit longer. I have to admit Naomie Harris have a killer body and some great tits. But the scenes was a bit out of place, and a bit dull. I had just seen the great trailer before I saw the movie, and the trailer was yelling ""action action"" with rushing speedboats and the cool track Linkin Park ""Numb"" (Miami Vice version) in the background.It's not a very bad movie, nether a very great. But I just had wish, they (the movie makers) had been more true to the original. Only two cops/detectives, not four. More action. More funny lines. Only one boss, not two bosses (FBI agent Fujima is, as I said, actually not Tubbs & Crockett's 2nd boss. But it just feel sometimes he is, because FBI is also on this mission/investigation) I miss the atmosphere, and the teamwork from Tubbs & Crockett, as it was in 1984. I don't expect everything copy-pasted from the TV-series. That would be too corny. It's okay with Linkin Park's ""numb"", instead of Jan Hammer. That would a little too much retro. In fact, Linkin Park's ""Numb"" is a perfect choice for a modern Miami Vice version. I gave it a 5'er. A middle movie. Perhaps it deserves a 6'er, for the filming (nice camera shots, and locations).But maybe I got a evil, because I had very high expectations for this one, after the high energized trailer.",Miami Vice
916,charbuwood,Review from someone who never watched the original series,1,31 July 2006,"I went to the drive-in to see this movie, on one screen there was Monster House and Click, on the other Miami Vice and You, Me and Dupree. So both the first movies start, I'm there for MV so I try to watch it. The movie starts in the middle of nowhere like if there was 30 minutes missing (and you wouldn't want this movie to last 30 more minutes) in a disco. You then see a guy in a car going fast, then two other guys in a car chasing the first one, they talk, sex scene, music, blah blah blah, music, car/boat scene, sex scene, repeat for 2 hours.This movie doesn't develop the characters at all so if you've never seen the original series you just don't understand what's going on. There's no background story, and it was never clear for me what was going on. I managed to understand that they were undercover agents and that there was some drug somewhere but that's about it.This movie was completely mediocre and an excuse for showing nice boats and nice cars and doing the promotion of some music groups (because that's pretty much what this movie is all about and also some sex scenes somewhere in the middle). I ended up changing channel and listening to Monste House and Click until the other movie started.I would never recommend this movie to anyone, I watch a lot of movies and this one is one of about the tens that I must have started watching and never finished.",Miami Vice
917,xx_j5,Kick ass Movie,10,29 July 2006,"Michael Mann Is at the top of his game in this movie. It's mood draws you in instantly and never lets go. This is material that Mann is intimately familiar with, that comfort with this kind of story lets him go crazy with the cinematography. This is a beautiful film, every shot in the film has this stamp of artistry on it. Good story and strong performances from all involved. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx have a very natural chemistry that makes you believe that they are partners who have been working the seamy dark undercover world for a long time. Gong Li is arrestingly beautiful as always but her performance is what truly stands out. I loved this movie, when violence occurs and rest assured it does, it is sudden and shocking.",Miami Vice
918,bethjustin518,"movies are subjective, but Vice is an adult drama not a cop shoot em up.",9,10 August 2006,"It was a unique take on common story. It was a middlebrow summer movie. If you like Bad Boys 2, you won't like this movie. things don't blow up every 15 minutes and there's no packaged, linear plot line for the masses to enjoy, that's why it a box office failure. They don;t make many good movies anymore do to amount of money movies cost, films must be marketed to teenagers and have chart topping soundtrack. Miami vice is like a documentary compare to bad boys 2 and other films of that genre. It doesn't have the scope of Heat but it is a taut 2 hour drama. The violence has meaning and brutality not the cartoonish violence of the Lethal weapon movies.",Miami Vice
919,CrimsonJupiter,Surprisingly slow and beautiful movie,8,1 September 2006,"I can imagine why many people didn't like the movie. I guess they expected fast pacing action, but this is a very slow and beautifully shot movie. The story is surprisingly romantic and there is a continuous feeling of sadness throughout every scene. I loved that.I also loved the characters. I think the cast was great and opposed to what many people here say i didn't notice any missing chemistry between the two leads. And while you can rightfully moan about some plot holes and stupid decisions of the characters, this movie felt very mature to me. Maybe that's another reason why many trolls ... err i mean people didn't like it ...",Miami Vice
920,ampaintco,Kept waiting for the movie to start!,1,28 July 2006,"I was really disappointed with this Mann entry to the Movie screen!I kept waiting for some action, and while I was waiting; something brite, witty, or something to keep me interested! But NO! About 3/4 of the way thru this waste of time and $$, finally a good action scene w/ a crook getting it in a new way, and then finally came the end action scene that was a payoff, of sorts, but what happened to script and story and characters I care about? And the action? They were no where to be found in this dull, droll, so called action movie! 2 more weeks then to DVD which I'll be ignoring completely! PS. Only laugh in this is when the aforementioned crook gets it!",Miami Vice
921,jordanthegoober,very very very unimpressed,1,29 July 2006,"This was probably one of the worst movies I've seen. The plot would have made an action packed episode of a TV show, but stretching it to make a 2 hour plus movie killed it. The empty spots were filled not with character development, or suspense, or anything of substance, but with action shots of boats and cars, and with sex scenes that lacked interest or steam. If you're going to blatantly use sex to fill holes in your film and attract viewers, at least make them GOOD sex scenes. I actually left the theater during the last several scenes, because I was so sick of them. And I fell asleep, which I can honestly say I have never done before in any movie. It was horrible, not even worth renting. Sorry.",Miami Vice
922,godless-4,Another good movie from Mr Mann...but is it Miami Vice?,7,3 December 2006,"I have one main issue with this movie. I can't relate with the main cast as ""Sonny"" and ""Tubbs"". Don't get me wrong, Colin and Jamie do a good job, but I fail to see them as the Miami dynamic duo. Actually, I fail to see this as a Miami Vice movie at all. It could be just another Mann movie, really. Something is lacking to make it relate with the original series.That put aside, the movie has that Mann's ""urban quality"" splashed all over it, and of course if you're a fan of that shooting style/photography, you can't go wrong here. This does bear Mr Mann's seal.Certain aspects of the plot can be confusing though and sometimes you get the impression plot twists happened a bit too fast. Is this done on purpose to mimic the TV compact one hour episode style? You'll be the judge.In addition to the plot being a bit short and rough, I still don't feel that chemistry between the cast is paying off, and Sonny's ""intimate scenes"" seem fabricated; No kissing? Hardly any? It all seems very forced instead of effortless.Regardless of all that, this movie still delivers. You get the action, the nice boats/cars/jets, the guns, the decent acting for the job, the attention to details, the works. All in all, I see it as another Mann movie that is enjoyable and will make you eager to see what happens next, but, the movie IS called Miami Vice. That, I disagree with.My score is a 7. It's a good Michael Mann movie and it delivers fast action, but in my opinion it's not Miami Vice as promised, so the score can't go higher.Maybe my brains are too used to the original cast? Still. An enjoyable movie.",Miami Vice
923,kiteman001,"Pretty to look at, but boring.",1,20 January 2007,"This is the first DVD I have given up on half way through.Since the film is three times as long as the original episodes, you'd expect there to be three times the action, three times the plot. Instead, they've stretched a fairly basic story far too thinly.There are some basic similarities to the original TV series - fast boats, fast cars and egos that barely fit into a wide-shot. Even the clothes and haircuts date back to the eighties, but the acting is wooden. The actors' voices are hard to hear generally, with the leading female character being particularly hard to understand, making the plot line a peculiar mix of confusing jumps in a fairly clichéd set of scenes (the blown bust, the brazen-it-out confrontation with the dealers).There's no denying this film is very pretty, lots of absolutely glorious camera-work, but it's wasted on stuff like way-over-long establishing shots. Edit them out, losing about 30 minutes, and maybe the plot would hold the attention. As it stands, I don't know how the film ends and I don't really care. I've wasted the price of the rental.If you're still dithering, I'd advise digging out some tapes of the original, it's a much more satisfying watch.",Miami Vice
924,aliblincow,"Too long, vague and boring",3,27 August 2006,"I went into the movie not knowing what to expect at all - although i was hoping that the combination of Colin Farrel and Jamie Fox would boost the entertainment but i was quite wrong...Firstly, the plot was too vague, you wouldn't know what was happening nor why it was happening, the characters would blurt out something that no one can understand and somehow ends up meaning they travel half way round the globe to pick some special seaweed or something. Second, it was too long and dragged out - i ended up wanting to leave within the second hour.The acting wasn't terribly great - i thought that Farrel and Fox made a good team but the audience never really gets attached to any of the characters throughout the movie. Also, there is way to much talking - for a film where you have guns in pretty much every scene its hard to believe that there are so few action scenes and these scenes weren't that good either.Personally i thought the camera work was awful - the majority of it was presented in a very sloppy and jerky fashion which may have been intended but i certainly didn't like it - you miss a lot of the action in fight scenes and the sex scenes were extremely toned down. Also, the music throughout the movie was particularly bad and didn't quite seem to fit in with most scenes.Overall it was just a movie - something which people will see just because there is nothing else on and this looked like something worth watching. I would recommend watching this on video rather than at the big screen.",Miami Vice
925,svenjanssen,wow,10,27 August 2006,"From the first second till the last, I enjoyed this movie. People told me it wasn't that big a deal. I suggest to look at it, listen to the music and feel with the characters. If you're able to do that, you'll see a very impressive movie, if you don't then it's not to blame this picture, only to blame yourself. If you are into this kind of picture, then you shouldn't have seen it at all.I was completely 'with it' and I had a very good time. Even Colin Farrell was good, and I'm anything but a fan. Jamie Foxx as always was very good and I also liked the Asian girl in the picture. And then what about the scene with the speedboot trip to Havana?",Miami Vice
926,sstorti27,"Saw movie on Tuesday, after further review???",9,28 July 2006,"I was lucky enough to land Sneak preview tickets for this movie, Since I was a huge fan of the TV show, I have been very excited about seeing this.I did have some concerns about the movie, It jumped right into the story, which was strange, no theme music, which i was slightly disappointed about, at times I would say it was hard to understand what the actors were saying, various scene's where I was wondering what was just said.If it was my call, I probably would have lessend the love scenes a little, but i do understand that it helped to provide closer at the movies end. It wasn't non-stop action like I thought, I was very similar to heat, good Dialouge excellent story, some very intense action scenes.Neither Farell nor Fox, tried to steal the film both actors and all the actors I thought did a great job.Some excellent scenic shots, along with your classic mann , music which really was excellent, especially the music that comes on at the end near , track 5 on the soundtrack, very intense, very throwback! My local Film Critic gave it a 5, and I can see where he's coming from, but I don't believe it was that bad, you have to remember the TV show was not all action, it was story, characters , enviorment, and yes I was a bit disappointed that the movie didn't highlight the ""South Beach"" glitter and glare, but that's not the plot of this film.I'm telling you you will walk out of the film with a feeling of I'm not sure what I think, but the day after you will think about it more and more, it was a darn good movie, and the soundtrack is very very good.All in all I say thank you Michael Mann, for giving us another glimpse of 2 of our favorite characters from the early 80's, it was worth it! Oh and by the way it was left wide open for a sequel!",Miami Vice
927,G_Unit-2,A big disappointment...,5,1 August 2006,"Michael Mann is a good director. He showed it with Heat & Collateral. In Miami Vice, we find Mann's style (the editing, the cinematography, etc), like in Collateral. but even if the movie is almost 2h30 long, we don't get into it.... After an half-hour, the movie becomes boring and don't really goes somewhere. Also, we don't feel the chemistry between Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell, and the characters are really poorly developed.The movie started well. It begins in a club, where we start to get into the film's plot. The plot itself is not bad; the idea is great, but Michael Mann is not able to build a captivating story, where we are pushed into the detectives' world. That Was I expected for Miami Vice: a breathtaking full-of-action thriller. Instead, we're getting a not well developed movie, and too long with no great content. Sorry Michael Mann, You could have do something really nice with this material. You didn't succeed.3 out of 10.",Miami Vice

They are supported in their efforts by Trudy, Gina, and two other Miami Police Detectives. If you are looking for the TV show, watch re-runs on Cable. The names are the same, the music is there, the drugs are the focus, the cars and the boats are there, and Miami is the backdrop. Once I accepted the fact that this was indeed different, I sat back and enjoyed the movie. I especially liked the performance of Gong Li who plays a business woman with the drug kingpins. Colin Farrell did a decent job as Sonny. He portrayed the intensity of the character very well. Jamie Foxx was somewhat of a disappointment. He did not capture the suave character of Ricardo Tubbs. He was not a bad character, just not the cool,debonair character from the TV show. The ending left me saying ""what was that"".",Miami Vice
929,guy-large,Like watching someone playing the best looking video game - still dull as hell!,2,13 July 2007,"Lets get something straight here - I'm a massive Foxx fan, I'm a super-massive Mann fan, and on paper Miami Vice sounded like a sure bet.But even the opening 5 minutes are disjointed and slightly unclear, and as you start to hope the film 'finds its feet', you soon realise that you're spending the entire film hoping for this to happen, and it never does.Miami Vice. The television series. What worked? Most importantly would be Chemistry between the leads - believable interactions, you know!. Like in Bad Boys or Lethal Weapon. Not the best films, but highly enjoyable and with fizzing and enticing chemistry between the leads. Farrell and Foxx play characters with barely enough personality to make it through lunch, never mind interact with each other. There is not one joke between them, and neither one even smiles for the whole film?! Take away Foxx's character, and the Farrell's character would have acted the same, there was simply no reason for the both of them!The plot is your standard (and I mean standard) drug-deal-to-trap-big-dealers-with-dull-love-interest-side-story. Its well shot, sure, and it looks great, sure. But like I said in the title - you can watch someone play the greatest game on earth, and you'll be bored out of your mind and checking your watch!In summary: 1. Lots of people feel obliged to like this film because the adverts looked so cool and its all 'slick' and 'classy' looking itself. Thats why this film is rated above 5.2. Absolutely soulless acting, Colin Farrell putting on a gruff voice for 2hrs and Jamie Foxx looking seriously at everything for a very large pay cheque.You know how there's bad films, like "" Its so corny! That was gross! killed time nicely though!"" Well thats most films - Jurrasic Park 2, Anyhting with Will Ferrell, etcWell then there are films like Miami Vice which are so devoid of warmth, chemistry, characters you can relate to, tension -the biggest problem is that when you can't relate to any of the characters because they are so shallow or miserable, you really can't enjoy a film, period.Not entertaining-bad but heartless-and-boring-bad! When a 'big film' has you squirming and looking around at the other numbed cinema-goers, it's a bad film.

After reading a few comments I was very hesitant to watch the movie but I did anyways; and I am glad I did! I was not expecting MV, just a cops movie and that it delivered. Much better than any Steven Segal/Chuck Norris stuff. The extremely low scores 1-3 are probably disappointed people. If you are expecting to see a re-run of Miami Vice this movie is not for you. I seldom watch a IMDb movie with less than a 7 average rating but in this one the ratings are off. Some people believe the movie is too long, does not have enough action, I disagree with that. It is slower than a TV series but there is a good reason for it. The photography, directing and acting are OK.",Miami Vice
931,cullenward,This movie was terrible,1,7 December 2006,"I had heard this movie was bad, but rented it anyways. I wasn't expecting anything really good, so at best I was hoping for a mediocre to decent movie, and at worst a playfully stupid movie that would offer some mindless fun.What I got, was neither. The characters were not likable, the villains really did not generate any feelings of ill-will, in fact I felt pretty damn emotionless about all the characters. Their motivations really made no sense.There seemed to be things missing from the plot, as well as the believability of the world as the movie had created was seriously lacking.The movie felt far too long, and it seemed that important elements were cut to make way for unnecessary scenes or extended scenes that really did nothing to drive the plot or character relationships forward.Whenever someone says a movie is the worst movie ever, they can probably usually find at least one thing they liked about the movie or at least one memorable thing. However, with this movie I could not find a single memorable or redeemable thing about the movie. In fact, the entire 140 minutes of this movie is basically a blackout in my memory.While not the worst movie I have ever seen (some that come to mind are Vegas In Space and Invasion of the Blood Farmers), it ranks up there if only because it left me feeling emotionless during its duration.",Miami Vice
932,RuiBK,A reinvention of the series and a great Michael Mann film,7,20 August 2006,"Since the beginning Mann said that this movie would have very few likenesses with the series,and he must have predicted that some hardcore fans would go after him,and that's what I see now.This movie although is not at the level of Colateral and Heat is a god movie.In a scale from 0 to 10 I would give it a 7 , 7,5 in comparison to Colateral and Heat to which I give a ten.Since the beginning this movie success was compromissed,because it had a very strong point of comparison(the original series,although in terms of cinema as art,Miami vice 2006 is way better then the original).The TV show haunts the movie.And I think that this movie doesn't deserve that. It has good acting,good storyline(although while seeing the movie I felt that some parts where rushed),few but extremely good firefights or shootouts,incredible visual(after being a pioneer with digital,Mann brings hi-definition to the game).Plus,this movie is realistic.It shows how the world is :everything but perfect.It shows how low can human beings go to make money.It shows how powerful criminals have become. Although it is a blockbuster we get out of the thinking about not only Sonny and Isabella,and Rico and Trudie but also how screwed up our world is.I will be waiting for the next Miami Vice.Long live the vice!",Miami Vice

935,tommase,Miami Vice delivers exactly what was promised,8,30 July 2006,"When compared to previous Micheal Mann films such as Heat and Collateral, Miami Vice doesn't seem like much. With those two previous works, Mann had a strong grip on a well developed story and amazingly deep characters. Take the Tom Cruise character of Vincent in Collateral, for example. Mann had such a deep understanding of that character and the city surrounding him, that he transported us inside that taxi cab and had us hanging on every word that was being said. The film was just as much an introspective character study as it was an action thrill-ride. In Heat, we found Pacino and DeNiro creating a portrait of two men whose lives are their careers, both men seeing no way out for himself. While these two find themselves at opposite ends of the spectrum, at odds with each other, they share a mutual respect, both seeing a bit of himself in the other. It is in those two films that we can find Mann mastering both the action, and his characters and their respective stories. So the big question is raised with Miami Vice, is this film as much of a masterpiece as those two films were? The answer is, no. However, Vice does NOT disappoint, and delivers just about everything one could expect from a film of this sort.What it lacks for in character depth and story insights, it makes up for largely with style, some kick ass action sequences, a well rounded cops-vs-drug lords plot, and some surprisingly effective relationships between our two heroes and their respective lady-friends. With the Colin Farrell character Sonny Crockett, we see him become subjected to the pressures of getting involved too deeply with undercover work, falling for the lady drug-lord Isabella. The relationship provides a great set of circumstances for Crockett, as it is a relationship he knows that can have no future. He deals with the consequences later. His partner, Ricardo Tubbs (played amazingly well by Jamie Foxx), is dealing with his own set of personal problems, as he learns the hard way about how having a romantic relationship with a fellow female officer can also provide its hardships. The film only goes so deep as to show us sacrifice and consequence. It doesn't provide us any more insights into the characters or the story than that, and the raw emotional energy and explosive dialogue from Mann's previous films is somewhat missing here.Where the film really plays its cards is in the style. This is one of the best looking films I've seen all year. The cinematography is handled much the same way as it was with Collateral, using digital techniques that provide a gritty layer of ""real world"" texture. It has a real look to it, almost as if you're there in it. Some may want to argue that it has that ""amatuer film student"" look to it, but its the very opposite. We see some breathtaking shots of cityscapes and vistas, the lighting of these shots totally reminds you of something you'd see with your own two eyes. Imagine driving down the expressway at night, then stopping and pulling over to the curb, getting out of your car and looking out over the sparkling city...whatever you have pictured in your head is most likely there on the screen for you to see. This film just looks so freakin' cool.The action sequences are also a real treat. In fact, the final action sequence is enough to bring back memories of the stunning bank robbery shootout in the middle act of Heat. Only here, Mann is using his newer camera techniques, so as I said before, it puts you right there in it. The story manages to build a suitable amount of tension between the two main characters and the ""evil drug lords"" right from the get-go. Its not poetry in motion, mind you, but it does an excellent job of setting us up for those really great shootouts. Just as the trailers promise, you get lots of sweet looking scenes with expensive cars, hot women, and slick looking club sequences. The film does its own thing, and not once was I reminded of the TV show. It embodies everything that the TV show was (the basic concept), but stands apart as a serious crime drama. Colin Farrell brings his own swagger and charisma to the role of Sonny, and you can quite picture Don Johnson in your mind while watching Farrell on the screen. Jamie Foxx really delivers with this one, he never misses a step here.In a summer that has turned out one disappointing movie after another, Miami Vice hits the nail on the head, delivering exactly what it promises. It doesn't reach the masterpiece status of some of Mann's other films, but that's forgivable seeings how those movies are really hard to top. However, its not hard at all to top mostly everything thats come out this year, and Miami Vice tops nearly all of it!",Miami Vice

I am so tired of people depicting films as horrible simply because they have no understanding of their conventions. Too long have I screamed in agony over all the ranting idiots out there who want to know where ""Miami was?"", or ""Where's the boat, Where's Elvis, Where's Sonny's wife and kids, Where are those characters?"" They're back in the 80's where they belong!! This is ""change"" folks, get with it. Stop consuming yourself with the conventions of the past and how good something was, and start thinking about how good something could be! God forbid that there is such an inventive filmmaker out there that understands this, and realizes that modern conventions must change in order to prevent the end of something. I mean, come on people. Gee, a serious action film with heart, that would just be too wrong. No one-liners right before someone gets blown away at the end of a climactic gun-battle? Really? That's too bad. Or characters actually deciding things based on emotions instead of some two-bit idea that was concocted over the weekend on Microsoft Word? This is real folks, real-life, where our lives and fate are determined through our emotions, not answers. Did you ever wonder why you were engulfed in such a passionate sub-plot than a main-plot? It's because that's what's real. Our lives are nothing more than one gargantuan sub-plot, to an ever... growing... story, where Emotion plays the character. ""There's no character in this film."" There's so much character it's bursting. The entire time I watched the Unrated Director's Version, I sat in awe with a humongous smile on my face of understanding. In one scene I almost shed a tear; I know that's probably hard to believe, but I was consumed. And I have never felt the kind of love one has for another in this film since Titanic. But, having said that, I find that I'm at the point now where I understand this film so much that it's hard to describe it since no one would understand me.... Look, maybe it's so hard to describe the understanding of film because it's so much like philosophy: it's individual, and it happens differently for everyone, that's why you can't teach it in school... too many questions with so few answers. But I would like to say something to those of you reading this: please, please... watch films for what they are, not for what you want them to be. Let go of past loves and desires, and concentrate on the new and exciting. Believe me, you will be rewarded. Alas, I must bid you farewell. Michael Mann, you have made a masterpiece, and you have put magic back into movies for me, and I thank you. Bravo sir, Bravo.",Miami Vice
938,hardboiledwonderland,Why is this film called Miami Vice anyway?,3,23 January 2007,"Silly question, you might think, but that was the first thing that came into my mind when I saw it. I have to admit that I can't remember the series in particular, but I do remember the flavor and atmosphere it had, which was different from what you could see on TV in the 80's. But all what is left from this in Michael Mann's version from 2006 are fast cars, exotic places and beautiful women. Ingredients you see in nearly every film which deals with drug dealers or undercover agents nowadays. In fact Miami Vice 2006 looks more like a new version of James Bond to me. The same ingredients, only that the Martini is now a Mojito. Same thing, no depth and no real characters. To revitalize Sonny and Tubbs seems to be more a strategy then an idea, as the plot is not much convincing and the action a poor imitation of Collateral and of course Mann's masterpiece Heat. Disappointing!",Miami Vice
939,miesha607,This movie is very good,7,1 December 2006,"Let me begin by saying i do not understand how ""Superman Returns"" gets a better average that ""Miami Vice""?I know that this movie was slow and the violence is not typical Hollywood shoot, shoot , bang , bang. This movie does have great scenes and camera shots and above all , this movie is a great (i repeat, great) buddy flick. There is an unspoken friendship that comes along with their job between sonny and rico. If you watched the series (which i did not because of age) then i believe that the companionship is carried over without having to explain. Micheal mann does his thing and i know that most people do not research the directors before they see a movie but the people who read this do, so please wipe your slate clean and see the movie on DVD with no prejudgement.",Miami Vice
940,turron2001,This was a different show!! -- spoilers!!,3,22 January 2007,"Even when the movie was shot really nicely, the result is far from what i expected. While trying to create a dark atmosphere, the movie becomes so slow paced that it just makes you think if it was really based on the show. There were no speed boat chases, no shooting showdowns that would make you jump of your seat, or anything. I think corruption, in this Miami was not enough. Also the part where Farrell becomes involved with the Chinese woman, when they go over to Cuba, have mojitos... makes you think you are watching a whole different movie (maybe you where watching Hot Habana Nights of something like that). I swear that i was waiting for something to happen, the only thing that kept me awake was the fact that we began to make jokes and betting who would get killed or shot first.... (i won!).Well , that's all i've got, hope that if anyone gets to read this, may find it useful or just share the point of view.",Miami Vice
941,Ztyle,an one time movie,3,21 January 2007,"Miami Vice (2006) is a one time view. the plot line is OK, great actors and a selling title, this should be a smash hit, but only 3 out of 10 from me. I not sure where it went wrong, but in my opinion there are way to many love scenes, and it feels like it is thrown in, course the are completely unnecessary for the plot line, I believe they should have used the time to let the audience connect to the main characters instead, course I personally feel that we need to know who they are, so it shows that it's independent of the TV-series. further more the music in the film does'n connect with what is going on, and I feel it is missing a theme melody, that is worked around for various situations.There are rumors of a sequel, and if that is true, I sincerely hope that Mr. Mann is using the actors skills, and hire some one to make the music true to the film.",Miami Vice
942,kickjim93,"A dark mix of insight and portrayal with an intrudging, deep storyline",8,27 July 2006,"Giving realistic insight combined with Michael Mann's deep unique vision and elements which in terms inspires great emotions portrays real life situations without losing it's fictional foundation. It's almost like a documentary at times, or like the ""cops"" TV series. It makes you want to go undercover, you really feel the emotions of Crocket and Tubbs, thanks to great acting among other things, and it's enjoyable to watch. It does get a little frustrating trying to keep up with the complex story and screenplay written by Mann himself. I love the dark essence in films, especially Manning's, the criminal undergrounds, Cuban cocaine lords and the sick nature of humanity for instance. Also very worth noting, the hybrid beginning and the spiritual end.",Miami Vice
943,patlazz,So far?...By far best movie of summer,10,28 July 2006,This movie by far is the best movie of the summer. This isn't a teenage movie. Gritty dark with real people. Michael Mann is one of the top three filmmakers today. The shoot outs in the film are top notch far and away better then the PG-13 ho-hum cute shoot outs you get. Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell are at the top of there game. Once the movie opens you are dropped into the mood of the flick and never get out. The bad reviews the movie has been getting is because it is not a cheesy and I mean cheesy movie i.e. Startsky and Hutch or that dip shoot Charlie's Angel's waste of film. Many reviews don't review the movie for what it is and what it is not. Pastel shirts and eighties music. This is not the eighties. It is 2006 and the best action director working today has made one of his best films. This isn't a cute little summer movie which I call no calorie movies you watch it and forget as soon as you go home. Miami Vice is a movie I walked out of ready to talk about for hours. Get to the movie quick.,Miami Vice
944,joshagate,What was up with all the awful one liners,3,9 August 2006,"I don't want to fully comment on the movie because I wasn't entirely paying attention throughout the movie, but why were there so many awful one liners? I also want to state, I am post Miami vice era, but still, the terrible one liners were just unacceptable.I think my favorite of the entire movie was: ""Well my mommy and daddy know me..."", but a definite close runner up was ""Hola Chica"", which if I recall was the second or third scene in a row in which the female character in the movie gets it on.Come on now, how low quality is that. I don't care if this form holds true to the original series, you cut stuff like that out because it is an obvious sign of a terrible movie.",Miami Vice
945,djgame_2000,"A very ""Miami Vice"" film",9,14 September 2006,"If anyone could made a movie about Miami Vice, the final result would be exactly how this movie is. Because it have the Miami Vice spirit: a mix of glam, hard, reality, fantasy, sex, drugs, action, investigations, etc. You have to be a fan of the series to like this movie and I am that fan. I found it very entertained, I like it so much. Before seeing the movie I was frustrated because I read so many bad comments that I started to think its going to be another bad story based on a classic TV show. But I liked so much I want to see it again. The characters are OK, but Castillo is so much different, I don't like him. The story could be a little more better but is enough to me :)",Miami Vice
946,rickhwt,horrible!,1,4 August 2006,"oh my ever-lovin' God.... that was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I can't believe I sat through it. silly plot. no suspense. characters I couldn't care whether they lived or died.. I mean, aren't we supposed to care about somebody? the only thing I had invested in the movie was the $40 for popcorn and getting in. even the love scenes were comical.. and what was the whole white supremest part? what a goofy component. they try and build up the bad guys as having overwhelming force, technology and intelligence, ..in one scene there appear to be dozens of heavily armed reinforcements.. and then they supposedly trust the main hostage to 2 guys, a inbred old lady, and a kid?? what little action there was could not make up for the bad writing. don't waste your time or money. stay away. warn your friends.",Miami Vice
947,sian-39,Rubbish,1,7 September 2006,"I was just falling asleep during the film, then machine guns came out and gave me a headache, this scene then lasts for about 10 minutes and when watching you have no idea what is actually happening and who is winning and which characters are dying and who are still alive and basically its crap! Also throughout the film Jamie's Beard changes length even though the film is set in a short space of time and from shot to shot this length changes, how difficult is it to get it to be the same length. His earing also appeared and disappeared, but this was not as annoying. The only good thing about this film is that you see Jamie Foxx's bum!!! FIT!!!! LOVE IT!!!!! So I'd advice use the fast forward button in this film, unless you want to put yourself through torture and really want to kill yourself after watching it!!",Miami Vice
948,FlimFlamFilmMan,Michael Mann is a master of Mise en Scene,10,31 July 2006,"This film is one of the best realistically portrayed crime sagas. The first scene has you just dropped in the middle of a plot like no other film beginning. I actually thought that the projectionist had started the wrong reel first! The shootout scenes sounded like I was at a military shooting range. Kudos to the sound editing team. Mann's production team have the original recipe for a perfectly realistic portrayed cops and robbers shootout. No other director can top Mann's expertise. Just think of this, like Scorsese is to gangster films, Frankenheimer is to car chases, Mann is to shootouts. Camera filming was ultra realistic like documentary style continuous dialog's minimal editing scenes. Mann has a knack for his perfect casting of dead on unhollywood glamorized bad guys. His extras were all everyday people in this movie, gritty year worn faces, acne, scars bumps, dark circles etc. In air flight shots were amazing. Mann loves using Chris Cornell music montages that work well with his film flavor. This movie had the ultra flavor of Mann. Crockett and Tubbs were hard vice veterans that never lost their composure and were on top of the bad guys from square one. They never were out of step. I was disappointed in Jan Hammer's absence, the film still had sounds of what Mann wanted from him. I was listening for the Miami Vice theme and Crockett's theme but I kind of knew I was going to be disappointed with the two decade difference.I would really like to see more Vice films made. Mann really had my applause for his use of composition, staging, movement, design, costumes and of course lighting as a expressive narrative and stylistic tool. See this movie, I will, many more times, like how I wore out Heat on VHS and the 3 releases on DVD.",Miami Vice
949,madhatter7772103,Two undercover cops try to bring down a drug dealer that ended up killing another undercover cop.,3,7 August 2006,"Now I had anticipated for Miami Vice since I first saw the trailer and couldn't wait for the day it came out. The scenes containing fast pace music fast cars and catchy dialog had me captivated,but unfortunately good advertising was all this film had to offer. The Trailers Played this movie off like a XXX deal but was nothing of the sort. With in the first hour there was little to no action and a lot of the shots I felt where cut off too soon leaving much to be desired. For example in the beginning one undercover Cop( I'm assuming that what he was as it was never clearly stated) jumps in front of a truck and all you see is a 20 seconds shot of streak of blood on the pavement and then it jumps to the next thing.This choppiness works in some films but not this one as it made the plot unclear and hard to fallow,causing boredom and frustrating to this viewer.To top it off there wasn't even enough action to compensate for the lack of clarity in the script. Maybe the film got better as it went on but I wouldn't know because this was the first film I had ever walked out of. Simpley because I felt as if I was waiting for the movie to even start. Miami Vice has a bad script and doesn't have the action needed to bring it all together. It's good idea with the wrong direction save your money wait for this one to come out on TV.",Miami Vice
950,jephtwist,The evolution of Mann...,9,5 August 2006,"Pre-viewing it was the same old story of mediocre reviews, comparisons and general moaning from the 'audience', who have become so absorbed by the past, they fail to recognise a progression.Post-viewing it was the same old story of mediocre reviews, comparisons and general moaning from the 'audience' who, have become so absorbed by the past, they fail to recognise a progression.Mann has created a fascinating expose of undercover police life. The choice to put the viewer at a distance instills a nervous, voyeuristic atmosphere that continues throughout the film. It is an intelligent and bold approach. The relationship between Tubbs and Crockett is not vocal, but one of inbuilt economy and mental trust. They are as one. This is almost a revelation for what the masses expect from a 'cop' film. They are serious and professional beyond reason. Think Joe Carnaghans 2003 'Narc' (without the corruption) and you are close. Style wise this is a beautiful, digital mash. For the intense detail of the action scenes the juxtaposition of the landscapes and transition shots are breathtakingly serene. Mann should bottle his style and never let anyone near it. He is king of his format. This really needs to be seen to be fully appreciated, the plot is not as tight as it could be, the amount of characters are sometimes confusing but this only adds to the nervous atmosphere created by the distance we feel from these 'characters'. There is no real back-story, no real character development. There does not need to be, they are so in tune with their existence, ruthless, efficient and refreshingly human (as shown in some nice cut away scenes which wouldn't look out of place in a French New Wave film). The premise is an immersion into these two guys life as detectives. Mann's 'Heat' showed us Pacino as Vincent Hanna, he eats sleeps and shits his job. It is a way of life. This is similar to Tubbs and Crockett, but interestingly they have more similarities to DeNiro's character in so much as their attitude and delivery.The small fractures in this film cannot take away from the brilliance.",Miami Vice
951,willcannon,Another Brilliant Michael Mann Film,8,1 March 2009,"I just had to say something regarding the idiotic comment posted here. This is not just another remake of a 1980s TV show. For starters, Mann produced the original series himself. As for the film's divergence from the TV series, please quit your whining. Thank God for the absence of Jan Hamer and Don Johnson's pastel wardrobe. However, the strands of plot woven by the film are clearly apparent in season one of the TV series. We know how the film will play out, but Mann dazzles the audience with stunning visuals and a well-executed crescendo - not to mention his trademark verisimilitude. Summing up this film as ""stylish"" but vapid is missing the boat entirely.",Miami Vice
952,aladrummond,Fragmented action at best,6,10 August 2006,"First off the award for best movie short for 2006 would have to goto Miami vice, the movie, the images, the grit and the hair!!! This was the single reason I was so excited to see this film.To say the least I was very disappointed. From the moment the movie starts you begin asking questions and even at the conclusion of the film these questions are still left unresolved.Throughout the movie u are aware of Michael Mann attempts to showcase the same old film in a brand new way. Dark gritty characters, clean crisp suits and very very nice rids are show cased amongst some of the darkest corners in the world, at the heart of the drug world. Unfortunately what Michael Mann set out to do, leaves the audience wondering not only what is going on, but why is it going on.The Saddest part of all is that Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell were completely wasted in their roles as their characters never evolved nor did we ever learn to love them. Instead character development was sacrificed for an attempt at originality.Bad boys showed what a combination of drugs a list actors and lots of money and explosions can look like when executed correctly, unfortunately Mann's ego ensured that even with the right ingredients this film would result in a failure.",Miami Vice
953,grant-allan,What a load of rubbish,1,28 July 2006,"I won't be placing any spoilers in this review as I didn't hang around to see the end.I thought the plot was muddied. The early scenes were hard to follow and the acting was clichéd to say the least. The pace of the movie rumbled from staggering to inane from there on.For me, the lingering love scenes were probably the lowest points of the films - do I really need to see Jamie Foxx/Colin Farrel simulating sex? Is it adding anything to the film? Was it even remotely sexy? Had the film been given a different title, I might have liked it a little better. I don't really see the point of a remake if it bears no similarity - whatsoever - to the original. Oh, sorry - they drove a Ferrari!",Miami Vice
954,Mierhnam,Not what i expected,8,15 September 2006,"I didn't have High expectations on this film, in fact I wasn't keen on watching this movie at all, I generally don't like Collin Farrell and the same goes for Jamie Foxx. But as soon as the film started I was stuck from beginning to end. As other users mentioned I liked the gritty feel to it as well as the way the camera's were placed, as if it was a reality show, were the viewer was placed behind the characters. What made me not so keen on this film was i thought this was going to be a bad boy clone and nothing more (ala gunfights galore and explosions left and right). I was mildly glad it was either. The film was made fairly well and characters were defined well also, but i think they could have expanded Ricardo's role more. The violence may kinda have been over the top, but it was done well and fit the story. Overall its a good film, if you expect as gunslinging action movie stay away from this but if you like realistic, gritty, action and suspense movies this is the film for you.",Miami Vice
955,bluetorch03,If Miami Vice was on TV today,10,25 September 2006,"This is what it would be like. If you don't like this movie, you are probably from the UK. This movie had the music, the action, and drama of the TV show, I thought it was everything I could have hoped for. If you loved the show, you have to see this. It was raw and had a lot of depth which nay sayers put off as boring. If you thought the film was boring, you have the personality and IQ of seaweed. Don't talk bad about my Miami Vice. The sound of the boats and the Ferrari is worth the price of admission. The setting was vibrant and seemed to be an updated version of the 80s shows. And as always, Mann's shootouts are almost too realistic. Trust me, I know what full auto gun fire sounds like when it is coming your way! If you are from anywhere but the UK, see this movie. Brits are just mad they didn't come up with the idea first.",Miami Vice

I've seen some bad movies, but this one come's in a close second for worst movie i've ever seen (right next to baby geniuses). I don't know what happened with Michael Mann with this. Heat was great. I loved Colateral. But I think the writer never watched the movie because it was so cliché and boring. The dialog is fake and inconsistent with the plot. It has Colin Ferral. Jamie Foxx has 4 lines. People pop out of nowhere. Jamie foxx can fly a plane, drive a Ferrari, maneuver a boat, and work a crane. 2 action sequences and 37 sex scenes. Oh, and it has Colin Ferral.Colin had more sex than magic Johnsen in Miami Vice. Colin has a horribly grown Molest-stash. Colin had the fake voice of that weird guy in little Nicky. (You know, the one that's in all of the Adam Sandler movies. Colin Ferral had the ugliest mullet on the face of the earth. People just mutter words. They had a 300lb 50 year old detective with coke bottle glasses go tactical in a rescue for 6 seconds and then scout for snipers.The only thing good about this movie was the sound the gun's made. It was pretty realistic.Don't SEE THIS MOVIE. If you must, go and get trashed and make fun of how dirty Colin Ferral is.",Miami Vice
957,chris_lafave,Another top-notch film from Michael Mann,10,31 July 2006,"I saw it regardless of reviews because I love Mr. Mann's movies. He's one of the very best at evoking a mood through the use of color and music. His movies don't just show you the action; they take you there and make you feel it because they're so realistic. Whether or not it was faithful to the TV series wasn't important to me; it could stand on its own and still be a ten. The action and imagery were bad-ass, of course. The gunfire was impressive, as usual. His film, Heat, my all-time favorite, is known for the audio realism of the downtown-L.A. shootout and Miami Vice cranks it up a notch with some even scarier firepower.",Miami Vice
958,shanes_17,When's the sequel?,8,15 December 2006,"That's the first thing I thought after seeing this. Although it did lack more references to ""Miami"", I think it was still an excellent film. It really didn't need to be called 'Miami Vice' to get a good nod, in fact; it may have done better just being its own animal. Farrell and Fox are great, and I think the chemistry was there but just hard to see. Reason I believe your blind to it is because that's how it is suppose to be for their respective roles in the film. When going undercover they are acting as business partners more than buddies, so it wouldn't make a lot of sense for them to be bonding and playing grab ace on film cause most the time they are under surveillance by the criminals. Which leads me to the next part of the movie I loved.It keeps you constantly on edge, wondering 'when' the cover was going to be blown and what the repercussions would be. The criminals in the movie where played well, and really got under your skin, which made it more enjoyable to watch. The plot was clever I think, it wasn't too complex but it also wasn't a run of the mill ""watch the good guys go after the bad guys"" film. Your never really sure who is about to do what, which made it interesting and fun to watch. Someone else mentioned the visuals being great through out the movie and I couldn't agree more, they had some great shots.",Miami Vice

I have never fallen asleep in a movie or walked out...until now.At the 1 1/2 hour point I raised up my hands and thought if I have another hour to go, I'm out of here.Mann has too many yes men around him or something, because this bloated, overly stylized piece of trash strays so far away from the original material that it seems to be wanting to create a new identity. But why not just make an original film? Why use a brand name? Easy, because this way Mann can use it as a selling point, because after people realize they got a bait-and-switch, it's too late.Shame on you Mr. Mann.

I'd recommend this film to most as it does everything you would want from a film with a great original to follow in my opinion very few films managed it so far.Trust me this film ain't as bad as most people have been saying they must have been brought up on the original so if you've got an open mind and want to see it just go you won't be disappointed.

If you expect an action movie or a tribute to the old MV series, you'll be very disappointed as I was the first time I saw it.If you watch this movie without preconceived expectations or to see a dark, gritty crime movie, Mann delivers big. The visuals, soundtrack, and editing are spectacular. Foxx and Farrell however are out-acted by their support cast and Gong Li is simply hypnotic. Mann is still the best director in Hollywood. If only he could have named this movie something else and given Foxx and Farrell different names for their characters...",Miami Vice
