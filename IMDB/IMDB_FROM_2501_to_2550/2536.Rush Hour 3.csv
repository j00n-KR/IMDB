0,TheLittleSongbird,Under par,3,4 March 2011,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two Rush Hour movies. They were fun and entertaining, with great stunts and an inspired double act. This sequel is not the worst sequel I have seen, the soundtrack is decent, the locations are striking and while he looks a little bored Jackie Chan at least manages to do something with his role.However, Chris Tucker is very irritating this time around, and the chemistry between the two men isn't as strong. Also, the editing isn't as efficient and the stunts and fights aren't as well choreographed and feel rather tired. The pace is both rushed and laborious, the characters are barely credible either being clichéd or underdeveloped and the film is too long. Rush Hour 3 is further disadvantaged by a weak script, a predictable story and plodding direction, while the support actors fare little better.Overall, rather weak and under-par. It isn't Chan's worst, not like The Medallion, but compared to two very enjoyable films it is a big disappointment. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Rush Hour 3
1,Leofwine_draca,Formulaic fun,5,12 September 2011,"Another year, another instalment in the RUSH HOUR series. For what it's worth, RUSH HOUR 3 isn't so bad. For a film with a sub-par script and lacklustre director, it could and should be a lot worse, but I found something amiable about it. Sure, the comedy's dumb and the story groans with cliché after cliché, but there's something hard to dislike in this, and that's Jackie Chan.Another positive, although it doesn't sound like it, may be that they play to formula. The paper-thin plotting sees Tucker and Chan dispatched to Paris, to track down various criminals. Along the way there's plenty of 'fish out of water' culture humour and more excruciating laughs from the ultimate wannabe, Chris Tucker, although it may just be me but he seems to have toned things down a little here.Chan, of course, is great and the only reason for me to watch. The good news is that the film gives him plenty of action scenes, with mucho prop breakage along the way. The final and extended climax atop the Eiffel Tower allows Chan to pay ultimate homage to his silent film hero, Harold Lloyd, in scenes directly inspired by SAFETY LAST! Chan's acting has improved and his fighting hasn't declined, so all in all it's a good film for the star.Hiroyuki Sanada, one of my favourite action stars of all time (check out his early films, made under the mentorship of Sonny Chiba), is cast opposite Chan as the bad guy. Sanada, typically excellent, immediately raises the quality of his scenes and his climatic swordfight with Chan is the highlight. Elsewhere, the laughs are dumb and the story even dumber, but that matters little when Jackie's on form.",Rush Hour 3
2,SnoopyStyle,The team is back and it's the same old same old,6,25 January 2014,Carter (Chris Tucker) is reduced to a beat cop after many mistakes. Lee (Jackie Chan) is in the States guarding Ambassador Han. The friends team up after an attempt on Han's life. The assassin is Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) who has a mysterious past with Lee.It has moments of fun with Tucker. It has moments of stunt action with Jackie Chan. It has enough gun play and explosions. The story is almost unimportant. Director Brett Ratner returns for the third time bringing back the team. The movie starts to get weird when they go to France. I don't know if it's the water. It's just very odd to see Roman Polanski pop up. And this goes into an alternate universe when Jackie Chan starts singing. The movie is a series of action scenes and Tucker joking around. You get exactly what you expect.,Rush Hour 3
3,lee_eisenberg,"really funny, although it'll be fine if they end it here",7,17 June 2008,"More of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan teaming up to solve a crime, and their personalities bounce off of each other. In this case, they go to Paris to investigate a criminal syndicate known as the Triad. But ""Rush Hour 3"" naturally has as its purpose to show a bunch of completely silly things, and it delivers. There's a skit done like ""Who's On First?"", a profanity-laden English-French interpretation, and stuff about the strained relations between the US and Europe. As for what Tucker does in the theater...I might have done that! All in all, this is the sort of flick only intended to appeal to limited group of people. I liked it. Also starring Max Von Sydow, Tzi Ma, Dana Ivey, Philip Baker Hall and Roman Polanski (I wonder how Tucker and Chan felt being on the set with the guy who directed ""Repulsion"", ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Chinatown"" and ""The Pianist"", and married a woman who got murdered by the Manson family, and later had sex with an underage girl).",Rush Hour 3
4,jboothmillard,Rush Hour 3,4,31 August 2007,"The first film is the best, the second is good fun, and I was looking to a third film completing the trilogy, but this was a bit of a disappointment, from director Brett Ratner (The Family Man, Red Dragon, After the Sunset, X-Man: The Last Stand). The story sees Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma) shot in an attempted assassination, and Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) and Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) are assigned to find out who did it, and promise the ambassador's daughter Soo Yung (Jingchu Zhang) they will get the criminals. Their search for the triads lead them to journey to Paris, France, and many chase sequences happen as the continue their search for the main villain, Lee's evil brother Kenji (Ring's Hiroyuki Sanada). During this, Soo Young is kidnapped and held hostage, they find Genevieve (Noémie Lenoir) who holds secrets to many triad leaders names, and the final battle on the Eiffle Tower. Also starring Youki Kudoh as Dragon Lady, Max Von Sydow as Varden Reynard, Yvan Attal as George and film director Roman Polanski as Detective Revi. There are some giggly gags, good chase sequences, and the still quite fun mismatched partnership, but there are not enough big scale stunts, and some jokes, particularly from Tucker and his loud-mouth are wearing thin, however not an absolutely terrible martial arts action comedy. Okay!",Rush Hour 3
5,paul_haakonsen,"Good, but not all that good...",6,16 December 2020,"The third movie in the ""Rush Hour"" franchise, ""Rush Hour 3"" from 2007 is in my opinion the weakest of the three movies. Now, don't get me wrong here, I am not saying that it is a bad movie or anything, but in comparison to the 1998 ""Rush Hour"" and 2001 ""Rush Hour 2"" then this 2007 movie just falls slightly short.So why is that? Well, simply put, it was the storyline, as it felt sort of half-hearted. The in-your-face spirit from the previous two movies was severely toned down here in ""Rush Hour 3"" and that was very noticeably.It was good to see Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker to partner up together again for the third movie. And I do thoroughly enjoy their on-screen chemistry, as one compliments the other. And ""Rush Hour 3"" also have the likes of Max von Sydow, Hiroyuki Sanada and Tzi Ma on the cast list. It was definitely a blast to see Yvan Attal in the movie.""Rush Hour 3"" is packed with lots of action and comedy, just as the previous two movies, but it just lacked that special ingredient. And the storyline just didn't fully deliver. It was set up for something grand with the Triads, but the Triads just never really fully showed up, much less actually feel like they were all that big a part of the movie, though being such a big part of the plot and storyline.While it is still good entertainment and an enjoyable movie, it just didn't manage to land on the top shelf along with its predecessors.My rating of director Brett Ratner's 2007 movie lands on a six out of ten stars.",Rush Hour 3

7,hitchcockthelegend,Lee I got a big problem man this guys on steroids! His head is as big as Barry Bonds!,7,13 June 2013,"Ah look, as you have most likely heard by now, this is not as good as the first two films and it's just a little bit tired in formula. However, it's still a bunch of fun if you already buy into the fastest mouth/fastest hands pairing of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. The plot is incidental, thus simple, and the emphasis here is more on fun than electrifying action. Though the finale here is edge of the seat exciting and laugh inducing in equal measure. There's some truly good one liners thrown out and the chemistry between the two actors is still very much evident.Undemanding it is for sure, even disposable if it was to be judged as a single action/comedy entry, but it closes the trilogy down safe enough and the smile should rarely leave your face upon viewing. 6.5/10",Rush Hour 3
8,Scarecrow-88,Rush Hour 3,5,18 January 2009,"Flimsy, by-the-numbers plot(..about the cops getting tangled up with a criminal organization known as the Triads in Paris)is just an excuse to re-team director Brett Ratner and stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. Inspector Lee(Jackie Chan)watches as Ambassador Han(Tzi Ma)is shot by a sniper, a man he's assigned to protect. Able to finally track him down, Lee is startled to find that the shooter was in fact a ""brother"" from his childhood, Kenji(Hiroyuki Sanada), a prestigious member of the dangerous gang known as The Triads who wish to find the document which reveals the secret members of their organization. This document, which was in Han's possession has been stolen back from a French beauty named Genevieve(Noémie Lenoir), a popular fashion model in Paris, and Lee and Carter(Chris Tucker), currently a traffic cop for bumbling up several cases, plan to find her before Kenji does. It is only inevitable that Lee and Kenji will meet again, after the inspector, unable to relinquish love for his brother, isn't able to arrest/shoot him. Both fish out of water will hit the streets of Paris, attempting to find and protect Genevieve while also evading the Triads who will not stop until they retrieve what is theirs. Also in danger is Han's daughter Soo Yung(Jingchu Zhang), quite a bargaining chip for the Triads if they could kidnap her.The film's plot is basically a series of comedic bits strung together with martial arts stunt sequences. Chan seems as flexible as ever, although, I'm certain he must depend on a stunt double at times..there's just so much punishment a body can absorb for someone in their mid 50's. The film depends heavily on the chemistry of the leads(..and their clashes in culture which bring out the best comedy, specifically when both are in another country) and the breathtaking action sequences, which feature Chan in a magnificent sword fight with Hiroyuki Sanada on the Eiffel Tower while Tucker engages in a martial arts brawl with Kenji's goons, and an all too brief encounter between Chan and ""Dragon Lady""(Youki Kudoh)in a hotel room.Stunning supporting cast compliments the film such as Roman Polanski as Paris Detective Revi(..with a funny interrogation gag who even gets punched out by the duo at the end!), Dana Ivey as a nun who understands French and gives information during an interrogation to find out about a contact vital to the case, Max Von Sydow as Reynard, leader of the World Councel who may not be who he seems, and Philip Baker Hall as beleaguered(..with Tucker's hapless Carter) LAPD Captain. Yvan Attal has a very amusing role as a French cabbie who helps Carter and Lee during a thrilling car chase, and wishes to join forces with them to stop the Triads. My personal favorite sequence occurs in a training facility where Lee and Carter find themselves in an unpleasant fight with a giant, only saved by the blind master Yu(..the names of Yu and Mi are playfully poked fun at during an inspired interrogation with Carter)..many will relate back to Game of Death between Bruce Lee and Kareem Abdul-Jabar.",Rush Hour 3
9,zardoz-13,Nothing Worth Rushing Out To See!!!,5,14 August 2007,"The third time around isn't the charm for New Line Cinema's action comedy ""Rush Hour"" franchise.The Los Angles Police Department has demoted Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker of ""The Fifth Element"") to uniform status as a traffic cop. Of course, ultra-cool Carter has his own way of directing traffic to his favorite pop tunes until motorists misread his signals, collide with each other and grid-lock occurs.Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Chief Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan of ""New Police Story"") accompanies Chinese Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma of ""Rush Hour"") to L.A. as his personal bodyguard. ""Rush Hour"" fans will remember that Han relied on Lee's help in the first ""Rush Hour."" No sooner has Han taken the podium at the World Criminal Court than an assassin wounds him. Han, it seems, was about to reveal a top secret list of Triad family leaders to members of the World Criminal Court. The Triads, the largest criminal organization in Asia, have always served as the bogymen of the ""Rush Hour"" movies.While the paramedics attend to Han, Lee chases the assassin into rush hour traffic. Carter spots Lee hoofing it through the streets and commandeers a sports car from a couple of babes. Together, Carter and Lee corner the assassin in an alley. Not only does Lee do a lousy job of shielding Ambassador Han, but he also lets the killer Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada of ""The Last Samurai"") escape during a back alley stand-off. Neither one can shoot the other, so where's the conflict? It seems that Kenji and Lee grew up in the same orphanage. Lee has a soft spot for his old friend who has taken a different path in the world.Later, our resourceful heroes corner a second-string villain in the hospital where doctors are treating Han. The Asian killer only speaks French. Lee and Carter persuade a middle-aged Catholic nun to act as their translator. Naturally, foul-mouthed Chris Tucker has to censor his own language before he can ask the nun to translate it, with lines like ""You tell this piece of S-word that I will personally F-word him up!"" Indeed, the profanity has been imaginatively hyphenated, and Tucker's hysterical delivery makes it sound hilarious. Tucker's best scene is his masquerade in a French night club as a costume designer who decides to dress the dancers according to their corresponding hair color. At the same time, Jackie Chan gets to duck knives and mountaineer about on the Eiffel tower, but neither qualifies as hair-raising scenes. Watch the Jackie Chan movie ""New Police Story"" if you want to see Chan perform some truly extraordinary stunts.Basically, ""Rush Hour 3"" (** out of ****) doesn't top 2001's ""Rush Hour 2"" for a number of reasons. Indeed, ""Rush 2"" still remains Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker's finest hour. They proved that their kinetic comic chemistry in the original ""Rush Hour"" was no fluke.First, ""Rush Hour 2"" topped 1998's ""Rush Hour."" Sadly, ""Rush Hour 3"" isn't even as entertaining as ""Rush Hour."" Moreover, ""Rush Hour 2"" cemented a surefire formula that New Line Cinema apparently chose to ignore; namely, let Jackie Chan demonstrate his martial arts wizardry and let Chris Tucker do his screaming, ghetto caricature of Eddie Murphy.Second, don't delay another sequel for six years! Although the plot covers less than a week, spontaneity is sadly missing from ""Rush Hour 3."" Jackie Chan doesn't stage any new marital arts routines, and stunt coordinator Conrad Palmisano stages fight scenes that will make you yawn rather than flinch.Third, Chris Tucker is given more flat jokes than funny ones. The African-American comedian does the best that he can with some pretty lame material. However, this time neither Tucker no Chan bicker with about racism. Unlike the early ""Rush Hour"" movies, they are both fish-out-of-water here when the intrigue takes them from Los Angeles to Paris, France. Legendary Oscar winning director Roman Polanski has a walk-on role as an unsavory Parisian police chief. The French police intercept our heroes before they leave the airport, and Polanski snaps on his rubber gloves to make sure that they aren't hiding anything.Fourth, nothing about ""Rush Hour"" director Brett Ratner's recent success with the third ""X-Men"" movie seems to have rubbed off onto ""Rush Hour 3,"" except for the running time. Ratner deserves some credit for bringing ""Rush 3"" in at brisk 87-minutes. This action comedy doesn't wear out its welcome, primarily thanks to its charismatic leads. Unfortunately, the good jokes are fewer and farther between for the third outing. The comic chemistry between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker hasn't diminished an iota. Tucker reminds Chan the he's his brother from another mother. The amusing ""You & Me"" gag imitates the classic Abbott & Costello ""Who's on First"" routine, but ""Rush Hour 2"" had already used it first.Fifth, ""Rush Hour 2"" scenarist Jeff Nathanson's shoddy screenplay lies at the bottom of ""Rush Hour 3."" Since Nathanson did everything right in ""Rush Hour 2,"" he presumably got sloppy and did just everything wrong in ""Rush Hour 3."" The tension, suspense, and surprises that made ""Rush Hour 2"" clearly superior to ""Rush Hour 3"" are absent in this slipshod second sequel. The babes are neither as sexy nor as lethal. Ratner, who has helmed all three ""Rush Hour"" comedies, puts roughly the same stuff in the same places, right down to the explosions. Nevertheless, Nathanson and he ignored the formula that relies heavily on Chan's unique martial artistry and the basics of any good thriller: a treacherous villain and a demanding objective.Don't rush out to see ""Rush Hour 3.""",Rush Hour 3
10,Calicodreamin,Classic Chan and Tucker,8,24 July 2019,"Rush Hour 3 is an adequate follow up in the franchise. The laughs are there, the classic riffs between Chan and tucker with keep you rolling with laughter. Some of the plot points don't flow well and could have done without. But you can't deny the comedy gold, it'll keep you laughing.",Rush Hour 3
11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"This time, it's personal... and kinda dumb... and really clichéd",5,16 January 2008,"I caught this on a plane, as one of the in-flight movies. This was basically the one that made me feel the least amount of strong repulsion, of all the available choices, so I endured the 90 minutes, with some pretty scattered enjoyment. There are some funny things... the scene in the dojo isn't all bad. Mostly, the humor didn't really work, at least for me, though. Tucker seems to be growing more irritating as time goes on, and his character seems to have gotten somewhat incompetent... in the first film(I haven't seen the second), he was a good cop, unorthodox, and not necessarily popular, but he didn't come off as inept as he did in this. I'm not sure anyone should have to be subjected to the ""singing"" of either lead. The action has its moments, and there is surely plenty of it... even though, as far as recent over-the-top fast-paced action flicks have gone in recent years, since at least the early 2000's, this isn't as ridiculously overwhelming as others. Some of the action clichés, and to a larger extent, clichés in general, are noticeably present. By the time that almost half a dozen instances of characters being endangered by the same basic thing take place in the same scene, in a matter of minutes... well, if you don't already dislike the movie by that point, I suppose you may forgive the film that. A previously seen character returns to the franchise, quite possibly the last one we wanted to see again. The film seems to supply as much sexual content and nudity as they could and still get away with a PG-13 rating, and most, if not all, of it is utterly gratuitous, with the only purpose being to attract heterosexual males, and young ones, at that. The plot is obvious and predictable, and sacrifices any kind of sense for the sake of action or comedy(neither of which are all that strong, for that matter) more often than not. The cinematography and editing break absolutely no conventions, and both have moments that are downright bad. The acting is essentially unimpressive. The film manages to waste both von Sydow and Baker Hall. The characters don't really possess any charm they might once have had. The one attempt the film makes to stir up emotion fails so miserably, it's not even funny... it's almost a parody of scenes like it. This may manage to offend every single race and nationality featured. I guess if you can borrow it from a friend, avoid having to pay, it'll do. I recommend this to fans of the actors, Ratner and/or the franchise. 5/10",Rush Hour 3
12,view_and_review,"Funny, Enjoyable, and Entertaining",7,5 April 2021,"""Rush Hour 3"" features a slightly slower Jackie Chan and a slightly puffy Chris Tucker, but he is just as funny as always. In the last episode of this trilogy we go from L. A. to Paris, France in pursuit of the would-be assassin of Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma).James Carter (Chris Tucker) is no longer a detective for the LAPD. It seems he made one too many mistakes and has been busted down to a traffic cop. He seamlessly morphed right back into detective mode when he saw his old partner Lee (Jackie Chan) pursuing Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada), a Triad gang member and attempted assassin. Their chase took them to France where they'd get into more trouble.RH3 did fall into some uninspired tropes. There was the kidnapped girl for trade, the ultra-good guy trying to save his nemesis, and the old white man (the late Max Von Sydow) as the antagonist behind it all. Casting the cliches aside, RH3 was funny, enjoyable, and entertaining.",Rush Hour 3
13,george.schmidt,Yet another aimless sequel,6,27 August 2007,"RUSH HOUR 3 (2007) ** Chris Tucker, Jackie Chan, Noemie Lenoir, Hiroyuki Sanada, Youki Kudoh, Max von Sydow, Yvan Attal, Jingchu Zhang, Tzi Ma, Roman Polanski, Philip Baker Hall, Dan Ivey. Aimless re-teaming of the odd couple of police detectives motor mouth Tucker and mush-mouthed Chan this time re-united to stop a plot involving Asian assassins. Listlessly unfunny for the most part with Tucker & Chan coming across as an ersatz Hope & Crosby with their globetrotting misnomers and schticky slapstick  even Chan's usual daredevil acrobatics is growing wearisome - directed by Brett Ratner (again for the ride) with all the subtlety of a bull in a China shop.",Rush Hour 3
14,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Rush Hour 3,6,9 August 2007,"Should movies make money, then the Hollywood rule of thumb is to make another, and another, until the franchise runs out of steam. The original Rush Hour was a Jackie Chan vehicle of sorts to break into Hollywood, and it made a lot of money with the mis-pairing opposite Chris Tucker in a buddy cop movie formula filled with action and comedy. Rush Hour 2 was made 3 years later and made even more money, but it took 6 years for the second sequel to be made, and 9 years for the entire trilogy to be done (pray tell, will there be another sequel?)Is the franchise tired? Probably, yet probably not. Face it, it's Jackie Chan, and most of his films (with the exception of missteps such as Around the World in 80 Days) make Hollywood studios smile. You can rely on him to deliver the goods in any action comedy, but age unfortunately has caught up with him, not to mention as well the safer-than-safe minimal risks that studios in the West tend to take with its stars. The action sequences in Rush Hour 3 look a bit tired, tame, and very uninspiring, and what Jackie Chan can probably still do, has been whittled down to sequences that are just a pale shadow of what could have been.Which leaves us with the comedy, thankfully still having its moments especially for those punchlines which deliver. Tucker again gets most of the snarky lines, and a target for those politically incorrect jokes, while dishing some of his own. If there's any hint of rudimentary character development after these years, is that his James Carter, besides having been relegated to traffic duties, managed to ""half-chinese"" himself, and no longer is that helpless cop who without his gun, can't kick a ball for nuts.The plot is no rocket science, and in fact, the previous two movies just had something which could coast along from scene to scene, providing a platform either to get our heroes Lee (Chan) and his brother-from-another-mother James (Tucker) into fisticuffs, or provide something for laughs. The first had a kidnapping of a Chinese Consul's daughter which the duo had to investigate in the US, while the second brought them to Hong Kong on the trail of a counterfeiting scam. The third pits the detectives against Triads, and brings us full circle with the return of that little girl in the original movie, who's now all grown up, played by Chinese starlet Zhang Jingchu.Zhang Jingchu follows in the footsteps of fellow compatriot Zhang Ziyi who starred in the previous sequel. But unlike Ziyi, Jingchu's role is sans martial arts, despite her character being a kungfu instructor. It's unfortunately a purely flower vase role, though she looks more fleshed and healthier than her druggy role in Protégé. Yvan Attal's supporting role as a French cab driver is actually more of a scene stealer - listen out for those jibes at America, though it's a little of a cop out how that eventually plays out. Some of the more totally insane moments involve those deliberate lost in translation moments, which are the more enjoyable moments in this movie.Rush Hour 3 is similar in structure with its predecessors, and it does seem a tad familiar at times in the way the story gets developed, with only a change in locale, now set in Paris. It's basically an attempt to reunite the two stars in order to make another dent in the box office, so though they're back, this movie can't be taken all too seriously. It plays out like a cartoon for adults, though the local distributor decided to edit portions of the French revue scene to obta in a rating that everyone can go to.If anything, stay behind for the outtakes, which triumphs over the main offering, hands down.",Rush Hour 3
15,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Rush Hour 3 was a lot of fun, but it is getting kind of old",6,25 August 2007,"Rush Hour 3, the sequel I've been waiting for, it's been 6 years since our last Rush and I couldn't wait to join Chris and Jackie once again for their awesome comedy and action. I saw Rush Hour 3 a few days ago and I have to say that while I was definitely entertained, this still didn't feel the same as the previous Rush Hour films. It had great comedy, don't get me wrong, Chris Tucker is still so much fun to watch on screen. Jackie adds a little more comedic edge to his role this time; but it seemed like Jackie and Chris are not clicking as well as they used too. It almost seemed like they were meeting for the first time watching them on screen. Not only that, but this movie seemed more rushed and the story wasn't as well developed as the first two Rush Hour films.In the beginning it seems like Lee and Carter are not on good terms, Carter seems to have broken off Lee's relationship to his ex girlfriend, Isabella. After an assassination attempt on China's Ambassador, Lee and Carter are about to face the Triads', China's deadliest gang. They are looking for a list in Paris and Lee and Carter are on the case to find a beautiful woman who might hold the secret. Things get a little more tricky when Lee has to his own brother who is the leader of the Triads'.Rush Hour 3 is all in good fun, standing on it's own, if this was the first Rush Hour, it would have been fine somewhat, but just comparing it to the first two films, this wasn't as good. But that's just my opinion. But I think if you loved the first two Rush Hour films, you should see this, it's still a fun film and has great comedy, there is a little less action, a warning in advance, but it's all good if you are looking for a fun film for the end of the summer.6/10",Rush Hour 3

Here, after an assassination attempt on Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma), Lee and Carter head to Paris to protect a French woman with knowledge of the Triads' secret leaders, where its Chinese criminal mastermind named Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) is revealed to be Lee's long-lost brother.There are some exciting action, but the movie somehow lacks the charm and substance of the first two films. Aside from Chan and Tucker, the cast members weren't very memorable, and the story is boring. Although the actress that plays Yoo-Sung did a good job, I would have liked to see the original actress from the first Rush Hour movie to portray her. And, Ambassador Han's character was not emphasized enough in the movie.If you haven't seen this movie, there is no rush to see it.Grade D-",Rush Hour 3
18,Buddy-51,really only kicks into gear at the end,5,21 August 2007,"Like the two previous installments in the series, ""Rush Hour 3"" is an uneven mixture of low-ball humor and kick-ass action, with the amazingly nimble and athletic Jackie Chan once again playing the karate-chopping straight man to Chris Tucker's wisecracking cynic.In this edition, detectives Carter and Lee go from the mean streets of LA to the cafes and sewers of Paris to find and protect a French woman who possesses information of great value to some sort of secret international organization. Since the plot feels as if it were pretty much hammered out in a late night storyboarding conference, the filmmakers are forced to rely even more heavily on the charisma of the two lead actors than they did before; luckily, Chan and Tucker, intrepid troopers that they are, pretty much deliver what is asked of them in that regard.I wish I could say the same for the screenplay by Jeff Nathanson and the direction by Brett Ratner. For the most part, however, the humor in ""RH3"" is sub standard and derivative - a pale imitation of the classic ""Who's on First?"" comedy routine is particularly unfortunate and embarrassing - and the action sequences are not much better, until, that is, a spectacular fight scene between Chan and Lee's evil brother, played by Hiroyuki Sanada, set high atop the Eiffel Tower that finally brings the movie to life in its closing stretches.For movie historians, the only real element of note here is the presence of legendary director Roman Polanski as an overzealous French inspector, and acting bulwark Max Von Sydow as World Criminal Court Director Varden Reynard. As to the latter, what can one say about a career path that starts off with ""The Seventh Seal,"" then passes through something like ""Rush Hour 3"" on the way to its final destination?

Since the most notable thing about Chan's films are the elaborate fight sequences, this should ruin the movie, but actually I think I like RH3 just a bit better than its predecessors. The story is as contrived as ever, and Tucker still veers wildly from annoying to funny and back again, but over all this movie is the funniest in the series. It's as though they knew without Chan's fancy stunt work they would need to up the humor, and they did. Tucker's annoying to funny ratio is improved, Jackie is still pleasant even if he can't roll around the floor the way he used to, and while the movie is utterly forgettable, I enjoyed it.",Rush Hour 3

It didn't disappoint me per se, I'm glad I saw it but it just further proved how mediocre this series is and by using the exact same formula and not straying from how they made the first two they churned out another average installment. Now Rush Hour I think is a great series because they introduced two minority main characters and that is truly awesome and should be done a lot more!! But the film is made in a way that is completely mindless and incredibly (and in a way mercifully) short. The action is not really full blown typical action and it focuses more on exploiting each one of their races and comedy based on that as well as their personalities. The story line in Rush Hour 3 (as it was in the previous installments) is pretty weak and you don't really care. It just seems like they are looking for an excuse to slap these two characters together in as crazy and exotic an environment as possible.Chris Tucker returns in really the only role he's got going for him. He's done nothing but Rush Hour films for the last ten years and probably doesn't need to do anything else or wants to. His acting range is limited and he's usually loud and obnoxious and annoying although I felt like they utilized him a little better in this one so that he didn't come across quite as overwhelming. Jackie Chan also reprises his role as the more down to earth Inspector Lee. Chan is a much better fit to the action genre and he's more fun to watch. He plays the fish out of water role pretty well and I think he is a talented actor in his own way. He is very hard to understand sometimes but getting past that he has some great lines in the film and doesn't get overshadowed by Tucker's obnoxious performance nearly as much as in previous films. Everyone else around Chan and Tucker are simple and truly just supporting characters if even that. They do have some really interesting talent including a small role by Max von Sydow and an incredibly rare cameo by director Roman Polanski.Somehow the Rush Hour trilogy has generated hundreds of millions of dollars so director Brett Ratner knows his cash cow and he knows not to change what seems to work. So I guess in that way I am in the minority because I think Rush Hour, including the newest Rush Hour 3 is the exact definition of average in every way shape and form. It has some funny moments, there is no doubt about it, and there is some mild action and stunts but even Jackie Chan doesn't really perform his usual myriad of fantastic stunts and crazy moves. If you can't get wild action out of Chan there just isn't any point. Rush Hour 3 is simply mediocre, not bad, not good, just somewhere right up the middle. Watch it, ten minutes later you'll forget all about it but you saw it, case closed. 6/10",Rush Hour 3
22,MLDinTN,Better plot than expected but still the same ole same ole,5,29 June 2008,"Rush Hour 3 follows the exact same formula as the first two films. Policeman Carter teams up with Inspector Lee to solve a big international crime case while Carter has a lot of wise cracks to add. In this film, the plot actually made more sense than I thought it would. But it seems Jackie Chen can not do as many stunts now that he's older. The scenes written for humor were rather silly, as though written by a 10 year old. I mean who stops to sing Kung Fu Fighting after knocking out a bunch of guys with the girl still in peril. The wanna be spy cab driver was about the best thing for the whole film. The nun interpretation scene was good too. The girl who played Genevieve needs to be the next Bond girl. She had a very unique look.FINAL VERDICT: Nothing to rush out and see.",Rush Hour 3
23,g-bodyl,The Best Rush Hour!,9,20 October 2010,"Rush Hour 3 is definitely the best Rush Hour out here to date. I enjoyed the first two but this one I really loved. Everything seemed the same as the first two but for some reason I loved this film. I laughed more than I did in the first two. No matter how old Jackie Chan gets, he is the master of kung fu.This is about the two detectives going to France to get rid of the Triad gang who is giving them problems. But they have to deal with rogue police and a impressive action sequence from the Eiffel Tower.My favorite scenes were anyone of them with the French cabdriver. I liked it when he made the transition from Anti-American to pro-American. It was absolutely hilarious.Overall, this is an improvement over the first two films. I really hope they make a fourth one soon. I rate this film 9/10.",Rush Hour 3

26,tabuno,Average Thriller,6,21 January 2019,"13 August 2007. There isn't as much martial arts fighting in this movie. Perhaps and it appears that Jackie Chan is maturing and growing older. He's more serious in this movie and the chemistry doesn't seem to be there with Chris Tucker whose antics are getting a little tiring. The plot is something we've seen before with the helpless female and the evil doer who is as predicted in past movies. There are some scenes that are fresh but then there's a lot derivative too. The overall concept was good, the execution decent, but not crisp nor as exciting as before. There are crass moments, efforts at comedy that are funny but not hilarious.

27,The-Sarkologist,"As with most sequels, the quality degrades significantly",3,9 November 2013,"I am quite a fan of Jackie Chan movies – when they were made in Hong Kong during what I considered the golden age of Hong Kong cinema. However his Hollywood movies just do not seem to have the same class about them as his Hong Kong movies did. Further, as can be expected with most Hollywood sequels the quality of the films degenerate significantly, and it is no different with this film. It did have its laughs, and with the exception of Chris Rock's character, it wasn't that painful to watch, but it still does not deserve a very high rating.The basic premise is that Jackie Chan is a cop from Hong Kong and Chris Rock is an LA police officer. Chan has returned to America with the Chinese Ambassador for a conference at the world court, but the Triad want to put an end to this, so they attempt, and fail, to assassinate the Chinese ambassador. Thus Chan and Rock team up again (much to Chan's horror) to attempt to locate the head of the triad and bring the criminal organisation to an end. Throughout the film Chan and Rock attempt to come to terms with a rather, unique, friendship. Rock is very keen to be Chan's friend, while Chan (much like myself) finds Rock to be incredibly annoying.While I would recommend that one not really waste one's time with this film, I still don't feel too comfortable in revealing too much of the plot, namely because there is not all that much depth in the plot to discuss, so, without further adieu, I'll finish the review.",Rush Hour 3

30,TheMovieDiorama,Rush Hour 3 packs a few comedic moments during its rushed hour...and a half.,5,4 August 2018,"This third instalment to the unlikely buddy cop duo is a guilty pleasure. Every fibre of this film is mediocre. From Ratner's direction, predictable plot, forgettable scenes and overuse of racial stereotypes for the script's jokes. Yet, the undeniable chemistry between Tucker and Chan disguises the apparent issues, that results in an entertaining watch. The dream team must partner up again as they travel to Paris to investigate the assassination attempt of an ambassador. Immediately, we are greeted with Tucker singing a song in his infamous high-pitch vocal chords as he guides traffic. Instantaneously the tone is set. Disposable comedic action that reeks of pure stupidity whilst remaining fun throughout. Chan's determined stunt choreography once again juxtaposes Tucker's interjectory comments that seemingly complement each other to create humorous action sequences. The cast were absolutely fine and dependable, particularly Sanada who will always be a personal favourite of mine. Regrettably the lack of inventiveness and imagination for the story consequently conjured up familiarity. It's the exact same formula as the previous two instalments. The script substitutes the astute wit that made its predecessors funny for obvious racism. It should be taken with a pinch of salt, as it is harmless fun, however when it is relentlessly overused it becomes tiresome and predictable. In relation to this, the plot itself can be predicted before the title credits appear. The story remains uninspired throughout and its abrupt closure leaves a sour aftertaste (even if it's a dance sequence). The poor visual effects during the Eiffel Tower showdown really took me out of the frantic action. Alas, I just can't hate this film. It's faster than a pair of chopsticks being used in a rice consuming competition. Several scenes producing a giant grin on my face, particularly the ""He is Me. I am You."" scene that still has me cracking up to this day. Yet Ratner was far too safe with this sequel, which ultimately makes it forgettable.",Rush Hour 3
31,Movie_Muse_Reviews,One sequel too many for Rush Hour,4,10 May 2009,"Carter and Lee, the famously diverse detective duo are back, and this time it's more pointless than ever. ""Rush Hour 3"" hopes that six years after the second film that viewers will be ready to jump back in with those quirky characters without any promise of bringing something new to the table. Not only does it settle for the same action gags and obnoxious jokes, but it seems to care even less about delivering them with any creative tact. It's like a mildly entertaining TV show episode.The plot, something else not quite new, involves an assassination attempt on the life of Chinese Ambassador Han, which results in Carter and Lee traveling to France simply for a change of scenery because the US and China have already been done in the last two films. There in Paris, they are out to find and protect a girl with a secret list of names.It's not that all of a sudden Chris Tucker got unfunny, but for the money they are paying him, they ought to try and improve his gag. He still treats women inappropriately and has blatant disregard for political correct speech except this time he just forces it at awkward moments. It sounded like writer Jeff Nathanson and director Brett Ratner were just hoping that because Tucker and Chan are black and Chinese respectively, that they were free from criticism of prejudice. It's not offensive, but ""Rush Hour 3"" walks a fine line with some of the dialogue.The fight sequences are respectable as always, but even some of the action gags have been seen before. Nothing jumps out as particularly cool. Somehow there's always falling off a tall building in these movies and so this one follows suit with no good reason. Even the film's ending blooper reel feels remarkably like ""Rush Hour 2's""The appeal has simply worn off on this 10-year franchise. There was no indication that a third film would be successful 9 years after the first, but Ratner and the producers just decided to give it another go and hope the cash would follow anyway. Considering the movie barely grossed the estimated budget, I would say there will be substantial improvements if we are to see Tucker and Chan dance to ""War"" a fourth time. Even then, will anybody care?",Rush Hour 3
32,GOWBTW,"More comedy than action, still great fun though!",8,10 August 2007,"They are at it again! Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker return to another ""Rush Hour""! This time, it's gay-Paris! Only it's infested with a known Asian crime organization known as the Triad. Inspector Lee(Chan) and Carter(Tucker) are involved in an investigation deal with an important piece of work a woman named Genevieve(Noemie Lenoir) who has a big secret. First, Lee protects Ambassador Han(Tzi Ma), until an assassin hit complicates the situation. His daughter entrusts Lee and Carter, to find out who did this. They go to this kung fu school when they deal with this giant student, a lot of laughs there. The French taxi driver was a ingrate until Carter gives him a big attitude adjustment. He got his just taste when Carter made him a ""spy"". He did well when he killed that turncoat, that made him very happy. Both Lee and Carter got their kicks on the bad guys, as usual. Carter finally did his part without Lee's help, at least he always watched his back. It was funny when he pretended to be a fashion designer, he either had all the luck,, or just the charm. The comedy was greater there, it was total non-stop all the way. More comedy was in there, the fun factor wasn't lost at all. 3.5 out of 5 stars!",Rush Hour 3
33,freemantle_uk,A cinematic low,1,11 September 2009,"There are four main things wrong with Rush Hour 3: Chris Tucker, Chris Tucker, Brett Ratner and Chris Tucker. Here we have another example of a film franchise that is too successful for its own good, and in the year of threequels, this was one we didn't need.Set a few years after Rush Hour 2, James Carter (Chris Tucker) is no more then an LA traffic cop and Lee (Jackie Chan) is the head bodyguard for the Chinese Ambassador. The Chinese Ambassador is about to reveal who the heads of the Triads are when he is shot and wounded by a sniper. James and Lee end up working together again, and take their investigation Paris and set out to break-up the Triad.The plot is skeleton thin, like they have been in the previous Rush Hour films; but this is a new low! The plot is overly silly, and way too over the top. The film repeats the same plot with even less success. There are pointless sub-plots, some thinks that wouldn't even work in a action comedy, like Lee haven't a Japanese step-brother. The treatment of the French is awful, unrealistic and just playing to neo-Con crowd in the States which was out of date even in 2007. I can imagine some idiots cheering when Chris Tucker forced a French Taxi driver to sing the American national anthem. It is the stereotypical Hollywood of the French where their our hopeless, corrupt and completely anti-American and Xenophobic. It's complete rubbish.Chris Tucker is the film's lowest point. He is a terrible actor and comedian. His style of humour is simply to shot as loudly and as quickly as possible. They is no wit or insight in to his humour. He can't act and he is really annoying. He offers nothing but racism in his humour, pretty much saying, 'I'm Black, you're Asian'. If it was a white comedian then they would be an absolute media storm. They are many more talent comedians and actors of African-American descent, like Chris Rock to Will Smith to Denzel Washington. The film also suffers from bad writing in the jokes department. I saw some of Rush Hour and whilst it wasn't a classic, it at least has some sharper writing behind it. What is more sickening is that Chris Tucker got paid $30 Million for this rubbish, there are many talented people struggling to break through in the industry.Jackie Chan, a master of material arts and a legend of Hong Kong cinema is little served by this film, having very little to do. He doesn't even get to use his talents in material arts that much. I'm such he only did the film for money (he got a percentage of the Asian profit) and loyalty because the series gave him his big break in Hollywood. Even he doesn't like the humour in the series.Brett Ratner is a terrible director, a hack who is a man you get when no one else is available. He was hired to Red Dragon because the studio wanted a safe pair of hands to copy Johnathan Demme style of Silence of the Lambs, and turned X-Men from an excellent sci-fi series into no more then a wham-bam action film. Here with Rush Hour, he is flogging a dead horse with a pointless second sequel to a film which was only okay to begin with. He shoots some rubbish action scene, like the material arts school, he can't handle humour and he can't reign in his actors (a problem he always suffers). He is a man who such quit directing because he only offers rubbish after rubbish.A great example of the awfulness of the film is a joke involving two Chinese characters called Yu and Mi, and Chris Tucker motormouth confusion.A needless film that should be avoid. It is not a fun film like it pretends to be. If you dislike Chris Tucker you would possibly end up self harming if you watch this.",Rush Hour 3

Second time I saw it, I liked it. Third time I saw it, I don't know. It's well made, but I guess what gets me is Carter's character. It seems that it's dumbed down too much on purpose. Asides from that, the movie was A okay. It's a very interesting mixture of international stars. It has elements of Jackie Chan movie, and if this is any indication, it will be a movie that would be a joy to watch 30 years from now.",Rush Hour 3

Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) and Reynard (Max von Sydow) kind of gave me the creeps. You'll understand why once you've seen this movie. I got really scared when Soo Yung (Zhang Jingchu) was tied up at the Eiffel Tower and when other unexpected thrilling things happened. To me, Carter (Chris Tucker) and Lee (Jackie Chan) were very tough and funny guys. In my opinion, the performances were top grade, the direction was superior, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the cast was perfectly chosen. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too. Before I wrap this up, I must warn you that this movie is very violent if you're going to see it, so viewer discretion is strongly advised. Now, in conclusion, if you like Chris Tucker or Jackie Chan films, I highly recommend this movie. It's sure to keep you guessing from start to finish.",Rush Hour 3

Now Carter and Lee are investigating the sites but they run to more trouble than they ever imagined.Directed by Brett Rather (X-Men:The Last Stand, The Family Man, Money Talks) made an lively action/adventure comedy with entertaining performances by Tucker and Chan.

This time around, cops Lee and Carter are hot on the trail of a secret assassin group, which takes them to Paris. Along the way, they encounter several very beautiful women, some of who can actually act, and take on a veritable army of bad guys. Some of the fight scenes are thrilling, and some are trite and poorly staged. It is too obvious this final film in the series was done strictly for the money. Nobody seems to be having much fun, and even the blooper reel at the end is lifeless. It does not help that the main villain is obvious from the get-go, which hurts what little credibility the film has. For completists only.",Rush Hour 3
39,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Still entertaining although the plot holds little value,7,13 July 2014,"Rush Hour (1998) and Rush Hour 2 (2001) both proved to be extremely successful with Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan matching up to stop major crime bosses. Then its third installment in the franchise slowed,... going into a dormant sleep. Almost paralleling its release dates to that of The Mummy (1999) series, Rush Hour 3 (2007) was released a little over half a decade later. And no doubt did it perform well no matter what critic disliked it. To be honest though, this is still a very entertaining sequel. However, it's also becoming apparent that this duo's story is starting to repeat itself.Rush Hour (1998) took place in America, Rush Hour 2 (2001) took place in Hong Kong. Now, our heroes end up traveling to Paris France, not for a vacation though. This time, Lee's (Jackie Chan) past comes back to haunt him, when a childhood friend, Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) kidnaps Soo Young, the girl he and Carter (Chris Tucker) rescued from the original film as ransom for something important in return. The thing to be returned to Kenji isn't explicitly described until halfway through the film and by that particular time, it doesn't feel as clearly put as it should. Jeff Nathanson's screenplay does work but everything pertaining to the plot feels skimmed over to the point of just having our cop duo perform action sequences.That's not to say that the action sequences don't entertain though. Who doesn't enjoy sword fights, hand-to-hand combat and gunshots? It's a mix of all three types of violence. Still, even with it being the third entry, the action is still energetic and comical at points too. Nathanson's script preserved the funny dialog that made the last two funny for this as well. It is strange though because sometimes it feels like some gags were repeated. For example, when Tucker's character mistakes an Asian man's name between ""Yu"" and ""You"". Wasn't that done already? Nonetheless, it is funny but recycling also means that the fresh and creative ideas are beginning to fade, like its plot. Thankfully, Nathanson introduced a minor new character that helped make interactions funny and that was the cab driver George (Yvan Attal). Although at first, I'm not sure if his dialog was supposed to represent a certain group or just being crass, but over time he does have his moments. It's also strange because it felt like Carter and Lee and even George could get away with even more chaos and trouble than usual than having to face the authorities. Are they that untouchable? Also, story line wise, the ending felt too soon. It did end with closure but only for its main characters and nobody else. Ummm for a trilogy, shouldn't it be tied up a little neater than this?The cinematography by J. Michael Muro looked good. Considering that it took place mainly in Paris (at least the real shots), it looked good. Seeing a European city is always a different viewing experience. Instead of always seeing tar, now there's stone roads and other types of street terrain that normally Americans don't drive by. Veteran composer Lalo Schifrin's score works at being as frantic as the action scenes are and replicate the correct emotion being portrayed on screen. You would think though after two other successful installments, he would've come up with some type of main theme by now. A way of making memorable characters even more memorable is by giving them a catchy theme. With all this, it is still good fun though.It's plot just feels like a reason to see Carter and Lee again, but then again who wouldn't? Rush Hour 3 feels recycled but it still is fun to watch.",Rush Hour 3
40,eric262003,It's Starting To Lose It's Interest,6,6 July 2009,"To be blunt, the reason for ""Rush Hour 3's"" letdown is simply because it doesn't have the same magic that made the other two movies successful. Unlike ""Rush Hour 2"" (which is my favorite) ""Rush Hour 3"" is not very funny or that exciting to watch for that matter. It felt like the cast, the crew and the big stars (Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker) agreed to do this, just to put money in their pockets. Nothing new emerges out of this threequel, and it tells you that after a while, the buddy-cop movie gets tired after a third try. The action was exciting. The fighting scenes were well planned and there was never a dull moment. I was a bit disappointed that there was very little karate scenes. It felt too much cheap thrills stored in like shooting scenes, car chases and sword-fights. The humor was there, but at the same time, it wasn't enough and it got to the point where it became utterly annoying. How much do we have to put up listening to Chris Tucker shriek. He sounds like a cat getting his foot caught in a blender while it's on puree.""Rush Hour 2"" is still the best of the series. In ""Rush Hour 3"", for a ninety minute film, this one seemed slow at times and it looks like the crew was frantically searching for ways to fill the holes and even that wasn't entirely fulfilled. Some subplots were just padded on with no sync to the movie and it came to the point where it was all too predictable. As much as I hate to say it let's hope this third installment is the last one.",Rush Hour 3

42,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Rush Hour 3"" is one of the films I've seen that's left me the most conflicted. It's wildly entertaining and fun, yet also an exceptionally-poorly-written piece of fluff.",5,24 November 2013,"In my ""Rush Hour 2"" review, I pointed the issue of the film on one aspect- the lazy, clichéd script by Jeff Nathanson.And that very same issue is what plagues ""Rush Hour 3"", although on a far grander scale. While I mentioned that ""Rush Hour 2"" had a script that was almost embarrassing, the truth is, the script for ""Rush Hour 3"" IS embarrassing. It seems almost impossible that this film was actually ""written""... it feels more like a script-writing exercise from a beginner's screen writing textbook than an actual film script. It uses every cliché and trope without shame, phones in every twist and turn without subtlety and covers all the bases in a way that actually made me almost angry that I had spent $8 to see it in theaters.And that's a really huge shame, because other than the script, this is actually a fun, entertaining movie. Heck, I found it more entertaining and humorous than the second film. But that lazy script almost completely ruins it.Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are back as Detectives Lee and Carter. After Chinese Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma from the first film returning in a cameo) is almost killed in an assassination attempt by the ruthless Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada of ""Ringu"" fame), Lee and Carter are whisked away to France and get pulled into a plot involving a secret list of Triad leaders and a mysterious woman named Geneviève. (Noemie Lenoir)And it leads to- you guessed it- action, action and more action.As was the case for the first two films, the charm, chemistry and heart of Chan and Tucker are what makes the film work, and actually what saves it in the end in this case. Chan and Tucker just gel well together by this point, and they've both learned a thing or two since the last film. Tucker has toned himself down slightly, making himself more tolerable than he was in the second film, and Chan continues to play a great role as a conflicted Police Detective. Although I feel Chan comes across too darkly at times in this film, and he doesn't quite have that fun presence that he did in the prior two entries. But I can forgive it, because he still has a lot of fun moments and he's still got a great chemistry with Tucker.Supporting roles are also well-played. Sanada is a blast as Kenji, a villain who once again has a dark tie to Lee's past. Max Von Sydow is a lot of fun as a French Ambassador. Noémie Lenoir is sexy and fun as Geneviève. Yvan Attal is amusing as George, a taxi-driver who gets pulled into Lee and Carter's adventure. They're all a lot of fun.Except perhaps for Roman Polanski, who oddly enough has a small role as a French Commissioner, in an uncredited performance. I'm just still uncomfortable with his sex-abuse charges, and seeing him in a major release like this (especially when, as part of a joke, it is implied he does a cavity search on Lee and Carter) is unsettling. I still watch his films and whatnot, but seeing him on screen in a somewhat comedic role was just a bit much for me.The production is once again well accomplished. Ratner's direction is good fun, although I found this film to be one of his more over-clean and over-sanitized works. It slightly lacks character in that it is too polished. But still, he tells the story well, and I'd rather have a film be too polished than not polished enough.And as was the case for the last two films, the triumph of ""Rush Hour 3"" 's production is Lalo Schifrin's score. Utilyzing his themes from the prior films and building off of them, Schifrin delivers another knockout musical achievement.Set and costume design is quite nice. The editing is well-done.This is just a good, competent, solid production. The problem just keeps coming back to that darned script by Jeff Nathanson.This could have been a solid film that matched the quality of the first. It has everything else going for it. Fun performances, good production value. You name it. But if the script isn't there, it brings everything else down.I really am conflicted about this film. It's just such a joy to watch these characters... these actors... these movies. They're fun. They bring a smile to your face. But the writing in the sequels is just terrible. Objectively, this film should get a 3 out of 10 for its poor quality script. But for me, it's about a solid 7 out of 10 for entertainment.So I'm meeting somewhere in the middle and giving it a 5 out of 10 score as an entertaining piece of cinematic fluff. And that's cutting a LOT of slack as a fan. This is a film to see if you're a fan of the series, and a fan of these characters. However, don't expect it to be a good film. Expect it to be light entertainment with no thought whatsoever put into it. Hopefully, the long-rumored ""Rush Hour 4"" will fix the problems of the prior sequels and bring the series back to the quality of the great original.",Rush Hour 3
43,denis888,"Funny, Brisk, Light-hearted",4,2 September 2007,"The third part of Rush Hour is very much in the same vein as the two predecessors  it is funny, very fast, very dangerous about the tricks, very comic in dialogs, and very entertaining in its best meaning of the word. Right, if you are seeking some serious, mind-provoking, heart-touching film, this one is not for you, by all means. Rush Hour is a feast for those who want to relax, to have fun, to laugh heartily, to enjoy the head-breaking tricks of Jackie Chan, and the unbearably funny escapades of Chris Tucker. The duo is impeccable, where Jackie is usually virtuoso; Chris is clumsy, merry and silly. Where Jackie is slightly bland, Chris is readily cunning and agile. The new series of adventures in Paris is very much the same  car chases, fantastic fights, shootings, gags, jokes, only now they also take place on the Eiffel Tower and around. The plot credibility as well as accuracy were never the strongest part of the film crew. The final part, where Chan and Tucker are flying down using the large French banner, is far from being real. But if you want some light-weight comedy, with little to offer or even less to ponder on, this is the movie exactly for you, complete with usual false takes at the very end, when the titles are going up. The conclusion? A typical, undemanding, easy to grasp chewing gum. But very enjoyable, very merry, very upbeat work. Watch it for sheer fun.",Rush Hour 3

I wasn't expecting much but ""Rush Hour 3"" is even worse than I could imagine! How is it possible that with great martial artists like Jackie Chan and Hiroyuki Sanada you can't get more out of the action scenes than it did! Chan and Sanada deserve more respect than this! Compare this movie with Chan's ""Rob-B-Hood""! Also more of a comedy than action movie! Which was a very funny movie! But one scene from that movie contained more action than there is in whole ""RH3""! Even the first two ""Rush Hour"" movies had more spunk and action! Brett Ratner again proves that he is a bad director! He has no idea what Sanada and Chan are capable of! With these two he could have created a classic end fight! What we get in stead is too ridiculous for words! After violating ""Xmen 3"" I was hoping that he would redeem himself! Well,he didn't! I must admit that Chris Tucker was funny at times! But part of the charm of the earlier Rush Hour movies was the combination of the funny Chris and ass kicking Jackie! Now it was almost a one man show starring Chris Tucker! I liked him in the movie! But to diminish Jackie's talent like this is offensive! ""Rush Hour 3"" is hopefully the last in the series! It can be enjoyable if you numb yourself!

46,Sirus_the_Virus,Not in the third part curse.,7,4 August 2009,"Rush Hour 3 isn't in the third part curse. I'm not sure if it was as good as the first, but it was better than the second. The problem I had with Rush Hour 2 was that Jackie Chan is a bad actor. Not only that, almost everything he said was stupid. Roger Ebert blamed the problem on Chris Tucker, which is the only reason I like the films. The plot: Lee and Carter try to protect Soo Young after Ambassador Han's assassination attempt. Lee and Carter travel to Paris looking for the Shy Shen list, which is a list of people who escaped from prison or something. Lee and Carter also try to fight off Kenji, who is Lee's adoptive brother. I did like Rush Hour 3 a lot more than Rush Hour 2. I laughed in all three Rush Hour films. But Rush Hour 3 still has Jackie Chan doing these stunts like he's in his thirties. I just find it a little bit ridiculous. That's not why I gave it a seven out of ten, I gave it that because Rush hour 3 is slightly ridiculous and i'm proud of it. I liked how they kept showing the Eifel Tower in the background. I've been to Paris so I liked seeing that. I think some parts of the film are silly. I liked George the cab driver a little bit, though he was slightly stupid. It took seven years for them to return with a sequel and it doesn't disappoint. It's a hit and miss film, but mostly a hit.Rush Hour 3: 7.4",Rush Hour 3

Chris Tucker was funny as always but the film had lost the spark and magic that the first carried. I think Jackie's lack of interest in doing the same type of movie time and time again got him.The film is predictable and the only thing that has changed is the location.A lot of people say this is a great film and better then the first two but the truth is either those people have convinced themselves or they have never seen a Jackie Chan movie before...Only sticking to the American Chan movies. The reason the first worked so well was because it was new and clever with some great dialog but this seems to be repetitive and slow...Stay away from this Jackie Chan movie.",Rush Hour 3
48,TheUnknown837-1,"probably the least of all three, but still lots of silly fun",7,27 January 2008,"Nothing in ""Rush Hour 3"" has not been delivered to us by the first two installments in the popular series. There is still more of Jackie Chan's spectacular skills in stunt work, lots of martial arts fights, Chris Tucker cracking jokes, a simple but effective storyline, and above all, tremendous amounts of fun. ""Rush Hour 3"", like its two predecessors, embraces a style that is unrealistic in several regards. Perhaps the Chris Tucker character's behavior is a little bit too ridiculous and silly to be considered realistic, but then again, ""Rush Hour 3"" is a funny action-comedy movie. And Chan and Tucker still make a great team for laughs.""Rush Hour 3"" started out on a pretty weak level and it had me worried for a short while there. After the first ten minutes, I had my doubts onto how good the movie was going to be overall. But as it went on, I just sat back and learned to enjoy it for what it was. Probably after the hilarious ""Mi and Yu"" scene in the martial arts school, the film forced me to embrace its style and enjoy it for what it was. And it still had lots of action scenes, many of which contained comical elements, and kept me glued to my seat.Sure, ""Rush Hour 3"" is not perfect and if it wasn't for Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan making such an effective pair for the screen, the movie probably wouldn't have been that good. Many elements, mostly regarding characters and development of the plot, were in need of some more development. Some scenes were worthy of a few more takes, or just rushed by too quickly. The beginning needed a little more work, but overall, ""Rush Hour 3"" was just a third barrel-full of fun. Effective and entertaining.",Rush Hour 3
49,mstomaso,More violent slapstick fun with Chris and Jackie,7,12 August 2007,"Director Brett Ratner returns to his element, offering a third fun, funny, and violent slapstick installment in the Rush Hour series.Rush Hour 3 sees Inspector Lee and Detective Carter back together again, trying to save the lives of a Chinese ambassador who may be on the brink of cracking open a massive organized crime syndicate called the Triads, the ambassador's daughter, and a woman with a very dangerous secret. The biggest problem, however, is the return of somebody from Lee's past with the potential to derail the otherwise stalwart Inspector. Most of this takes place in Paris, providing a different setting and a few opportunities to exploit cultural stereotypes that are new to the series. The film is jam-packed with the wild, mildly provocative humor the series is known for, and the silly but entertaining martial-arts slapstick that is Mr. Chan's trademark. Chris Tucker gives his best performance in the series, delivering a lot of comic punch and playing a nice complement to Chan's sombre and serious Inspector Lee.Rush Hour 3 delivers exactly what fans of the series look for - a simple linear action-thriller liberally decorated with a lot of cleverly written comedy and the amazing physical performance of Jackie Chan. It is better than many of Ratner's recent efforts, and a worthy entry in one of the very few comedy series I have enjoyed.",Rush Hour 3

I thought 1 was fun, 2 was better and it would have been great to end with a bang. Alas it feels more like balloon slowly deflating with a farting sound instead of happily popping loudly. It's been 13 years now so hopefully they don't try to revive this anymore with Tucker and Chan (we're not even going to talk about the sad, sad attempt at a TV show).",Rush Hour 3
51,dglink,Fairly Good Third Installment in Rush Hour Series,6,6 November 2017,"For the third in an action-comedy series,""Rush Hour 3"" is not half bad. Perhaps that should not be a surprise for a Jackie Chan film, because ""Shanghai Knights,"" the second film in his collaboration with Owen Wilson, was even funnier than the first, ""Shanghai Noon."" In Chan's third film with comedian Chris Tucker, Jackie witnesses an attempt on the Chinese ambassador's life, and he springs into action with the aid of Tucker. Directed by Brett Ratner, who helmed the first two installments in the series, the film sends the pair to Paris in pursuit of the assassin, where they become involved with crime lords, the French police, a helpful taxi driver, Jackie's long lost brother, and some beautiful women.As expected in a Jackie Chan movie, the action is a non-stop series of martial arts fights, car chases, and explosions. A martial arts sequence with an extremely tall black belt and a group of young students is quite good, and a precarious fight atop the Eiffel Tower is especially well done. Tucker provides the wise cracks, which are generally funny, although his barbs that disparaged a large-size woman were in poor taste. However, the ""Yu and Mi"" exchange, reminiscent of the classic ""Who's on First"" by Abbott and Costello was funny. While there is nothing ground-breaking here, the film has plenty of action for Jackie's fans, and some good lines from Tucker; when you throw in appearances by Max Von Sydow, Philip Baker Hall, and Roman Polanski, ""Rush Hour 3"" is pretty decent entertainment for the third film in a series.",Rush Hour 3
52,fwomp,"Rest In Peace, Rush Hour Series",3,27 December 2007,"The RUSH HOUR series is getting tiresome. How many off-color jokes and physical comedy routines does it take before things become old hat? If you've seen the previous two Rush Hour films, you already know exactly how this one pans out. Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) and Chief Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) reconnect when an attempt is taken on a Chinese official's life. Lee and Tucker are thrust back together to try and track down the villain(s).The usual suspects pop up, including an old ""brother""of Lee's named Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) and a diplomat named Varden Reynard (Max von Sydow, THE SEVENTH SEAL).A secret society. Carter and Lee get in way over their heads. They battle impossible foes doing equally impossible feats of daring duo all while being sprite, charming and funny.In the end, they come out smelling like roses.The end.Rumors of filming a fourth Rush Hour film immediately after this third installment were apparently scrapped due to unknown reasons, but one could easily venture that failing interest in the series hamstrung such a project (but who knows ...maybe there will be a fourth).Tucker and Chan still have a unique chemistry on-screen, one a speed talking black man and the other a soft talking Chinese gentleman. The blooper out-takes on the DVD are worth watching to check out Chan's difficulties with various English translations and his physical accident while trying to throw a piece of furniture with his legs (I've heard tell that he broke his sternum during that take. Ouch!).Plenty of eye-candy awaits those guys who like to see marvelously curvaceous women whom you normally would only see air-brushed on magazine covers. Most notably is French actress Noémie Lenoir who plays Genevieve, a dancer with a very special head on her shoulders.But beyond that, you're not going to see much that'll intrigue you.

Jingchu sheds a single, meaningful tear at a critical moment, giving one false hope that the series of barely connected, predictable sequences that preceded would be followed by a real movie. Unfortunately, Jingchu is relegated to ""damsel-in-distress"", largely off-screen until the final reel. Meanwhile, the audience is subjected to unbelievable setups for Chris Tucker's humor. Even the best element of ""Rush Hour 2"" (Jackie Chan's romance with a female Secret Service agent) is trashed for weak laughs. What storyline exists is paper-thin and either trite or unbelievable. I give ""Rush Hour 3"" a ""5,"" primarily for the production values and Jingchu Zhang's brief performance.",Rush Hour 3

55,fernandoschiavi,"This third chapter appears to be worn and old, but it is worth a look for anyone who is a fan of the genre or just wants an afternoon of uncompromising fun",5,18 October 2020,"Rush Hour is certainly one of the most loved franchises by the public, knowing it is good comedy entertainment with great elaborate action scenes, but it is also undeniable that with each film the quality has been declining. As productions begin to gain sequences, the formula that won over the audience in the first version tends to wear out. In many cases, the director loses his hand or the script becomes weak; characters can also become tiring and lose their enchantment. Rush Hour 3 is also exposed to these problems, common in sequels. Even so, it remains a good option for good entertainment.In Rush Hour 3, Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma) is in Paris, about to reveal evidence about the work of the Triad, the most powerful and well-known crime syndicate on the planet. He discovered the identity of Shy Shen, who is responsible for the organization, and is willing to reveal it to the World Crime Court. However, the Triad wishes to keep this information secret and to do so it decides to use all the possibilities it has. To help Soo Yung (Jingchu Zhang), the ambassador's daughter, Chief Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) and Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) travel to France. In Paris, without knowing the city or the language, they need to prevent a worldwide conspiracy from happening.In spite of several renowned professionals involved in the tape, both in the cast and in the technical team, mediocrity sets the tone in this film where jokes do not work in the context of the - extremely bad - plot, the action scenes are uninspired and unimaginative and the lack of rhythm prevails throughout the projection. Apparently, the studio's greed for billing at the box office backfired, as the film's overbilling is more than evident, costing an absurd $ 140 million dollars and struggling to recover the investment at the box office. What bothers the most is the waste of the great characters that the franchise has in this ridiculous closure of the trilogy that does not even come close to providing that crazy feeling of fun from the previous two copies of the series.The mission takes them from Los Angeles to Paris, where they locate and then try to protect a fatal woman (Noémie Lenoir) whose survival is essential for the elucidation of the case. The geographical displacement of the plot, in turn, provides more to the plot than just postcard landscapes. Stereotypes about French and North Americans are wielded, with unusual harshness, in this action comedy whose politically incorrect humor seems to warn that it has no commitment to anything except grace and dollar signs. In addition to updating the repertoire of jokes around the crooked tune between black ""cop"" and Asian ""cop"", the plot also involves the reappearance of a young woman from the first film, daughter of an ambassador (now played by Jingchu Zhang), and the presentation of a mysterious character (Hiroyuki Sanada) who emerges from Lee's dark past.The script, again in charge of Jeff Nathason, who wrote the second film, provides us with a good percentage of the clichés of police films used to exhaustion and a range of cartoon villains, who are not frightened by the simple fact that we know that the main duo never someone would be dead. There is even the old cliché of the good guy who turned out to be the bad guy in the end, to no one's surprise. A graceful ode to the lack of originality. In addition, there are several problems of continuity or even huge holes in the script: as character X he would know which character Y would be at the moment Z in the place. This third example is more of the same, and all the negative points mentioned in the paragraph above are irritating. However, for your salvation, the film confirms the fun factor of the series and, when it manages to mix good jokes with interesting action (not smart, but no more stupid than any Hard to Kill, for example), all those negative points can be denied to background without guilt.No aspect of the story is developed properly. Lee's relationships with Carter and Kenji, which were supposed to be the driving force in the plot, simply do not convince what is a pity, since the friendship between the two lawmen was the most interesting aspect of the series. The ones taken from the film, despite some - like the fight that pays homage to the duel between Bruce Lee and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in ""The Game of Death"". Following the leads, they end up going to Paris in search of Shy Sheng, who would be in the possession of a seductive dancer named Genevieve (Noémie Lenoir). Once there, the pair experienced the curious ""French hospitality"", when they were received by delegate Revi (filmmaker Roman Polanski, in hilarious participation). Cursed, punched, humiliated and raped, the two will discover that they have stepped into hostile territory long before facing the bandits they have been chasing. There is also the introduction of the taxi driver. These parts work well in isolation, do not convince as parts of a script, as they seem to be played in the middle of the story.However, there are at least half a dozen very funny moments, and if the purpose of the film is to offer uncompromising entertainment, it does so without offending the intelligence of the viewers, with a story that is absolutely unsuccessful, but good enough to justify beautiful scenes and assembled, in the sense that the action flows well without forcing the plot to continue for a specific scene. Even some extras are highlighted, such as the taxi driver who makes an expression priceless when he feels like a professional American agent during a chase through the streets of Paris. And there are several other moments as good as this one.Jackie Chan remains the main engine of the series. Chan shines with his elastic and almost always unexpected movements. Although the weight of age starts to slow him down, his exceptional physical form is undeniable, and this is valid for a good number of scenes, culminating in the final duel in the middle of the Eiffel Tower. We also have scenes with Le parkour through the streets of Los Angeles. Of French origin, this mixture of sport and juggling leads its practitioners to jump staircases, climb walls and jump over rooftops quickly, facing the urban landscape as a great set of challenges to be overcome. But long before the current hype around the sport, Jackie Chan was already doing that in his films. So taking your adventures to the land of le parkour can make all the sense in the world. Unfortunately, his career did not succeed in Hollywood as he wishes (Chan still dreams of making serious films and working alongside Spielberg), but when he does what he knows best, he is practically unsurpassed. While Chris Tucker amuses himself with his situations involving women and auto racist jokes, his character is the ultimate stereotype for black actors in American police cinema, when they play police - see Martin Lawrence and, especially Eddie Murphy.The worst performances, however, are beautiful in the film. Noémie Lenoir, although stunning, has no stage presence, while Jingchu Zhang can barely give the proper intonation in his lines. Furthermore, both are simply overlooked by the film - and its protagonists - after the climax of the projection. Those who still leave with some dignity preserved from this disaster are precisely the members of the cast who appear least. Philip Baker Hall returns as Captain Dell, in his short participation with the cliché of telling Carter not to investigate the case. Yvan Attal, as the taxi driver George, is the most charismatic figure on the scene, having the funniest dialogue in the feature when he meets the police duo, even though he inexplicably participates in solving the plot. Regarding the much-vaunted participation of Roman Polanski, his appearances in this feature serve more as a curious addition to the award-winning director's career, being quite interesting to see him on the scene, even though his character makes no sense in the story, as well as everything else.
Brett Ratner, director who usually does well when the project does not demand so much, fails to extract good interpretations from the actors, fails to give any sense of risk to the tape, not giving any dynamism to it, nor remembering the previous adventures of Lee and Carter, which he himself had directed. The director of photography by J. Michael Muro, fails to take advantage of the potential of the City of Light, resulting in an uninteresting work, nor remembering what he had done in ""Crash - No Limite"". The editing work, carried out by Billy Weber (nominated for an Oscar for ""Beyond the Red Line""), Don Zimmerman (""The Madnesses of Dick & Jane"") and Mark Helfrich (Ratner's regular collaborator), fails to give the feature any rhythm, counting on senseless cuts and unreasonable narrative breaks, as in the last sequences of fights, which alternate between those starring Lee and Carter almost randomly. Speaking of such fights, with the exception of the beating taken by Chris Tucker in his feud against the giant Chinese, they fail to excite and amuse the audience, some still counting on an evident and poorly performed blue screen, raising the question of where it all ended up.Rush Hour 3 is a film with impressive problems in terms of script, but if you sin in that sense, please when it comes to fun and technical. This third chapter appears to be worn and old (which is still true), but it is worth a look for anyone who is a fan of the genre or just wants an afternoon of uncompromising fun. With a movie face for a boy, which features beautiful women, cars, shots, ""Rush Hour 3"" offers guaranteed fun to the public, who seeks only entertainment in the cinema. Since the team moved to Europe, the narrative takes the opportunity to nudge the US government, especially when referring, between the lines, to President George W. Bush and his insistence on the war in Iraq.",Rush Hour 3

Their chemistry brightens the screen with their outrageous jokes and awe-inspiring deliverance of non-stop action of car chases, stunts, and kung fu. Although a bit of CG is added in the action, particularly with some of Mr. Chan's stunts and his age is really starting to show. Nonetheless, his stunts are considerably great.This time they crash the bad guys' party in Paris, France. They're bad, but not as bad as the villains in the previous two Rush Hours. And I was bummed that this Rush Hour did not pick up on them going to New York City with Isabella. Although Carter and Lee briefly mentioned some events that happened during their time there; I felt that the story had a gap in the line (unless there's a Rush Hour 2.5, which I doubt). Oh, well.The story is real basic, nothing spectacular like Lord of the Rings or Star Wars, but I was a bit surprised that the director brought back Consul Han and a stunning eighteen year-old Soo Yung. This is a pretty good Rush Hour. I like it better than the second one, but not as much as the first. It's always hard to beat the original. 8/10",Rush Hour 3

Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker were excellent, and I'm glad they continued to reprise their roles in this latest instalment. My favourite part is where Inspector Lee and Detective Carter take on that very tall Chinese man. He was actually over seven feet. That part was hilarious! It made me laugh. Another favourite part is where Lee fights that lady or assassin, and James Carter thought they were doing something else haha...That part was also hilarious! In fact, it made me laugh throughout the entire movie. I think Rush Hour 3 is the most funniest of all the Rush Hour movies. It will get you cracking! It was all due to Chris Tucker who played Detective James Carter. I don't know what to make of him other than the fact he's full of jokes! I like Chris Tucker - he's a funny actor! Jackie Chan, on the other hand, who played Inspector Lee, is serious about his business. I like how he leads the charge in this operation. In this movie, Lee and Carter go to France, Paris to protect a witness from the Chinese Triads. The two cops fight it out against these dangerous criminals. Can they fight? Can they win? Can they survive? You need to see it in order to find out. Although the movie is very funny, there's still plenty or enough action for you to enjoy. The story is good by the way. What I liked about the story is just how different it is. Rush Hour, Rush Hour 2 and Rush Hour 3 are all different movies. That's what I like about these Rush Hour movies. In Rush Hour 3, I like how the setting takes place in the wonderful city of Paris. Somehow, it just worked. People should give Rush Hour 3 a chance; you won't feel disappointed. It's funny, and has more than enough action! Rush Hour 3 is a great action/comedy movie. Usually, the third movie in the series underperforms, but Rush Hour 3 is an exception. I'd say all the Rush Hour movies are equally good, and it's very rare to say that. Each being different. That's the third Rush Hour movie. It's a trilogy. It may not be the greatest trilogy out there, but it's definitely one of the more underrated ones. I'd say it's in the top twenty. I hope there's Rush Hour 4. I know it will work given how these three movies planned out, but it doesn't matter in all honesty. Rush Hour 3 is a fantastic movie. It will get you laughing for sure.",Rush Hour 3

They travel to France to catch their target. With all fun, frolic and action they do their task in the end.I enjoyed the movie. Jackie Chan shows age and even though he is not in his best of stunts and speed, he is still good. Chris Tucker as always is a loud mouth and provides the bubbling fun.The backdrop of the movie is set in France and one cannot miss the final fight scene on the iron girders of Eiffel Towers. It was a treat to watch, I would have liked it more the same fight happening in daytime with some helicopters hovering around Eiffel Tower.The Director Brett Ratner who achieved the success status through the first Rush Hour movie, still maintains the tempo and does not slow the pace at all.

Third in the series so the two lead characters are well known: a loud and quick mouthed American paired with a fast moving and hard hitting Chinese guy. The combo is like fire and ice and it worked for the first two films, so they must have thought it would work for a third one too. Alas, the cow has been milked dry. Most of this film is rehashing the material of the first two and although there are some good moments they come few and very far apart.The problem with light headed comedy is that it doesn't leave the audience hanging on very long if the pace drops down and that is just what happens too often in this one.

The first two were good enough but now I feel like it went too far. The franchise just continued and became predictable. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are great actors who give a lot of life to the film, and a lot of sense of humor. But there characters are not fully developed: in the first movie they become partners for the first time and are forced to work together, at the end of the movie they become friends and save the day. The problem is that since then they haven't been developed. Their characters stay the same in both sequels, moreover the third movie brings back old characters from the first movie to fill the empty plot. The story has nothing much to deliver, detective Lee (Chan) always seems to have a struggle about his family. In ""Rush Hour 2"" it was about his father, now it's about his brother, what's next?

63,lagudafuad,what a waste of my time,3,31 March 2013,"Why must Producers milk a cow dry, till a franchise is worth less than a B-Movie? When movie makers decide to over drag a movie it makes you wonder why such a plague has been allowed to continue and no one has even bothered to search out a cure. It is never your place to tell a man what movie he will make or not, but we the fans can help matters by actually airing our views about such.My stand is that a movie like Rush Hour that pulled out an awesome combination of martial art action and comedy, should have been laid to rest after the release of Rush Hour 2 in 2001, the truth is movies like Mad Max, Die Hard and Lethal Weapon dragged for too long till the last movie made about the lead actor or actors ended up just being a mediocre, (Mad Max 3, Die Hard 5 and Lethal Weapon 4).Moving forward, the first Rush Hour was a form of a classic it pulled the stops and made sure that you the viewer will be laughing all the way to the bank, the second was just bull and watching the errors that the actors made during filming was more interesting to see than the movie itself. The worse thing about this movie I can remember is Zhang Jingchu who portrays Soo-Yung Ambassador Solon Han daughter, she was the worst thing to be seen on TV as she doesn't even have an idea what it means to be a convincing actor.Now the script is where the high jump bar lays, and how this movie failed to scale it, an assassination attempt by the Triads was on Ambassador Solon Han and Lee (Jackie Chan) was present at the shooting and he chased the culprit to the street till he finally caught with him only to discover it is a childhood friend.Chris Tucker was annoying this flick, and Jackie Chan was just not in form, making both look like they were forced to take the roles we are seeing them in. I don't get? After such a bad performance, anybody will think the producers will now kill the franchise, but that is not to be as talks are circling around that a Rush Hour 4 can be done soon. I guess cash is now the motivation why this franchise is being continued; because as of now i have lost any interest I may have had to see a new Rush Hour.My conclusion is that, see Rush Hour 1 and 2, then stop this is nowhere worth viewing.www.lagsreviews.com",Rush Hour 3

66,diac228,"""If you pick this up for another 893 episodes, you'll get more of the same!""",6,12 August 2007,"Ralph Bighead says this to his producers as he introduces his pilot for the company's newest television show in the cartoon masterpiece Rocko's Modern Life (Wacky Deli, for you old-school Nick fans). This quotation basically describes Rush Hour 3: more of the same, whether you like it or not. If you've liked the previous Rush Hour movies, then you will get a kick out of thiseven if it is the weakest of the three installments. Otherwise, there's nothing new to the table, except for different scenery. Rush Hour 3 is so formulaic to the franchise and the genre itself, you can practically predict the next scene coming up. Despite the lack of surprise and the inability to try something different, Rush Hour 3 is indeed a fun movie if you set your expectations nice and low. However, the frontrunners of Hollywood yet again fails to utilize the skills and mastery of the legend Jackie Chan and focus more on the antics of the loud and overpaid Chris Tucker. Chan fans will be disappointed, but Tucker fans should be more than pleased. Taking a seat back yet again on the action and focusing on laughs, Rush Hour 3 can be described more as a lighthearted comedy with a hint of action and unnecessary drama.In the back end of the trilogy, we follow Lee (Jackie Chan) and Carter (Chris Tucker) reuniting after a long period of no communication attempting to help Soo Yung (little girl from the original) track down the men trying to kill her father, the Chinese ambassador. In the midst of all this, they wind up in Paris looking for a list of names that is of great importance to a wealthy yet deadly Chinese gang called the Triads. This mission is yet again personal to Lee as the past catches up to him. The brotherhood theme is present throughout, as well as the influx of references to the original and part 2. However, this predictable plot shouldn't win any awards; it's the buddy chemistry of Chan and Tucker that keeps the movie afloat and above mediocrity---until the final act.Jackie Chan is a legend. He can sing (somewhat, he is a music star in Asia), he can act (New Police Story proves this) and he knows how to brawl like no other actor in the entire planet. With a refusal to use doubles and tons of fake effects; he does all his own stunts and gets involved with every fight imaginable. But, this legend is not utilized, but when he is fighting or dodging attacks, he will leave you breathless. In the end, if you want to see him at his best, when Hollywood isn't paranoid about anyone getting hurt, watch his overseas movies and Rumble in the Bronx. Chris Tucker needs to make more movies, because he has great comedic timing and also because there is a major threat of being typecast. Typecasting is known to damage and even ruin careers, and it would be a shame to see Tucker be known as just the bigmouth cop in a buddy cop trilogy. Aside from the main two, there is nobody really outstanding to watch, with the exception of the cab driver portrayed by Yvan Attal.Rush Hour 3 is a funny movie; that is its main strength. In the first two portions of the movie, there are plenty of funny one-liners and unexpected hilarity throughout. Chris Tucker's best moment was in the kung fu school where Soo Yung teaches as he meets the master of the place and his minions. While the drama was reserved for Chan's character, he still has his moments, especially when he starts singing. Brett Ratner knows better than to mess around and lets the spotlight shine on Tucker, and let Tucker work his comedic magic. However, Ratner's fear to try something unique and spin something new to the franchise sets it apart from the other two as Rush Hour 3 begins to grow stale as the third act approaches. Another problem is that he attempts to throw in a bit of drama, something really not needed. Come on now, what we Americans need is a mindless Chan action flick! Lack of action also hampers Rush Hour 3, which has nowhere near as many thrills as the other two, nor are the sequences any better either (the best fight in the trilogy remains in the original, with the pool table showdown). By the end, even the ending was rather weak, as it doesn't really offer any appetite for more Rush Hournor does it seem like a fitting conclusion.Bottom Line: While it is unfair for Rush Hour 3 to follow-up to the amazing Bourne Ultimatum, the movie still suffers from following an obvious formula and not giving the dosage of action we've expected from the series. The chemistry is still there between the two, but the supporting cast, writing, directing, and lack of action hampers what could have been another good addition to the trilogy. Jackie Chan remains quite underused no matter what director is handling him in Hollywood (last time he was superbly used by Americans was 2003's Shanghai Knights). They should whether try something new to the series, or just end it altogether, because the staleness is beginning to show, especially when approaching the climax of the movie. Rush Hour 3 may taste a bit stale, but still has a bit of flavor, mostly coming from the essential ingredient Chris Tucker. Needs more Chan though.",Rush Hour 3
67,johnnymacbest,Cookie-cutter sequel,6,31 August 2007,"Sequels are getting a bad flack nowadays with the third installments of Spider-Man 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean. In my opinion, both films flopped in style and context. Oh, how I long for originality.Rush Hour 3, unfortunately,falls victim to ""sequelitis"". This new word should be included in Merriam Webster.(someone PLEASE make it happen) to describe films that have little to no originality or substance because Rush Hour 3 is nothing more than reheated leftovers from the first two films. There's hardly anything ""new"" in this film save for a car chase with Carter, Lee and a French cab driver (oh yeah, like we never seen that before) as well as the setting of the film being in France, but it's all been done before with nothing in it to make it interesting or fresh. It seems like the film took several scenes from 1 and 2 and tried to frost it over with something new. It's not. One major gripe is that the fight scenes are very restrained; never going hog-wild like the first two films. Some of the humor is funny, but the novelty of it wears off and makes the film stale.Overall, Rush Hour 3 is a cookie-cutter of a film, nothing more or less.",Rush Hour 3

69,mOVIemAN56,Rush Hour 3 = stupid and unbelievable,4,19 August 2007,"I had seen the previous two Rush Hour films and had loved both of them. The goofy antics of Chris Tucker mixed with the amazing martial arts moves of Jackie Chan made both of the previous Rush Hour films funny and entertaining. Rush Hour 3 is missing both the heart and the feel of the previous Rush Hour films. It is neither enjoyable or believable. It is simply a mess with little humor and is the proof that is needed to show the when a comedy film has a good sequel, another attempt shouldn't be made.The plot is rather complicated. Chief Inspector Lee is now the bodyguard of Ambassador Han (who is from the first film) who is on the way to give a report at the World Criminal Council concerning the Triad crime organization. After and attempt on the Ambassador's life, Lee and Carter seek to find out who is responsible. After a cheesy scene where the promise the Ambassador's daughter they will find the men responsible, they are off to Paris to investigate. Along the way they meet a strange cab driver, a sexy dancer who may have connections with the Triads, and a man who may be linked with Lee besides being an enemy.The main problem with Rush Hour 3 is too many things don't make any sense at all. To start it out the plot is a bit hard to understand. Tho whole movie I was waiting for a plot to be revealed to discover by the end nothing had really happened. There are villains that are just added on and mirror images of previous villains, particularly the knife throwing girl who reminded me a lot of the girl from Rush Hour 2. Also the main villain is never properly addressed and at the end when Lee and Carter 'save' the day, you feel kind of empty inside.Most of the movie did not flow well. There are a few funny scenes but I found the camera turning a bit too many times to Chris Tucker for him to go on one of his now famous rants. There is no character development. Lee and Carter both feel like statues on the screen. Mix that with very poor writing (I almost threw up when Jackie Chan was on a swing singing to Chris Tucker, I am not lying) and you get a poor film. Even the action scenes, which the Rush Hour films are known to be good for, aren't any good. They are boring and unbelievable to say the least. I found Rush Hour 3 to be a big let down. I rarely laughed. The jokes were too far-fetched and unbelievable for my taste. I did like the fight scene on top of the Eiffel Tower but even that got out of hand. Tucker has a few good moments but I am really beginning to wonder what exactly Jackie Chan is considering doing with himself. His parts were some of the cheesiest and most unbelievable parts of the film (and I am not talking about his martial arts, which there is little of). All in all avoid Rush Hour 3 and pray there is no Rush Hour 4 in the works.2/5 stars",Rush Hour 3
70,barrys82,A good finish to a successful trilogy,8,2 September 2007,"This is a very good movie, the last one of the trilogy following the same formula of the previous two, with lots of funny moments, great action scenes, a little mystery and some romance to spice the things up. Although the story is a little predictable, it still has that charm that captivates. The plot is decent and convincing. The scenery is great, watching different places of Paris is such a joy. The fight scenes are just impressive, they are so well choreograph that it seems real and Jackie Chan's stunts are spectacular as always. Brett Ratner directing was good, he obtains a very good rhythm from the beginning to the end just with a little slump at the middle. The cast was very good, Chris Tucker is absolutely great, his performance is so funny. Jackie Chan is also very good, the chemistry between those two is perfect. Noemie Lenoir looks so beautiful and delivers a very good performance that is very important to the movie. The secondary role of Yvan Attel as the french cab driver is hilarious and turns to be also very important. Hiroyuki Sanada gives us a very good villain that kinda redeems himself at the end and Youki Kudoh as Soo Yung it was a short role but also a decent one. In conclusion, this is one of those movies whose only purpose is to entertain people and in my opinion it succeeds in doing it.",Rush Hour 3
71,TheHonestCritic,"We have reached the end of the ""Rush Hour"" trilogy. Does it end with a bang?",10,13 December 2020,"""Rush Hour 3"" (2007), it was six years between the release of ""Rush Hour 2"" (2001) and this film. Sometimes, the extra time is necessary to bring forth a good storyline. Which is exactly what ""Rush Hour 3"" delivers, and then some! It has a great story, perfect acting, excellent sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The storyline is that a man named Kenji, played by Hiroyuki Sanada, attempts to assassinate Han, played again by Tzi Ma. Lee and Carter, played by Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, follow the trail to Paris in an attempt to stop him and the Chinese triads. Soo-Young, who is this time played by Zhang Jingchu, has been kidnapped again, like in the first movie. When I first heard the spoiler-free synopsis of the plot, I was worried that it might go back to the original roots of the first film and be too familiar and cliched. However, the script writer managed to make the recurring concept new and fresh. It was it's own distinct story and it did not draw any references to the first movie, which is a common mistake among most sequels. On some occasions, it has some callbacks. But, they're clever and utilized at just the right moments to help tie the story together. The storyline did exactly what it was supposed to do. It kept me invested, guessing and laughing all the way through. All of the acting is stellar in this film. But once again, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker steal the show as usual. Hiroyuki Sanada plays a great villain and Zhang Jingchu does a great job with playing Soo-Young. In the first movie, she was played by Julia Hsu, but Zhang is an excellent replacement for her. The rest of the acting from the whole cast is fantastic as well! All of the sets/locations are beautiful and create a great atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in Los Angeles or Paris! The special effects are well-done and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Lalo Schifrin is yet another home run. Lalo Schifrin is one of my top 10 movie composers, and this film score is no exception. ""Rush Hour 3"" is a fun and exciting ride from beginning to end. It's not quite as good as the first two films, but it's still fantastic and very enjoyable. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Rush Hour 3"", or the first two films, go and watch them today. I do recommend watching the first two films before you watch this one though. It will make ""Rush Hour 3"" that much better. When you watch it, be prepared to laugh out loud!",Rush Hour 3
72,curtis-8,"Good fun, but not as polished as RH2",7,13 August 2007,"I thought RH3 was good fun, but it was obviously a rush job (bad Joel Siegel pun not intended). The action and comedy bit highlights are there (to a lesser degree than in the past), but they aren't really tied together. Seemed like Ratner and the screenwriters needed more time to fill out the story, Jackie needed more time to come up with his elaborate fight sequences, and Tucker needed more time to work on comedy riffs. If they'd started earlier or put the release off until Xmas or next Summer, this could have been much better. Many of the bits don't have the expected payoffs and there seems to be dialog sections and other expected scenes missing. For instance, it would have been nice to see a quick flashback to Lee's orphanage days to deepen the relationship between him and his now-criminal ""brother."" And it would have been nice for Rosalyn Sanchez to make an appearance at some point (near the end, in some kind of coda would have worked)since she is the subject of an early conversation (and because she'd be a great addition to ANY movie). And a few other explanations and clarifications of plot would have helped (such as why does Polanski's French cop tell Chan and Tucker they could go to jail for a long time for bringing a gun on the plane to Paris--and then let them keep it?) So, I liked it, but it didn't rise to the super-slick popcorn movie heights of RH2 or Shanghai Knights, Chan's best American flicks. maybe Rater can fix it in the DVD release.",Rush Hour 3
73,ExpendableMan,Decent enough but nowhere near as good as the first two,6,18 January 2008,"Proving the old Hollywood adage of ""if it ain't broke, throw money at it until it's worn out and over-exposed,"" Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker reunite for the third installment in the Rush Hour franchise, the best buddy-movie series out there which doesn't have 'Lethal Weapon' in the title. And aside from looking older (Chan), bigger (Tucker) and having a new location (Paris), Rush Hour 3 follows the formula set by the previous installments to a tee. The two lead's natural camaraderie is as watchable as ever and there is a wealth of comedy and action scenes to keep audiences entertained, but somehow it isn't quite as good as it was back in 1998 and 2001.In the six years since the last movie, Detective Carter (Tucker) and Inspector Lee's (Chan) friendship seems to have taken a battering. It could be because while Lee remains a high profile career cop trusted with guarding Chinese senators, Carter has been busted down to traffic duties. Or maybe it's got something to do with Carter accidentally shooting Lee's girlfriend and putting her in hospital? Either way, Lee is a bit reluctant to keep their friendship afloat but when a Triad sniper interrupts a speech by a Chinese councillor, they once more find their paths intertwined as they set off on a trip to France to kick bad guys off the Eiffel tower.It's all good fun but what immediately becomes apparent is that the action is taking something of a back seat to the comedy this time. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing as some sequences (The visit to a martial arts school in particular) are hilarious, Chan's bewildered everyman bouncing off Tucker's fast talking flyboy with ease. However, the action has been toned down a bit and features what is fast becoming a staple of Hollywood action movies - safe, blood free violence where people simply fall over after getting shot and the gruesome deaths occur off-camera. Mind you, given that Chan has been flinging himself through glass, off buildings and into Samo Hung for the better part of forty years, he probably deserves a break...Not all of the humour is easy to recommend though and some of it seems entirely implausible. Their treatment at the hands of the French authorities where the two are strung up and beaten for no reason whatsoever stretches the limits of believability almost to breaking point. Their relationship with a French cab driver meanwhile veers awkwardly off-course, turning what should have been a hilarious sub-plot into a mish mash of badly delivered lines and awkward flag waving that'll get anyone who isn't from America rolling their eyes in disbelief.Furthermore, it's hard not to shake the impression that everyone is merely going through the motions. There's a dangerous oriental lady assassin to contend with again but she has none of the intensity that Zhang Ziyi brought with her last time around. Then there's Lee and Carter's traditional ""fall out and make up"" sequence and Max Von Sydow's incredibly predictable turn as a supportive dignitary, not to mention the abrupt ending which culminates in our two heroes dancing to music that only the audience can hear.That being said, if you enjoyed Rush Hour 1 and 2 like I did, it's a safe bet you'll like this one too. The franchise may be running out of steam and Brett Ratner's directorial skills are fast approaching mediocrity, but you can still get a lot of laughs out of it. Besides, it's worth watching just to see Chan and Tucker squaring off again.",Rush Hour 3

The jokes are largely hit-and-miss and the supposed satire of the American, Chinese and French culture don't work either.Perhaps the passage of time has already hampered Jackie's range of stunt choreography because the fight scenes are surprisingly banal for a Jacke Chan flick.

But Jackie Chan and his co-stars still do some amazing martial arts set pieces-one involving a rug is pretty cool and another facing off again against multiple people is amazing. I think Chris Tucker is trying a bit too hard...sometimes he seems to be parodying himself.....but he still is well worth paying to see. They still have a great rapport. Plot? No clue......but I enjoyed the first two movies and I think this one was pretty good too. I think the first one was the best and the second one was a little worse and this is a little worse again, but it is pretty decent as second sequels go. It was interesting to see Brett Ratner's subtle digs against US foreign policy via the statements of the French taxi driver George (Yvan Attal) who wishes to be an American movie star and kill people mindlessly for no reason and which Tucker echoes. That said, if you want some well-made fluff and to relax in a movie theater in some nice air-conditioning for two hours, this is a great choice!

While the quality isn't any worse, this is getting tiring. Not the plot, not the thrilling action and astonishing fight scenes, but the humour. It's not as funny as it used to be and that's a shame. The story is way better than in the second, considering it's heavily tied to the first movie. There are interesting new characters played by interesting actors, like Hiroyuki Sanada and Yvan Attal. If you've written quite long reviews of the first two it's really hard trying to write something new about the third one. Everything that was good or bad is good or bad in this one as well - with the difference that some jokes are beginning to feel really tiring. First one is the best out of the three. Rush Hour 3 has better story than the second one though, since after seeing the third one, Rush Hour 2 feels distant considering few characters that are in the first and third but not in the second.

A collection of 'scenes' thrown together, rather than a screenplay. The comedy scenes are often overlong and in poor taste (for a so-called PG film) - why do that unless you just don't have a story? (""If it bends, it's Comedy -- if it breaks, it's not."" - Alan Alda from C&M (not good comedy, anyway).For that much of a budget, you'd think they would come up with a plot first. Despite all that, there are some funny bits - but the timing isn't at the 'Abbot & Costello' level by a long shot.I also think the presence of automatic weapons in the hands of the bad guys ruins the 'harmless fun' mood of a typical Chan vehicle. There are no 'stunts' that can really dodge bullets, so why go there? In fact, the villains show up and start shooting in public a few times - you'd think the police would show up and check it out.I agree with the Review of our colleague Saar Vardi (the lead review today) - Chan looks like he's sleepwalking. His character is not particularly heroic, funny, or effective this time.

81,kooleshwar,"Great Fun,......But Where was the climax!!??",7,21 August 2007,"Another sequel, of another movie that i was a fan off, and this this time with an actor who I've liked since when i can remember.Jackie Chan may not have delivered path breaking cinema or enjoy the iconic or cult status that Bruce Lee got, but what he has always delivered has been good fun, with the right blend of humour, action, and naughtiness. And he has been doing that for more years than I can remember.Needless to say despite this being a sequel, i did have some expectations from this movie, and expected at least the regular Jackie Chan fare.The whole hullabaloo about Cris Tucker, and his paycheck ensured that i knew that he would be getting more footage than normal in this movie, and was the only reason i was a bit apprehensive of expecting to much.Well i was right on all counts.This movie was fun, this movie was a typical Jackie Chan movie, this movie had a lot more of Chris Tucker.But there were surprises.Jackie Chan was not the typical mystical far-eastern cop that he played in the first 2 movies, hes a different person in this movie, its like the filmmakers have actually factored in the influence of living in America and the close proximity to a person like Chris Tucker and written his role.For a long time, maybe even for the first time since he crossed over, he has displayed the boyish traits such as the desire to be with women, and cracked adult jokes, got me reminiscing about his earlier Chinese movies that often even had risqué humour.Instead of the regular slapstick fair JC displayed dry humour that was TOTALLY REFRESHING, IT MADE THE REGULAR SLAP STICK HUMOUR FROM CHRIS TUCKER MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE, AND ALSO ENSURED THAT WE WERE LAUGHING THROUGHOUT.Humour is something this movie has scored really, really big.Acting was top-notch all around, and thanks to what i said earlier CT who has the ability to get on ones nerve after a while was totally enjoyable.Noime Lenoir displayed her sizzling body but lacked the spark that I've seen in one of her earlier films (asterix and Cleopatra, yes i know i like cheesy cinema and After the Sunset).Technically this film was superb and despite what I'm sure was a limited budget, if what they say the paid Chris Tucker is true. This movie is as good as the best with a similar budget(excluding the actors remuneration) and type (action, stunts are expensive you know).There were lots of good scenes but ones that come to mind are the Kung Fu school, the hotel scene, and the french taxi driver.Action was Good as usual with the regular, prop usage, falls, and fist fights that you would expect from a typical JC movie, the big stunt was missing but was not missed, the sequence on the Eiffel Tower was particularly good AND HAD ME FULLY WARMED UP FOR THE BIG JC STYLE CLIMAX..........................THAT NEVER CAME.Yup this movie ends so abruptly its almost a shock, I was really enjoying this movie so much and so looking forward to the whole Shiafun and JC kicking major TRIAD ass when BAM, THE MOVIE ENDS.WTF.I may have taken this harder than most but almost every I spoke to agreed with me that they didn't expect the end and that 90 min is to short for a movie, especially when your enjoying it so much.Thus despite the fact that i had great fun in this movie and that it excelled in every department, and even though it was a great sequel and was a rare instance of meeting expectations in recent times, I have to say i was a but disappointed with this movie and the end especially.I know some people like to leave craving for more, but if you ask me I payed good money to be fully satisfied and not to miss the climax (hehe this actually sounds like something else and is even more relevant because of it).The end is almost always the best part of any movie and I'm sorry to say that this movie will not live up to its expectations in that department.Still i would recommend, this movie for all audiences (families please avoid), and is a must watch in the theater itself, although i confess that it will be equally enjoyable in any format.FANS SHOULD NOT AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ANY COST.So strap yourself in and enjoy the ride.-s THE ENDING, THE ENDING AND NOTHING BUT THE ENDING.+/-s to much footage to CT (yes but handled brilliantly).+s SUPERB HUMOUR, good action, GREAT TECHNICALLY, good acting, great overall package.total 7.5/10 (I've changed the rating a dozen times from 7 to 8 but in the end I've decided on a 7.5, the surprise end,the short length and the lack of a big climax is just too bitter a pill to swallow).",Rush Hour 3
82,kurciasbezdalas,"I'm not a big fan of Rush Hour, but this was really enjoyable",10,9 November 2008,"As a big Jackie Chan's fan, I never was a big Rush Hour's fan or any other American Jackie Chan's movie, because in those films Jackie rarely get a chance to self-actualize. This film is no exception, actually it's a disaster for Jackie's fans because not only Jackie didn't get much of the show (he was sharing it with Chris Tucker, who was good actually but right now I'm judge this film as if I was watching it only because of Jackie) but they also were using those digital effects (or what a hell are they called?). But still everything in this movie was enjoyable. There were few good fighting scenes, even Chris Tucker was fighting and it looked great. There was one very impressive car chase scene and a sword fight on Eiffel Tower. There were some funny scenes, especially with Chris Tucker. So this film really works, it's really entertaining. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker make a great team and I sure hope that they will return for Rush Hour 4.",Rush Hour 3
83,AdrenalinDragon,It was very good but I think the series should end here,7,11 August 2007,"So again we are back with a sequel of the Rush Hour series. The first two were pretty good comedy movies staring both Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker as cop partners with a typical plot with good action mixed with comedy. This one follows the same structure, but how does it hold up?If you liked the first two, you'd probably enjoy this one. There's quite a few decent action scenes and again Chris Tucker's character delivers a lot of the jokes and Jackie Chan's still got the awesome moves and stunts but is it just me or was the action a bit tamer compared to the other two? Not that its much of a problem since I still enjoyed it but just something I noticed. Anyway, usual plot including a kidnapping and this time they go to Paris, and the two meet up with a person who wants to be like a spy.It was very good and I'm glad the series is still working but perhaps the series should end here. It's hard to tell, but usually 3 movies is enough and the first one started like 10 years ago so its a rather large gap. The movie delivered a few laughs, some action scenes, and for what it was I thought it stayed true to its previous movie structures. I'm glad that Chris and Jackie still work well together, but to be honest I think the series should end with this one before it goes overload and loses what made it fun in the first place.",Rush Hour 3
84,helmutty,Rush hour 3!,7,9 August 2007,"I admit it that it is funny and some jokes really make me laugh but now, we are focusing on the story plot which is straight-forward and its action scenes are not very impressive for a Jackie Chan movie. If you had watched Rush hour 1 and 2. You will realise that this movie is pretty much similar to the two movies. The director is the director of the big-action X-men 3. The jokes are the best in the movie, nothing else. With all the jokes, this seems to be more of a comedy more than a action movie. Even when they are fighting, they do not take things seriously. The only change is the event takes place in Paris. Other than that, this movie seems to be recycled.The story is dead simple. Two buddies, Lee (Jackie Chan) and James (Chris tucker) go to Paris to find for more clues about the Chinese Triad crew. The story is something like that. And with jokes added.Nothing is impressive. The jokes, some of them are the same dirty jokes and fighting scenes, Jackie Chan can do better than that. Though, it is straight-forward and has recycled jokes, I still had fun watching it. If only it had great action.If you want to watch a Jackie Chan movie, this is harmless for you. It may be fun but you can't expect great action from this. The fight scenes are simple and last for around 5 minutes. It is not very worth to watch it in Cinema unless you have a lot of money to spare. It may be loud at some time but it is just like a comedy with some goofing-action. Unless you like Jackie Chan, you can wait for the DVD.",Rush Hour 3
85,David_Frames,Why?,1,15 August 2007,"Rush hour was originally produced under the working title 'demographic splice missile' but then a focus group sampling the target audience found that too obscure and thus the title was changed to reflect the time the session took place. That the original was such a huge hit is testament to the fact that the cynicism that green lights the likes of this derivative, formulaic toss is very well founded. American audiences really are that easy and frankly, if this is what they want, they deserve a double shunting each.To recap the original partnered the matalan Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan with 'funnyman' Chris Tucker. Why the inverted commas? Because Tucker, a man with a voice that sounds like the a recording of a pig being slaughtered, is a witless hysteric whose trademark rapid fire noise ruins any film in which it features. The fifth element might have survived the ridiculous production design by gay fashion moron Jean Paul Gautier but it had no chance against Tucker's high pitched squealing. Why anyone of any age, sex, colour or nationality would find this milk curdling sound audible yet alone funny, is one of the great mysteries of the modern film era. Regardless millions of mentally retarded wide eyed drones laughed the first film to blockbuster status  awed by Chan's chop sockey manipulation of common objects in contrived situations, bowled over by Tucker's bolt on wisecracks and positively arse over face at Brett Ratner's workmanlike direction.Rush Hour 2 followed in which the crazy cops did more of the same and were rewarded by a gross that made you pinch yourself with the severed fingers of the woman you'd killed in that first flush of anger. Were American ethnic minorities really so underrepresented in the studios annual output that they'd flock to see this in their millions? To put Rush Hour's coinage into some kind of perspective, imagine Shanghai Noon making $300m at the American box office. Doesn't feel right does it? No, dark forces were at work here  jet black in fact and now they're back for another bite of an already maggot ridden cherry.Rush 3 was much delayed, not least because Tucker, a man in such high demand that he's been offered precisely nothing between Rush Hour movies, held out for an obscene $25m payday. There's no mystery as to why you don't see CT in anything else  what else can he do? He's completely hopeless. Cynical enough to rest on his non-existent laurels and obviously as clueless as the rest of us as to why he can become a multi-millionaire for doing absolutely sod all, he returns here to extend a franchise that was tired from the moment it started. The irrelevant plot is your standard washing line arrangement onto which a string of predictable comic and action set pieces are hung. The action shifts to Paris for reasons that won't concern you and from that point it really is an easy assignment for Hollywood script software B.A.N.G (the b-movie action narrative generator) here given the non de plume 'Jeff Nathanson'. America hating cab driver George is introduced as a clumsy stab at satirizing Franco-US relations post Iraq but this being a Brett Ratner movie the joke is as weak as a pint of p*ss topped up with tap water. George becomes a convert to American aggression of course but an attempt at self-deprecation 'It feels good to kill people for no reason' is lost on the Christopher Pike, bleeping chair crowd this thing is aimed at. If the jokes have all the polish of one of those grimy vans onto which someone has hand written 'clean me', what about the action? Its pedestrian stuff, predictable seen it all before cut and paste histrionics underscoring Ratner's reputation as a hack par nonchalance. To his eternal shame Roman Polanksi has an extended cameo here and considering his past it really is something to say he's never looked more embarrassed and thank God Ingmar Bergman died recently because the sight of Max Von Sydow in this mindless trudge might have killed him otherwise.Punishingly poor and half an hour too long at just 90 minutes, Rush Hour 3 is the reason that people talk about the slow death of cinema, though in this case its a case of suicide. Its not that it's risible, every year has its crop of photochemical waste, it's simply that it's done so well. Inexplicable. Interminable. Intolerable.",Rush Hour 3
86,saarvardi,It just didn't work out for me in the end,5,10 August 2007,"Rush Hour 3 was fun, but nothing special or new. Chan looked a bit tired throughout the film, and baring one hilarious singing scene, it seemed as if he was sleepwalking his role in this one. Tucker was the only thing good about the movie, which really made me wonder why the hell this funny guy doesn't work more often. He does have a hilarious comedic timing, and he seems to be in good shape... oh well, some things will always remain a mystery to me.Other than that, the plot had this gigantic ""been there, done that"" feel to me, this time revolving around Chinese mafia intrigues which span around half the globe (America, Asia and most particularly France, Europe). The cultural jokes and references were cute but way too overdone as well, and the action sequences were extremely short (as was the whole film, by the way). Sure, there were some fun points here and there, Roman Polanski delivered a cute cameo and the Parisian settings were a nice change of scenery for the more adrenaline rushed aspects of the story - but as a whole, I felt this just wasn't enough for a franchise this big.I wanted to like it more, particularly after being pleasantly surprised by many of the other sequels this year (Pirates 3, Spider-Man 3, Evan Almighty, Live Free and Die Hard and Ocean's Thirteen to be precise), but it just didn't work for me in the end.I gave this a disappointed 5/10.",Rush Hour 3
87,RCWjr,"Good, but time to stop",7,16 September 2007,"I am a fan of the Rush Hour franchise. I think Jackie and Chris work great together. Ratner knows how to work their chemistry. The latest entry comes after a long break and though still funny, shows the ages of time.Chris Tucker this time out is the funniest out of the 3 films. I don't think he had a line that didn't have a joke somewhere in it. Jackie brings the usual to his Inspector Lee role. I had read where the action was toned back in this entry. I beg to differ. I felt there was much more physical action this time around than the first two combined.My one complaint was the last act of the film. It roles by too fast and the ending is very abrupt. It is like they couldn't figure out how to end the film so they just cut it off right after our heroes are triumphant. There needed to be a bridge scene between the final action sequence and the end, as has been the case in the previous two films. But it just kind of ends giving you the feeling something is left out.All in all, enjoyed the film, was a good afternoon diversion from the ""real"" world. I think with this entry the book should be closed and allow these characters to move on.",Rush Hour 3
88,guyfromjerzee,"OK, enough already",5,12 August 2007,"This is officially the worst film out of the ""Rush Hour"" series, and I was sorely disappointed. I understand that these movies are not meant to be monumental in quality. That didn't stop me from enjoying ""Rush Hour 1 and 2."" But in this third installment, the jokes have all run dry. This sequel best showcases Chris Tucker's weaknesses as a comic actor. He is undoubtedly a very funny stand-up comic, but unfortunately even the funniest stand-up comics don't always make smooth transitions to film. The problem with putting stand-up comics in movies is they have the tendency to improvise whenever possible. The problem is that they have to improvise within the parameters of each scene. They don't possess the same freedom and imagination they have when using their material on stage. It doesn't help that a lot of Tucker's material was recycled from the previous two films. The film opens with Tucker dancing like Michael Jackson in the middle of a busy L.A. street. Why is he doing that? Because people thought it was funny when he did it in the previous two films. There's no valid reason for his character to be listening to his I-Pod, singing and dancing along, when he should be directing traffic.Both Tucker and Jackie Chan seem to be going through the motions this time around. The chemistry is only barely there. Besides, the novelty has worn off by now. We get it. One's an Asian, by-the-numbers cop who doesn't speak much English and the other's a goofy LAPD detective who can't shut up. You can't expect to keep milking jokes out of that one premise.There are some spectacular action sequences, but as a comedy the film doesn't quite click. The jokes in the other ""Rush Hour"" flicks were pretty cheap, but in this one it didn't even feel like the filmmakers and actors were trying. The plot involves the unlikely duo going to France, so naturally we're bombarded by every French stereotype imaginable. Stereotypes can definitely be funny. As I've said in previous reviews, political correctness is the enemy of comedy. But when you recycle the same tired old stereotypes we've seen billions upon billions of times, how am I supposed to laugh? When the characters get to France, they hop into a cab with a French cab driver who hates Americans....because he's French. With movies like these, why shouldn't the French hate us Americans? And of course, we're bombarded by more tired Asian stereotypes. In one incredibly lame scene, there's a Chinese character named ""You"" and another named ""Me."" Hahaha, how friggin' original! So we're treated to another tired rendition of the classic ""Who's on the First"" act, with Tucker asking the character, ""Who are you?"" ""You."" ""What's your name?"" ""You."" I don't think I need to go on. It was bad enough when Morris Day and Jerome tried to re-create it in ""Purple Rain."" We don't need to suffer through it again. I hope Abbott and Costello rise from the grave and punch Brett Ratner in the face.On a happy note, the film did end with the song ""War, What Is It Good For?"" with Chan and Tucker dancing into the moonlight. That was one callback to the previous flicks that I can never get tired of.",Rush Hour 3
89,jed-estes,No Chimistry Anymore,3,19 September 2007,"I like Rush Hour 1 and I loved Rush Hour 2 but the third one was a pitiful excuse for a film. The first one was your basic action film and it also threw in a lot comedy for people who need that kind of thing in their film. It was sort of a knock off of the Beverly Hills Cop formula combined with the action stunts of The Lethal Weapon series. I found it to be quite hart warming and light. Part two was a thrill ride that packed all the right punches, it made me laugh a lot and feel stunned by the action set pieces. Two is easily one of the top ten action films of the decade. So, when I heard that a third film in the saga was going to be released I was ecstatic. But that only lasted until the film was over. It was a dud. What ever chemistry Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker had had in one and two was lost over the last five years because I just felt they were not into the film. It seemed as if they just phoned it in. Tucker never made me laugh and Jackie's stunts were lacking. The most horrible scene in the film involves the guys interrogating a witness who will not speak in English while a nun is present. I do not find the scene to be religoesly offensive but it is certainly offensive to any one who likes a smart edgy film. The five minute dialog scene plays like a five year old wrote and they are the only one's who could possible get enjoyment from this film, unless your someone in your 60's our 70's who likes film with no edge. And the film would be fine with no edge, except it was marketed to teens and adults who expect more substance than these other age groups. The film should have been rated PG and toned down more so the audience that could have enjoyed it more would have seen it. But that's just another stupid thing about this film, like Brett Ratner's direction lately. Someone send him back to film school, he has not made a decent film sense the Red Dragon. In closing I will say that if they make a forth one I will go and hope to god it's as good as two because that was good movie.",Rush Hour 3
90,samseescinema,This time it feels fresh. Or at least fresh enough.,7,10 August 2007,"Rush Hour 3 reviewed by Samuel OsbornIf I'm not mistaken, Rush Hour 3 is the final sequel in a long train of franchise continuations to be released during Summer '07. With Spiderman 3, 28 Weeks Later, Pirates of the Caribbean 3, Shrek 3, Oceans 13, Live Free or Die Hard, Fantastic Four 2, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Hostel 2, Evan Almighty, and The Bourne Ultimatum on its heels, Rush Hour 3 certainly finds itself in a thick, polluted cloud of over-sized expectations and bristling fans. It's been an exhausting Summer. But luckily, unlike Spidey and Jack Sparrow, the buzz around Detective Li and Detective Carter of Rush Hour 3 hasn't risen above a gentle hum. And with the tentpole mentality out of the way (no midnight screenings, juicy on-set rumors, profit-minded blog spoilers), the lack of heady expectation surrounding this sixth trilogy capper of the season makes Rush Hour 3 all the more tolerable. Let's say it's like a Spring Roll: a flimsy, transparent outer-layer of action that bounds the healthy innards of comedy to make a fine, single entrée of a genre. The formula has aged; in fact, the whole genre has all but died since its advent with the original Rush Hour. But call that a blessing because Rush Hour 3 is a near-exact clone of its predecessors. It wouldn't work if we could remember the films' similarities.That thin outer-layer of action breading involves the Parisian Triads and their attempted assassination of Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma), assigned charge of Detective Li (Jackie Chan). Driven by honor and pride and whatever else Westerners perceive the Chinese to be motivated by, Detective Li sets off to hunt the Triads to their core. Loud and racially alight, Detective Carter (Chris Tucker) tags along , using Li's investigation as a vacation from his duties as a lowly Los Angeles traffic controller. As is standard to a buddy cop picture, the unlikely pairing of Jackie Chan to Chris Tucker is the film's lifeblood. Jeff Nathanson's script does well to load Tucker's performance with fantastic one-liners tailored to his shrieking timbre with ample opportunities for Chan to swing about as a one-man circus. This is where the two belong: with Tucker as the mouthpiece and Chan as the dropkick. Watching Jackie Chan trying to maneuver a snappy one liner is like watching him try to swallow cardboard. Not funny in the right way. And though his martial arts are still more dizzying than anything a skinny white boy like myself can imagine, Chan seems to have grown past his prime. Innocent and smiling, dying to entertain, Chan was the modern-day answer to silent-film legends. He flung himself into dastardly stunts for our gosh-wow amazement and did so with a giddy, boyish pride. He still does so here, but it's apparent that he's grown past fifty. I hate to call that a criticism since fifty-three year old stuntmen don't grow on trees, but the effects are sadly noticeable. For a standard buddy cop picture, Brett Ratner seems the right choice as a standard director. Not especially interesting in any way (except, maybe, for ruining the X-Men franchise), Ratner directs the film rather competently. He leads it along at an efficient pace and never lets creativity stand in the way of the good, expected joke. And for this Rush Hour 3 is fine. It's no better than any other franchise decency released this Summer, but because its been six years since the last Rush Hour was released, this time it feels fresh. Or at least fresh enough. Samuel Osborn",Rush Hour 3
91,simonparker1990,I'm a bit Rushed out now,6,10 August 2007,"Until recently I hadn't seen the first two Rush Hour movies, it was only after a friend actually lent them to me, after calling me an idiot for missing them all these years, that I actually managed to see what they were like. While they were undoubtedly entertaining and pretty light hearted blockbuster fun, I couldn't see the huge fuss surrounding them. They're funny, the action is good, but there are many other better movies out there that I could think of. Anyway this is all besides the point, the fact is that there are a hell of a lot of Rush Hour fans out there. Fans who will lap up any Rush Hour movie that comes out because they find the formula so enjoyable. I am not one of these die hard fans, I can take or leave the franchise and so I was looking forward to Rush Hour 3, but not overly anticipating it like the friend I went and saw it with. And as I predicted my friend adored the movie, he came out saying how brilliant it was and how they should make a Rush Hour 4 as soon as possible. Now that thought actually terrified me, you see while I enjoyed Rush Hour 3, I also felt it was a step too far. The series isn't exactly well known for its originality, and I felt the third movie was pushing it a bit too far. The movies storyline was a rehash of what we've seen before, the action sequences seemed a bit tired until an amazing bit at the end, and even the humour at times felt a bit too familiar. Rush Hour 3 just feels like we've seen it all before. A lot of people complained about Rush Hour 2 being a rehash, well this movie is worse, a lot worse. Matters aren't helped by the fact that some jokes can be very hit or miss and the storyline is so obvious it unreal, I swear if you can't figure out who the villain is in the first few minutes then you are a blithering idiot.Part of the charm of the first two Rush Hour movies was the chemistry between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. This thankfully has remained intact in the third movie and so the movie is still enjoyable because of the pair. In fact the moment the pair are split up from one another the movie actually seems to nose dive. They're very rarely apart, but there was one scene in the middle I noticed the change of quality instantly. The pair are separated and so they can't bounce off one another, when they don't bounce off one another I noticed that the pair alone aren't even a tenth as funny. However, when they are together the script seems a lot better. Chris Tucker can be either irritating or comedic genius in my mind. For the most part he is closer to genius than irritating, although at times his constant screeching still does start to grate. Jackie Chan has some good comedic moments, although he's still much better when he's fighting then when he's saying anything. The supporting cast are a bit of a letdown this time around. Hiroyuki Sanada's interesting villain, Kenji, is never really explored to his full potential, so he feels a bit two dimensional at some times. Max von Sydow also felt a bit flat for the majority of the movie, leading me to believe he did it for the pay check and nothing more.Another part of the success of the previous two movies was the nice balance of action and comedy. Here I found the focus much more on comedy than action, undoubtedly there are some good action sequences in the film, but most are played out for comedy and nothing more. The fight in a kung-fu school is amusing at first, but lasts too long and so its potential is squandered. A car chase through the streets of Paris felt a bit flat as well. In fact there are only two action set pieces that really stood out for me in the entire movie. A nice humorous one with Chan's encounter with a lady, its priceless and very funny. And a superbly executed fight on the Eiffel Tower at the end, its the first serious fight of the movie, and boy it doesn't disappoint. The comedy side of the movie succeeds at some times, but other times it actually feels a little bit uninspired. A sequence where Tucker and Chan sing might have sounded genius on paper, and I thought it would be genius when the scene began, but it quickly became apparent it wasn't very funny. This time round the comedy also feels a bit tedious as I felt I'd seen it all before, jokes are rehashed and brought back to make the audience laugh a third time. Well sorry, but a joke first time is funny, a joke a second time is amusing but its power is lost, a joke for a third time is just boring and a cheating way out of making something new.Overall Rush Hour 3 is one of the more mediocre movies of Summer 2007, while its nice to see the characters back on our screen, its a bit irritating to see them in virtually the last two movies again. So this is unfortunately for Rush Hour fans only, its still worth checking out, but perhaps it might be a bit better to wait and rent than to pay to see it on the cinema.",Rush Hour 3
92,Cocacolaguy912-2,A film that suffers from being rushed...,6,16 August 2007,"Before I went to see Rush Hour 3 I read many reviews. Very mixed, but these were the general thoughts...""Not enough action."", ""A Chris Tucker movie."", ""Same jokes used."", etc.I want to think that most of Rush Hour 3's problems are attributed to the fact that it was just a rushed film. It just goes by so quickly that it seems like the film is not even 90 minutes long. The first two films are not that much longer, Rush Hour 2 is also 90 minutes, but they had good paces and weren't lazy productions.As for what some of the other reviews say, I say this: Jackie Chan is getting old, which may be the reason why the film didn't seem to have as much action. There is nothing anyone can do about this, the film would suck if they had replaced Chan with a younger martial arts actor. I will say I do think that the story line, in all its simplicity, did center around Jackie and not Tucker. I think that Tucker may have gotten more screen time, however...and I will say he was still pretty damn funny.However, the true laughs are brought on by Yvan Attal, who, as their French cab driver, is inspired by the violence taking place around him to become an, ""American who kills for no reason."" I am an American and I thought that was hilarious.The bottom line is this: Rush Hour 3 is lazy, rushed, and not as good as the first two. However, it isn't terrible, and it is probably worth seeing if you enjoyed the first two.",Rush Hour 3

Rush Hour 3 is high-octane action with a generous measure of comedy, rolled out into another box-office smash hit.Rush Hour 3 sports an impressive budget of $140 million (USD) and although its total takings have been somewhat slow in showing an overall profit, it has chalked up $135 million (USD) since its limited worldwide release.It's much more of the same: hot shot martial arts cop from Hong Kong, Lee (Jackie Chan), teams up with big-talking player turned cop, Carter (Chris Tucker), to combat a nefarious criminal syndicate. The action comes thick and fast and fans of the series will relish the international venues showcasing some of the fight sequences.These two actors have come a long way together and their on screen chemistry constantly filters through. Rush Hour 3 is formulaic, and it follows on in the footsteps of a successful franchise. The old axiom holds true  if it ain't broke, don't fix it.It's east meets west in an even bigger action adventure than ever before. The pulsating fight sequences and stunts are simply astounding.

94,thomas-hardcastle-2,Brett Ratner Writes His Own Obituary With This Truly Crap Film...,3,6 January 2009,"Well, let's face it - this was never going to be a classic. However, there are sequels that are not as good as the previous offering, and then there are God-awful, art-less, money-making piles of turd...very much like Rush Hour 3.As an audience, we've more or less had enough of Chris Tucker by the end of Rush Hour 2, but take a look at his CV, and you'll see that the poor guy couldn't get any work after the second movie, so along came Jackie Chan to help his mate out, allowing him to reprise his role as quite possibly the most annoying man on the planet.Brett Ratner too has effectively directed his own demise, with a distinct lack of vision, and what can only be described as sheer contempt for his audience.The film is set in France, yet French people speak English to one another, like it's an everyday occurrence, using Jewish insults like, ""schmuck,"" to enhance the Gallic feel of the overall piece. As well as this, Jackie talks to his own brother in English throughout the film. I think it's terrific that the English language has reached every corner of the planet, and has made foreigners talk to one another without using their mother tongues.What would a film set in France be without the predictable plot settings of a burlesque club, or the Eiffel Tower? What would France be without a rude taxi driver who speaks perfect English, using slang as though he'd lived in America all his life? As for the fighting...was there any fighting? I've seen more kung-fu in a courtroom drama. There is a fight at the end, somewhere, with more cuts in it than a Michael Bay film, inadvertently confirming the common belief amongst Jackie Chan fans that the superstar was past it long ago.""Let's end the film on the Eiffel Tower..."" was the cry of the writer (well, if you can call him a writer). I've written better scripts sitting on the toilet. The final showcase merely stated the case for never making another Rush Hour film ever again...or giving Chris Tucker any more money.Overall, this film is a highly predictable cash-in, with no genuine taste of France anywhere in sight. The script is the worst I've seen in a long time, the kung-fu is almost non-existent, and the over-riding message is that we have been robbed for the sake of the almighty buck. A truly awful film, lacking in every good reason why cinema was created, without substance, that created a genuine feeling of nausea deep within my soul.Chris Tucker is fat too.",Rush Hour 3
95,lovintennis,Hilarious except for one thing,5,11 August 2017,"Chris Tucker avoids the cab driver's grudge toward the U.S. early in the movie and drives his mind the other way by shoving the Star-Spangled Banner down his throat. Other than that, he's absolutely hilarious and by far one of the best Michael Jackson imitations. The opening's a part I can't get enough of-- hilarious.",Rush Hour 3
96,vovazhd,The formula runs dry,4,1 January 2008,"Rush Hour 3 follows the adventure of detectives Carter and Lee (played by Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan) as they follow an important case into Paris. The film is very similar to the first two, using identical situations in many cases. There is the hostage element, the usual personal quarrels between the two partners, the surprise bad guy, the main bad guy (always Asian) who dies by falling onto a crushable object, and the heroes that escape by using a parachute/tarp. I could go on with the similarities I noticed, but you should get the idea. I loved these things from the first movies, but there is nothing exciting thrown into the mix here. It is practically all recycled material. It makes the movie extremely predictable once you catch the pattern. I wish I could say that the specific plot ideas were different, but they are not. The only real change is that the setting is moved to Paris, which has potential but is made uninteresting and stereotypical.The action scenes are quite good, so you will get your moneys worth if you come in just for that. The martial arts studio sequence definitely stands out, especially during the fight with the giant. The comedy felt dry; I admit that I had a few laughs, but most were tentative or short. The acting was fine, with Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan giving their usual charismatic performances, but its nothing better than the first two.If you really enjoyed the first two, then you might still like this one. But if you thought they were merely decent, then you'd best pass this one up.",Rush Hour 3
97,Batkid1,An under-rated fun film sequel of the year.,7,3 November 2007,"I enjoyed the first two films immensely and didn't see anything bad with this film with the exception of a lazy storyline, but that's not an entirely bad thing. Th film is just supposed to be a fun, mindless hour of action, comedic mayhem and having our buddies, Chan and Tucker, reunite.SOme characters from the first film return as well and there are more then enough secondary characters that tend to steal the show as is common in the series. The French taxi cab driver almost makes Tucker and CHan look silly in comparison!The end credits are a hoot as usual and I hope this series doesn't just stop here!Just watch and have fun!",Rush Hour 3
98,powerfull_jedi,Rush Hour still has it...but...,7,13 October 2007,"I remember back to when Rush Hour 3 was just a gag being told by Chris Tucker on one of the outtakes of the second movie, it was a joke, but we all knew it was coming. It's was just a matter of when... I saw it today and I'm glad to say Rush Hour 3 retains all the same action and comedy that has been the hallmark of this franchise. Rush Hour 3 doesn't disappoint, but I do have some complaints. Rush Hour 3 starts with Carter(Chris Tucker) directing traffic jamming to a song and busting out Michael Jackson moves and while Lee is escorting his good friend from the Chinese Embassy(as seen on Rush Hour 1). On a World Court Assembly, the Chinese ambassador is shot when he's about to reveal what appears to be an urban legend even among the Chinese triads, something called the Shay Shen, the ambassador is shot by a hit-man lurking nearby and he's spotted quickly by Lee, a chase ensues resulting in the hit-man gone missing and Carter and Lee having to work together(they got separated after an accident involving Lee's now ex-girlfriend) to solve the mystery of the ambassador's elusive figure which ultimately leads them to France where they are greeted by a snobby french policemen and shouted at by an angry anti-American-ranting taxi driver(and an interesting note: Carter gets ticked off and makes him sing the ""Star Spangled Banner"" at gunpoint after the french taxi driver continues to go on and on about the US, in later portions of the movie he does the same, only Carter and Lee don't seem to mind at all... O...K...), they set off to find that elusive person who holds the key to bringing down the Chinese mafia. As a Rush Hour fan, this third movie doesn't disappoint, it's hilarious, it's action-packed(I got a John Woo vibe from some of the shooting scenes), Jackie Chan continues to his routine and Chris Tucker in his first motion picture in years, steals the show as he provides the best laughs and even getting a proper choreographed fight scene near the end of the movie. I feel like nothing's missing at all. However some jokes are just awkward,if the french taxi driver's(played by french actor Yval Attal) rants were the scriptwriter's idea of irony and comedy, I just don't see it and nobody was laughing and I saw this movie in a Portuguese theater and the audience, even if they didn't like the US, were certainly silent in most of those scenes. It's just awkward, see Rush Hour 2 in comparison and see how not using rants(and sticking to race related jokes) makes it so much more enjoyable and entertaining. The story is also nothing special, made up of mostly parts from both the two first movies(not to mention a huge plot hole from if you saw the second movie), so don't expect any major surprises(save for one). Rush Hour 3's still got it, it's probably a bit edgier then the original movies and some dialog that should've been left out... But it was certainly worth it.",Rush Hour 3
99,JaikrishnaVS,The Rush is on more fun and less action this time around,8,10 August 2007,"The Chinese Triads have a secret to keep n Jackie and Tucker sets out to Paris to find what the secret is. This forms the pin-point juncture of the movie surrounding which the plot revolves. Fun Packed, with a large chunk of recycled jokes with too little of Jackie Chan action , thats what I felt of the movie from a totally neutral perspective.But being a Jackie Chan fan that I am , the movie is an entertainer with loads of fun n chicks. Rush hour 3 evolves on predictable lines ,but still entertainment quotient remains pretty high throughout. The on screen chemistry between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker is simply rocking . But for an avid Jackie fan like me nothing pains more than a movie , with him in the rolls and yet , not having the traditional breathtaking Jackie Stunts. But for a man aged 53 Jackie is still more fast , agile and flexible than most of his much younger co-stars. The last stunt atop the Eiffel tower was a masterstroke with Jackie and Tucker defying height and gravity to put up a creditable show .But yeah, the movie ought to be a disappointment for those who expected a still young, reckless and crazy Jackie running around and kicking arse of the do-no-gooders. There is less of the traditional slap stick comedy that one associates with Jackie Chan movies. On the whole, a must watch for Jackie fans with a very high quotient of entertainment value .",Rush Hour 3

This movie didn't need to be made, there was nothing new they wanted to show off, the script is bland and uneventful and the jokes are so tired. Unless you're an immense Chris Tucker fan then I wouldn't even watch this movie when it hits the TV, even then I'd say rent/buy his standup act instead so you can get some actual jokes out of him.Summary: An obvious attempt to rinse some cash at the box office based on the names of the actors.",Rush Hour 3
102,sullibrandon,"Too Much Tucker, Not Enough Chan",6,22 August 2007,"Nobody going to see this movie is really going to give a crap about the kind of critical ratings it will get. The only people that are going to see it are going to be the fans of the first two Rush Hours, which, though they did get progressively worse, were still enjoyable action-comedy flicks with a healthy balance of Jackie Chan cracking ribs and Chris Tucker wise-cracking. It's now been six years since we've seen these two in action, and, for the most part, they do not disappoint. However, this time around, there is far too little Jackie Chan and far too much Chris Tucker. Tucker whined and whined and whined to be paid increasingly more and more, and the result is evident. The script revolves almost entirely around Tucker's ego, which is not to say that he's not funny, but Chan fans will be disappointed in this outing.The paper-thin plot revolves around Tucker and Chan trying to discover the secrets of the most powerful mafia in the world, the Chinese mafia. After a brief stint in the States, they follow a lead to Paris, presumably a decision made by the filmmakers to plaster on SOME kind of difference between these three movies. The change of scenery doesn't really do anything for the plot, however, as, of course, mayhem ensues with the hapless Tucker causing chaos and the sensible Chan actually doing the detective work required to get to the bottom of the case.Rush Hour 3's biggest, and almost unforgivable problem, is Chris Tucker. He thinks he's the greatest thing in the world, he thinks he's God's gift to this franchise, and you can tell that's what's going through his head with every second he's on screen. He's completely forgotten that what made the original Rush Hour so enjoyable was not his constant banter, but the sheer affableness and true character that Chan brought to the movie. Jackie Chan has always had an easygoing and effortless relationship with his fans through the camera - this guy is easygoing, fun, he's not bound or constantly conscious of all the ""rules"" that go along with being a Hollywood celebrity, the guy just simply has fun and loves doing what he's doing. He's not doing it for the money, not in the least, and you can always tell that in every second that Chan is on screen, but Tucker is the exact opposite. He really needs to shut up and give some space to Jackie Chan. This outing is also far more sexual than the previous two. The first featured one or two sexual innuendos, while the second had them more liberally sprinkled, but in this outing it seems hardly five minutes go by without Tucker making some kind of sex joke, or some provocative shot of a woman, or said woman undressing.These sexual jokes do not manage to draw anything more than cheap laughs, and Chris Tucker's predictable white/Asian/French racist jokes mostly just grate on the nerves.The first Rush Hour's action scenes were kinetic, choppy, and very difficult to really understand. Once Chan's punches started flying, the camera seemed to cut randomly from shot to shot without paying much attention to what Chan was actually doing. Whereas his moves flowed like a graceful ballet of action, the camera was an uncoordinated klutz. The second Rush Hour was a clear improvement in this department as Ratner learned how to better film action scenes. In this one, he takes another step up and the way the action is filmed is the best part about the movie. Not the action itself, mind you. Normally when you watch a Jackie Chan film, he uses every single object around him creatively and bounces around the room like a frog with barely a pause for breath. In Rush Hour 3, most of the action is straight, to the point, and lacking. Ratner never approaches the scenes with a sense of reverence for the material. You can tell he's just thinking, ""Okay, we gotta squeeze in this fight scene here, but let's move on as quickly as possible."" For the first half hour of the movie, I was consistently waiting for a great fight scene to come along. But it never did. Even once fight began, there would be one or two semi-wow moments, but they were just never good enough. That, and they were few and far between - nowhere near enough action for a Chan flick, and that is the most unforgivable part about this movie. On the posters Jackie Chan gets first billing, but from watching the movie, you wonder why Chris Tucker didn't.Tucker simply sucks all the Chan fun out of this movie. Whereas this third outing could have been a great collaboration of their comedy styles, it mostly feels like trying to fit Chan into more of an American box. Chan would normally never consistently make dirty jokes in his films, he's even said that he doesn't like too much sex in his movies because it detracts from the material. But he makes several sexual jokes in this film that seem more like they should be coming out of Tucker's mouth than his. Even his action is basically dumbed down garden variety martial arts - there's none of that delicate Chan flair. Nevertheless, the mere presence of Jackie Chan saves this movie from total disaster - if it weren't for him it would simply be Chris Tucker parading around with a T-shirt that said, ""I'm the greatest!"" If you're a Rush Hour fan, this movie is worth seeing, and if you're a Chris Tucker fan, well, I'm sorry.",Rush Hour 3

That completes a hilarious action packed hours of a trilogy.,8,4 June 2009,"After making 2 great films (rush hour, rush hour 2) Brett Ratner installs another wonderful finale. The cast and the crew come back with a bang and perform a sensational 3rd. After making a hilarious action packed sequel (rush hour 2) it's hard to step back up and still show the same amount of rush in a 3rd sequel, i'm sure as many feared there thoughts that rush hour 3 might kill the series and leave many disappointed. We all new it was a tough job but they certainly managed it! Rush hour 3 is a great example of what a trilogy is meant to be like. 6 years after the previous one, it still offers as laughs, in fact even more laughs this time around and very decent ""rush hour"" action.Like i said before, Brett Ratner certainly executed a 3rd very well, his sharp mentality and his funny adventure scenes are panned out well. He's the real underdog of this film but doesn't get enough credit for it. Congrats to him. Rush hour 3 is more focused on the ""rush"" this time. It's definitely more way more funny and will always keep you laughing with some legendary lines from the comedy legend himself Chris Tucker (Carter) and Jackie Chan's fighting and his insane stunts are back and keep you pleased. The two main characters are all back and on another voyage, but this time in Paris. So yes, the acting was very good (as you would expect) the cast were hilarious and definitely spot on. The one thing it maybe lacked a little was it's running time, the film appears to be too short and could definitely be extended a extra 20 30 minutes. If you loved the first 2 instalments and thought they were funny, i can almost guaranteed you will love this threqual, and it's simple. It's full with fun and action, a fun rush hour type adventure and Chris Rock and Jackie Chan will have you on the floor laughing. A nuclear bomb of a complete brilliant trilogy",Rush Hour 3

If you watch Rush Hour 1 or 2 again then you have seen Rush Hour 3.

If you have never experienced any of the Rush Hours, I highly recommend you do. All of them deal with Chinese triads, lots of kung fu fighting, and pretty ladies. The combination of Chan's fighting skill and Tucker's high-pitched voice shouting obscenities and the like make all the movies an enjoyable experience.Unlike previous installments, Rush Hour 3 takes place in Paris, France. The Eiffel Tower scene at the end of the movie is the only real part that takes advantage of France. The movie's roots are in Japan, so there is a high amount of Japanese influence in Rush Hour 3.

The chemistry between the two leads is still there which makes these movies fun in the first place.

Stupid movies are what I call movies that are pushed out by the studios with lame jokes and weak scripts; all targeted at the not-so-intelligent movie goers around America simply to rake in the moo-lah. This review may or may not make it into that book but it's certainly leaning in that direction. Rush Hour 3 is the long awaited third installment in the Rush Hour lineup. In the last decade, the Rush Hour franchise has been the only acting work Chris Tucker has been able to find. Strangely enough Jackie Chan has had film after film, making him the more bankable of the two actors. After watching this film, I couldn't help but think that Tucker should've tried other things.The film actually did have a good story. It seemed like Carter and Lee were going back to what made them fun and lovable in the first Rush Hour film, which was the only one I enjoyed. Former ambassador Han is the target of an assassination attempt. Apparently Han had some very incriminating evidence against the Triad, the Chinese mob. From there on, Carter and Lee have to go to Paris to face off with the Triad and retrieve a list with the names of the Triad bosses.From this standpoint, the premise was in fact, a classic Rush Hour concept, meaning it had all the potential in the world. But Carter and Lee don't deliver on any level. They already know each other which take away the need for them to try and understand one another. This is part of what gave the first film a clash of civilizations type humor. At the same time, Carter has been practicing his Cantonese, which allows Chris Tucker to pick up on words here and there rather than watch him bumble around, trying to understand what's happening around him with all the Chinese people. The inclusion of a French cab driver named George seemed to completely ruin what should be a film just about Christ Tucker and Jackie Chan. He kept popping up here and there and I was sitting there thinking to myself, ""Please, go away."" The pacing wasn't bad as the film moved along fairly steadily. As for the action, they seemed to focus it more on, well, action. I walked into that theatre expecting to see Rush Hour 3, not Die Hard. Gone are the fun and comedic martial arts scenes with Jackie Chan, rather we get over the top action scenes, and even a car chase. Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan play the characters as they've played them before but it's the writing that fails them.It's rare that I regret wasting a sheet of paper for taking notes when I write a review.

Europe, and more specifically, Paris This plot point doesn't actually change the formula's outcome that much, because every other element is essentially unchanged.The coolest stuff in the movie is already showcased in the trailer, so if you're pressed for time, just watch that.PS: Roman Polanski did look like he was having fun though...so much fun, in fact, that he didn't bother to have his name added to the credits.

While the ambassador is lying in the hospital, Detective Carter (Chris Tucker) and Chief Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) promise his daughter that they will catch the man who attempted to assassinate her father. Lee and Carter travel to Paris to save the girl, solve the crime and catch the bad guy.The story goes that this film was not released in China because they only can release a certain number of Western films per year and they had reached their quota. Also, the other reason they gave for not releasing a film in which China's biggest star appears was that the Chinese censors found Chris Tucker's character offensive. When I heard this, I thought it was just another case of political correctness gone mad and it couldn't possibly be that bad. After seeing the movie, however, I have to agree. I wish it had not been released here either.The movie only runs just under 90 minutes (thankfully). The stunts are nothing spectacular and the comedy set pieces are below average. In fact, the funniest part of the movie is the blooper reel at the end, which would lead me to believe that it is not the fault of the leads that the movie is not really that funny or engaging. The blame should lie firmly at the feet of the writers.With my saying all of this, I am sure fans of the series will turn out to see it in droves; yet, I can't help but think that most will find this the weakest in the series.

112,MattDevivre,OK movie but no need to see it,6,14 December 2007,"Think of TV-series like ""Columbo"". Every episode provides a similar concept and takes between 70 and 90 minutes. It is a great TV show concept - but can you imagine to watch this in some cinema, pay a full ticket for one single episode ? Movie-sequels that base on one dominating concept (which is repeating itself over and over) are rarely a box-office hit after more than two sequels. TV shows are allowed to depend very much on each of their own episodes while features produced for cinema commonly should be able to stand for themselves (so you don't have to know ""Harry Potter"" 1-4 to understand part 5). In this respect ""Rush Hour"" (though the concept isn't as fresh as ""Columbo"" was decades ago) is disappointing. From 1 to 3 it's exactly the same concept with only little variation. This could be a sweet (but expensive) TV-show - however on the big screen you must expect more and not more of the same. Some good jokes are not enough to make ""Rush Hour 3"" worth the money. The longer the movie takes the more predictable it gets. Besides I doubt the brotherhood story-theme works well for this feature. Rush Hour has always been a buddy movie and so it has always had a similar side-theme. That's why this doesn't give it a fresh direction! My next negative point concerns the acting which sometimes seems just overdone (probably Chris Tucker has seen too many Eddy Murphy flicks). In a short: Solid buddy movie with the typical fast Ratner style. Nonetheless if you know one of the other sequels you've seen it and it's - though perhaps the ideal thing to dawdle away - just no good film. Better watch this on TV.",Rush Hour 3

Jackie Chan who is the main action guy (who's great at it) did a good job at being funny and fulfilled his role. As Chris Tucker who's the wise cracking jokester with a bad case of the hornies (who's great at it)delivers as well. Great action/comedy.10/10",Rush Hour 3
114,kenvandenbussche-2,Changement de décor (a different setting)!,7,17 October 2007,"When Chris Tucker at the end of the second movie in one of the added bloopers says that one of the characters, which had just been thrown out of a window, wouldn't make it into ""Rush hour 3"" - this joke was both unexpected and very funny. Because at that time, nobody was already thinking of a second sequel. This should account for the duration of 6 long years between the second and third movie.Because every now and then, there are small hints that this funny series is running on empty. As mentioned above: it took a long time to greenlight this movie and come up with enough material to make it worth the while. Chris Tucker has grown fatter but fortunately for everyone involved he is still hysterical. This third movie still has many jokes to tell but not all of them work out as well as they should. On the other hand: there is Jackie Chan who is still incredibly agile and lightning fast doing the craziest moves imaginable. He actually manages to hide himself entirely into a flag on a pole from the bad guys in this movie. Sometimes it feels as though there are long pauses in between two action sequences, but once the action kicks off - it is always very entertaining to watch!In order to keep this movie from becoming a drag, they altered the setting once more. This time the duo find themselves in Paris, investigating one of the biggest crime syndicates in the world. This once again leads to fairly new and pleasant situations; each one funnier than the next. One of those new ideas is to mould a French taxi driver into the story and this particular character has its moments ... even though, at times, he seems more like a blunt copy of the main character in the 1998-French action movie ""Taxi"". Still: he is never really any boring and that's a good thing.Thus, Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan do what they do best and we love them for that! As always: the cast is very colorful. Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada plays the part of Kenji. Swedish actor Max von Sydow, best known for his role as the priest in the classic horror movie ""The exorcist"", stars as Varden Reynard. There's also a Japanese actress by the name of Youki Kudoh playing the mysterious figure of the Dragon Lady. Of course: there's a French woman involved as well. Noémie Lenoir plays the role of Genevieve. A famous Chinese actress named Jingchu Zhang does the role of Soo Yung; the little girl featured in the first film too. And compelling actor Tzi Ma returns as ambassador Han. On a more comical side note: be sure to watch out for Polish director Roman Polanski (famous for such classics as ""Chinatown"" and ""The pianist"") who takes place in front of the camera rather than behind it. He stars as French detective Revi. Truth be told: I hadn't even recognized him until after the movie.In short: ""Rush hour 3"" is a very entertaining movie but I think the series should end here.

Hiroyuki Sanada plays well to (since the last samurai) and the stunt are never the less impressive. Two things on the dark side though, sadly Jacky Chan does age and did not really go over the top, and the parachute end scene which is really too much . Other than that do go to watch it and have fun it's not a waste of money nor time.",Rush Hour 3
116,zakali4u,funny,8,16 August 2007,from start to end this film was too good and unfortunately it had to end. Its a Mark of a quality film that makes you feel sad thats it ended and so quickly especially when it is 90 minutes in length.the chemistry between these two great stars in still there and the gags come thick and fast and have everybody in stitches.they both are putting some age and weight on but that does not stop the stars from delivering punch after punch whether thats as a joke or to the adversaries.my favourite gag was the one they have used throughout the series with chris tuckers confusion over the words and names me and you or who. Usually these jokes are just between Chris and Jackie but it was cleverly implemented with other actors.Thankyou for this superb!,Rush Hour 3
117,Stofft,no more please!,2,20 April 2008,"What a waste of time more or less! This movie was by far the worst of all three in the series. Jackie seems to be nothing more than a tired old man and Chris tucker seems to have no glow in his comments or acting. They both seem to be ""just in it for the money""I really hope this will be the last Rush Hour film, the first and second was both really really enjoyable with fun comments, good comedy and good action scenes this third installment has nothing of it.For some good Jackie action stick with his older films and those made in Hong Kong, for Chris tucker films watch any other film he's in besides this one.",Rush Hour 3

Its so funny i really really enjoyed it, i was laughing so much at one point it was hard to breathe! I loved it! The story was good and the acting was amazing, they really pulled it off. The script was so good, and so comical, i want to go watch it agen and will be buying it on DVD when it comes out. The action scenes were so amazing, they were really really good, well done!

I've followed all of Chan's movies specially his hong kong movies and sad to see him belittled by such irresponsible and childish ratner. Chan can do a lot more than what he was given to work with, jeez the writers and directors should have focused more on new material and the one that Chan does best. Hollywood just cant seem to capture the Jackie Chan magic. He should be given more freedom to do things his way because thats were all the amazing stunts and what not comes out of.The dojo scene, Eiffel tower scene and the ending credits is basically the only thing worth watching. Tuckers the same, although the guy who played kenji had chemistry with Chan on screen. I would never again expect anything from a Ratner film. It really disgraces 1 and 2. The only reason i gave it an 8 is because I'm a big fan of Jackie.",Rush Hour 3
121,beerwine900,made me sad watching this movie,5,30 August 2007,"When i heard Rush Hour 3 was coming out i nearly jumped out my shoes with excitement, i've always been a massive fan of Jackie Chan and was impressed with the new Police Story so couldn't wait until R H 3 came out. I loved the first two films so i thought another sequel would just be 90 minutes more of action comedy enjoyment, i went to see the first showing in my local cinema and was stunned at how little fight scenes and unimpressive fights there were, which brought me to only a few conclusions why this was.1)American film makers don't let their stars do as much stuff as they used to.2)Brett Ratner decided Jackie C couldn't help choreograph fight scenes.Or god forbid age has finally caught up with Jackie which until he brings out another movie seems to be the logical explanation, now i will say Jackie Chan has done excellently in the past also bearing in mind Jackie is 55 years old so it has to happen eventually.I did find the script entertaining there were some funny moments and loud over the top remarks coming from Cris Tucker which i was expecting, i think as a family film it would be good but for classic Jackie Chan fans they'l be disappointed.over all i give Rush Hour 3, 5 out 0f 10 7 out of 10 for a funny script 2.5 out of 10 for action p.s I felt a similar disappointment with Die Hard 4.0 i just hope Stallone dosn't do the same with Rambo 4.",Rush Hour 3
122,davulture,Not to bad....But then again nothing out of the ordinary,6,16 August 2007,"Rush Hour 3 I guess lacks something every other sequel this summer pretty much has which is of course originality and trying to distance itself from the previous affairs. This movie neither has an original plot like the First Movie nor does it distance itself away from the Original Rush Hour movie.Well back again is Chris Tucker as Detective Carter and Jackie Chan as Inspector Lee. This time out when Ambassador Han is nearly killed in an assassination attempt the duo of Carter and Lee head over to France to look for the ShiShang which is a list of the secretive lethal crime organizations who obviously don't want their names known because it would end their secrecy.So of course Carter becomes wild and Lee does all the work. The movie is okay but it becomes too similar to the First Rush Hour including a scene with a flag parachuting downward and a snaky insider. The writing is okay and in this movie there is really a lack of chemistry between Chan and Tucker. Maybe tensions, who knows. But Tucker's character seems minimally useful to Chan who in most cases is doing most of the work.The fight sequences are grand and more realistic then say something in Pirates of the Caribbean but again the movie's lack of a cohesive plot along with Tucker's character getting more comedic scenes then Chan being able to actually perform stunts wear thin in this movie. It's an good popcorn movie because yeah at 53 Jackie Chan is an amazing stunt man and Tucker does have a few funny quips but really this is the weakest of all three.",Rush Hour 3

They don't even get to Paris until an hour into the movie and when they do, the movie quickly starts to wrap up. However before they leave, there's time for a pointless fight in a dojo with a very tall man.The action scenes aren't as spectacular as the first two and there's some strange rule for this movie that doesn't let up with humor in points. It seems as if the movie is afraid to go stop joking around and that leaves room for a lot of jokes that fall flat.I was entertained enough not to get bored but I wouldn't watch it again or even recommend it.",Rush Hour 3

After an attempted assassination on Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma), Detective Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) and L.A.P.D. Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) find out who is responsible and they head to Paris, France to stop the Triads once again from their despicable crimes. Rush Hour 3 takes place 10 years after the events of Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2.Directed by Brett Ratner, the film has a good amount of humor, crime, and action as well as drama. One of his better films.Rush Hour 3 made a good profit. However, it was made on a budget of $140,000,000 and only grossed $258,000,000, making it the least successful entry financially in the series.Rush Hour 3, while not a masterpiece like Rush Hour (1998) and Rush Hour 2 (2001), is still a great sequel and an extremely underrated film.

After Genevieve removes her wig, you might find the joke funny, you might not even notice it, but as someone who's experienced assault just for being trans and walking down the street; I just find the joke more disturbing than funny, just a skid mark on the corner of a Rembrandt painting, but all the other offensive jokes in the film are magnificent.",Rush Hour 3
127,lalitdevraj,Can't miss for a comedy movie aficionado,7,8 February 2012,"So simple and so sweet, this final installment to the 'Rush Hour' series proved well in the box office and for many viewers as well. Similar to the first two movies, this one inculcated a setting which was different to both main characters. Like this, without much predictability of events to follow, it was a bang. Watching both the first and second movie and being a fan of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, this movie excited me right before entering the theater, during it, and even afterward.In full candidness, no matter how satisfied I was about this movie in general there was one aspect which I cannot support: the duration of the movie. As a Rush Hour series fan, truly the length of 90 minutes did not suffice for me to enjoy the movie to the fullest. It was so straight to the point that one wishes they would have taken another detour or two before the end of the movie. As the final segment, I desired that it would be a bit longer to witness more screen time of the legitimately funny couple. This movie gets a 7 as it was good, but not 'amazing' or better.A can't miss for Rush Hour fans, but moreover, a shouldn't miss for those who have seen the first two parts already.",Rush Hour 3

Rush hour 3 kicks off after the attempted assassination of Ambassador Han. Upon promising too his daughter that they will find the culprits and peoples responsible, Lee and James Carter set off to Paris in another one of their stylized adventures. Jackie Chan has admitted that he is not a big fan of the Rush Hour franchise, and for me it showed in his performance. However expect too see in terms of action the usual Chan stuff, like his trademark sword fighting with his suit jacket. Chris Tucker demanded a whole heap of money for this movie, and as of such I enjoyed his predictable, arrogant and sometimes obscene style of humor that he brought to Rush Hour 3. The climax is enjoyable, and although the conflict between the odd couple is exactly the same as it is in Rush Hour 2, their friendship is never boring, and always exciting on film. Overall Rush Hour 3 adds nothing too the franchise, despite this and all of it's shortcomings I throughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it too anyone else that got a kick from Rush Hours 1 and 2.",Rush Hour 3

Why? Well, aside from the lack of originality, there was nothing to keep you interested in these characters - Jackie Chan's was a mere cipher, which is kind of okay in this kind of film if the plot makes up for it, which it didn't here, but worse of all, Chris Tucker's was just a dick, a total moron, and not even an endearing one - he didn't have the moves, and neither did Jackie, so what was the point? Now, if the movie had been shot well, so you could appreciate the artistry of some of the action, that too would have been a redeeming feature, but it was all too fake and uninvolving. In summary, the movie was mind-numbing and not fun to watch. And I had wanted to really like it, too; I just couldn't.H_J",Rush Hour 3

With so many better movies in theaters (EVAN ALMIGHTY, HARRY POTTER, and even TRANSFORMERS were worth the admission price, but that is my opinion after all), why spend money on this movie, which will be just as entertaining in 6 months on DVD (for the price of rental and you can see it with your friends in the comfort of your home) or in a year on cable (for just the cost of cable)??? If you liked RUSH HOUR and RUSH HOUR 2, after seeing RUSH HOUR 3 you may be as disappointed as I was, and yearn for the earlier films.

Rush Hour proved that you can have a good laugh with a dodgy storyline, cheesy dialect and in your face humour, the sequel just about got away with it - but the third in the trilogy proved to be a lot more jaded. The humour had sizzled out, the live action from Jackie just seemed to much for him now - and the storyline was pretty damn ghastly, in all sense of the word. However, there were moments of compassion, indulged with some pretty good laughs wrapped around the movie, which in fairness, kept the film rolling.Tucker's wit is still there, albeit tried and tested formula, it still works in its simplicity. The random French taxi driver's character was just a waste of space, which just left the plot crying out ""I'm going to make this guy involved in the finale somehow"". Chan, well, he's seen better days. Age has caught up with him, his stunts actually were fine, if he didn't take so god damn long to do them. It actually took him about 15 seconds to scale a simple wall, whilst looking like he was trying to make it harder than it actually was.This film isn't going to be remembered forever in the trilogy, but its just like a really good computer game, you buy the add-on package for having it sakes.Rush Hour 3 is one of those films where you know before hand your going to have an average night's viewing, but you goto it anyway, and afterwards, you think to yourself, ""Meh, maybe I was right, I was better off playing that add-on for Half-Life"".Its not a bad movie, but its not great either. If you actually took away the crap storyline and dodgy acting, the humour would of given the movie at least 6-7 stars out of 10.",Rush Hour 3

Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are still very entertaining, and even though the movie lacks originality, this veteran team still knows how to please. You won't see anything new, but you'll leave eager to see more.Well, that should wrap things up. Let me just enjoy this refreshing Coke as I read the movie's budget...*MASSIVE SPIT TAKE* $150 million dollars?!!! What the hell were they thinking?!!! Granted, the last Rush hour cost $90 million and made $350 million in gross, but what made them think that upping the budget to $150 million was going to make it any more successful? They could have cranked this out with nearly half the budget, and made a decent profit.Come to think about it, this isn't the only big budget disaster that Jackie Chan has been connected with. Remember Around the World in 80 days? The American take ($24 million) didn't even cover the marketing costs ($30 million), let alone the $110 million dollar budget of the movie! (although it did make $52 million internationally) Big budget movies are a big risk, and Jackie Chan, although a very talented actor, cannot guarantee a profit for the movie. Despite his stunts and charm, he cannot turn a bad movie into profit. He can make a bad movie average, an average movie good, and a good movie great, but he can't turn lead into gold.In fact, I think it's a mistake to give any movie a budget greater than 100 million. How many special effects do you need? Granted, Pirates of the Caribbean had a budget of $200 million (at least), but did they really believe that Rush Hour 3 was going to make almost as much as what Pirates 3 was going to make? Even a great movie can do poorly if it comes out at the wrong time, competes against another popular movie, has bad marketing, or for any number of other reasons. To think that someone was betting heavily that a movie (especially one not aimed at children or young teens) would make AT LEAST 150 million, and preferably more like 200-300 million...is just blind optimism, in the worst possible way.",Rush Hour 3

I had heard during production and pre-production that Chris Tucker demanded more money and this effected the budget and wanted to be the centre of the movie, and he is he gets lots of funny scenes that had my sides spliting but because of this Jackie Chan is in his shadow, the action scenes where built up but the unused, the fight at the end (between the obvious two) was very weak its short and sweet but needed to be a lot better especially due to the build up. This movie is hilarious due to Chris Tucker but disappointing to me and many Jackie Chan Fans because he is practically unused like venom in Spiderman 3. No where near enough screen time someone of Jackie Chan's talent deserves. I did hear that Tony Jaa was offered a role in the film (I am guessing his brother) and the movie would of had potential to be amazing but if they misused him as well like Jackie Chan was it would of still been disappointing. Conclusion: Chris Tucker takes over the movie, and its unbalanced therefore Jackie Chan is left almost as a extra. Brett Ratner didn't do someone of his talent any favours with this movie. 6/10 See it to see another chapter to the series of films but don't expect to see Jackie Chan's talent used at all, the other films maintained a Balance between comedy and action but there is no balance in this movie.",Rush Hour 3

I didn't have the highest expectations for the movie but watched it for the sake of watching Rush Hour, which I have missed for a long time. The humor this time relies on 99% one-punch, unintelligent racial (and sometimes racist) remarks that come out of Chris Tucker's motormouth, as well as Jackie Chan's not-so-perfect English. He's still pretty funny at some points but it seems that 6 years of no acting has taken its toll on him. I think Brett Ratner made it too obvious he wanted to make this as funny as the previous Rush Hour movies, so he just squeezed in low-grade humor like the god-awful interrogation scene with the nun amidst all the crap. The acting isn't as sharp either, especially Soo-yung, the hostage from Rush Hour 1 all grown up; the actress who portrays her now offers a stale, boring portrayal of the character that makes you want to cry.

If you look at all 3 Rush Hour movie ratings on IMDb, you'll see they steadily go down. In #3, the jokes fall flat and the action sequences are poor. Perhaps Jackie Chan, at 52, was getting too old for them. He didn't seem to be able to do more intense action. There are very few jokes which will make you laugh. They needed better writers and action choreographers.At a cost of $140M, this really should have been a better film. #3 made $140M in the USA, more worldwide, and even more via DVD's. Although I'm hoping they don't make a #4, I suspect they can't walk away from that kind of money.There is one interesting thing about this film: Famous real-life USA-convicted child rapist director Roman Polanski, hiding in France, was in Rush Hour 3. He played French head-detective Revi. It isn't often you see a convicted child rapist, still wanted in the USA, in a film.

The trouble is they don't come very often. Most of this somewhat brief movie consists of rather lame comedy, much of it coming from Chris Tucker's character James Carter. Chan; whose crossover to big budget Hollywood flicks was a large part of the reason for the first film's Box Office success, barely makes an impression. His screen time often feels either severely limited or poorly used.Tucker of course made a bit of a splash last year for becoming the highest paid actor in Hollywood with his pay cheque for this film, despite not having worked since the previous entry. He seemed to decide he could make himself worth every cent of that money with volume. That's volume in both senses of the word; he screeches incessantly. Tucker is by no means a bad comedian, but his act in this film seems to consist entirely of getting angry with people and shouting out words 12 year olds find risqué. Of course the quality of his material is not his fault, but I can't help feeling it may have all been a bit more enjoyable if he had exercised a little restraint. Then again, what point is there offering restraint when you're dealing with a script that seems to think that Chan and Tucker singing or dancing, or the very idea of a man backstage at a burlesque show are, as concepts in and of themselves, hilarious? This series, incidentally, seems to get more lascivious with each entry; the rumour-mill makes me wonder if this is Ratner's influence. Coupling this with a strong undercurrent of xenophobia towards just about anyone who crosses Detective Carter's path makes this slightly uneasy viewing.Or at least it did for me. In the interest of balance I should point out most of the audience I was with lapped this up. Perhaps I am in a minority on this one. If you have been looking forward to this for years, you may well love it. If you are a die hard Tucker fan, or a Chan completist, you will probably love it. But if you don't fall into any of the aforementioned categories, it's not something I can recommend. Of course there are far worse things you could see, but it just isn't really worth the effort, not least because it superior predecessors can be bought on DVD or caught on television. Then again, it's a lot better than ""The Tuxedo"" or ""The Medallion"". Jackie and Hollywood just don't seem to mix.",Rush Hour 3
147,adilrye_1467,Stupid plot...lame humour....fun action,4,23 August 2007,"I'm a fan of the Rush Hour series. I found the first two to be enjoyable and fun movies with a great sense of humour. But Rush Hour 3 was downright embarrassing. The story was so stupid, so convoluted and generic that I barely cared about it at all. The whole plot was so predictable, anyone with a mediocre knowledge of American cinema can figure everything out, which they even mention! The comedy was also pretty bad. Bland jokes and tired sight gags made up this film, with the annoying Chris Tucker and the once innovative culture clash just seeming tasteless. In fact, my friends and I were mostly laughing at the lame attempts at humour and the serious bits which were so corny, they could have been a spoof film on their own. The acting, surprisingly, was awful...with Tucker and Chan doing decently, but the supporting cast failing in almost every scene. What was supposed to be a tongue in cheek action buddy cop movie has become a cheesy, lame and unfunny PG 13 romp...that's just not necessary.",Rush Hour 3
148,andersox,"No action, no fun, no story--don't even bother with the DVD",4,15 August 2007,"I loved Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2. What a disappointment Rush Hour 3 is.There is less plot than a porno movie and what plot there is doesn't hang together well. I mean, who's the chick with the fan and what is her motivation for chasing them? Is she one of the dragon heads? Where is the clever dialog, where are the interesting twists?The action is WEAK, has lousy choreography, and is filmed poorly! One of the main difficulties is that, throughout the film, Chris Tucker has better moves than Jackie Chan. I love Jackie Chan, but he almost seems bored as the waddles across the freeway and slides down a pole--it figures he would be bored because he's done this stunt and done it better in films such as ""Who Am I."" I hope the action in Jet Li's ""War"" is more interesting.",Rush Hour 3

The two fellas obviously have fun together, but they are two steps slower than in the original ""Rush Hour"". Chris has put on weight and the effortless babble seems to have been replaced by rehearsed lines which even he seems bored with. Jackie Chan is as wooden as ever. The two are at their best when they're in action.An attractive female lead reminiscent of a less voluptuous Beyonce adds to the interest level. The story, script and other characters are very much below average.The climax below the Eiffel Tower is quite spectacular, and the credits were the best part for me: relief that it was over plus bloopers.",Rush Hour 3

The humor is still good and the action is good, but the gags are getting old sort of.The acting is alright, I mean you don't go into Rush Hour movies looking for character studies or anything like that. As the other films they throw in a twist that you can see coming quite a while before it happens.The action in this film is a step up over the previous two films I must say including the hospital shoot-out (Hard Boiled reference maybe?) and the fight at the end added more fun to this movie then lots of films I've seen this summer.

Jackie looks old; every time he has to fight or do a stunt it just reminds you of how much faster, slicker and younger he used to be. Tucker is going through the motions - he had two amusing moments, one about calling Chan 'Kiko' and another when he dances while forgetting the dangling hostage he was supposed to be rescuing. As for the plot - forgetaboutit. Max von Sydnow? Could you have flagged the bad guy any louder if you'd given him a Hitler moustache?It gets three stars; one for each of the jokes that made me smile, and one for the blooper reel, the funniest thing in it.

153,Snespy04,"Rush Hour 3, feels rushed.",5,13 August 2007,"I have to admit I was pretty excited that this film was coming out. I was pumped to see this duo on the big screen again since their film together was in 2001. Six years it took this film to launch off, but the launch, the ride and landing was very rocky.Chris Tucker is the one of the key elements to the Rush Hour franchise with his awesome one liners and his sarcastic tone of voice. Then we have Jackie Chan who is known for his martial arts skills, provides the audience his quick reflexes that seem almost impossible for man to do, but he always seems to prevail. This film however follows the typical three. The first film pretty good, second film was great and this one is very poor.The plot was decent although it may come across pointless. The plot was that the Triads had grown to have over half a million members. The group is mainly consisted of assassins and that if this keeps up there is no stopping them because well no one knows who they are. The World Court meeting had addressed this along with there is a list of these Triad members and it has been found. None the less they need to be stopped. Sounds dumb, but if a person takes the time to really think about it, we the US, get involved with many issues or altercations whatever you call it, it becomes our problem as well so this is way I thought the plot was decent due to the relevance of our country/society and so on.Aside from the plot the dialog which seemed to be focused more on Chris Tucker's character James Carter. He was primarily the comic relief. This just proves that the writer(s) were trying to make use of his sarcastic remarks to get laughs. I have to admit they did along with ""I can't believe he just said that."" The dialog itself was poor. This left Jackie Chan's character in the dark with all the limelight shining on Tucker's character.The resolution of the film wasn't even an ending at all. No problems were solved in the end. It just faded into the credits with the bloopers from the film.All in all, this film was entertaining and that was it. The first two provided a good story, one liners, action etc. This third like I said feels rush, no good action nor dialog, it just concentrated on the one liners with no resolution to the film. Brett Ratner needs a kick to the face along with his writer(s).",Rush Hour 3
154,bolt76,"Bored Chan, Weak Tucker, Poor fight scenes. Bottomline: A Paycheck movie",5,31 July 2009,"OK, here are a few reasons why I disliked (note: NOT hated) this film.Chan looks bored and his action scenes simply do not impress.Tucker gets a few decent one-liners but surprisingly, his comic timing is off.Storyline is simultaneously boring and unbelievable, and the ending a massive letdown.Everyone seems to be in simply for the money, and there's clearly ZERO imagination or honesty visible. Patrons have a right to be annoyed.Avoid this film as it is simply a ""paycheck"" movie.3/10",Rush Hour 3
155,enjoiskaterguy,"Rush Hour 3 ""Rushed""?",7,15 August 2007,"The two buddy cops, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker meet up once again in this 3rd part in the Rush Hour series and take flight to Paris to deal with some unfinished business.This time around the two find themselves in a too quite familiar situation connecting the 1st and 2nd film....which isn't a bad thing at all but does Bret Ratner execute? Many of the same characters from the series are brought back with some nice new additions to the cast. The overall acting is par with the series and doesn't let down on the comedic aspect one minute. The action in this movie is well put together but what lacks is the quantity of action. What action there is though holds up high. There is a serious aspect to the movie which balances the humor which in turn attach'es the viewers closer to the characters and wanting unsolved issues amended to help close the movie with a sense of resolution and completion.In this chapter of their series Chief Insp. Lee(Chan) still holds a grudge and has a hard time with attachment and forgiveness even after 3+ years in this fictional world of Rush Hour. There seems to be a wall between Lee in which Carter can't break and what sets this movie aside from the series is that in Rush Hour 3 the two don't really resolve anything through words or actions. The movie is set for the viewers to kind of assume that everything between the two is resolved and brings some confusion to the table.The Ending (no spoilers) ------------------------------- About 4 months back before the release of the movie I had read from IGN.com that the movie had went over-budget. If this is true than that probably explains the end result of the film and why it ends where it ends. If Bret Ratner were smart he would go do some extra post production photography work in LA and resolve the problem with the length of the film.copy/paste link and read towards the bottom of article http://movies.ign.com/articles/749/749513p1.html The flow of the movie seems to go very well through out the entire time until it hits you. After all the laughs, running and screaming you as the audience are struck with an almost disbelief of what is happening...""Its ending???"" Thats what I felt when it came on screen. The movie just started rushing it. I felt like there should have been at least 30 more minutes left in the film. The mission the two were asked to do was completed but you never see what happens to the enemies, what happens to the supporting characters(despite the obvious) and why do Lee and Carter seem fine with their friendship at the end? I recommend this movie for sure if you even just liked the first two but if your an analytical critic whose exceptions are high be prepared for some ""what's?"" and ""huh's?"" as you watch. Great movie, but poor ending.Rush Hour 4 anyone? ---------------------- I think it needs to happen to what I saw in RH3, plus Chris Tucker said he would love to do anyone if 3 is successful and he said he would even hire a writer for him and the writer to sit down and make a pre-ready script if the movie does seem to become reality. It seems though through Jackie Chan's eye's we will have to wait for 5 years until we see another one according to an interview with Chris Tucker which said those words. You can't really tell how he is saying this in the interview because it is just a Q&A text interview online, but I'm pretty sure Mr. Tucker was...as he says in Rush Hour 1 ""you know how the newspapers are, they be overizageratin"" about it being 5 years until something pops up about another sequel.Aside from the setbacks of the film, its fun,entertaining and well thought out. Bret's skill as a director is still strong in this sequel and will hold high in the buddy cop ""fish out of water"" genre.",Rush Hour 3
156,joshzancan,"Ridiculous, Cheap Laughs, and Great Entertainment",8,13 August 2007,"Fact: people will decide whether or not to hate this movie or to give it a shot before they even watch it.If you decide to hate a movie, you will hate it. Give this one a shot.What made this a good movie? Well, it was hysterical. Being that its a comedy, this is a good thing. Its got good enough action. Being that its also sort of an action movie, this is also a good thing. Thridly, you get to see Jackie Chan do some crazy cat-walking (a type of maneuvering that involves doing acrobat-like things along various street objects). He's more impressive in this movie than any others. Plus, you get to see the outtake where he breaks his sternum.Fiction: they DO NOT re-use jokes. One or two here and there, just for old time sake. And if you're sitting there thinking ""well i don't wanna here old jokes 'for old time sake!,"" quit bitching, cause i imagine you sound whiny and annoying. like I said, it only happens once or twice. I mean Austin Powers reused the exact same jokes for all three movies, and nobody seemed to mind.I gotta say, though, this movie is damn ridiculous (getting into a racial fight with a french Chinaman while having a nun translate, and then she uses Ebonics...c'mon). But the ridiculous situations were definitely used as a set-up for some Chris Tucker commentary.I've heard a lot of people say that they didn't like this movie because they find Chris Tucker annoying. This causes me to inquire...why did you go see a Chris Tucker movie if he annoys you? People go to Chris Tucker movies because they like his style of comedy. This movie doesn't hold back. While some of the jokes fall flat (if i'm not mistaken, it seems at one point the actors even pause on screen for a moment, letting the audience laugh at what they imagine is a funny joke), this only happened once or twice. No joke ever really seems forced. There isn't the feel of ""oh, this will be a good line, lets see if we can work it in there."" It is all situational.This is just as good of a movie as the second one, and the only reason i think the first one was better is because we saw the cross-cultural struggles between Carter and Lee for the first time (the third one does bring that back, though, with them being in France).This movie is ridiculous, scenes are more far fetched than I'm used to, but the bottom line is, this is a hysterical movie. I hope they end the series here though. After three movies of the same type of comedy, its a good spot to finish. (Mike Meyers had it right.)",Rush Hour 3

158,sidyaqub,"The Weakest Installment of the 3, but still a mindless and enjoyable film",7,20 August 2007,"When we saw the trailers for 'Rush Hour 3', what did we expect? A life-changing epic? No. An intelligently made masterpiece? Definitely not. A mindless action comedy? Yes, thats what 'Rush Hour 3' is.When Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma) is fallen victim to an assassination attempt, Chief Inspector Lee of the HK Police (Chan) teams up with loud, arrogant and somewhat annoying LAPD Detective James Carter (Tucker) to investigate the matter. Their investigation leads them to the city of love: Paris. They continue their search for Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) and the Triads but are violated (and probed) by a French inspector (a cameo by director Roman Polanski) and bump into a local cabbie named George (Yvan Attal) who hates Americans and rescue sexy cabaret singer Genevieve (supermodel Noemi Lenoir), who leads them closer to the Triads.Simply put, the plot for this movie (just like the first two) is not rocket science. Which is what makes this film enjoyable. There are some moments which let out a chuckle like Roman Polanski's cameo and Chan and Tucker interrogating a French Triad with the use of a nun and their encounter with a Chinese giant at a kung fu school. But a lot of the jokes are just rehashes of jokes from 1 and 2, so they are rather predictable. The action sequences are toned down from what the second instalment offered us (as Chan is getting older) and the West likes to play safe with it's stars, so there are minimal stunts from the action legend Chan is known to be. Yet we do get a thrilling car chase in the streets of Paris and a rather exciting shootout/fight sequence at a hospital and a breath-taking finale filmed at the Eiffel Tower.There are many flaws in this film, what saves this film from being unbearable (like some of Chris Tucker's jokes) is the on-screen chemistry between Chan and Tucker. Like the previous films, Jackie and Chris bounce off each other with ease and make it out as they are having a lot of fun while working together. Just as expected the outtakes at the end do provide a lot of chuckles and will leave you laughing as you walk out the cinema... and THE ONLY way you will enjoy it as I did is to NOT take it seriously. If you want a life-changing epic, go watch 'The Shawshank Redemption'. If you desire to see an intelligently-written masterpiece, go watch 'The Godfather' or 'Memento'. If you want to switch off your brain, relax and watch a mindless action comedy... Then 'Rush Hour 3' should be able to cater.3.5/5",Rush Hour 3
159,dv-rec,"Silly, implausible and boring - one of the worst",1,8 December 2007,"well, i liked the first one of this series. Not as much as the more better HK Jackie films, but nearly as funny as Jackie cooperation with Owen Wilson.This movie has nothing; no humor, boring actors, boring action scenes and an even more boring plot. The chemistry between the actors has completely vanished, and what's left is some good shot movie sequences in Paris, which looked more like an alibi than really necessary for the plot. Jackie's talent for comedy, which was really excellent in US movies like ""Shanghai Noon"", is simply not existent in this one. The rest is an under average action comedy without and funny gags at all. Most of the attempts of the movie to be funny are simply embarrassing.Overall there is nothing in it that could possibly be remembered, and this is very low for a Jackie Chan movie.",Rush Hour 3

I mean, since it took them six long years to come out with the third installment, you'd think that this time around, the series has pretty much run out of energy. Plus, all of the bad reviews that I read before seeing it, didn't exactly make me feel that I was going to be impressed. On the contrary, I was surprised by the performances of both Chan and Tucker. The story is fun, the characters are interesting, the comedy is sharp, and the action sequences are well done. It was fun to watch the interplay between Tucker and Chan. Tucker being the outrageous, loud, and amusing Detective James Carter. And Chan, the straight-laced, 'good guy' Inspector Lee. The charisma is still there, just like it was since the first Rush Hour movie. This one seems to have plenty of more laughs and an even more exiting climax towards the end of the movie than the previous two.

How on earth someone could come up with such trash and think it would be funny is beyond me! It was embarrassing and insulting to watch.I liked Jackie Chan in the previous movies, but in this one we don't get to see enough of the fighting he's known for, and the fights we are treated to are just boring.

I know some people may think, ""well within those 6 years Rush Hour 3 and perhaps a fourth one would be made"" but I think Rush Hour 3 came in a right time and concluded this years streak of the number ""3"" for sequels on a good note..Now about Rush Hour 3, this time around Carter and Lee are parted back to investigate the troubling issues of one Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma), a leader of organization that its primary objective is to get rid of the remaining Triads that are a threat to the World Court Council and its leader, Reynard (Max Von Sydow) but when Ambassador Han gets shot and Han's daughter Soo Yung (Jingchu Zhang) gets kidnapped, it leads Carter and Lee on a chase to stop the Triads and it eventually leads them to the city of love, Paris. There Carter and Lee must find the source of the Triads and it's leader.. Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada), who is Lee's long lost brother.

With Carter and Lee now in the city of love, watching every angle.. they must put an end to the Triads and rescue Soo Yung.To me Rush Hour 3 was a very good installment, I've read some reviews where it's been said that in this movie there seems to be more humor and less action.. well the humor played a key factor in the first and second Rush Hour and I believe for Rush Hour 3, they got it just right.

In my opinion this is the best comedy film that came out this year , so far. It contain a lot of hilarious scenes that make you laugh till you just start crying.

165,Leon_Salmon@hotmail.com,Jackie....your better than this,6,13 August 2007,"I went last night with my fiancé ignoring all reviews that I read previously. I must admit the trailer did not light me up either, showcasing more Tucker than Chan.This film cost more than Rush Hour 1 & 2 combined, but does it feel any bigger or better....no. It fails because of Director Brett Ratners' singular vision. Everything he shoots looks like it was filmed by a first year film student. Nothing original from the set ups, the action is shot bog basic with no build up or suspense. Lets face it the only thing saving Ratner is his his cinematographer, who at least makes his footage look pretty, but thats about it. Everything Ratner shoots feels like it was filmed in a goldfish bowl, for example in this one you never really appreciate Paris as a backdrop because Ratner just doesn't know how to shoot it.But the main thing that bugs through out Rush Hour 3 is the main reason we watch these films....Jackie Chan!!! Now I went into the cinema knowing that Jackie had really injured himself badly on his previous film 'Rob B Hood', a lower back or spine injury from falling off the back of a quad bike during a fight sequence. It was reported that he went into production on Rush Hour 3 with this injury.Now this is the only solution I can come up with as to why the action sequences came off as a bit boring by Jackie's usual standards through out the film. All of his fight sequences contain no elaborate kicks, jumps, flips, nothing. And when most of his scuffles are filmed in close up you know something is wrong. So anyone using Jackie's age as an excuse should just watch any of his recent Hong Kong films, 'New Police Story', 'Rob B Hood', they all prove that although in his early fifties, he still has the physicality and can still pull off the stunts when required.This is not the first time injury has plagued a Jackie Chan film, it's just the first time that it's been one of his Hollywood efforts. He was doubled for the entirety of 'Thunderbolt' because of a neck injury on a previous film.I'm not saying this is the main reason for 'Rush Hour 3s' failings, but it does make sense. We all know how strongly Jackie feels about being restricted when producing Hollywood films.In an ideal world, New Line should have waited for Jackie to recover, scrapped Brett Ratner give Jackie the $100+ budget, bring in his Hong Kong production team and let him direct. And I bet the result would have been streets ahead of anything Jackie has made in Hollywood previous. At least it would have been original.Brett just seems happy to take elements from Jackie's Hong Kong efforts and rehash them in this one. From the opening we've seen everything before.If Hollywood had grabbed Jackie back in the 80's at the height of his powers, paired him off with Eddie Murphy who was also at the height of his powers, with a decent script from maybe Shane Black who was also at the height of his powers, directed by maybe Walter Hill or Richard Donner, letting Jackie have complete creative control over the stunts and choreography. This could have been a genre classic and who knows even Lethal Weapon would never have happened.Anyway speculation and Jackie gibber jabber aside. 'Rush Hour 3' is pretty average addition to the series, I'm not even going to comment on Chris Tucker, some of his jokes work (BECAUSE THERE IN THE SCRIPT!!!) and his ad libbing is cringingly awful even out staged by Jackie who's English is mediocre at best.Brett, to let Jackie struggle through this movie is just an insult to his fans. To let him go through a entire Hollywood movie with out a decent extended fight sequence (sword fight at end was hardly stretching the imagination) must have brought back bad memories for Jackie. And to give Chris Tucker top billing, what the f**k is all that about.In a nutshell, wait for the DVD to come out at Christmas I'm sure the extra features will make the package worthy of purchase, which is a shame really. For me Jackie's best Hollywood moments have been the ones that have been less popular, 'Shangahi Knights' and 'Around the World in 80 Days'. And sadly in his most popular franchise Brett Ratner restricts him once again.Rush Hour 3 6/10",Rush Hour 3

So anyway, you've got your B level action-comedy movie and it does it quite well.Jackie Chan (Who plays as Lee) acts well as usual (have some problem for pronouncing things but I didn't mind that) and Chris Tucker is still hilarious and he's still loud as ever. The jokes were great and I had my shares of laughs and chuckles, the only problem I have with the comedy is that sometime they try to stretch it far to much and you're ending up saying ""We get it already"", but the comedy succeed quite well. The action scene were always a thrill and the car chase was very fun (there was a bit of laughter in the theater).There's a lot more comedy (which some jokes were cheesy) in this movie than action, but in the end I didn't mind, I still felt entertained and happy to spend my 15$ in this movie.So this is the end of my simple review, go watch this movie with low expectation and in a mood for some good laughter and action and you'll enjoy it.

168,kinsho,A big disappointment,5,9 September 2007,"Rush Hour 3 was the one movie I was waiting for all summer. Needless to say, I've loved the past two Rush Hours. I still remember my excitement after the release of the first one in the series. Thinking about that only saddens me more over the big disappointment that is Rush Hour 3. Over several years in the making and the movie turned out to be a waste. Just try and imagine my sadness as I write this now.The movie's plot does not divert much from the series norm. A gang, this time the Triads, are causing trouble. Lee, played by Jackie Chan, and Carter, played by Chris Tucker, are once again on the case to find out what the Triads are up to and to stop them before their machinations are fully realized. Unlike its predecessors, this movie completely fails to seriously appreciate the plot. First off, any notion of realism is completely thrown out the window, what with both Chan's and Tucker's characters being put in one too many ridiculous situations. Then again, that's not so bad, at least when compared to the movie's other faults. The movie's characters are thrown in and about without any sort of finesse or style. None of the secondary characters ever bother to leave a lasting impression, save maybe the villain. Furthermore, Chris Tucker's tired out slapstick comedy is given more priority over the pacing and integrity of the storyline.On that note, the movie's failed humor comes at the sacrifice of character development. Both Lee and Carter have only one serious moment together, yet any drama is marginalized by the idiotic humor and the lack of gravity in the general storyline. As for the other characters, as I mentioned before, none of them besides the villain are given any serious grounding. They're puppets, more or less, to move the shoddy plot forward.Can anything good be said about this movie? Sure. The dialogue, despite not being that funny, is tolerable and even enjoyable at parts. Chris Tucker pulls off his lines quite charmingly while Jackie Chan is lovable no matter what he says. Furthermore, the action scenes are a good deal of fun. The ending's topped off with an awesome fight between Chan and the villain, unsurprisingly. Yes, Jackie Chan's getting older, but the stunts are still amazing and the fighting still intense enough to keep your attention. Even better, Chan's nimbleness is complemented by Tucker's kung-fu skills this time around.Overall, though, the movie proved to be the summer's biggest disappointment. I highly recommend that Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, and Brett Ratner move on. Let this movie be the final chapter to a series that might be well past its prime.",Rush Hour 3
169,baba-06622,Funny and Exciting,7,20 December 2019,"Maybe being Jackie Chan with one of the best Asian celebrities who really make it big in Hollywood and really brought honours for us here in Asia, I knew I was in for a great time when I first watched this movie. Also when I was growing up, his movies were those which are at times on the television here.It was like four or five years back I saw this on an projector at the school hall of my alma mater, as part of the school's post-exam activities. Really, I almost laughed myself silly as I was watching with my other peers then. Like many of us, we grew up watching Jackie's trademark kungfu moves and his amazing stunts which often made us all in awe on the movie screen.Jackie and Chris Tucker's chemistry just clicked with each other. And watching Zhang Ziyi playing a bad girl, it was like - whoa! Watching some of the movie scenes being played out in Hong Kong somehow brought back some memories for this person who grew up watching some of those Hong Kong TV dramas (with subtitles and Mandarin dubbing) on the television here. Looking at some of those scenes, at times I wondered how really the western world will see Hong Kong. But given many knew who is Jackie (he is from Hong Kong himself actually), I knew it's a relief.The two guys are just real funny between each other. But when it's time for those kungfu moves and the stunts, it always excite me. It's always like that.Definitely really funny. Prepare to laugh in stitches.",Rush Hour 3
170,squallz10,Don't Know Why people bash this,8,10 August 2007,"I thought this movie was actually good. It was everything I expected it to be,funny and full of intense action. I do not understand why people are hating on this wonderful film, but the jokes I guess could be said that they have been done before. Either way the whole audience was laughing in the theater I went too. It deserves be watched.Jackie Chan's fights were cool too. His fights fall short compared to other the movies he has done, but for a movie like this they are considerably good. I thought the story was pretty basic though, but I didn't go in expecting an epic movie like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc. I went to laugh and i did. Chris tucker just kinda does the same thing like the movie. But isn't that why we love Rush Hour?",Rush Hour 3
171,xprecipice,Motor Mouth man Chris Tucker delivers!,6,22 August 2007,"Another line of sequels that Hollywood has piling up, Rush Hour 3 at least stays true to its origins. Firstly whomever that haven't been enjoying the past few Rush Hours should give this a miss because its jokes are basically the same, if not lesser then the previous Rush Hours. But who said anything about it not working! With the paycheck of 25 million, Chris Tucker sure makes it worth it. Listening to his impromptu jokes in his rambling high-pitched tones never fails to crack me up. Do note that the funny lines actually has many references to the past Rush Hour movies so do, if possible re-watch the previous movies in the series.Action wise, it has been significantly reduced. We hardly see any more of Jackie Chan's monkey prancing and his famous trait of having the quick wits to use props around him to his fighting advantage. Maybe cause he is being paid 10million lesser then Chris Tucker? I don't know. However, he still delivers some Asian kick ass!The story as with the others, is very predictable and straightforward. I probably would have shot myself if I did not guess who the undercover bad guy was. But man! Who cares about the story with Chris Tucker strutting his stuff! Or mouth.Writing this review a week after I caught the movie made me realize that I hardly remember any specific jokes. (Try remembering the jokes after watching the movie). All in all, the movie is very forgettable but still as funny as ever as the clumsy duo wrecks havoc (and rubbish) in the final trilogy. A great popcorn movie to chill and laugh out loud!7/10",Rush Hour 3
172,city_of_screaming_statue,A funny action packed comedy,9,20 August 2007,"After the first 2 films, you always asked yourself weather Mr Ratner would bother with a third. Although fun to the first time viewer, the first and second doses of this comedy franchise quickly became boring and silly. The third i must say surpasses all expectations. With all the original cast that made Rush Hour what it is, This film is packed with friendly fast pace action all washed down with some hysterically funny moments thanks to Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan who some might consider to be the comedy duo of the century. This film certainly backs this. Perfectly executed one liners and facial expressions to boot. In conclusion, Rush Hour 3 is a must for anyone with a love for action comedy or just a love for the series in general.Being one of the better release of 2007, You wont be disappointed",Rush Hour 3
173,sandiskone,One of the funniest films of 2007 if not of all time!,10,15 August 2007,"This film may not have the explosive action as previous rush hours, but what it lacks in action is makes up in storyline and humour. There is a increase chemistry of the characters lee and tucker and makes you feel that over the years they have become very close and a sense of brotherly love between them. This film is one of the funniest films i'v seen and that every scene is pure class. Chris tucker is on top form, it truly makes him one of the funniest men in Hollywood super seeding Eddie Murphy, and Jacki Chan has become more funny in this film and a sense that because of Chris tucker he has become more relaxed and into the jokes a lot more. This is excellent film one that you can watch over and over again.",Rush Hour 3
174,Organic_6,"""Rush"" has never felt so slow",3,16 August 2007,"What we have here is a sequel of two action-comedy blockbusters and let me tell you that I'm a huge fan of Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2. Unfortunately, even though Brett Ratner had six years to direct a Rush Hour 3 it seems as if he didn't use his time wisely. Rush Hour 3 isn't necessarily a horrible film, its just void of belly laughs to make up for the disappointment in the weak action, story and chemistry. WARNING: Best jokes are used up in the trailer. The rest of the jokes have been used in other films or they're just not funny. Its hard to even tell when I was supposed to giggle.Carter and Lee try to solve a case in which a famous ambassador is shot in the chest the moment he is giving a ceremonial speech. Even though the ambassador is guaranteed to live, his daughter makes Carter and Lee make a promise that they will catch this criminal who put the ambassador in harm's way. After that it sort of just lost me. But I didn't care, I mean come on this is Rush Hour. I came here for the comedy right? Well it turns out that there's a bunch of twist and turns and rituals and mysteries that almost seemed like a supporting genre of the film.The relationship between Lee and his brother is tremendously frustrating. Mainly because his brother is an evil, foolish murderer and yet Lee can't accept the fact that killing him would make the future convenient. Throughout the film Lee hesitates to kill him which I know you'll grow tired of as well. But that's not Jackie's only problem. 99% of the film he looks miserable. What happened to the Lee that made an idiot of himself that we saw having a good time yet had the time to perform kick-ass action? Speaking of action scenes, the karate he uses is much more milder and instead of using his fists and legs he's always trying to defend himself with an object and running away instead of going after. Carter is more obnoxious than funny in this film. Just yelling and screaming words but the truth is that just because you amplify your voice doesn't make something funny. There's some plot in here that almost made me feel like I was watching Rush Hour 2 again cause we had that moment where Carter and Lee got mad at each other and become friends again, where they judge each other by race and the finale where they fly to the ground from a skyscraper with enemies firing at them. The action sequences aren't anything special, story hard to follow and comedy not in the league of the first two Rush Hours. Overall Rush Hour 3 is worthy of a rental. Nothing is worth while on the big screen though. I think people planning to see this would have a much more promising time at Stardust or Superbad.",Rush Hour 3
175,ultimecia_omega,Only for die hard Rush Hour fans,5,28 August 2007,"Rush Hour 3 was quite disappointing. The plot is straight out of your typical Asian kung fu style movie and therefore it is not very interesting at all and very predictable. The subplot between Inspector Lee and his Brother was awkward and i thought it was very fake and un-believable.But we don't go to see a Rush Hour film for it's story, but rather for the comedy that Chris Tucker brings and the fighting that Jackie Chan brings. Unfortunately both are lacking in Rush Hour 3. First of all the fight scenes are few and far between, featuring only 1 big fight at the end. I didn't find the film very funny either, Chris Tucker seems to have lost it in this film.The best part of Rush Hour 3 is the awesome French taxi driver who becomes an American Super-Spy for the day. His scenes were great and easily the funniest scenes in the movie, in my opinion.I can't say i can recommend this film to anyone but die hard Rush Hour fans or fans of Chris/Jackie. It's a typical movie with an uninteresting plot and sub-par fighting and comedy. 5/10",Rush Hour 3
176,salut1,Entertaining movie,9,21 August 2007,"It's a movie to be entertained not to get your brain picked on. If you like Rush hour 1 and 2, you will like RH 3. The scenery is beautiful and romantic, the photography is excellent. I don't understand why would people bash this movie. Noemi Lenoir is also gorgeous. H Tanaka is very handsome too. The club scene ( I have been to Paris about 50 times but cannot remember which night club this was but it was really hot) Lenoir lips will throw Angelina Jolie off the throne. My only complain was that Chris Tucker was such a loud mouth. He really was wisecracking all thru the movie,it was very annoying and not funny, it was too distracting. This is not a movie about the hood, I just don't know what the director was thinking. People over-hyped Bourne Ultimatum. Although I liked Bourne, I think it was too much action, not enough plot. RH 3 has the right mix of comedy and action and nice photography.",Rush Hour 3
177,DemiDuck,All in all not great but not bad,6,12 August 2007,"Rush Hour 3 was a mediocre copy of the first 2 Rush Hour movies. It had the same well choreographed action sequences and stunts, silly jokes, puns, and physical comedy and the predictability that we've come to expect of these films. I did laugh at most of the jokes though many were rather cheap. What bugged me most was how static the characters Carter and Lee seem to be. Everyone is always out to get them and yet they go to secluded areas and fully trust people they've met only moments ago. The plot is highly predictable. It has about the same amount of cinematic inaccuracies and ""Why the hell did they do that?"" moments as most movies. All in all it was good. I wouldn't recommend it for theaters however.",Rush Hour 3
178,ncman12004,Best Rush Hour I've seen...,8,20 August 2007,"Many times, the 1st part of a trilogy is what gets people to come back for the next two. Sometimes, the 2nd or 3rd part of a movie rarely best the 1st. This can NOT be said about ""Rush Hour 3"". In my opinion, the best ""Rush"" yet. If, and I do mean IF, they said their good-byes here, it was well fitting. The comedy scenes were perfect and the action was superb. It was nice to see Chris Tucker's character become MORE than he was in the last two. With ""Lethal Weapon"", I thought they were going to end it at 3. It wouldn't be hard to do another ""Rush"" as long as it's fresh and new. Kudos to Jackie Chan and his action scenes. Always above caliber and knowing that he does his own stunts is a credit to his work. As with the last ""Rush"", the outtakes at the end of the movie were hilarious, as was the whole movie. I normally don't see movies twice in the theaters, I've scene the first 2 ""Rush Hour""s on HBO, but this one, I would go see again. I was laughing from beginning to end, which is always a treat with Mr. Chan and Mr. Tucker.",Rush Hour 3
179,toxicyeah181,its pure entertainment...,8,11 August 2007,"I've noticed a lot of people commenting negatively on this title, but why? what were you expecting...rocket science, a miracle? its not that complicated. its just a feel good 90 minute movie, granted its not the best in the series, but it works. the 2nd is obviously the best, but this one still holds true to rush hour style. you cant really take away from that..can you? the acting is once again top notch between our two mismatched but lovable heroes. the dialogue is witty, the acting is good, and it still delivers the action we hunger for.and the supporting cast was great as well. it wasn't like the first two rush hours..where the supporting cast consumes as much time in the movie. they are given ample time to support the cast..not give them a run for their money. kenji,soo yung, dragon lady, genvieve and the big behemoth Japanese man help to create balance and equality for jackie and chris. i really like this movie. it deserves an 8. but because of its obvious lack of Oscar worthy material, its genre and its lame special effects at time, its stays at a solid 8.",Rush Hour 3
180,jsman-1,oh come on - seriously,1,14 September 2007,"Hey honestly guys, I liked the first one. Second one was decent. But this one is honestly terrible. Sure there are some nice little moments from Chris Tucker, but if I want some classic African-American humor I will download Chris Rock Uncut or something. The plot is ridiculously predictable and mundane - I'm sorry it's just boring to watch. And you know how you have some movies where you pick up on a few details that are just implausible, or a few objects aren't where they should be - but you let them slide because they are pretty minute and the movie is good anyway? Well this movie is loaded with so much garbage like that which is so central to the plot you just CAN'T ignore it.The whole ""wise-mouth"" American cop with the ""slightly aloof but smarter than he looks"" kung fu expert Asian cop thing was funny when it started, but it's old, not funny, and hence this movie sucks.",Rush Hour 3
181,BMovieScreamQueen13,Best of all Three!!!,9,7 September 2007,"Rush Hour 3 is an English comedy directed by Brett Ratner and made by New Line Cinema. It relies mostly on slapstick comedy to appeal to its audience, and at times it is expected for someone to slip on a banana peel to create this effect. Having said this, Rush Hour 3 can be a treat those with an open mind, or if you're like me, easily amused. Called one of summers ""guilty pleasures"" by critic Carrie Rickey of the Philadelphia Inquirer, it echoed true for many who stepped out of the theater probably feeling whole and satisfied, but reluctant to admit such feelings. Rush Hour 3's plot revolves around the attempted assassination of Ambassador Han, who was calling for a crack down on a particular powerful Asian gang. The Ambassador returns to the third film from Rush Hour 1, as does his now grown daughter Soo Yung who pleads Detective Carter and Inspector Lee to find the men who tried to kill her father, and who have now come for her. Detective Carter and Inspector Lee then use their unorthodox, but undeniable crude and side aching humor to confront the underground Asian gang who want anything but peace. It is predictably predictable, but James Carters' iconic animated facial features and attention grabbing techniques at ""stealth"", compliments, however messily with Inspector Lee's resourcefulness and martial arts skills. With its excessive bad language, racist and sexist remarks, sexual content, and nonstop violence, Rush Hour 3 deserved its PG-13 rating. I give this movie 9 out of 5 stars.",Rush Hour 3
182,arvawter,Lost Sense of Identity,5,2 May 2020,"Just rewatched all the Rush Hour movies, and this one stands out, and not in a good way. The first two Rush Hours use that buddy cop formula to perfection as Tucker and Chan have great chemistry together. The reason this movie feels lesser is that they spend so much time apart from each other that the movie loses that dynamic.It starts with an action chase where it feels like they couldn't even get Tucker and Chan on set together, so are completely separated with Chan not even knowing that Tucker was there. When they finally do meet up at the end of the scene, they interact extremely breifly before taking us to the next scene. Even in scenes they are both in, they are often apart such as when Jackie Chan is fighting a woman and Chris Tucker is listening in through the door. The two never really have any consequential dispute or growth and they end the movie just like they started it without a sense of need for them to return in this sequel.The action also takes a step down. The first film is a great action movie and I think the action in the second actually tops it with Chan doing many stunts with extensive choreography. One of the first fights is so overly cartoony it has a giant swinging a pole around as Chan and Tucker clutch on like it's some kind of amusement park ride. Chan's fight with the woman while Tucker is listening by the door is the stand out, but the big finale feels lesser. I'm not sure if it was because Jackie Chan is getting older or because the studio was worried about insurance costs for crazy action, or whatever it may be, but just as a pure action film it falters.The story is also confusing with the real plot not getting revealed until the scene before the climax of the film. Overall, this movie is a decent action flick compared to others in the genre at the time of release, but lacks the charm of the previous films. It's not awful by any means, but forgettable and a disappointing follow-up.",Rush Hour 3
183,jaguar__X,Excellent third installment of Rush Hour series,10,24 August 2007,"What can i say? There's more character development: Jackie Chan as Inspector Lee confronts his ""brother"", of whom he has spoken to no one else. Christ Tucker as James Carter has a deeper understanding of the Chinese culture and even has managed not to be the yelling cop that needs Lee to save him, holding his own against even a couple of triads.The two have a chemistry that is very hard to find in action comedy movies, and it's unfortunate that critics have lost a sense of humor, because they're falsely giving this movie a poor rating. RH3 deserves at least an 8/10 imo, because there was never a moment of dullness in the movie. It was always packed with scenes that progressed the action or that involved comedy.Jackie Chan even added a few more laughs than in his previous movies, and Chris Tucker's always funny. There wasn't a time in the movie where a joke was made and the theater crowd wasn't laughing out loud.It's also not an action/spy movie, so stop comparing it to Bourne Ultimatum(which i saw and thought was spectacular). RH3 is a hybrid combining good humor to some good action, and did a superb job at doing just that.If it ain't broke, don't fix it. And in my opinion, the duo, the action (with swords in the final scenes), and even some unsuspected twists, along with the jokes that we see in RH3 we done well, not overexaggerating or being dull. 9/10.",Rush Hour 3

Poor story with an ending full of holes (Entire triad organization consist of only 3 Non Chinese people and some goons??) At least it is funny including many unintentionally groan out aloud bits. The actress that played Soo Yong seems to thinks she is in it to win an Oscar with her overtly dramatic 'performance', one of the worst acting this year. However this film also features probably the most inspired cameo this decade by the great Roman Polanski as a Parisian Cop who got punched in the face by both leads as well as featuring an 'up yours America' bit with his index finger (Pop ref. to his criminal record back in the US?). And here I thought he never had a sense of humour and only directs dark and serious 'cinema'! On the other hand, the casting of the 'surprise' villain was so uninspired, it was fairly obvious right at the start (Hmm Triads, oh let's get 'Ming the merciless' duh!). Side note: Weird all the triad members were played by Japanese. Like what the heck was that about? Did Hollywood got confused with Yakuza with the Triad again? It is as bizarre as casting all Chinese actresses to play Japanese Geishas! But I guess that is Hollywood for ya. Oh and i am not so convinced by Tucker's last fight scene when Jackie took ages to fight them on one on one.",Rush Hour 3

I was surprised with that, but I have to admit, I did laugh more watching RH3 than The Simpsons Movie.So this not a disappointing Rush, its is about Bloody time the brought out one of these films, I mean come on the first two was hilarious, and this is as good.

Similarly to Jackson and Willis in ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"" or Gibson and Glover. We watch these films for the pure entertainment value they deliver and nothing more. There is no denying, young or old, watch with there movies with anticipation, ""what will they do next"" or ""what will they say next."" Regardless of what you've heard, this movie delivers, this movie rocks hard. Admittedly, its all been done before. There is nothing original nor new about the plot. There is hardly any movie out there that meets that criteria. All the movies out there are remakes or comics turning to film.

Well basically the movie is nice and all but i expected more from Jackie and Bratt Ratner,Chris like always is doing the job amazingly. Anyway the movie is nice and all but I expected more of it!a lot more! I gave the movie 9 only because I love the combination of Chris and Jackie in the same movie with the title ""Rush Hour"". In my opinion you should go and see the movie because it's funny and amusing and you really have fun and you can't even notice that the time runs by so quickly. My advice to you is to go and see the movie but don't get your hopes up because you'll end up like me,glad but a bit disappointed.",Rush Hour 3

Don't get me wrong he does some pretty awesome stuff... but not as much as in the previous two films.Really, that alone sums up my feelings on the movie....the humor was really good.... I mean.... I was probably laughing harder than anyone in the theater...but at the same time crying on the inside harder, knowing I'm not gonna see another epic Chan movie..its only out of my disappointment towards the future of this genre that I rate this a 4...lets just say.... if you are looking for humor its a yes....if you wanna see Jackie kick it old school like you expect, don't bother-Segwo",Rush Hour 3

It has the same formula than the first two rush hour but only more of them. More action, more humor and the chemistry between jackie and chris. The first two parts of the movie has a little bit less action (in fact about the same like rush hour 2 have if not more) but the finale ( who goes about 10 min) on the eiffel tower was freaking awesome.So if you liked part 1 and part 2 than go and see rush hour 3 too no matter what critics say.

Rush Hour 1, was fantastic, and for me Rush Hour 2 was even better. However Rush Hour 3, where do we begin? You know what you're going to get from this series of films when you sit down to watch Rush Hour 3, great fight scenes, Jackie Chan doing acrobatics and Chris Tucker singing. All this happened in the first 2, and they were great films. So why does the formula not work this time? Its because it's already been killed to death in the former 2. There is only so far you can push your luck with the same old formula (see Shrek) and unfortunately Rush Hour has done just this.That said, it's not an awful film. If you've got nothing to do one evening then stick Rush Hour 3 on, and you won't hate it.

Rush hour 3 is more on the Chris Tucker's jokes and punchlines than Jackie's fights, this probably down to Jackie's age. Although some of the jokes had been done before, I still found myself laughing, also the new comedy really made me laugh my head off.As for the storyline I found it to be, well, the typical Rush hour storyline but don't take that as a bad thing, it was a still a very enjoyable film that I will be watching again and again like I did with the first two.",Rush Hour 3

For all that I care, the movie could have been a musical and left the 5 minutes of footage of Chris Tucker both singing Prince's ""Do Me Baby"" in the streets, and his tantalizing rendition of our National Anthem in the cab. And who says the plot line was less eventful than a weekend with a pile of rocks! I consider myself a connoisseur of the Rush Hour films, and the ending truly shocked me.

First i was expecting something really bad, since sequels don't succeed very well.but the movie had some hilarious jokes, and i had more laughs than i was expecting to have.all though, in the end it was filled with lot of sugar, and the fighting scenes weren't that good. I had really hard guessing what would happen, but i knew from the beginning that the french taxi driver would make an important part in the plot. so, after seeing this movie, i think its a OK entertainment if your feeling down.",Rush Hour 3

Wow that was a long long time ago. Is Jackie Chan still alive? The humour is very much the same jokes as before and there are times where you just want to walk out. There is just nothing new in this ""episode"" and the film just feels like that the produces needed a few extra bucks to fill there pockets! The would have done better with releasing a new Jackie Chan action figure made out of paper! But, if you do go and see this film make sure you stay to the end because the outtakes are by far the best (and funniest) part of the film. If you liked Rush Hour 1 & 2 go see 3, but please...oh please stop there with the sequels; there is absolutely no need for a forth (or a third for that mater)!",Rush Hour 3

198,jackcampbell31,A Hongkonger and American cop try to get to the bottom of a Triad case in New York and Paris.,6,20 April 2009,"Rush Hour 3- Need I say more? Jackie Chan one of my favorite culture icons, Chris Tucker one of the most elusive but entertaining comic actors have a strangest chemistry as the good moral cop and the fast-talking international hot shot wannabe cop. When I heard the two along with Brett Ratner were hard at work with new Rush Hour and in Paris considering the hilarity of 1 and 2 and the success of recent 'French setting' films 'Ratatouille,' 'Mr. Bean's Holiday,' and kinda-sorta 'Pink Panther' I was really looking forward to it. When the film begins Chris Tucker is dancing to Prince and directing traffic--I know. The meeting of Soo Yung--I know. And a French woman (Noemie Lenoir) tangled in a triad smuggling scheme who falls for Carter-I know. And of course the taxi driver George (Yvan Attal) with the stereotypical French 'America's useless, dumb, and fat' was great comic relief.Before I get exited he film was actually recycled humor. The first time I saw it I was actually annoyed. Maybe it was the dumb settings for a buddy-cop movie like a kid's Chinatown martial arts centre or a sewer but seeing it when I had a bad day cheered me the heck up. I'm a sucker for comedy...WITH SOME TASTE (cough cough...parodies...Epic Movie...Disaster Movie...cough cough)I think when Jeff Nathanson decided to put a twist on Lee having a brother (Hiroyuki Sanad) who got into a messy life was recycled Hongkong drama/actor material but executed in a new light with the element of having it take place in a different locale (having to be Paris-looking for Shy Shen) was sort of new. My favorite element of the film were two things: When Lee and Carter split up and Carter who sees 'The Temple of Doom' and Lee who sees two men from a Masai tribe and miss each other and when they walk off to WAR by Edwin Starr, the trademark of the Rush Hour Movies. A nun spelling curse words and derogatory terms- I know!PS- Ratner might work on the project titled Rush Hour 4 in Moscow!",Rush Hour 3
199,Jukseri,"Rush Hour 3, the third wheel of a good movie series",5,30 September 2007,"I had high expectations for this film, because I absolutely love(d) Rush Hour 1 and 2. However, the conclusion of the trilogy is pretty sad.The actors(Tucker mostly) seem tired to do the film and I cannot see the same passion and energy for it that was present in the prequels. The plot is horribly predictable and corny, and most of the jokes unfortunately just don't work being only amusing, not truly funny.The things that partially save this movie are Jackie Chan's charisma, although he doesn't do as many stunts as before and also the Blooper reel at the end of the movie, which was the only really funny part of the movie.5/10",Rush Hour 3
200,robertp17,This is no Rush Hour,3,10 August 2007,"If you go into this movie expecting Rush Hour, then you'll be disappointed. If you want a Jackie Chan action flick then this is the one only please hold the Chris Tucker. Truly Tucker's horrible jokes (and delivery of them), the paper thin villains, the CG and the anti-Americanism ruin the Rush Hour series. First we'll deal with the anti-Americanism. Whatever you think of the current situation in the Middle East or this country one goes to the movies to get away from the real world and in this case to laugh (you won't do that either here). Well the director has decided that the Iraq war and us horrible Americans deserve some in-your-face chastising. While some of it is meant to be funny, most of it seems to be meant to tell us how he feels about America.Second, the jokes are mostly unfunny and break up what would be awesome action scenes. Most of this can be blamed on Tucker's character who works out by talking in this one instead of fighting bad guys. If you liked the jokes in Rush Hour and its sequel then you may find a few good ones here but nothing in comparison to those movies. Third, the villains and characters are as thin as the can get. Sure we know Tucker and Chan's characters but maybe you could give us a little more on the others? Oh, those villains? Don't worry about them, they're bad, trust us. This is what the director seemingly tells us.CG. Something Jackie Chan does not need you say? Not so says the director here. Jackie Chan's action scenes are the only redeeming part of this movie and even some of those scenes were tampered with by CG. Why did they need it? Well not to ruin anything but apparently we needed to do some extravagant things to make the move bearable to the modern audience. This is precisely what Rush Hour is not about. To top it off the CG is obvious and bad. The budget was not spent here.Overall I would avoid this movie. There are far better out in theaters and $10 is a lot to spend to hear Tucker crack some horrible jokes and hear why Americans are horrible.",Rush Hour 3

202,jazzx64,Biggest let down of 2007,1,13 August 2007,"Maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind when I went to watch this movie, but in my opinion this movie was truly awful and stands side by side with Epic Movie as worst movie I have seen this year.The laziness on display was shocking and it was clear to tell that this movie was all about Chris Tucker who is now officially not funny with his now tired whiny watered down erm 'comedy act'(well...unless you're aged 4 to 12 that is) It did have the odd moment or two but this was mostly desperate stuff. However one chap in the cinema I was in probably thought this was the greatest movie he'd ever seen with his constant bellowing throughout plus his added commentary on the movie itself. Good on HIM I say! No doubt it will find an audience who will put up with the cheesy jokes, lame action and ridiculous moments in the ahem storyline, but compared to Rush Hour 1 & 2 which were enjoyable, this was just a clear case of counting the money and running with no care or effort being made to make movie FUN!

203,justinblue,Rush Hour is still fun!,10,8 February 2008,"This movie series is great because it is still about the fun. I want to laugh and be entertained sometimes and Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker know just how to do it. It's nice to know that in the day and age we live in, someone is still interested in just making us laugh. This is a nice break from the norm. The movie is completely reliant on the performers of the film, not too much computer animation that would give the film a fake texture. Thank you for giving us a reason to smile instead of being either too serious, or so over the top that it's not even funny. The biggest mistake was waiting so long for part 3.

If you want to watch a truly superb movie with that same actor, watch The Twilight Samurai. He won the Japanese version of an Academy Award for Best Actor.You may have noticed that this bad guy was the right-hand man to Katsumoto in The Last Samurai.It's a totally different kind of movie than the Rush Hour series, so if you like these a lot, you may not like Twilight Samurai.Rush Hour 3, on the other hand, should never have been made. The very film it was printed on was probably embarrassed about the ordeal.",Rush Hour 3
205,larrybobba,worst comedy ever?,1,23 September 2007,"I never really laughed during this movie. While I enjoyed the first two Rush Hours, this one really stunk. It had the feel of a movie that the producer and director just threw together on the cheap, knowing they would make money because of the momentum from #1 and #2. I found it to be mean spirited. An example is stupid dialog such as ""I want to be like Americans and kill people for no reason"" from the cab driver was probably to lowest point of many low points in the movie. The plot line was lame and disjointed. It just seemed to me that everyone was lazy as they went about making it. I was shocked to see that it was in the top ten of new releases at the theaters. In my opinion, it was a total waste of my time and money.",Rush Hour 3

207,pooops-1,I liked it,10,12 September 2007,"Very Funny! I enjoyed the whole movie. I laughed my heart out in some scenes It was good. The movie is like the old time comedies, great humor. I liked that because most of the comedies lately are filled with dark humor and grotesque, and the it all goes about sex, it's all seen and done in some other teen movie(even if it is not a teen movie). Of course there could be done more about the plot, but even like that it disappoint the viewers. Some of the action scenes were made too far, it's obvious that they are impossible for a human being to do, but what can we do about American special effects, sometimes they spoil the whole movie. But not this one, it has enough other fresh moments to compensate.Jackie and Tucker are great team and if the producers decide to make Rush Hour 4, I'll definitely go see it :).",Rush Hour 3
208,bay_cj,Third sequel comes back with...Less Action...More Guilty Pleasure,8,27 March 2008,"It seems as if both Chan and Tucker enjoy themselves out there on the set while filming the movie. Rush Hour's return seemingly includes that deeply unpleasant humour combined with that typical Hollywood action script. But nonetheless no matter the degree of criticism the movie would receive, you could never stop yourself from that laughter you'd get from the slapstick duo. Putting aside the great chemistry felt from both main actors, the cab driver George (Yvan Attal) adds to the flavour of enjoyment. In conclusion, as for a movie marketed under the 'comedy' genre I personally think the movie deserves a 10 out of 10. But other than that the script is very well known among the average audience and the action supplied by Jackie Chan took a lesser degree in this one. So I would advice you to go for it if you are feeling depressed and you need that thing to cheer you up, but you are looking for a well told story well you are in the wrong place pal.",Rush Hour 3
209,darkshadow14,This is what we the people get?,1,5 September 2008,"I have never written a review before this one. Let me begin by saying I am a very qualified movie enthusiast. I love movies , all types of movies but sometimes I get fed up. And like most people won't say anything. But this movie enraged me. Rush hour and its sequel.....Rush Hour 2, both had the kinetic energy and drew a fine line between slapstick and action well. To be honest I'm not a Chris tucker fan I mean he has made 2 movies this century....the aforementioned Rush Hour 2 and now 3. He was brilliant in the first two movies though and was really funny. So this isn't an attack.First If you have a budget of $140 million dollars here is an idea get a script. Not one that keeps making you go I have no idea why or what just happened but oh well. Or I know ...be funny. A couple funny lines in a movie doesn't make it a funny movie.Second if you watch the movie close enough it copy's, takes or borrows plot devices and scenes from a lot of other movies that were way better.I want people to think about this $140 MILLION dollars(just let that sit there for a second) Third Since when did a Jackie Chan movie become so filled with special effects that the stunts don't even seem the least bit real therefore you can't even become engaged in the action. For crying out loud at one point they are sitting on the road and it looks like they have a blue screen behind them oooh dangerous......$140 MILLION dollars.Did I mention the runtime or as I like to call it actual time 81 minutes minus the credits, which movie company's always add in so their films seem longer. This is what we as the movie going public will get if we don't say ENOUGH! I would rather wait 10yrs. for a movie thats half decent than 6 years and get this $140 Million dollar movie that we told the movie execs is OK to make. What would you buy for a $140 MILLION dollars?",Rush Hour 3
210,sawestrpsgtrst,Sequelitis,3,8 November 2020,"It's a general rule of thumb that sequels fall short of their predecessors,and second sequels are even worse. There are exceptions, of course, but the Rush Hour franchise follows this rule to the letter. In comparison to 1 and 2, 3's action sequences are more tame, it""s comedy less funny, it's plot more contrived and preposterous. And Chris Tucker just irritates.I see in IMDb that there's a Rush Hour 4 in production.

The story itself is rather interesting which makes you sitting on the edge of your chair to see what happens next.This is a must see if you love comedy films that have an interesting story and several fighting scenes. It was a great addition to the previous movies and although it may not be better than Rush Hour 1 and 2 i strongly believe part 3 fits in perfectly.I would give this my personal rating, comedy 9/10 action 8/10 story 7/10 either way this is my own opinion, but i know several people that really enjoyed this movie and even saw it for a 2nd time at the cinemas.

215,nut_untouchable,"Same humor, different feeling",8,6 October 2007,"First i would like to comment on all the critics who put this movie in a bad day light. There are no errors in the movie (some said you could see the blue screen in stunt scenes etc) and the story is very clear. Some critics said you never find out what happened in New York, but you do so they either haven't seen the movie or want to criticize it.The movie itself is very good with the same humor only a bit different. Part 1 and 2 had a more relaxed and joyful feeling to it and part 3 has a more somber and serious feeling to it. This is not necessarily bad but this way it feels like another movie. What's more of the same is the humor which is good most of the time but sometimes really lame. As a result Tucker's jokes feel off at times. For example, the sewer scene where Chan talks serious to his brother and Tucker keeps joking. The first two movies worked because of they used the same formula and that also counts for this movie but they overdo it a bit. For example, where Chan's starts talking slang and the scene where Tucker mentions Tito again etc. The action is of course also there and like in the previous movies. The story is a bit simple but i like the fact they did some new things, like where Tucker and Jackie part ways. The plots of the first 2 movies were much better which makes this movie the least difficult and least interesting. The end is a conclusion of a rushed plot and rushed release. It could've been much better if they took more time, at least have a part in New York, Roselyn Sanchez played a part like intended and a different plus more stretched ending.",Rush Hour 3
216,darkdefender85,Good Movie...Good Ending,7,27 December 2007,"I think that this movie was pretty good. It has some great action scenes with Jackie Chan, who always delivers in that department, and even Chris Tucker gets in on the martial arts fun. It delivers some laugh just like the two previous films and brings the series full circle. Carter and Lee realize that they are ""Brothers From Other Mothers"" and they have to recuse Soo Yung again, just like in the first movie. The movie ends with Carter and Lee dancing off to the song ""War"" which is the song that they first bonded to in Rush Hour. The series should end here while it has a bit of dignity left and while Carter and Lee dance off into the night, a perfect metaphor for the end of the trilogy.",Rush Hour 3

Mindless action and simple comedy make this a great movie to lose yourself in. Sure it's not ""Citizen Kane"" but I didn't go into the movie expecting classical acting.Jackie Chan was his typical bumbling Kung Fu action guy with fumbling English and Chris Tucker played his sharp humor to great effect. Sure there were a couple of ""beyond reality"" scenes but that's what I go to the movies for.I had a great time.

The action scenes at the Eiffle Tower were terrific. Even the Frech cab driver added a lot to the thin substance of the movie.

Always good story, interesting fighting and happy ending.But I don't really enjoy Rush hour 3. As we know the soul of a film is storyline, which must be intact, coherent and reasonable, even in a comedy. However, the storyline in rush hour 3 is far beyond perfect and always interrupted by a lot of ridiculous jokes. For example, At the end of the film, Chan sang and danced with Chris for victory, but he had just cried for losing his brother several minutes ago, that is absurd.

His age is obviously beginning to have an impact, with his stunts being toned down a bit, yet there were a couple of scenes where we got to see him performing the magic we have come to love him for.The plot was nothing overly imaginative but it didn't have to be; the movie worked great, especially how it tied in with characters from the first movie.Rush Hour 3 attempts to tackle some very emotional issues, though I found that didn't work with me as I was too busy laughing to invest myself emotionally in such scenes.I was sceptical that this movie would top the greatness of Rush Hour 2 but, in my opinion, it exceeds it and is definitive proof that sequels do not always have to suck.Chan and Tucker compliment each other greatly, and whilst it felt like there was little action in this movie compared to the previous instalments, the action provided was more than satisfactory. Rush Hour 3 has definitely been worth the wait.",Rush Hour 3
230,Huge_Eug11,"Not as good as 1 & 2, but still funny!",6,10 August 2013,"Rush Hour 3 is not as good as the first two, but was still a pretty entertaining movie; that is its main strength.In the first two portions of the movie, there are plenty of funny one-liners and unexpected hilarity throughout. Chris Tucker's best moment was in the kung fu school where Soo Yung teaches as he meets the master of the place and his minions. While the drama was reserved for Chan's character, he still has his moments, especially when he starts singing. Brett Ratner knows better than to mess around and lets the spotlight shine on Tucker, and let Tucker work his comedic magic. However, Ratner's fear to try something unique and spin something new to the franchise sets it apart from the other two as Rush Hour 3 begins to grow stale as the third act approaches. Another problem is that he attempts to throw in a bit of drama, something really not needed. Come on now, what we Americans need is a mindless Chan action flick! Lack of action also hampers Rush Hour 3, which has nowhere near as many thrills as the other two, nor are the sequences any better either (the best fight in the trilogy remains in the original, with the pool table showdown). By the end, even the ending was rather weak, as it doesn't really offer any appetite for more Rush Hour—nor does it seem like a fitting conclusion.Bottom Line: While it is unfair for Rush Hour 3 to follow-up to the amazing first two Rush Hours, the movie still suffers from following an obvious formula and not giving the dosage of action we've expected from the series. The chemistry is still there between the two, but the supporting cast, writing, directing, and lack of action hampers what could have been another good addition to the trilogy. Jackie Chan remains quite underused no matter what director is handling him in Hollywood (last time he was superbly used by Americans was 2003's Shanghai Knights). They should whether try something new to the series, or just end it altogether, because the staleness is beginning to show, especially when approaching the climax of the movie. Rush Hour 3 may taste a bit stale, but still has a bit of flavor, mostly coming from the essential ingredient Chris Tucker. Needs more Chan though.",Rush Hour 3
231,tachicey,Painfully bad,1,29 August 2007,"I really hadn't thought it could be as bad as it was. I found it downright offensive in a few points and the humor was weak at best.Potential spoiler...There's a scene where they force a French taxi driver at gunpoint to sing the US National Anthem which made me spontaneously so ashamed to be American I wanted to crawl out of the theater and apologize to the rest of the planet. It was ugly to an extreme. I think the worst bit is whoever wrote it likely thought it was funny.I'm rather certain one could almost pick any other film showing and have a better time. I wanted to walk out of the theater several times. The only reason I didn't was that I had gone with a friend, and even at that I considered leaving anyway.",Rush Hour 3
232,benjamin_rulz,Rush hour,9,2 February 2014,Very funny! Love the last 2 movies and the same with all Rush hour movies. Rush hour has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Putting Jacky Chan and Chris Walker together is a great combination. They should do something like this a lot and make a rush hour 5. I love every rush hour because of the action and story plot. This makes it a awesome movie to watch.This also makes it very funny and action-packed movie. The rush hour movies should be on DVD so people can buy it and watch it. Movies like this are something for me to admire and to watch. This has got to be one of the best movies I've seen of Jacky Chan. Though you have Chris Walker in it to make it funny so this makes it something to remember.,Rush Hour 3
233,heartsparkdollar,TV Show,2,18 August 2007,"This movie would have made a really good TV show. It wasn't that funny. Did Chan/Tucker make this movie for the money? It appears that the whole movie was made as an after thought. The best part of the movie were the outtakes. I would not recommend anyone seeing this movie. I realize that not all films are going to classics, and people go to movies to escape from life for a couple of hours. But when I pay $10 to get in, and another $10 for a coke and popcorn, I would like to think I got my moneys worth. This film did not give me my moneys worth. It is no small wonder that Hollywood is complaining that they are not making any money. They have made very few quality films in the last several years.",Rush Hour 3
234,Rothwell19,"The Rush is back, but isn't half as strong as you would remember it",6,14 August 2007,"In this day and age there is nary an action move, sci-fi, or horror film which does not tie in with the word 'franchise'. Sequels are a sure way to cash in on the success of original films while also giving the chance to offer something new and exciting. Unfortunately, this is not always how it turns out.Rush Hour 3, the third installment in the venerable series that brought Jackie Chan back before western audiences is part of the latter; its the same characters you know and love but it brings nothing new to table.The original Rush Hour was a breath of fresh air, it combined Jackie Chan's expert stunts and martial arts with Chris Tucker's comedic elements and it delivered non-stop action and laughter. With Rush Hour 3 however, the formula is getting a little old and so are the jokes, which are recycled from the last two movies and are hit and miss at best.Rush Hour 3 does have its moments but they are ruined by too many cringe worthy spots, as well as a plot that does nothing more then lead to action sequences. There are other characters in the film but you since they don't have much to do, you don't care what happens to them.Overall, Rush Hour fans will get a kick out of it, but that sweet and sour zip and charm of the first two movies is gone, and in its place is an aftertaste of a movie that could have been so much more.",Rush Hour 3
