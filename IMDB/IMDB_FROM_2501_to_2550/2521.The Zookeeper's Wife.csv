0,SnoopyStyle,solid Holocaust drama,7,11 November 2017,"Antonina (Jessica Chastain) and Jan Zabinski run the Warsaw Zoo. She's a hands on zookeeper. When the war starts, the zoo is not spared. Nazi zoologist Lutz Heck convinces Antonina to transfer her prized animals to Berlin. The Zabinskis try to befriend Heck and convinces him to allow them to raise pigs in the zoo. This allows Jan access to the ghetto which he uses to save some 300 Jews right under Heck's nose.This is a solid Holocaust drama. It's not new but still very much worth telling. There are some heart strings pulled. Sometimes like the little kids is too much. I would still make a couple of changes. The accented English needs to be reduced if not eliminated all together. It's just silly to have characters speak English but in an accent. Chastain is doing too much accent. Everybody should speak in a neutral manner. The second change is the title. It is bland and weak. They could call it a Human Zoo and that would be much better. I can overlook most of that and there is a compelling story underneath.",The Zookeeper's Wife
1,Prismark10,Unlikely sanctuary,4,7 August 2017,The director has managed to turn The Zookeeper's Wife into a lacklustre film with soap opera elements.Antonina Zabinski (Jessica Chastain) and husband Jan Zabinski (Johan Heldenbergh) are vets at the Warsaw zoo but when the Nazis invade the animals are killed. Hitler's zoologist and the chief of the Berlin zoo Lutz Heck (Daniel Brühl) takes an interest in the zoo to revive extinct species of wild cattle and Antonia herself.Heck allows them to turn the zoo into a pig farm. In return the Zabinski's spirit away Jews from the ghetto and into the safety of the tunnels underneath their home.The film is aiming to be Schindler's List with animals. There is a magnificent scene as animals roam outside of the zoo after it has been bombed with soldiers having no option but to shoot them. However the film comes across as tedious.,The Zookeeper's Wife
2,lee_eisenberg,one of the Righteous Among the Nations,8,7 July 2017,"On the one hand we could call ""The Zookeeper's Wife"" another movie about the Nazis' actions. But I'd say that an important point that the movie makes is that everywhere in Europe there were people who stood up to the Third Reich. In this case, the protagonist is Antonina Żabiński, who with her husband Jan harbored a number of Jews during the Nazi occupation of Poland. The Nazis cleared the Warsaw Zoo of animals, and so the Żabińskis helped Jan's Jewish colleagues into the zoo, where the latter stayed during the occupation.A similar movie that I saw was Agnieszka Holland's ""In Darkness"", about a sewer worker who used his knowledge of Warsaw's sewer system to help the Jews hide there. I guess that everywhere in Europe there were both collaborators and people who helped the Jews. Yad Vashem eventually recognized the Żabińskis as part of the Polish Righteous Among the Nations.I recommend ""The Zookeeper's Wife"". It reminds us that there is good in us all. Jessica Chastain puts on one of the finest performances of her career.",The Zookeeper's Wife
3,Quinoa1984,"honorable, well-acted, dull and safe all at once",6,7 April 2017,"Maybe it's because of films like Son of Saul not being too far removed in recent memory, but something like The Zookeeper's Wife seems like weak tea in comparison. Or, if that may not be fair (and perhaps it's not as it's well-shot and has some interesting and effective spurts of montage editing - not throughout, but at times), it's a soft movie, the kind of holocaust-period-WW2 movie I'd be perfectly fine showing kids in a middle school class or even to 4th graders to teach them a little about the period it's set in in 1939-1946 Warsaw, Poland. It's also meant to be a suspense movie about a Polish couple (with Jessica Chastain as a Saintly 'Shiksa', she's never called this it's just my name for her) who are hiding Jews they've snuck out of the ghetto in their zoo during the war as Germans only let the zoo and the owner and his wife stay due to a pig farm and, uh, a bizarre medical experiment involving Bison-Oz hybrids(!?) The most effective moment of the film for me doesn't come with these scenes of 'acting' by Chastain's character and others when the Jews are hiding in the tunnels leading from the main building to the zoo cages, but earlier when it involves the animals in the zoo and especially after the initial bombing in September of 39. Seeing Antonina help revive a baby elephant may seem slightly cheesy, but it works to establish how I'll-see-this-through-till-the-end she is, and she pours pathos on this scene as well as many others like syrup at an IHOP. And the moments where the animals are drifting about after the first bombing/attack is haunting and striking; I want to see a movie that has this as a more central scenario some day, where we see these animals that shouldn't be wandering around a small European city in the 30's. For a brief moment it makes the film unique.But the animals soon go away - they have to, though we're pretty sure we'll never see them again, which is fine - and the plot to save the Jews kicks in to gear. I think an issue for me with this movie is that Caro's pacing is at times a little too fast. It's not always, though I wanted more scenes like when Lutz (Bruhl's Nazi villain) is telling the zookeeper and his wife about his plans to mate the bison with the ox. Again, kind of an interesting take to see weird medical s*** in a movie like that (certainly not like the more WTF Nazisploitations of the 70s, but hey I'll take what I can get). Otherwise, it's one of these safe, boilerplate stories about bravery and (sorta) sacrifice in the face of all danger and so on, which also includes (as one might also expect, in part from the trailer) that Lutz might make moves in Antonina and this makes some strife for husband Jan.When I say that The Zookeeper's Wife is perfectly fine to show children, I mean it. That may not necessarily be a terrible thing per-say, and if this was the very first exposure to what the holocaust was about I could see it as exciting and fascinating drama. But after things like Son of Saul or, seeing Bruhl here and it being about hiding Jews reminds me as well, Inglourious Basterds, you got to go a little more for unpredictable beats. The suspense comes often from whether or not a character will be found out and, until near the end when Jan's life is in considerable danger and Antonina has no choice but to try to use her feminine wiles to save him or find him or whatever, I never felt that suspense.Some of this could be on the writing part (there's even a beat where I was sure Lutz was about to discover something, he clearly hears a kid laughing nearby, but Antonina distract him), but I wondered if Caro could've done a little more to heighten the tension and direct the actors to... be better actors, or I should say when the characters have to/must act in order to protect themselves against the usually suspicious, don't-ever-f***-with-them Nazis. And lastly, and this is only a personal point for me, Bruhl ultimately doesn't get enough chances to show how villainous he may be or really is; in that last stretch with Antonina Lutz clearly becomes perturbed and rape-like, but he never crosses a line that may, you know, put the audience further on edge or increase the risk of danger - and just when one thinks the movie will go there (surprise, not) it doesn't.This isn't to say obviously every movie's got to to Son of Saul levels - that movie, on the flip-side, may have gone too far into pummeling its audience with intense-depressing horror - but the drama becomes minimal when the underlying feeling of it all is, 'Yeah. it's horrible right now, but at least we're all okay.' And this is different than a Schindler's List, which left more room for ambiguity and showing the horrors when it had to. There are points where for all of its handsome craftmanship and, I must point out so I'm not so callous, that Chastain and Bruhl are wholly believable in their parts, it's kind of dull, and the holocaust and its stories should never be that.",The Zookeeper's Wife
4,michaelRokeefe,Efforts to save citizens and animals in 1939 Warsaw.,8,6 February 2018,"After Hitler's Luftwaffe bombings of Poland's capital, Warsaw; caretakers Jan Zabinkski (Johan Heldenbergh) and his wife Antonina (Jessica Chastain) turn their zoo into a different kind of sanctuary.

5,writers_reign,Zoo Story,6,28 April 2017,"World War II in general and specifically the Holacaust continue to attract filmmakers and it would seem that the further away we get from the actual events - and it's now something like seventy years in the past - the more directors and writers look for new angles to tell and/or embellish the same facts - Sarah's Key was a case in point - and now we have The Zookeeper's Wife, based on fact, with a man and wife running the zoo in Warsaw - a zoo that still stands today so a caption at the end tells us - and using it as a refuge to hide Jews smuggled out of the infamous Warsaw ghetto. The film opens in 1939, technically still peacetime, and shows us the extent to which the couple love the animals in their care and how competent they are in their stewardship. It's largely low-key with more emphasis on day-to-day living than gung- ho action scenes and as such is quietly effective. Performances are excellent throughout with only Jessica Chastain and Daniel Bruhl being known outside Europe. Recommended.",The Zookeeper's Wife

Everyone knows that ""History Repeats Itself,"" and THE ZOOKEEPER'S WIFE dutifully depicts the complacent Polish Jews of the 1930s promising to return to their homes after ""this"" (Hitler's Third Reich) is over. As we all know, unless their ashes miraculously drifted back like homing pigeons from Adolph's Death Camp Crematoria to their burned-out original residences, these proved to be hollow, unfulfilled promises. ZOOKEEPER'S final credits state that Warsaw LOST 94% of its overall population by the end of World War Two, and every move of the Odoriferous Rump\Scents Gang suggests that Putin is shooting for a similar ""culling"" percentage of Americans in our Once-Great USA Homeland. ZOOKEEPER'S ""Jan"" doesn't resort to Armed Resistance until its Waaaay Too Late to save the doomed 94% of his community. Certainly this film is urging US to begin putting up a stronger, more timely Resistance to the Putin\Rump Mob NOW so that these Traitorous U.S. Fifth Column Turncoats are not allowed to consign We True Blue Normal Loyal Patriotic Union Label Citizens to the ash bin as were the sheep-like Poles and Jews!",The Zookeeper's Wife
7,AlsExGal,Keeping it PG-13 makes it more powerful emotionally than seeing everything,8,20 December 2017,"I enjoyed The Zookeeper's Wife and would recommend it to most audiences. Skillful direction by Niki Caro, excellent sets and costumes, a slightly washed-out look to the cinematography which nonetheless has a full range of color, and a capable cast. The story is based on the actions of the owners of the Warsaw Zoo, who saved the lives of more than three hundred Jews during the Nazi occupation of Poland.Nonetheless, the performance of Jessica Chastain is the single most important factor in the film. Unlike many American actors, she understands that a Polish woman of the 1940s does not look, move, or carry her features like a contemporary American. So fully does Miss Chastain inhabit her character that I never had the sense of an actress making choices.The film is a bit long and a bit slow, like most films today, but not to a damaging extent. I particularly admired the way that the official from the Berlin Zoo who becomes a Nazi officer, well played by Daniel Bruhl, has certain scruples and personal moral standards although he embraces the Nazi philosophy. He's a villain, but not a cardboard villain, and part of the suspense of the film is waiting to see which lines he will cross and which he won't.",The Zookeeper's Wife
8,ferguson-6,My heroes have always been zoologists,7,30 March 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. Heroes come in all shapes and sizes. Director Niki Caro (North Country, Whale Rider) introduces us to the story of zookeeper Jan Zabinski and his wife Antonina. The couple is a stunning example of heroism and bravery and compassion – both in cuddling with tiger cubs and in assisting approximately 300 Jews escape to freedom during the Nazi invasion of Warsaw in 1939. You might think of this as Schindler's Zoo.We first see Antonina (Jessica Chastain) as an angelic figure pedaling her bike through the zoo during morning rounds with a trotting young camel alongside, and soon thereafter helping rescue a newborn elephant from peril. It's an idealistic image that appears shattered as soon as the German bombs begin dropping on Warsaw and the zoo. But the true story of what actually happened is more heartwarming and inspiring than a dozen fuzzy bunnies or peach-eating hippos.Diane Ackerman's 2007 book was based on the diaries of Jan and Antonina Zabinski, and is adapted for the screen by Angela Workman. Yes, that's right  a woman director and woman writer collaborating on a film version of a book written by a woman about another woman! Some may say the film is too glossy and skips over the brutality of the Nazi's, but this is the story of a brave, compassionate woman and how she and her husband risked their lives to save others. There is no shortage of films that depict the horrific tragedies that occurred in concentration camps, so it seems we should certainly celebrate the kind and courageous who did all they could in rescue efforts, as they used the Warsaw Zoo as a way to hide Jews in plain sight.In addition to Ms. Chastain, who sports an unusual Russian accent throughout, Johan Heldenberg plays her husband, and Daniel Bruhl plays Lutz Heck – Hitler's Chief Zoologist at the Berlin Zoo. The scenes between Heck and Antonina are excruciating as he first charms her with his love of animals, and then later frightens her with his unwanted advances and desire to cross-breed animals in hopes of creating superbeasts (sound familiar?).One of the key messages seems to come from an early monologue delivered by Antonina where she compares the purity of animals (their eyes tell you everything) with the propensity to deceive and commonplace of ulterior motives in humans. While she prefers one approach over the other, it's obvious that Antonina values all life and will pay whatever price necessary to save others. She has her chance to run, but chooses to stay and fight evil in the only way she knows how. Here's hoping the film doesn't begin a fad of pet skunks, but its message of compassion and courage is never out of place. The story runs from 1939 through 1946 and reminds us that heroes are amongst us always, and their journey can be both stressful and inspiring.",The Zookeeper's Wife
9,sddavis63,An Important If Lesser Known Story From The Holocaust,8,1 September 2017,"Strangely in a movie about The Holocaust, my first reaction as I got into the main events of the movie was sympathy. As the Germans bomb Warsaw, I found myself feeling such angst for the animals at the Warsaw Zoo, who must have been absolutely terrified by what was happening. That's obviously not the main message or reaction that the movie is going for, but it's effective as a way of drawing us into the much more serious plight of Warsaw's Jews after the German occupation of Poland.I'll say right off the top that this isn't ""Schindler's List"" - which, for me, remains the most powerful and most moving Holocaust film ever made. Having said that, it rightly honours the courage and sacrifice of the Zabinski family. Jan and Antonina owned the Warsaw Zoo. They took wonderful care of the animals - Antonina especially having a special bond with them - and as the movie opens (in the summer of 1939) all seems bliss. There are concerns about a possible German attack, but no one seems to take them very seriously - especially not Dr. Heck, a Berlin zoologist who is a friend of the Zabinskis and denied any interest in politics. Once war comes, though, the bliss disappears, Jews start to be rounded up and confined to the Warsaw Ghetto, and the Zabinskis hatch a plan to save as many Jews as they can - starting with their best friends, then a girl who Jan rescues after she is raped by two German soldiers (it was an absolutely haunting and disturbing scene as she's led away into an alley by them, and actress Shira Haas was superb in depicting the absolutely traumatized girl afterward.) Eventually, they hid over 300 Jews in the Zoo, saving them from the concentration camps. It's a powerful story - a true one, and one that I was unfamiliar with (and I consider myself fairly familiar with that part of history.) Like Schindler from the aforementioned movie, the Zabinskis were eventually declared ""Righteous Among The Nations"" for their heroic work during the War.The brutality of the war was clearly depicted; the terror that must have been felt by the Jews was felt. In a way, Heck sums up what is still to this day one of the great mysteries of that era: how Germans who, before Hitler and the War, were good and decent people could become consumed by the Nazis and their evil ideology. Because as the movie started, Heck did seem like a decent person - not someone you would expect to become caught up in the work of the Holocaust.Jessica Chastain played the title character as Antonina. Her performance was good (as were the performances in general) but I found the fake accent she (and others) used in this movie to be at times difficult to follow and sometimes distracting. I really would prefer that actors in these kinds of roles just use their normal voices, because phony accents really don't convince me or give any feel of reality to the story. But beyond that there really isn't very much to criticize about this - except that perhaps the suffering in the Ghetto was somewhat underplayed, and the ongoing focus on the plight of the animals might have been a bit overdone at the expense of the human tragedy that was unfolding.

10,Hellmant,"History buffs, and fans of the genre, will definitely enjoy it.",8,1 August 2017,"'THE ZOOKEEPER'S WIFE': Four Stars (Out of Five) A World War II drama, based on the non-fiction book (of the same name) by Daine Ackerman. It tells the true story of a zookeeper, and his wife, who rescued many Jews from the Nazi army, by hiding them at their zoo in Warsaw, Poland. The movie was directed by Niki Caro (who's also helmed such other critically acclaimed dramas as 'WHALE RIDER' and 'NORTH COUNTRY'), and it was written by Angela Workman. The film stars Jessica Chastain, Johan Heldenbergh, Daniel Bruhl and Michael McElhatton. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it also performed modestly at the Box Office. I enjoyed it.Dr. Jan Zabinski (Heldenbergh), and his wife Antonina (Chastain), were the keepers of the Warsaw Zoo; which was one of the biggest and most famous zoos in Europe at that time (in the 1930s). In 1939, an aerial bombing killed a lot of the animals though, while many others were then executed by the Nazis. Hitler's top zoologist, Dr. Lutz Heck (Bruhl), offered to save the top specimens, as he also shamelessly hit on Antonina at the same time. Horrified by the mass murder of Jews in the area, Jan and Antonina then decided to turn their zoo into a pig farm, and use it to hide Jews form execution there. Heck agreed to the idea, to feed his men, and he also planned to conduct bizarre animal experiments there. Antonina and Jan then desperately struggled to save as many people as they could, for years, while hiding their activities from Heck.The movie is definitely educational, and involving most of the time. I really like the film the most when it deals with the animals, being a huge animal lover, but of course the story is mostly about the rescuing of Jews. This is something we have seen many times before, in similar war movies, but I didn't know this particular story yet. The acting is all good in the film as well (especially Chastain of course), and it's well directed by Caro too. I think history buffs, and fans of the genre, will definitely enjoy it.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/j_XDrmlMJNY",The Zookeeper's Wife
11,dromasca,Holocaust - the story of the people who helped,5,7 August 2017,"It's not easy to make a good fiction movie about the Holocaust. The story was told many times from different perspectives, it has a well known ending and a definite set of tragic victims and of evil characters. Although the number of movies made annually in the genre does not seem to decrease, there were just a few in the last decades that succeeded to present a fresh perspective, a complex approach and a human dimension that turns the historic tragedy into artistic thrill: 'Life Is Beautiful', 'Schindler's List', 'The Pianist', 'Defiance'. Unfortunately director Niki Caro's 'The Zookeeper's Wife' is far from this league.The exemplary story of Jan and Antonina Zabinski is worth being told and was already described in books and history articles. Jan Zabinski was the director of the Warsaw Zoo which was famous in the years before WWII both as a place of entertainment as well as a place of research and preservation of rare species of animals. With the breaking of the war and the occupation of Poland, the zoo was closed, and some of the most precious animals transferred to Germany. Jan was a member of the Polish resistance and he engaged in a very risky activity of saving Jews out of the ghetto of Warsaw, hosting them in the zoo and in his home, procuring false identity papers and transferring them to safety. He did this at the high risk for his life and for the life of his family. Hundreds of people were saved by the couple. For their deeds Jan and Antonina were both awarded the titles of Righteous Among the Nations by the State of Israel.Antonina Zabinska wrote a diary which was forgotten for many decades and American writer Diane Ackerman published a book based on it. Unfortunately, the fiction film while using some of the factual material in the book does not build a story compelling enough to sustain the story, does not add anything, but just simplifies and romanticizes to some extent the characters without adding any motivational dimension. The best part of the film is the one describing the almost idyllic animals environment in the Zoo facing the brutal realities of the breaking of the war. The most cruel scenes about the ravages of war actually feature the dead animals, while the horrors of the life in ghetto are rather suggested. The decisions of the couple lack motivation, we just need accept that they were wonderful people, we learn late and incidentally about their involvement with the Polish resistance, but on the other hand there is too much insistence in my opinion on the ambiguous relationship between Antonina (good acting by Jessica Chastain) and the Hitler's zoologist put in charge with the Zoo. 'The Zookeeper's Wife' turns an excellent page of history into just another Holocaust film, full of clichés and melodrama. The story and its heroes would have deserved a good documentary or a better fiction film.",The Zookeeper's Wife
12,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,6 July 2017,"The Zookeeper's WifeThe best part about having animals as your co-workers is that you can pet them during meetings.Unfortunately, the only engagements in this drama are with Nazis.Jan Żabiński (Johan Heldenbergh) is a predominate zoologist who maintains a menagerie in Warsaw with his wife Antonina (Jessica Chastain). When Hitler wants to resurrect extinct animals with help from his own zoologist, Dr. Lutz Heck (Daniel Brühl), the couple is obligated to open their zoo to the bizarre experiments.Unbeknownst to herr doctor, however, the Żabińskis are harbouring Jewish families within the walls of the park.While this true story of wartime charity is intriguing, this artistic adaptation of the bestseller doesn't deliver the emotional gut-punch expected from a Holocaust movie. Sluggish, with a stereotypical SS villain and a fictitious love triangle, admission to this exhibit is regrettable.

It was a well made film, based on the real, about the WWII. Actually, it all begins prior like in the 1939. The happy couple who was running one of the most notable zoo in all of Europe, in the Poland capital, suddenly started to lose the animals for nazi air raids. The remains were taken away when the city, the nation was invaded. Soon the empty enclosure becomes hideout for the Jeweish. But it is not an easy task, the consequences are serious. How the rest of the story folds out was a little emotional.The best performance by Jessica Chastain continues. She's choosing the nice films and roles. I had expected a big name pairing up with her, but the Belgian actor was good in a small part. Like any WWII film, a heart-wrenching story. Everything was told from the zookeeper's perspective, particularly the wife.The story also takes us outside the enclosure, with a series of glimpses of horror visuals that we had seen in other films. So it limits to what these people did, that's to shelter the Jewish community. Another WWII film from another perspective that one should see it. I've heard that some are saying it was not honest.

Antonina (Jessica Chastain) and her husband Dr. Jan (Johan Heldenbergh) were zookeepers of the Warsaw Zoo in Poland. They were open arms to every guest that came to visit. They loved and cared for their animals. When war torn through their country causing chaos, when Jews were forced to leave their homes and transported to camps from the Nazi's. Dr. Jan and Antonina tried rescuing a few people at a time by smuggling them back to their house pretending they are getting scraps and food for the remaining animals they do have. They kept the people safe in their basement until Dr. Jan was able to find a safe house to keep them there. Even, when Germans Zoologists Dr. Lutz (Daniel Bruhl) comes by to visit, hoping they can breed a specific type of bison. Dr. Jan is out, getting fake passports through a bakery to help these people cross without being discovered. Dr. Lutz lurking around the zoo and the helpless Antonina. What I liked about the film is the story's direction about Antonina and her husband. And their bravery act of saving people from being sent to these concentration camps. They are a loving couple and compassionate towards friends and people and animals. When war is tearing down their home and friends. They are trying to savage what is left of their home. It is a sad emotional journey of seeing these characters going through the darkness of this war. Jessica Chastain is a beautiful talented actress. Her performance was amazing. Johan Heldenbergh, Michael McElhatton (famous in Game of Thrones), and Daniel Bruhl all gave great performances as well. The music composer Harry Gregson-Williams also helped gave a score that delivered this eerie tough times with people being driven away from home. There homes being destroyed and burnt to ashes. It tries to help deliver the emotional impact with the film. Although, what did not work with the film is the direction could have tried to help deliver a better strong emotional impact. It sets up the dark tone of people being torn away from their homes, seeing kids being lifted on a concentration camp train while they are helpless but to accept their fate on where they are going. The direction was lacking the suspense and thrills to build the momentum. It was also pretty slow and boring in the second act. Where nothing in the plot was progressing at all when Dr. Jan was going through an endless cycle of getting fake passports for the new rescues. Overall, The Zookeepers Wife is a fair war drama film. Jessican Chastain performance was stunning. The plot is something worth seeing about the heroism of Antonina and her husband using their zoo as a safe haven. The direction lacked suspense and thrills, were the movie felt like a waiting game for the war to be over.",The Zookeeper's Wife
15,eddie_baggins,Fails to connect emotionally,4,8 November 2017,"It's never a good sign for a movie when there's more emotional response being wrung out of animal deaths than human causalities and for Whale Rider director Niki Caro's adaptation of Diane Ackerman's bestselling book, it's even worse considering the subject material here is dealing with a heartbreaking World War 2 tale of unimaginable loss and torment during the Nazi occupied time in Poland of the 1940's.The Zookeeper's Wife should be a film being talked about for end of year awards recognition but this pretty, yet unfortunately heartless drama fails to connect us properly to the plight of zoo managing couple Antonina and Jan Zabinski, who during the course of World War 2 risked their lives to save 100's of Jewish citizens escape the clutches of the invading German forces after their beloved zoo was bombed to pieces and taken over by Hitler's army in Warsaw.It's a fascinating and seemingly not well-known true story that should be ripe for the big screen, much like classic World War 2 big screen pictures like The Pianist, Boy in the Stripped Pyjamas and even Schindler's List but Caro and her team fail to ever ignite the story of the Zabinski's to the levels it deserved.Things start out promising enough as we're introduced to zoo life in peaceful Poland before war breaks out but Caro and her cast that's headlined by what could be normally ace actress Jessica Chastain's worst lead performance as the kind hearted Antonina and another terrible Daniel Bruhl turn as nefarious Nazi zoologist Lutz Heck (that seems to be his by now type casted role), can't make things work.With Chastain's distracting Polish accent in the forefront, poorly established scenes of the Zabinski's and their interactions with their house guests and just a general sense that we're never getting the best out of what the story should be delivering, The Zookeeper's Wife ends up being an experience that leaves us feeling rather empty, even though we clearly understand that what was done was nothing short of heroic and heart-warming.Final Say – Bringing a worthy true story to the big screen, The Zookeeper's Wife is a polished production that has failed to bring the passion and heart the story deserved. With a misguided Chastain performance at the forefront and little support from the ensemble as a whole, Caro's film is a disappointment and one of the year's biggest wastes of potential.2 food scrap bins out of 5",The Zookeeper's Wife
16,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,6,24 June 2017,"The Zookeeper's wife is not a bad movie, it just fails to deliver the message and the feelings to the audience. The setting is good, with the zoo and the animals giving a more realistic tone to everything. Maybe the family dynamics weren't that strong, or the wife's chemistry with her husband. Another thing that could have been avoided were the accents. Some of the characters had them, others didn't, and the leading lady's especially, sounded completely fake. Maybe this is just me that would have preferred and enjoyed better the movie in polish, but I do think that it would have been better in the native language, though I understand that then it wouldn't have too much appeal on the audience as the one in 'english' had. Lastly, the performances were good and the story nice enough to not make the film boring and tiring and, at least, enjoyable till the end. So, 6 out of 10.",The Zookeeper's Wife
17,howard.schumann,Lacks the emotional impact the subject matter demands,7,10 April 2017,"Many reports from the aftermath of World War II describe the indifference and, in some cases, outright hostility that the general population in Europe felt towards the Jews, with even lifelong neighbors and friends turning them in to the Nazis. The minority who risked their lives to protect Jews and save them from certain death in the Holocaust are remembered at Yad Vashem in Israel as those ""Righteous Among the Nations."" Among the honored are those who took Jews into their homes or properties, provided them with false documents, helped them to escape from ghettos and prisons, found food and shelter for children who became separated from their parents, or hid Jews in places such as attics, cemeteries, sewers, and even animal cages in a zoo.Based on the non-fiction book by Diane Ackerman with a screenplay by Angela Workman, the story of two such ""righteous"" individuals who rescued 300 Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto is told in Niki Caro's (""Whale Rider"") film, The Zookeeper's Wife starring Jessica Chastain (""Crimson Peak""). Set in Poland immediately before the September 1939 invasion by German forces that launched World War II, Chastain is Antonina Zabinski, wife of the keeper of the Warsaw Zoo, Dr. Jan Zabinski (Johan Heldenbergh, ""The Broken Circle Breakdown""). Assisted by her young son Ryszard (Timothy Radford as a young boy and Val Maloku as the older Rhys), Antonina is seen as the film opens gently tending to her hippos, tigers, lion cubs, and rescuing a newborn elephant in danger of suffocating.At a party, Antonina socializes with Lutz Heck (Daniel Brühl, ""Captain America: Civil War""), director of the Berlin Zoo and Germany's leading zoologist who plays a major role in the film. Soon after the party, tragedy strikes as the Warsaw Zoo is bombed by the German Air Force, killing most of the animals in their cages and leaving others to wander the surrounding streets. When the Zabinskis allow Heck take some of their highly prized animals back to Berlin for medical experiments, he agrees in return to their offer to start a pig farm at the zoo using garbage collected from the ghettos to provide food for the German soldiers. Unfortunately, this does not prevent Germans from returning to the zoo to kill any remaining animals.Under the pretense of helping the Nazis, Jan begins working for the resistance, smuggling Jews in their truck under piles of garbage collected from the Ghetto. Amazingly, a member of the German Labor Committee who sympathizes with the Jews provides a special pass for Jan to bring Jews to the zoo where they are hidden in empty animal pens. Among these are sculptor Magda Gross (Efrat Dor, ""Mermaids"" TV series), lawyer Maurycy Fraenkel (Iddo Goldberg, ""Last Passenger""), and Urszula (Shira Hass, ""A Tale of Love and Darkness""), a young woman who was raped and beaten by the German soldiers before Jan took her out of the Ghetto in his truck. Though danger is always present, the drama seems to lose its focus when it concentrates on whether or not Heck's attempt to seduce Antonina will be successful.The Zabinski's story is an important and moving one that should be told, yet The Zookeeper's Wife is a surprisingly bland film that lacks the emotional impact the subject matter demands. Jessica Chastain projects warmth and vulnerability as Antonina, yet her Polish accent seems forced and only distracts us from our involvement with the story. While there are some compelling and heartfelt moments in the film, especially when fear spreads among the animals as they sense the German planes approaching the zoo, the overall execution is often manipulative and mawkish.There is a scene in which the ashes from the burning ghetto are shown in an overly aestheticized manner, enough to prompt a child to say with wonder that ""It's snowing."" It is a misfire that serves only to trivialize the suffering. While the Zabinski's courage during the Holocaust will never be forgotten, The Zookeeper's Wife unfortunately begins to fade from the memory almost immediately after the final credits.",The Zookeeper's Wife
18,TheMovieDiorama,"The Zookeeper's Wife might look cute and cuddly on the front cover, yet it lures you into a bleak and depressing story.",7,24 February 2018,"Another saturated topic, we typically get two or three WWII films a year. Frustratingly, this is another typical holocaust film and one that will not standout against the packed crowd. In saying that though, this is an excellent ""story"" film to which I was fully immersed. A factual fictionalisation of the Warsaw Zoo surviving WWII where both animals and humans are in danger. The owners soon start to hide Jewish residents within the zoo in an attempt to save their lives from the Nazi holocaust. I expected a film about zookeepers and nearby residents saving animals from Nazi capture, boy was I completely wrong. The zoo animals only take precedent during the first fifteen minutes, and then the narrative's focus is purely on the owners, Jews and the Nazi regime. Soul draining is how I would describe this. It's bleak, depressing and not an ounce of happiness until the last five minutes. Director Niki Caro captures the horror of the holocaust and does not shy away from the brutality of it. She evokes powerful imagery that isn't portrayed in the film, we see a young girl being taken into a tunnel by two Nazi soldiers. We don't see what happens, but the detail in every scene enables us to imagine the terror that unfolded. Another synonymous scene would be when Jewish children are carried onto a train. We know where it's going, but the story never informs us. It's subliminal, and that might be due to the over saturation of this genre. Jessica Chastain stars as the eponymous character in what is one of her more nuanced performances, but emotionally vulnerable. When she cries, my God I feel it. Daniel Brühl was also captivating as the Nazi zoologist. Would I have liked the focus to be strictly on the zoo animals? Yes. It would've been different, less generic and perhaps more emotive. Can I complain about what was presented instead? No. A perfectly good WWII drama that is harrowingly depressing which will not set the cinematic world alight.",The Zookeeper's Wife
19,paul-allaer,"Well-intended, but too inconsistent",6,2 April 2017,"""The Zookeeper's Wife"" (2017 release from Poland; 124 min.) brings the story of Antonina and her husband Jan. As the movie opens, Antonina is waking up, and sees her young song sleeping with a pet (a lamb?). She then opens the gates of the zoo, as we are told it is ""Warsaw, Summer of 1939"". We learn that Antonina and Jan are the caretakers of the zoo, where it seems the animals are at peace (and some of them even roaming freely). But then comes ""September 1, 1939"", and it's not long before the Germans have occupied Poland. As Jan and Antonina see their once idyllic life ends. They now face even greater dangers when they decide to hide a Jew on their zoo compound. At this point we are 15 min, into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from New Zealand director Niki Caro, best known for directing ""McFarland, USA"" and before that ""Whale Rider"". Here she brings to the big screen the book of the same name by Diane Ackerman. Let's get this out of the way: at the end of the movie, we learn what becomes of the main characters in the years following WWII. I had no idea while I was watching the movie that this is in fact a true story (surely embellished somewhat for entertainment purposes). With 20/20 hindsight that this is based on true events, I've become a bit milder in my judgment of the movie, although it is still miles away from a top notch movie. The problem is that it mostly feels quite distant and unattached. We SHOULD care for these characters, as they go though some horrific things, but for the most part I just watched without further emotional involvement (there are exceptions of course--such as the very last scene of the movie, which made me well up). Jessica Chastain plays Antonina, with Polish accent and all. This could in style be further away that the tough as nails role she played in ""Zero Down Thirty"" but in the end these two roles each bring a strong heroine. Comments Antonina to one of the kids in hiding: ""After a life in hiding, you don't know how to trust. Maybe that's why I love animals so much"", wow. Belgian actor Johan Heldenbergh plays Jan in the biggest role of his career. Bottom line: the movie is obviously well-intended, and I'm always ready to support a movie about heroic deeds in WWII. What Antonina and Jan did in real life, is more than heroic, and for that we must be eternally grateful. It's just that the movie doesn't deliver at that same level, and feels way too safe and by-the-numbers. A darn shame.""The Zookeeper's Wife opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, I am happy to report. That said, I don't thing the movie will have long legs at the box office, once word-of-mouth gets out that this is just okay, but not more than that. It might be worth checking out when it comes to Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",The Zookeeper's Wife
20,Turfseer,A fitting tribute to Righteous Gentiles but how much of it is really true?,6,13 August 2017,"Director Niki Caro's ""The Zookeeper's Wife"" is a fitting tribute to two ""Righteous Gentiles,"" Dr. Jan Żabiński (Johan Heldenbergh) and his wife, Antonina (Jessica Chastain), who were the keepers of the Warsaw Zoo just prior to the Nazi invasion of Poland, and responsible for saving the lives of approximately 300 Jews by ferreting them out of the Warsaw ghetto where they were imprisoned under atrocious conditions. While the film works as a ""tribute,"" it's not as successful as a dramatic work, since a fair number of scenes had to be invented out of whole cloth in order to move the story along to a fitful conclusion. Nonetheless, this little-known story holds our interest basically to the very end, and is an important piece of history that all students of the Holocaust should take note of.The story is unusual as the main setting of the narrative is a zoo. The opening scene is particularly strong, chronicling Antonina Żabiński's love for animals as she saves a baby elephant from choking after the poor animal gets a small piece of a tree branch stuck in her trunk (all this in front of dinner guests who marvel at her acumen with the animals).Soon afterward the Nazis invade Poland and there are more striking scenes of animals killed during the bombardment and some escaping, roaming the streets as the hapless citizenry must avoid coming into contact with dangerous, wild animals, on the loose.The villain of the piece is Dr. Lutz Heck (an excellent Daniel Brühl), the Nazi zoologist who actually was a friend and colleague of the Żabińskis before the war. Heck proposes to save all the larger ""prize"" animals and bring them back to Germany as a ""loan,"" where he plans to continue with crazy breeding experiments to resurrect an extinct bison species. After the Żabińskis agree to Heck's plan, they're dismayed when he returns to the zoo with a group of soldier thugs, and begins shooting the remaining animals, as he argues they won't be able to survive in the cold.The Żabińskis come up with a plan of their own, convincing Heck to run a pig farm which could provide pig meat to German troops. This becomes a pretext to gain access to the ghetto, where they pick up garbage in a truck and bring it back as food scraps to feed the pigs. The scenes where they hide Jews from the Ghetto underneath the garbage intended for the pigs inside the truck, don't ring true, as the Nazis were much more meticulous in searching vehicles that left the ghetto on a daily basis.It was Jan's association with the shady Ziegler, head of the Arbeitsamt (labor office), that enabled him to sneak various Jews out of the ghetto. Ziegler, an amateur entomologist, learned of an insect collection that the Żabińskis were holding for a Jewish friend. In exchange for seeing the collection and ""taking care of it,"" Jan was able to obtain the document that allowed him to pass freely, in and out of the ghetto.The narrative slows down considerably in the scenes where the Żabińskis are caring for the various Jewish people hidden in the abandoned animal cages and underground passageways at the zoo. One invented character, Urzsula, a young girl who has been repeatedly raped by Nazi guards in the ghetto, is trotted out as a symbol of Jewish suffering and lends little to the dramatic urgency of the story. More ludicrous is the graffiti left on the walls by the Jews signifying their hope and despair —of course none of that would be allowed by the Żabińskis, as any hint that they were hiding Jews could have led to their subsequent imprisonment and execution.While I understand the film scenarists did not want to get bogged down with ancillary stories in regards to Holocaust chronology, I still was taken aback that there was no mention of the Jewish revolt in the Warsaw ghetto. Instead, that's skipped entirely, and we fast forward to the ""liquidation"" of the ghetto by the Nazis. And I understand the importance of brevity in a screenplay, but the lack of mention of one of the most significant events of Holocaust history is clearly unsettling.Finally, the conclusion of The Zookeeper's Wife simply feels forced. For starters there's Heck's infatuation with Antonina and the attempted rape scene that never happened. Jan's purported jealousy also feels forced and unlikely. In reality, Heck left the scene much earlier than the time Nazis finally left Poland (and of course never pretended to shoot Antonina's son—that actually occurred but at the hands of an unrelated German soldier).The dramatic scene where Antonina rushes back to warn the Jews and helps them escape, also never happened. The last contingent of Jews hidden by the Żabińskis left before the Warsaw Uprising in August 1944. Since Jan was in the resistance, he realized that their villa was no longer a safe place to hide refugees.Both Chastain and Heldenbergh are solid as the noble Żabińskis, with Heidnebergh hitting the mark as a strong, laid back man of science and resistance fighter along with Chastain, whose love for people and animals is most convincingly conveyed. The Zookeeper's Wife is a fascinating story better told through Antonina's original memoirs. Some verisimilitude is simply lost in the attempt to make the story more dramatic than it actually was. Nonetheless, despite its limitations, this is a film still worth seeing, due to the brave subjects it honors.",The Zookeeper's Wife
21,alindsay-al,A below average very forgettable film,4,2 January 2018,"This film has a very interesting back story so I was interested in watching it and I have now seen it and unfortunately though not terrible this film is incredibly forgettable. The premise of the film is based on a true story that sees a couple hide Jewish refugees in there zoo from the nazis. Jessica chastain plays the lead in the film and this isn't one of her best performances, she is clearly passionate about the role and she does her best with what she is given. But she overacts all the way through this movie and she feels very wooden and not real at all. Her emotional scenes usually come across as forced and very much like it is a script and not her if that makes sense. The supporting cast is a mixed bag, I liked the actor who plays her husband I thought he gave the best performance in the film but even he starts to overact towards the end of the film. Daniel bruhl is in this film and he does a decent job especially at the beginning of the film but as the film progresses his character becomes as cliché as you can get. Nobody else in the film gets any important screen time so when the film asks you to care you just don't which hurts the film. As mentioned before the story has an interesting concept and It is a bit interesting to watch and wonder how these people did what they did. But there are so many problems, there are aspects of the film that aren't expanded on enough and aspects that are focused on too much. It is a highly predictable film which doesn't give any surprises at all. The script has some decent drama with some particularly uncomfortable scenes that work well. Though there is absolutely no humour or life in this film even when these people are meant to be happy it just feels unreal. The style of the film looks good with the sets and animals especially coming across well, but this films pacing is really poor and just feels boring. Also this film has a really confusing way of showing time and how much has passed and it made it hard to follow. Overall this film isn't that bad it just is really forgettable and not worth a watch as you won't remember it.",The Zookeeper's Wife
22,jadepietro,A Serious Subject Oversimplified,7,2 January 2018,"GRADE: B-THE FILM IS RECOMMENDED.The Zookeeper 's Wife tells the important story of the Nazi Occupation in Poland and trivializes it with heavy handed sentimentality. The film tells the true story (with way too much melodrama) of Antonina and Jan Zabinski, zookeepers at the Warsaw Zoo, who decide to save some wild animals and many Jews from the Nazis during 1940 until 1945. The obvious symbolism of the newly caged Jews hidden within the walls of the zoo is not easily missed and probably the most subtle reference in this entire film. (Historically, the Zabinskis rescued nearly 300 Jews from their certain deaths.)The Zookeeper's Wife is a well made film, but the subject matter of the Holocaust and its systematic destruction of the Jewish people deserves a more realistic treatment. Although director Niki Caro earnestly tries to tell the story with serious intent, she overstates the obvious throughout the film. The simplistic screenplay by Angela Workman depicts Good vs. Evil in the broadest of terms. To her credit, Ms. Caro creates some powerful images and doesn't shy away from the ugly atrocities upon the Polish people but, the characters, in general, lack depth and rarely seem authentic. The actors play their roles with conviction. Jessica Chastain tackles the part of Antonina and she is a believable presence. As her stoic husband, Johan Heldenbergh is quite compelling. Daniel Bruhl balances his stock character, Lutz Heck, a Nazi sympathizer and animal lover, with a refreshing degree of nuance. He makes one believe in this conflicted man.However, too often, facts make way for fiction in this film adaptation for the sake of dramatic conflict. Though far from accurate, Lutz's infatuation with Antonina becomes a central issue of the story. Also a fine young actress named Shira Haas is cast as Urzula, a totally fictional character much maligned by the Nazi soldiers. While the actress is very effective in her supporting turn, one wishes the filmmakers stayed true to more historic accounts of real events.The Zookeeper's Wife has much to admire, if one can accept the oversimplifications and soap opera plotting presented as truth.",The Zookeeper's Wife
23,rannynm,"Shows how even in the worst of times, some people are kind-hearted beyond belief",10,24 March 2017,"This film is truly incredible because it shows how kind-hearted people are. Given that the movie takes place in Poland during World War II, there is a lot of tension among the Jewish and German residents because the Jewish Holocaust is occurring. But, the main characters, Antonina and Jan Zabinski, still manage to take care of their zoo and try to keep the animals safe. In the midst of World War II, Adolf Hitler's power permeates in Poland, specifically in the Warsaw ghetto, where there are many Jewish inhabitants. Living in Warsaw is Antonina Zabinski (Jessica Chastain), her husband Jan Zabinski (Johan Heldenbergh) and their son. They are in charge of the Warsaw Zoo, where any animal you can imagine lives. Bombs are hitting the Warsaw Zoo, killing many of the animals. The zoo is almost completely destroyed, and the Zabinski's decide to use it as a Jewish sanctuary. Jessica Chastain's portrayal of Antonina is quite believable. Antonina is a beautiful woman who loves animals more than she loves herself and she does her best to ensure that everything goes as planned. Johan Heldenbergh, who plays Jan, is very brave. He acts as an assistant to a German soldier and looks for creative ways to transport the Jews to safety. They put their lives on the line to save others, which truly is remarkable. The Warsaw Zoo looks astonishing. It is huge! There are so many beautiful trees, and there are animals walking around with Antonina. I want to now have my own zoo someday! My favorite part of the movie is when Antonina is riding her bicycle and she calls her camel to walk alongside her. This camel is hilarious because he makes strange noises and he hops so quickly. He acts as a police patrol for the zoo, which I think is extremely funny. The message of this film is to help others. Antonina and Jan Zabinski try to help hundreds of Jews stay safe and do not put themselves first. Antonina and Jan live in imminent danger themselves and all they can focus on is making a difference, which I admire greatly. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars. It is so inspiring and there are animals in it, for which I have a great soft spot. Given that there are many casualties among animals and people, I recommend this film to ages 18 to adult. This film is not afraid to depict historical reality, so it may be difficult to watch some scenes, but this movie is now one of my favorites. Watch this film if you enjoy history and films that are based on true stories. It comes out on March 31, 2017 in theaters so, make sure to keep your eyes open for it. It is a movie you certainly don't want to miss. Reviewed by Samantha M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",The Zookeeper's Wife
24,bkrauser-81-311064,Overstates Its Abilities,7,4 April 2017,"There will always be films based on WWII. The war demonstrated and exemplified both humanities best and worst attributes. There simply is no limit to the amount of stories one could tell nor the amount of messages that can be smuggled into the margins. Looking to honor the brave sacrifices made; Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) and Saving Private Ryan (1998) might do the trick. In the mood for dynamic character pieces; how about Patton (1970) or Downfall (2004)? Vicious black comedy; The Americanization of Emily (1964), demure airiness; Mrs. Henderson Presents (2005).Yet there's really only one ""acceptable"" way of making films about the Holocaust. At least the makers of The Zookeeper's Wife seem to think so. Thus the film based on Diane Ackerman's book, tells a stately version of a harrowing experience that on film, begs to be compared to Schindler's List (1993). It pulls at the heart-strings right where it needs to. It lingers at just the right moments of emaciated dignity and it lionizes its characters with the force of its true-to-life story. It also rings disappointingly false. Is it just me or are Holocaust movies losing their way? The film starts the summer before the German and Russian invasion of Poland in 1939. Antonia (Chastain) and Jan (Heldenbergh) Zabinski work as zoologists at the Warsaw Zoo and spend most of their time tending to their animals and holding dinner parties for their intellectual friends. When the war makes it to their front doorstep, they have no choice but to relinquish their prized stock to German zoologist Lutz Heck (Bruhl) who also gives them permission to convert the zoo into a pig farm. It is then the Zabinski's realize that they have the space, resources and ability to hide Jews escaping from the infamous Ghetto Warschau.So they do just that; no second thought, no consideration of the risks involved and no weighing of the pros and cons. If this movie is to be believed as fact, the Zabinski's didn't possess the steely-eyed negotiation abilities of Oskar Schindler, nor did they have the craven self-interest of Leopold Socha (who's story is recalled in Agnieszka Holland's In Darkness (2011)). The Zookeeper's Wife for all its inherent story potential, starts with a pair of saintly characters and ends with a pair of saintly characters.This is not to say that Antonia and Jan Zabinski were not, in reality wonderful people. They were awarded the Righteous Among Nations by the State of Israel for their efforts to save what Antonia described as ""shipwrecked souls"". Yet the inherent risk of doing the right thing, when the right thing could get you killed is never entirely present. There are several characters that come and go, and a few fleeting moments where it looks like the Zabinski's placed their trust in the wrong person. Then there's a wink, a nod and another scene of laying and wait.To offset the lack of tension, Zookeeper's Wife endows the movie with a subplot involving a Jewish girl (Haas), whose rape by two German soldiers, beguiles Jan to save her from the ghetto. Much of the film is spent with Antonia emphatically ushering her out of a catatonic state with art utensils and a fluffy rabbit. While these scenes inject just enough humanism without feeling melodramatic, one can't help shake the feeling they were added just so Jessica Chastain has something to act against.For what it's worth, Chastain turns in some splendid work. Which is more than can be said for poor Daniel Bruhl. Zookeeper's Wife requires of him to be not just a villain, but a representation of the entire Nazi Wehrmacht by the power of his position as Hitler's personal zoologist. Why on earth did they pin that particular swastika-shaped pin on a guy who could be liberally described as Amon Goeth's kid brother? His sexual advances towards Antonia don't even come across as creepy, they just come across as pathetic.Had this film focused on the sophistication of the Polish resistance or made an effort to demonstrate the frightful omnipresence of the Nazis in Poland, then Zookeeper's Wife might have been a movie worth the time to see. As it stands however, Jessica Chastain's performance is about the only thing keeping this meager movie afloat. That and a felicitously budgeted zoo bombing that was honestly done better in Underground (1995).",The Zookeeper's Wife
25,moviexclusive,"Told with grace, empathy and conviction, this celebration of ordinary heroism is elevated by strong performances by Jessica Chastain and her Belgian co-lead Johan Heldenbergh",7,19 March 2017,"Based on the non-fiction book of the same name, 'The Zookeeper's Wife' recounts the true story of the husband-and-wife couple, Jan and Antonina Żabiński, who secretly sheltered Jews during the German invasion of Poland from 1939 to 1945 on their premises of the Warsaw Zoo, thus enabling these Polish Jews to escape from the infamous Warsaw Ghetto and the eventual extermination of the place as well as its inhabitants within. At its heart, this is a celebration of ordinary heroes – that is, of ordinary men and women who have displayed extraordinary heroism during extraordinary times. Such tales are often told with sycophantic adulation, which runs counter to the nature of their character/s and ultimately leaves one feeling patronized. Thankfully, its director Niki Caro knows her way around such celebrations of heroism (as evinced by her previous works like 'Whale Rider', 'North Country' and 'McFarland, USA'), placing emphasis on the difficult circumstances of the war in order to demonstrate the Żabińskis' bravery rather than on exalting the characters per se. Scenes of life pre- and post-invasion, of life behind the ghettos and of the nail-biting process of sneaking the Jews out of the ghettos are played out with attention to detail and realism, just so the context under which the Żabińskis were living under as well as the danger they were putting themselves and their only son Ryszard under are felt keenly and profoundly – hence illuminating the spirit of valour and self-sacrifice their deeds exemplified.Those who have read Diane Ackerman's source novel will probably know that her narration is as much about Jan and Antonina Żabiński as it is about Lutz Heck, the duplicitous head of the Berlin Zoo whom the Żabińskis first meet before the war and who eventually turns out to be one of the prominent figures of the German war office in Poland. Like in the book, Lutz aimed to recreate pureblood versions of certain extinct species; and for dramatic impact, instead of transporting some of the cattle from the Warsaw Zoo to run his animal eugenics programme back in Berlin, Lutz (as played by Daniel Bruhl) does so right on the grounds of the former. That deviation allows screenwriter Angela Workman to fashion a rather unnecessary subplot between Antonina and Lutz, which sees Lutz develop a personal liking for Antonina and concomitantly engendering marital tension between Jan and Antonina. As distracting as that may be, it is consoling that neither Lutz nor the Germans in particular are demonized; in fact, the former's on screen representation shows an unexpectedly benevolent side at the end that may in fact be kinder than his real-life person.In turn, the horrors of the Holocaust are depicted through a fictional character which Caro has said was her idea. Played by Israeli actress Shira Haas, Urszula is a barely teenage girl whom Jan encounters on his maiden trip into the ghetto bleeding and shaken after being raped by two German male soldiers. Against better judgment, Jan conceals her right under the driver's seat of his truck (under his son's feet, no less) in order to help her escape from any further misery. Though manipulative, Urszula's addition is arguably an effective device through which Caro conveys the magnitude of the Żabińskis' rescue efforts – not only is she intended to be emblematic of the suffering and subsequent trauma that the Jewish children no doubt endured during the German invasion, she is the face of the persecuted Jewish, personifying the 'human' in humanity. Her recovery is also representative of the hope that the Żabińskis' act of wartime courage gave to the 300 Jews that they saved in the six years of the German occupation.As with such historical dramatisations, the strength of the performances determines whether the film itself ends up being compelling – and sure enough, that 'The Zookeeper's Wife' is fascinating to watch from start to finish is testament to the strong cast. However cynical you may be of Jessica Chastain's casting as Antonina which therefore requires the Hollywood actress to put on a Polish accent, she is undeniably captivating as the eponymous lead, channeling grit and vulnerability in equal measure as she fleshes out her character's fears, anxieties and convictions. Her stripped- down performance complements that of Belgian actor Johan Heldenbergh, who may not have matinée-idol looks but certainly the gravitas to play a resolute volunteer for the underground Polish resistance. Among the supporting actors, Bruhl and Haas are the standouts, the former exercising admirable restraint in what could have been a traditionally villainous act while the latter surprisingly nuanced in her portrayal of the most visible victim of Nazi sadism.Many a story has been told of ordinary men and women who have displayed extraordinary heroism during the Holocaust, and 'The Zookeeper's Wife' stands out among one of the better ones by simply telling its story well without embellishment or worse exaggeration. Even better, it underscores the emotional devastation of war without violence or gore; rather, with emphasis on authenticity, the film lays bare the communities torn apart when the Germans invaded, the sheer hopelessness of those who were oppressed, and the sacrifices that one must sometimes make in order to achieve a loftier, nobler purpose during such challenging times. Especially when some world leaders seem to have forgotten the importance of world peace, this is as apt a reminder as any that the cost of war is immeasurable, immutable and perhaps even irreversible.",The Zookeeper's Wife
26,arungeorge13,"A lot to appreciate, a lot to detest! [+60%]",6,7 July 2017,"Jessica Chastain starrer ""The Zookeeper's Wife"" invokes mixed feelings. The performances are uniformly first-rate. Daniel Bruhl, Belgian star Johan Helderbergh and Jessica Chastain occupy the maximum screen- time and they put in their best to sustain viewer attention.The aesthetics are worth a mention too; the film looks rich and convincing in terms of production values. The brunt of WW II isn't the crux of the film, hence there ain't much scope for digging into full-fledged battle scenes. The story revolves around a couple who run a zoo in Warsaw around the time of WW II, and use the premises to save nearly 300 Jews during the invasion of Poland by German forces.If you watch the film without reading the synopsis or watching the trailer, you are going to get a different feeling altogether. This is neither a movie that showcases its unbounded love for the world of animals nor a well-developed war movie. It is somewhere in between. While the virtues it professes are invariably good, director Niki Caro is forced to employ certain clichés to make the overall viewing experience better. The film's opening sequence is solid. But it would have certainly helped knowing more about the POWs since the movie spends a fair amount of time detailing their rescue. Once the couple gets their act going, there is an obvious aimlessness in the screenplay. The method of rescue is the same all throughout; the nail-biter moments are highly lacking. The accents probably add to the authenticity but are at times, a pain to keep listening to.The frequent jump in chronology sans noteworthy moments makes the film look slightly jaded on the whole. The climax can be predicted from a mile away. A crowdpleaser sans tear-jerking, one tends to feel more positive about the fact that the saga has finally comes to a close rather than getting exhilarated seeing the couple reunite. Diane Ackerman's book could have looked/felt positively different in the hands of another seasoned director. In it's current state, the film is still a fairly decent watch.",The Zookeeper's Wife
27,proud_luddite,A good effort but lesser than other Holocaust films,6,10 February 2018,"Based on a true story: the title character, Antonina Zabinska (Jessica Chastain) assists her husband Jan Zabinski (Johan Heldenbergh) in caring for the Warsaw Zoo, showing great affection and connection with the animals. After Germany invades Poland in 1939, the couple work together to smuggle Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to live in hidden spaces of the zoo and their home.This particular Holocaust story is certainly worthy of being told. It is in the same vein as ""Schindler's List"" in which citizens risk their own safety and lives to help others in great need.The trouble for ""The Zookeeper's Wife"" is perhaps in its timing. The best films in the Holocaust genre (including ""Schindler's List"") have raised the bar so high that it becomes more and more difficult to meet, let alone surpass, existing levels of greatness. The most recent great examples include ""Phoenix"" and ""Son of Saul""- each released within the last three years.The English language is used in the film and spoken with Polish accents. While this helps to add authenticity, it is sometimes difficult to understand when the actors are speaking softly.The directing style in ""The Zookeeper's Wife"" (by Niki Caro who did a great job with ""Whale Rider"") is perhaps too standard though the same could be said of the screenplay by Angela Workman based on the book by Diane Ackerman. The early scenes of the invasion and the ghetto are powerful. And who couldn't envy Chastain as she provides affection for a couple of adorable lion cubs. While we can feel tension in the movie's second half, the overall effect just doesn't match those of other films on this subject.

29,rockman182,The Zookeeper's Wife (2017),8,2 April 2017,"A wonderful true story of optimism, heroism, kindness, and bravery. All set during the grimest of times. The title of the film may be misleading for some. Don't expect a lovely romantic film about the wife of a zookeeper. While part of that is true the zoo doesn't have much to do with the premise of the film but is a key element in the rescue of hundred' s of Jews during World War II in Warsaw, Poland.The film is about an audacious zookeeper played by Jessica Chastain. It is 1939 in Warsaw and her zoo gets invaded by Nazi forces. Her animals are either killed or taken away and her zoo becomes a bit of a docking station for German troops. She and her husband are appalled by the killings of Jews so they devise a strategy to house many people and transport them to freedom. To top it all off, this is based on an incredible true story.Jessica Chastain is fantastic as usual, accent and all. Her performance has real hear. Daniel Brugl also excels in playing a despicable villain. The score is powerful and really complements the films emotional moments well. The film is two plus hours but just flies by. It never loses a beat from start to finish and there are moments that really get you on the edge of your seat or cringe at some of the hard to swallow moments.There are many moments in the film that are un-comfortable as you would expect with a Holocaust era film. The film has to have dark and sorrowful moments but it builds to something wonderful near the end. The film will pull at your emotions which is a good indication of a powerful film. It does this without ever really getting overly sappy or overly sentimental.While this film doesn't tread any new cinematic ground, It does what needs to be done and it does it right. The story of the brave zookeepers who risked everything out of the goodness of their hearts is a riveting and heartfelt story that needed to be experienced. I love Chastain and think she nails another strong performance.8/10",The Zookeeper's Wife

Her English Polish accent is often annoying. The casting of the children was awkward. Her son was overweight, an unlikely condition after about four years in a war starved country. The one year old daughter looked about four.The movie feels long and drags at times. There is a lack of emotional involvement. You don't get to know much about those saved.

31,dave-mcclain,A rare movie rated triple-F... by IMDb!,8,31 March 2017,"Are you ready for my first ""F Rated"" review? What? You don't know what the ""F"" movie rating is? Well, to be honest, neither did I, until literally a few short minutes ago. I was doing my usual post-viewing / pre-reviewing research before writing about my most recent theatrical experience and I came across the ""F rating"" – on the last day of Women's History Month, no less! First created in 2014 by Holly Tarquini, executive director of the Bath Film Festival, an F rating designates a movie which either has a female director, a female writer or a female in a starring role in her own right. I came across this information after I noticed that the historical drama ""The Zookeeper's Wife"" (PG-13, 2:04) not only stars a female (Jessica Chastain) in the title role, but was also written by a female (Angela Workman) AND directed by a female (Niki Caro). But wait. Is there a rating for a movie like THAT? Yup! It's called the ""Triple F""! Fortunately, before I settled for a lame proclamation like ""Hail to the ladies"" to start this paragraph, I learned about the F rating and the triple-F rating. But this F rating business isn't just observed at the Bath Film Festival and, as of today, by me. The mother of all Movie Fan websites, IMDb, has added the F, and triple-F ratings to their clickable search criteria! Only a little over 100 of IMDb's 4.1 million film and TV episode titles carries a triple-F rating, but with films like ""The Piano"", ""Clueless"", ""Monster"", ""Brave"", ""Pitch Perfect 2"", ""The Edge of Seventeen"" and ""The Zookeeper's Wife"" on that list, it's sure to grow.Jan Żabiński (Johan Heldenbergh) was the Director of the Warsaw Zoo in the summer of 1939, with his wife, Antonina Żabińska (Chastain) helping him care for the animals. The couple lived in a villa on the zoo grounds with their young son, Ryszard (played by Tim Radford and then by Val Maloku). The family is happy with their lives and the zoo is thriving until September 1, 1939. The sudden (although not entirely unexpected) German invasion of Poland heavily damaged the zoo's structures and killed many of its animals. With winter approaching, Poland's new Nazi overlords have decided to close the zoo and exterminate the remaining animals. A professional acquaintance, Lutz Heck (Daniel Brühl), the Director of the Berlin Zoo and the Third Reich's preeminent zoologist, offers to save some of the Warsaw Zoo's most prized species by transferring them to Berlin. With mixed emotions, Jan and Antonina agree. Months later, they approach Heck (now an SS officer stationed in Warsaw) and ask if they can turn their zoo into a pig farm. Seeing this move as a new food source for German soldiers and as an opportunity to conduct animal breeding experiments in an attempt to bring back extinct animal species, Heck agrees to keep the zoo open. He thinks of this solution as a ""win-win"", but Jan and Antonina have ulterior motives. Jan and Antonina have already started using their villa and the buildings and tunnels at the zoo to protect local Jews from the Nazis' increasing abuses. The pigs on their farm are fed garbage that comes from the Warsaw Ghetto, where the Nazis have consolidated the city's remaining Jewish population. When Jan drives his truck to the edge of the ghetto, he smuggles Jewish children out by hiding them under the garbage that he is collecting for his pigs. When additional methods are employed (and with a little additional help from like-minded locals), adults and even entire families are taken to the zoo grounds, where Antonina and Ryszard do the lion's share of the work caring for and hiding their ""guests"". Although some of the Jews quickly pass through, others stay for long periods of time, requiring an elaborate system of measures designed to keep everyone safe. It's a system that becomes increasingly dangerous as time wears on, the number of Jews in hiding increases – and Heck comes around more and more, ostensibly for his breeding experiments, but also to flirt with Antonina. ""The Zookeeper's Wife"" is a fairly original and very engaging Holocaust story. The story arc is similar to the Best Picture (and Best Director) Oscar winner ""Schindler's List"", but still has its own unique elements. Like Steven Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece, here is an ordinary citizen using the workplace to hide Jews from the Nazis and having to cozy up to a Nazi officer, but this is a Holocaust movie with no concentration camp scenes and the ways in which the Jews are hidden and smuggled out has never been used in any Holocaust movie that I can remember. Adapted from the 2007 book of the same name by Diane Ackerman, this is a true story that's based on Żabiński's own (unpublished) wartime diary, which is one reason that this film is so impactful. The other reasons include Workman's smart script, Caro's sensitive and well-paced direction and the performances – especially from the Oscar-nominated Chastain (""Hail to the ladies""). More than just giving Movie Fans a hard-to-believe-it's-true story, this film accomplishes some other important things too. It entertains, it educates, it impresses, it adds to cinema's growing list of triple-F rated movies and it brings us nearer to the time when it won't matter who made the movie – just that it's a really good one. ""A-""",The Zookeeper's Wife
32,Danusha_Goska,"The Zookeeper's Wife: Strong Story, Excellent Performance, So-So Movie",6,9 April 2017,"""The Zookeeper's Wife"" is a strong story. The 2017 film adaptation suffers from a weak script and direction that do not serve the story. Jessica Chastain gives a superb, understated performance as Antonina Zabinska, a real person. Antonina was a gifted zookeeper – why call her ""wife""? – who helped save 300 Jews in Warsaw, Poland, during the Nazi occupation. She and her husband Jan were part of the Polish Underground and Armia Krajowa, or Home Army. The film is worth seeing to see their story, but it's just an okay film, not the great one it could have been. Jessica Chastain is externally very beautiful and fragile-appearing. In her understated performance, she plays a resourceful, animal-loving Polish lady to perfection. She's the center of the film. All of the other characters are in the shadow of Chastain's central light. Lutz Heck had the Nazi-goal of reviving extinct species like the aurochs and the tarpan – primitive cattle and horses. Heck participated in the looting of the Warsaw Zoo. He selected which animals he wanted shipped back to his own Berlin zoo. Heck also lusted after Antonina. She had to do a careful dance of manipulation of Heck to protect her activity saving Jews. Heck is played by Daniel Bruhl, who also played a lovelorn Nazi in ""Inglorious Bastards."" Czech playwright Arnost Goldflam appears as Janusz Korczak, the author, broadcaster, children's rights advocate, physician, and overseer of an orphanage. Korczak famously stayed with his orphans rather than accept any of the many offers he received to be smuggled out of the Warsaw Ghetto. The real Janusz Korczak was a slim man; Goldflam is portly. His appearance not only doesn't mesh with the real Korczak. Goldflam doesn't look like someone who'd been living under starvation conditions forced by the Nazis for the past three years. The scenes with Korczak and his orphans did make me cry, but they seem like a detour from the film's main narrative. One problem the film faced: we have all seen Holocaust movies. Sad but true, during much of this film I was simply disinterested, waiting for it to show me something I had not seen in another film, to tell me something I had not yet heard. The film opens with Antonina happily taking care of her lion cubs, pregnant elephant, devoted young camel, and her son's pet skunk. We all know what will happen next: Nazi planes will bomb; Jews will begin to wear armbands. Brutality will increase and then there will be mass transports on trains. Perhaps the film could have opened in media res, during the Nazi bombardment, and focused more closely on Antonina's interior life. The film tosses away references to her tragic history. Her parents were murdered by the Soviets and she had had to live on the run. Why not weave those facts into a richer portrait of the central character? Poles who helped Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland had to scrounge food for their wards while they, the Poles, lived under forced starvation conditions. They also had to dispose of human waste without drawing any attention to themselves. The film never explores how the Zabinskis managed these considerable feats. The film falls into a historically revisionist trap when it implies that Nazis were interested only in Jews, and Polish Catholics were allowed to live out the war in beautiful clothing. Nazis served Poles brandy in snifters and politely debated their actions. The film also implies that Nazi policies were in effect in Poland before the war began. Antonina and her son Ryszard see Jewish porters carrying heavy loads in Warsaw's market. Antonina makes a comment about how ""they"" are mistreating Jews. The scene is simply misleading. Too, Nazis murdered and displaced more Polish non-Jews in the early days of the war than Polish Jews, but the film depicts Nazis as focusing almost exclusively on persecuting Jews. When the Nazi invasion begins, Jan makes a comment about how he has nothing against Jews. This is just a dumb thing for him to say. The bombardment of Warsaw was a thousand times worse than the film suggests. There are scenes were some herd animals are buried and others are set free in a forest. Poland was so desperate during the war that those animals would have more likely been butchered for meat, as happened to horses that fell in Warsaw's streets. The film just wants to tell a simple- minded, and false, story about privileged Poles and persecuted Jews. If the film had conveyed the threat the Germans posed to non-Jewish Poles as well as Jewish ones, the Zabinskis heroism would have been revealed as even more profound. Poles fought much more than the film depicts. Jan Zabinski was a member of the Armia Krajowa, or Home Army. He taught in the underground university. He sabotaged trains and built bombs. None of this is shown in the film. Jan comes across as a hapless victim who can only stand by open-mouthed and watch as his wife attempts to twist lovelorn Nazi Heck around her sexy finger. Polish-Jewish relations during the war were very, very, very complicated. I'm not using too many ""verys."" The film depicts Poles helping Jews, but it makes virtually no mention of Polish anti- Semitism. Not all Poles were heroes. Some betrayed Jews and their rescuers to the Nazis. In one scene, a Pole witnesses Antonina help a Jew. The Pole promises Antonina she will not betray her work. Had this eyewitness betrayed Antonina, the Nazis would have murdered the entire family, including Ryszard, the young son. These tensions and obstacles are only hinted at in the film.",The Zookeeper's Wife
33,swilliky,A mediocre film about a heartbreaking subject,6,6 April 2017,"The tragic tale of a woman caught up in the invasion of Poland and her brave actions to smuggle out Jews from the Warsaw ghetto is moving and disturbing but does come up short in some aspects. Antonina Zabinski (Jessica Chastain) is amazing with animals birthing elephants and calming down tigers, but when the Germans invade Poland, her animals are killed in bombs or put to death by the Nazis. Hitler's chief zoologist Lutz Heck (Daniel Brühl) takes an interest in Antonina and the zoo, hoping to breed strong bulls of legend. Meanwhile, Antonina's husband Jan (Johan Heldenbergh) works to smuggle out the Jews trapped in the Warsaw ghetto and hide them in the tunnels beneath their house.The movie shows how those who were not directly involved suddenly had their lives upheaved when the Nazis awful plans came to action. Even though the Zabinski's were not Jewish, many of their friends and neighbors found their houses taken and their lives at risk by the ruthless soldiers. Jan receives help from a Polish government worker and develops a plan walking right past the guard using the excuse that he was bringing the men and women out of the ghetto to work for him. The refugees have to hide during the day as the Zabinski's employ a chef and soldiers prowl the ground searching for escapees. Antonina plays the piano to warn them when they have unexpected visitors and let them know it is safe to come out at night.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",The Zookeeper's Wife

Gratuitous violence does not equal reality (yes, I know, horrifying violence was WWII's theme). And gratuitous depression and grim horrors do not equal pathos.

36,MrDHWong,"An interesting, yet, somewhat diminished showcase of a real-life event",7,11 October 2017,"The Zookeeper's Wife is a war drama film starring Jessica Chastain. Based on the non- fiction book of the same name by Diane Ackerman, the film is an interesting, yet, somewhat diminished showcase of a real-life event.The film tells the true story of Warsaw Zoo keepers Jan Zabinski (Johan Heldenbergh) and his wife Antonina (Jessica Chastain), who helped rescue hundreds of Jewish refugees and animals during the Nazi occupation of Poland in World War II. Despite the atrocities that Jan was witnessing along the way and the large number traumatised victims Antonina needed to take care of, the two keepers continued to help those in need and do the morally right thing in the face of adversity.While the subject matter makes for great cinema and the cast is good, the film feels lacking in certain areas. It seems like the filmmakers played it safe too often, which, in turn, sacrifices many moments for it to leave the strong emotional impact it should. The overall film feels like a watered-down version of Schindler's List, except with animals included.

It's an adaptation of Diane Ackerman's bestseller The Zookeeper's Wife: A War Story and does a very good job illustrating different kinds of cages: for animals, Jews in the Ghetto and on trains headed to concentration camps, small-minded Nazis imprisoned by Hitler's terror, and more. Uplifting theme: Heroism, sacrifice, friendship Humanity We will never know all of the stories of the many brave men and women who risked so much to save others during ""the war to end all wars.""Things I liked: Jessica Chastain did an excellent job as Antonina Zabinska. Her emotional performance made me cry several times. I loved seeing her with the animals and she seemed to genuinely care for them. Oscar- worthy? Should be. How they managed the animals in the zoo is truly impressive. How did they get the animals to do all those things they did? You get to see people cuddle with skunks, lion cubs, elephants, a symbolic bunny (aww), and more. I loved the little camel that ran freely around the zoo. The film does a very good job demonstrating the cruelty of Hitler and his Nazis. They destroyed soooo much that was good in this world. Daniel Bruhl is slickly evil, but even still not quite as menacing as he could be. He has too likable of a face. Before the credits roll, the screen displays text where you can read about what happened after the last scene, including the good news (SPOILER ALERT) that the Zabinska's zoo has survived as the Warsaw Zoo. Critics complain that the movie isn't realistic enough, as in.they want it to be more gruesome and bloody? I thought it had so much gore and violence that it should have been rated R. Besides, we REALLY don't have to see people's heads get blown off in every disgusting detail to know what's happening and be affected by it. Sometimes we see the gore and brutality in this film, but sometimes we just hear gun shots and the horror is implied. Both were equally effective, making the audience I sat with groan, jump, and gasp every time. It was clever and symbolic that a piano was used to give both comfort and warning to the Jews hiding in the zoo. SPOILER ALERT: I thought the scene where the children innocently trusted Jan to lift them up into the train was powerful and heartbreaking. It made me think of the many refugees that are in the world today. If you would like to find out how you can help, check out JustServe.Things I didn't like: Critics don't seem to like this movie very much, but I've noticed that most of those who don't are men. Just sayin... Everyone in the audience I sat with seemed to be really touched, based on the crying and sniffling I heard around me in the dark theater. It's not on par with the epic Schindler's List, but I appreciated the perspective from a woman's lived experience in this story. There was no humor to break up the tension. It was 100% drama. 80% tension. One of the best WWII/Holocaust movies I've ever seen and one that was able to mix humor with incredible drama was Life Is Beautiful It still haunts me.Interesting lines:""Maybe that's why I love animals so much. You look in their eyes and you know exactly what's in their hearts.

You are Eve in the garden."" – Jan ""People always want to run when they don't know what's coming."" - AntoninaTips for parents: Both animals and people are slaughtered in this movie. In other words, this is NOT a family-friendly movie. It is powerful and only appropriate for older teens. You see dead, bloody animal carcasses. You see a bloodied, stunned girl after she has been raped and you see another man attempt to rape a woman. There is also a passionate scene in bed, although clothes are on. You see some animals mating while Nazis cheer on. There is a lot of violence and suffering.MOVIE REVIEW MOM@trinaboice",The Zookeeper's Wife
39,CineMuseFilms,A beautifully filmed story of heroism under the Nazi occupation of Poland.,8,10 May 2017,"The diversity of Holocaust-themed movies has increased over recent years as filmmakers try different storytelling approaches to keep alive our collective memory of what happened. One film that has divided the critics is The Zoo Keeper's Wife (2016). While most of this genre uses graphic realism to confront large-scale human carnage and moral dystopia, this beautifully filmed story tells how 300 Jewish lives were saved by the owners of the Warsaw Zoo.The film opens in 1939 with stunning photography of an idyllic existence in the charming Warsaw Zoo. Owners Antonina (Jessica Chastain) and Jan (Johan Heldenbergh) are devoted zoologists who love their animals and each other. There are many touching scenes of physical affection that portray trust and understanding across the human-animal divide. The peace is soon shattered by Nazi bombing and there are many disturbing scenes of animal destruction. Soon after the Nazis arrive, the Zoo's best breeding specimens are sent to Berlin under Hitler's zoologist Lutz Heck (Daniel Brühl). With Nazi soldiers needing housing, the Zoo is under threat but saved when Antonina obtains Heck's support to convert it into a pig farm to feed Nazi soldiers. He becomes a frequent visitor to the Zoo and his sexual overtures towards Antonina means she must keep him charmed to save the Zoo. As the atrocities against Polish Jews escalate, Antonina and Jan hatch a plan to use garbage trucks to smuggle Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to freedom via Zoo tunnels. The story focuses on the dangers of hiding the Jews and the horror facing those who are loaded into cattle-trucks for transportation to Hitler's Final Solution.The critical ambivalence towards this film dwells on its aesthetic treatment of the opening scenes and what some argue is Chastain's saintly characterisation of Antonina. While the cinematography is superb from beginning to end, it does adopt an excessively sugary style in the pre-Nazi- occupation part of the story. The opening scenes of Antonina cycling through the zoo, personally greeting the caged and free-roaming animals, smiling and waving to all of humanity, are both beautiful but incongruous for the story we know is about to unfold. From the extraordinary scenes of Antonina saving a new-born elephant in front of its distressed parents to the harrowing escape scenes, the film almost deifies the heroine for her goodness towards others. But this are directing issues rather than acting. Chastain's performance is excellent across the range of emotions she portrays and she is a brightly lit beacon in a film that could easily have been depressingly bleak.The Zoo Keepers Wife is a worthy addition to an honourable genre that includes the multi-award winning Schindler's List (1993). It communicates the larger Holocaust narrative while keeping its scenes of human carnage and dystopia off-screen. In an age of audience desensitisation, it is ironic that viewers can be emotionally touched more deeply by the death of animals than humans. This is a story of courage and triumph told, from a woman's viewpoint, with top-tier production values in filming, acting, and narrative. It is also an important part of Polish history. In more recent times, Antonina and Jan were decorated as national heroes and the re-built Warsaw Zoo still stands as a legacy to their achievements.",The Zookeeper's Wife
40,LloydBayer,"As a holocaust film, Zookeeper's Wife could have done with a little more urgency yet well-intentioned and equally inspiring.",6,16 May 2017,"It's hard to think of any other era in human history that Hollywood hasn't exploited but the fact remains that for every life saved during WWII, there are still countless heroes that remain unnamed. Which is why The Zookeeper's Wife is an inspiring story of courage and sacrifice, but also a noble one considering how that war still haunts us on a global scale.In the titular role is Jessica Chastain as Antonina Zabinski opposite Johan Heldenbergh as Jan Zabinski, zoo operators in Warsaw, just as Germany invades Poland. Antonina loves her animals and this opening segment is beautifully shot and almost dreamlike, but all this changes when bombs drop all over the city. Then comes German zoologist Lutz Heck (Daniel Brühl who seems typecast as a German villain in a Hollywood film) with a proposition to move the prized animals to sanctuaries in Germany. Lutz is also an SS Officer and his sinister motives become apparent as the story progresses. Meanwhile, Jan has a plan and not just for the animals – on the pretext of turning their destroyed zoo into a piggery, they would smuggle Polish Jews out of Nazi controlled ghettos and into freedom.Along with admirable performances from the cast, director Niki Caro's period saga is amiably balanced between a heartwarming true story and powerful moments through the film. One scene has Antonina telling an assaulted girl why she trusts animals more than humans. In another scene, innocent children are seen eager to board a train, not knowing the destination is certain death at Auschwitz. Even as these moments are met with angst from the audience, a little more urgency could have amplified the emotional oomph of these scenes, especially if the script was filmed in the native language of this region but subtitled in English. Yet as a holocaust film based on actual events, The Zookeeper's Wife is a poignant story and at times a stark reminder of atrocities perpetrated by humans on other humans - something even animals wouldn't do; Scarier than that is the thought that if this happened before, it can always happen again.",The Zookeeper's Wife

Also starring Daniel Brühl, Shira Haas, Michael McElhatton, Iddo Goldberg. Based on Diane Ackerman's non-fiction book which was greatly inspired by the unpublished diary of the Zabinskis, this poignant tale of survival has gotten an suitably old-school screen treatment. Beautiful colors and horrible deeds only men are capable of. Some will be turned off by the sugary, even borderline tacky approach. The others will like the overall melodramatic feel, reminiscent of golden times of Hollywood, and how deftly the story can manipulate with our heartstrings. There's gonna be a lot of misty eyes and runny noses in front of the screen, I can assure from my own experience. Some will not probably even want to continue after the first 20 minutes, because the first act will totally break some hearts. If you are the kind of person who doesn't like animals or care about violence against them, then you will probably feel a bit bored and may also want to quit early. It's really more of a great war movie for animal lovers (a sparsely populated subgenre) than a great war movie in general. But it's got enough suspense and heart to compensate for rather middle-of-the-road script which takes a lot less risks than its main characters. If you liked Allied"", starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, then you can predict the overall experience offered by The Zookeeper's Wife"".

45,shobanchittuprolu,The Zookeeper's Wife is a true story which really deserves more recognition and this movie almost succeeds in doing that.,8,23 October 2017,"The Zookeeper's Wife (2017): When it comes to the long history of Holocaust films, there are so many that it's hard for the newer ones to stand out. Luckily, The Zookeeper's Wife doesn't have much of a problem in that area, as the film focuses on a more nurturing aspect of World War II and tells the inspiring true story of Jan and Antonina Zabinski, a Polish zoologist couple who turned their Warsaw Zoo into a hiding ground for Jewish refugees during the Nazi occupation of Poland from 1939 to 1945.Plot: Based on the true story of Polish animal tender Antonina Żabiński (Jessica Chastain) and her husband Jan (Belgium actor Johan Heldenbergh), the film follows the couple's colossally brave decision to transform their bomb-mangled zoo into a safe haven for Jews during WWII.My Review: From the opening scene itself,The Zookeeper's Wife gave signs that its going to be an emotional story which I had never expected as I have no idea about the film's plot.From the scene where the zoo gets destroyed,the movie gains momentum which continues for almost an hour.We really get hooked with Zabinski's family which is the reason we get shocked same as Anotinina when Jan proposed the dangerous idea of hiding refugees in their abandoned Zoo.I must warn all fellow animal-lovers: plenty of wildlife die cold, lonely deaths in this film. You hardly ever see these deaths directly, though seeing Chastain's crushing in-the-moment grief feels just as devastating – if not worse. It's a captivating trick Caro pulls off numerous times, often refusing to show the violence but forcing the viewer to piece together the horror that took place. It's telling when the sight of a blown-up animal corpse feels nowhere near at gut-wrenching as seeing Jan help kids board a train for a very depressing reason.The only drawback is that whatever promise shown in the first hour of the film was lost in the middle.Of course it is engaging but it lost the charm a bit which it gains back during climax.So,The Zookeeper's Wife is a true story which really deserves more recognition and this movie almost succeeds in doing that.My rating 7.5/10",The Zookeeper's Wife
46,asifahsankhan,"While there are tense scenes and earnest storytelling, something seems to have been lost in the adaptation of Ackerman's book",6,30 May 2017,"Therefore, it generates quite the rambling in uprising negativity, fails to fittingly serve the larger and more complex subjects and remains a mare fictional adaptation, at most. . .World War II and the Holocaust are still being mined for powerful, tragic and compelling stories about the human spirit. The Zookeeper's Wife, based on Diane Ackerman's non-fiction book of the same name, is the evocative story of how zookeeper couple Antonina Zabinska (Jessica Chastain) and Jan (Johan Heldenbergh) sheltered 300 Jews within their property during the war.The German invasion of Poland and aerial attacks on Warsaw has left the Zabinskas' beloved Warsaw Zoo badly damaged. Animals have been killed, lost, taken away or slaughtered by the heartless Nazi Reich under orders from Adolf Hitler or his chief zoologist Lutz Heck (Daniel Bruhl). The scenes of the chaos, fear and pandemonium in the zoo are heartbreaking, as confused and petrified animals run halter- shelter or fall to their deaths.A derelict shell, the zoo has become an outpost for German troops, even though Antonina, Jan and their son continue to live there with a few remaining animals. They gradually convert the zoo into a pig farm – a front used to rescue Jews from ghettos and shield them in a spacious basement.Director Nik Caro remains focused on Antonina's resolve and empathy not just for her animals but equally for her fellow citizens. She takes a stand of not running away with her son and follows that through with remarkable strength.For all the emotional gravitas Chastain breathes into her timid porcelain-like character – juxtaposed with Jan's bravery and struggles as he observes his wife's proximity to Lutz – the film is burdened by the unbearable awkwardness of Americans and Europeans doing German, Polish and Russian accents.Stories of the atrocities committed during WWII abound, but there are few told from a woman's point of view, and fewer still that explore the impact on helpless animals, for example. This is what makes The Zookeeper's Wife interesting. While there are tense scenes and earnest storytelling, something seems to have been lost in screenwriter Angela Workman's adaptation of Ackerman's book. The distilled story feels superficial and clichéd, and its deep devotion to Antonina doesn't fittingly serve the larger and more complex subject.",The Zookeeper's Wife
47,binducherungath,The Zookeeper's Wife is a film with soul.,7,26 April 2017,"The Zookeeper's Wife, a film by Niki Caro, is the visual adaptation of non-fiction book of the same name by Diane Ackerman. This film depicts the plight of Jews in Poland in 1939 during Nazi invasion (World War II). But the film is not about the war crisis, but it is more about how good elements of the society choose to give hope, share love and compassion with the victims. It is about how a few people grew beyond their self-interest to help the needy. The film does make one believe in the humanity and reinstate one's faith in the goodness. War is just the backdrop, not the main focus. The film focuses on the aftermath of the violence, and how the protagonists risk their own lives to help the people who are suffering. This is the real-life story of Antonina Zabinska and her husband Dr. Jan Zabinski, who are the keepers of Warsaw Zoo. Their lives are thrown into turmoil when Germany invades and occupies Poland. The film is about how the couple decided not to succumb to the odds and do their best possible so as to save Jews from being killed by Germans. A film with soul.The film begins in Warsaw in 1939. Antonina Zabinski (Jessica Chastain) and her husband Dr. Jan Zabinski (Johan Heldnberg) run Warsaw Zoo. The initial frames itself are very compassionate ones, where Antonina rides her bicycle through the main paths of the zoo.Antonina and Dr. Jan's lives turn upside down when Germans invade and occupy Poland. They felt so helpless to see their animals being slaughtered or moved to Berlin Zoo by Dr. Heck (Daniel Bruhl), a zoologist and head of Berlin Zoo. Antonina and Jan were not ready to be mere spectators of the ordeal their people and country were facing. They gathered themselves and started working in a covert manner to save as many people as possible. The Zoo which was home to many animals now becomes the shelter for many Jews. Dr. Heck keeps a sharp vigil over them. How the couple extends help towards the needy and fights the danger of hiding over 300 Jewish people over the course of the entire war, keeping it a secret etc. form rest of the film.Actors are terrific, be it Jessica Chastian, Johan Heldenbergh, Daniel Bruhl.The Zookeeper's Wife is a film depicting real-life story, where war is just the backdrop, not the main focus.

48,Moviegoer19,Glad I Saw the Movie First,9,9 July 2017,"I purposely saved reading the book until after seeing the film as books almost always have more depth and dimension than their film versions. It's just in the nature of each medium. That said, I very much enjoyed watching The Zookeeper's Wife and am surprised at the many mediocre and negative reviews I've read here.Well, yeah, it's another ""Holocaust movie"" but why go see it if that's your attitude? There's nothing new under the sun, remember? We just tell the same stories over and over in different ways. Personally, I will watch every Holocaust film that's made, unless it portrays untruths. I can watch films every day about people doing humane deeds and never get sick of them.I found this film to be both emotionally and visually engaging. I think the three main characters were well written and acted. An especially good job was done in showing the ambivalent nature of Daniel Bruhle's Nazi character, i.e. his humaneness as implied by his love of animals and his sparing of the Zookeeper's Wife and her son while also being a loyal Nazi. Likewise, the character of the Zookeeper, Jan, also had depth, i.e., he was an activist and fighter, as well as a jealous husband. The Zookeeper's wife, of course, was perfect: a woman who adores animals and saves innocent people...what's not to like?My only regret is when I visited Poland I didn't go to the Warsaw Zoo, but then again, I didn't know the backstory four years ago!",The Zookeeper's Wife
49,rdg45,"Another Holocaust Film, But Worth Viewing",7,7 March 2018,"There have been a number of films regarding the holocaust, WWII, the sacrifices and persecution of the Jews by Germany and the few that hid and helped many Jews escape death. This film is another story of just such activity and a thoughtful rendering of the price that is paid by those who sacrificed their lives to save the lives of others.",The Zookeeper's Wife
50,btm1,Could have used more history,5,14 April 2018,"I really enjoyed the opening moments of the film when the zookeepers wife is cycling through the zoo accompanied by a colt-sized young camel running to keep up and animals greeting them as they pass by their enclosures. The film is an homage to Antonina and Jan Zabinski. In 1968 the state of Israel honored the Zabinskis with the title ""Righteous Among the Nations,"" a recognition that was given to all those brave citizens who helped save Jews during the Holocaust. To understand the extent of the bravery you need to know that anti-Semitism was not limited to Hitler's minions in Europe. The largest Jewish population in pre-war Europe was in Poland, with about 3,000,000 Jews. Germany had only about 500,000, and they were more assimilated into the German culture, with many German Jews decorated for their World War I military service. While some native Poles were friendly with Polish Jews, anti-Semitism was rampant. During the Nazi occupation of Poland more Poles cooperated with the Nazi's denigration of Jews and reporting Jews in hiding to the Germans was mush more likely than helping to hide Jews. It is notable that even after the Nazis were defeated remaining Jews in Poland were subjected to another Polish Pogrom, the ""Kielce Pogrom"" in 1946, based on the centuries old blood libel, that Jews were kidnapping Christian children to use their blood for making Passover matzahs (never mind that Jewish law strictly forbids eating anything contaminated with any kind of blood, hence no rare steaks in Kosher cooking). So to risk the Nazi wrath by hiding Jews was particularly brave in Poland. But this film was made in Poland and Poland does not admit to its complicity in the Holocaust. When the Nazis began their removal of Jews from the walled-in Warsaw Ghetto to extermination camps, the inmates of the Ghetto resisted with a handful of guns and improvised explosives. That Jewish resistance broadcast appeals for support to the larger anti-German Polish resistance but none was forthcoming. The battle of the Warsaw Ghetto lasted 28 days. In the Zookeepers Wife there was no Jewish resistance at all during any of that time.As the war turned against the Germans in 1944, the Soviet Army was approaching Warsaw, and the Polish resistance was encouraged to launch a rebellion against the German occupation, the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. However, instead of pushing into Warsaw Stalin held his Red Army standing at the line of the Vistula River. Stalin was content to encourage the Polish resistance to rise up and be defeated by the superior Nazi forces. Stalin allowed the Nazis to kill off much of the surviving Polish aristocracy and other Polish leaders so that it would be easier for his installation of a puppet communist government after the Red Army occupied Warsaw. (As part of a secret protocol of the pre-war Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union had previously occupied a portion of eastern Poland two weeks after Germany invaded Poland in 1939.) The film addresses this only in briefly showing the defeat of the 1944 Polish resistance without any explanation of what led to it and their betrayal by Stalin.",The Zookeeper's Wife

So now we have German soldiers killing zoo animals. Why would professional soldiers, headed by a vegetarian, animal loving Fuhrer want this to happen? The Nazi's were also the first to outlaw vivisection but in this film they are all for it.

Jessica Chastain plays the main character who together with her husband Jan Zabinski, played brilliantly by Belgian actor Johan Heldenbergh, save thousands of Jews from the arms of the Nazi regime.The movie felt like it did not draw enough attention to the animals and I believe that's what made the premise appealing in the first place. No one would think of how animals reacted to the atrocities of World War II and this film could have been the chance to do it.

Based upon real life events that took place in Warsaw, Poland during World War II, this film fails to reach it's intended impact on the audience. The atmosphere of the film is misplaced and has an overall tone that doesn't belong. What should have been a tense film showcasing the impact the war had on zookeeper couple Jan and Antonina Zabinska, and how they responded to the atrocity, ends up feeling quote misplaced with an approach that waters-down the struggle the couple would have gone through. The film spends too much time on certain side plots that are not of importance to the narrative, and only divert the audience from the real story that we came for. Despite the poorly adapted narrative and misguided tone, the film fortunately contains several positive elements. In particular, Jessica Chastain's acting is nothing short of superb and is supported by great performances by Daniel Brühl and Shira Haas. The real-life animals used in the film offer a unique viewpoint of the war, and aid the film to be a visual delight. While it may be flawed in many places, 'The Zookeepers Wife' ultimately tells a unique and beautiful story of World War II that is led by a beautiful performance by Jessica Chastain.",The Zookeeper's Wife

59,svikasha,A Profound Depiction of a Polish Couple Who Rescue People from the Grips of Nazis during The Holocaust,8,16 July 2017,"""The Zookeeper's Wife"" starts out as an idyllic film about the Zabinskis taking care of a zoo in Warsaw, Poland. The film is based on the book of the same name by Diane Ackerman. The Zabinskis have been recognized as ""Righteous Among the Nations"" by Yad Vashem which is the World Holocaust Remembrance Center. The film opens in the year of 1939 and the couple and zoo seem completed isolated from the incredibly volatile geopolitical events happening between Germany, the Soviet Union, and Poland, at the time. That all changes on one of the most infamous days in history: September 1, 1939. The zoo is bombed. The Polish army massacres the animals. The cruelty towards the animals is oddly symbolic of what is to come. After the Germans overrun almost all of Poland, the couple is confronted with even more tragic news. They learn that their animals will be ""liquidated"" for the German war effort. All of the animals would be killed and be used for resources such as meat, glue, fur, etc. The on-screen sounds of animals screaming after being shot are haunting. The zoo is rendered useless but the couple convinces a Nazi named Her Heck who works directly under Goring that the Zoo can be converted into a pig farm to help feed the German troops. The husband witnesses what is happening in the ghettos where Jewish prisoners were taken. He sees a teenager get raped by a couple of soldiers and feels compelled to rescue her from the horrible setting in which so many Jewish people were taken to be left for death. The zookeeper's wife tells the young girl while she recovers from her injuries, ""We were running for so long. And no one knows how hard it is, a life in hiding. You can never tell who your enemies are, or who to trust. Maybe that's why I love animals o much. You look in their eyes and you know exactly what's in their hearts. They're not like people. We live in a zoo. That's where you are, in a zoo."" So it begins. The couple begins to hide other Jewish people.The most haunting scene in the film happens when the Jewish ghetto is being liquidated. The husband lifts children up onto the railway cars. For anyone who knows what happens to the Jewish people who boarded the trains out of Poland, this scene will horrify you. The image of young faces filled with fear as they are taken away from Warsaw serves as a grim reminder of one of the darkest moments in human history. Dr. Korczak, a kind and generous old man who had taken in countless orphans in the Warsaw ghetto narrates a story to convince the children not to be afraid. He tells them that they will be taken to a land called Ro to meet a magician. The older kids seem pretty unconvinced. The noble sacrifice of the doomed old man as he tries to bring an ounce of humanity to the depraved plight of Jewish children swept away by The Holocaust will bring a tear to many eyes. It certainly brought more than a couple to mine. Her Heck is the most evil character depicted on-screen. He hides his sick nature another a veil of order and discipline. At one point, he attempts to seduce the wife of the zookeeper. In another scene he forces a rather large bison to ""mate"" with a much smaller cow to produce a new German breed of cattle. His experiments with genetic breeding are as unsuccessful as the Nazi's belief in eugenics were unfounded. But like the Nazis, he kills many on his quest for racial purity.At the end of the film it is revealed that nearly 300 guests were hidden in the Warsaw Zoo and Zabinski villa during the German occupation. Some stayed a few years. Others only managed to stay a few nights. Other than two of the guests, all of the rest survived. ""The Zookeeper's Wife"" is a Polish ""Schindler's List"" about the extraordinary story of the Polish couple who turned the Warsaw Zoo into a sanctuary for Jews during the German occupation of the city in World War 2.",The Zookeeper's Wife

To see corruption imposed on the most undeserving made me reach a level of empathy and emotion I never even knew I had. The enormity of evil of the human race is depicted through these animals and their reaction to the bombs, their fear and inability to understand what is happening really shows how distorted and disturbing and disconnected war is from all living things and this movie really shows how in so many ways we are one of the weakest and most cowardly species on this planet.",The Zookeeper's Wife
62,Lalpera,Great storyline but not the best outcome!,7,10 May 2017,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. I wish I could write a really positive comment on it, because it has a great theme of human love and kindness. But there are few flaws which really hurt the movie that would otherwise have made it a great movie. First of all, the strength of love and kindness shown not only towards humans but also to animals is very powerfully shown. That is the strongest trademark of the movie. The immense risk taken by both wife and husband, Antonina and Jan to protect some Jews is depicted fairly strong in the story line. A powerful theme of empathy towards those hiding in the basement has worked out well. Jessica Chastain doing the role of Antonina is clearly the winner of the best character here. She lives in her character like a fish in the water and stands tall among other actors. How she handles the romantic advancements of Lutz while not antagonizing him in order to hide the secrets and safeguard the basement refugees is exemplary. Johan acting as Jan is doing a great job too. His character is a strong pillar to Antonina's character building. However there were some flaws. Losing momentum in some scenes and characters where the flow becomes faulty and with some voids. Basically it's a problem within the script, so the script writer has not done a proper job. I also attribute those to poor editing and directing rather than to acting. Many times, particularly in the last 30 – 40 minutes, the connection between the scenes was very weak. Scenes changed quite abruptly, not linking to the next frame thus losing the momentum. For e.g. how did Jan got involved with an underground group to fight with Nazis was not clear and the sequences leading to that was not shown at all. Whether Antonina knew about it or not, is rather confusing too. Also, how some workers still remaining in the zoo amidst so much of war chaos and Nazi bombing and invasions has not been created credibly. Given the ruthlessness of Nazis, the lackluster attitude of Lutz towards Antonina and her family when he found the secrets is very questionable. And when Jan confronts Antonina with a suspicion of an affair between she and Lutz, her reactions were not credible, because she didn't really wanted to be Lutz's secret lover. Yet she doesn't tell it to Jan strong enough, except in a flash. And how the couple afforded to feed hundreds of people in a secret tunnel is a big question very badly unanswered!Yet with all that, I find the movie a positive one.You get excellent acting by almost everyone. Needless to re-iterate how well Jessica, Johan and Daniel do their jobs. Music is serene and allure, that captures the poignant setting of the era. Cinematography is one of the best I've seen recently. The chaos of the zoo after the Nazi bombing has been captured brilliantly where the animals were running amok all over the city. Those few minutes must been a real challenge to film, with real animals, but both director Caro and cameraman Andrij have done a great job there.It is not a great movie. It is not a perfect movie. But it is a movie that enhance and re-affirm your faith in humanity. Strengthen your belief that humans are the most valuable thing on earth. Antonina and Jan shows us that no matter what happens to their life, when it comes to saving a human life, they would do it. And they did save as many lives as they could. That is what inspires me most about this movie.",The Zookeeper's Wife
63,virtual-93888,Excellent Depiction of Pre and Post War Europe,10,21 April 2017,"I have seen a lot of WW2 films - many about the Holocaust - I was immediately struck by the attention that this film paid to life in Warsaw before the invasion of Poland. The story line draws the viewer in with its depiction of the relationships between the zookeeper couple and the animals. Together, they struggle for life and everyone gets along. When Poland is eventually invaded by Germany,this makes the brutality of the war all the more shocking. The innocence of the unsuspecting, terrified zoo animals puts a magnifying glass on how the humans must have felt. This film does a great job of explaining how so many people were caught in the web and unwilling to attempt escape until it was too late.The film is well acted and pays great attention to detail. Several of the characters age before your eyes not only from the passage of time but from the extreme stress they are under. For 2 hours I completely forgot about the outside world which is what I most want from a movie. This is a very emotional film and not for those who are very sensitive and at the same time it should be seen by as many people as possible.

66,octagonproplex,I wish I could have believed,4,8 April 2017,"And again here with ""The Zookeeper's Wife"", yet another film standing stoically for virtue, forgets to actually be virtuous. Superficial piety poorly substitutes for the vitality of verisimilitude.I'm not going to write a lot about the plot or delve into specific spoilers here, except to say it's supposedly based on true events, focusing on a Polish family using their forcibly defunct zoo grounds to help hide and save Jews from Nazi occupiers during the second world war. Now that that is established, let me say as well meaning as I'm sure all involved were in telling this story, it is written and directed to play into every lazy cliché, and feels forced and false far too often to ignore. It's simply not enough to facade a crudely painted platform for the humanities whilst being disingenuous to the holistic hindrances and hardships that hue humanity.Although the film employs a perfectly talented cast, the acting is overwrought to the point of nearly being disgraceful. Like calculated clockwork; one single solitary tear systematically shimmers down Jessica Chastain's chaste cheek seemingly every five minutes. I don't necessarily blame the performers here, but rather Niki Caro's heavy-handed direction to them. Everyone is acting like their in an ""important"" movie instead of acting like real human beings faced with critical moments and difficult circumstances. We know the zookeeper's formidable wife is a woman of great integrity and capacity for courage and tolerance because -- in addition to pulling up her sleeves and working with the animals -- at every chance she affectedly plants affectionate kisses directly onto the snouts of any creature in her care without discrimination. Typical sniveling Nazi villain checks all the prerequisite boxes throughout, and is of course an arrogant predatory fascist stooge with fantastic notions of his own allure and aspirations of grandeur. Victims act like caricatures of victims, pulling faces and gestures with demonstrative abandon. A lot of shifting eyes here, or hysterics there -- everyone telegraphing their emotions when their supposed to be hiding them. Heinous character choices run rampant here, obviously meant to manipulate an audience's empathy or outrage, but backfire in there inauthentic regard for truthful human behavior and intellect. So many broadly melodramatic details clutter this telling without thought for the real-world recklessness that those choices would have actually been, that even without doing any research into the details of the actual events being portrayed I simply know as an common person of fair perception that there is no way they could have occurred in the fashion depicted within this film.The cinematography, production design, and musical score are uniformly serviceable and generic. I give this project credit for decent aesthetic appearance and humane ambitions, but unfortunately cannot endorse such egregious posturing. I never felt a single true moment that made me forget I was watching a contrived scene meant to stir sentiment without sentience, and therefore constantly felt disengaged by its labored desire to be loved.",The Zookeeper's Wife
67,willowwear00,Another Good Goy Holocaust Movie - but well done,8,24 December 2017,"As others have written, we've seen this formula many times before: Righteous Christians put their lives in danger to rescue Jews during the Holocaust. As a Jew whose people came from Poland and Germany, I thank the Zookeeper and his wife. And yes, the usual Jew haters always show up on IMDb to claim the Holocaust is a fraud. Good luck with that.I liked this movie because it tells a story without going over the top, which many Holocaust movies do. The fact that it happens in a zoo makes it different.But it also must be said: The vast majority of Poles LOATHED the Jews and were thrilled to see the Germans murder them. Indeed, even after the war. Poles would pray upon freed concentration camp victims and murder them. A movie such as this shouldnt scrub the dirt from Polish hands.",The Zookeeper's Wife
68,ronnietg,"Flawed Script, but worthwhile film",7,3 May 2017,"I review films from the point of view of the script writer. The Zookeeper's Wife story line employs the genres of: Drama/Historical Epic/Memoir-True Story. As a writer, it is important to know your genres because each genre embodies special story beats. Biography or Memoir-True Story are not really genres, but for the screenplay writer, they are a methodology of how to write a story that is ""based on true events."" Unfortunately, the scriptwriter for this story did not employ the format of Memoir-True Story, which therefore resulted in loss of Narrative Drive, a.k.a. Ho-Hum story line. A fix would have been the following: Start with the Story World of 1944 Poland and show the city bombarded by relentless explosions and chaos; shrieks of despair; buildings in rubble; Nazis in the city on tanks and long lines of Jews dying in the infamous Ghetto. Also, show the serial heinous murder of some 20,000 Polish Intelligentsia by the Nazis. Go to the beginning of the Climax/Battle scene whereby the ruthless Nazi (former distinguished zookeeper) comes to the Warsaw Zoo and pulls the Hero's (Antonina's) son away and we hear a gun shot. Then do a Screen Overlay that says: Five years earlier. Then, move forward from 1939, with Antonina's Story World of wild animals, some living in her house; Rhyz' pet pig; the orderliness and compassion of the zoo staff; the husband and wife synchronicity. This is broken by the Inciting Incident, which is the bombing and execution of their prized animals. Instead, the script writer shows the Jews being rounded up as the Inciting Incident. This is not the Inciting Incident and for audiences who came to see this story, it's predictable, to say the least. To understand the mistake inherent in this script, we must look at the Designing Principle of the story: Human compassion for the greater good can override the immediate desire to flee when one's life is in danger. Here we have ""righteous Gentiles"" who were ready to risk their lives to save Jews. Why? If we think the answer is because the Hero was compassionate, we miss the point of this story entirely. What Antonina and Jan saw was the crumbling of Polish society that they knew intimately and lovingly- They were not only zookeepers, but zoologists; research intellectuals; artists; lovers of animals, true, but they knew the value of their Jewish friend's insect collection: thousands of rare species; they knew the value of their Jewish friend's famous sculptures. In a horrifically short period of time, all of this was destroyed.Furthermore, the fascist Nazi regime's ultimate goal was to murder all the Poles and/or turn them into slaves, for their racial ideology stated that Poles/Slavs/Jews/Catholics were inferior to the Aryan ideal. This is symbolically shown to us by the obsession of the Nazi Opponent to cross breed animals so that he could create a modern ""Aryan"" hunting animal. All of the aforementioned Story World was overlooked by this script writer, but it was key to the motivation of the Hero and her devoted husband to hide as many Jews as they could; fight in the Partisan Movement; devise extremely dangerous methods to get the Jews out of the Ghetto. The script writer chose an Opening called the Community Opening, which plays in about 1% of all script writing. It's a slow opener; it shows a group of people laughing, socializing, life is beautiful and enchanted. And then, boom! Everything falls apart with the brutal realities of war. The problem of using this Community Opening with this particular story was that it was boring and predictable because this is 2017 and worldwide audiences know what happened in Warsaw, Poland in 1939. It was a poor choice of opening this Story World; made the audience feel that they were being preached to and/or manipulated. The Hero, Antonina never had the Nazi zoologist with his hands all over her, almost raping her. This was not in Antonina's journals. There never was a young Ghetto girl who was raped by the Nazi soldiers in Antonina's journal. So we have to ask, why did this script writer put these irritating and non-believable add-ons to the plot, which was rich with so many other important elements that could have been included. This script writer took the Drama genre and made it the focal point of the story line. Intimate Opponents and Character Web; intense Moral Argument that blows in the Climax. But not for this story – Wrong decision and audience irritation bears it out. For, the Nazi Opponent is executing prized zoo animals; he feels empowered; his Jew-hatred is on the table. If he wanted Antonina, he would have taken her and raped her. Okay, he was fascinated by her beauty, but that was all. It took the audience off the Narrative Drive and was not believable. The young girl raped and bloody: The Nazis would have murdered her. Her ""recuperation"" took the audience off the Narrative Drive. In sum, Story World of Historical Epic was overlooked here. Drama genre and branching off and unbelievable character webs The opportunity to show Polish ""beautiful and artistic"" society destroyed forever juxtaposed with the destruction of Polish Jewry; Polish Intelligentsia Oh! What opportunities were lost with this script! Righteous Gentiles who were willing to die in order to ""do the right thing,"" yes, this was a redeeming factor about the script and the movie. Still worthwhile for that fact alone. Antonina, Jan, their workers, their children: True unsung heroes.",The Zookeeper's Wife
69,cybrsrch,Unwatchable,1,16 February 2018,"Tragic, hard to stomach, needless. Sad, if you want to ruin your day, to make you feel horrible and witness atrocities against animals then this film is right up your alley. It is like watching faces of death on loop",The Zookeeper's Wife
70,maricam,Not perfect but good,7,8 April 2017,"""The Zookeeper's Wife"" is based on the lives of Antonina and Jan Zabinski, keepers of the Warsaw Zoo, during the German occupation of Poland during World War II. I class this movie in the same league as ""Sophie Scholl: The Final Days"" and ""It's A Beautiful Life"". These are movies which give viewers credit for having a brain as evidenced by a lack of gratuitous violence, blood, gore, and killing. We don't need to see animals being blown up or girls being raped to know these things happened and were horrible. I don't find graphic images of such things ""entertaining"" anyway so I appreciated the lack of shock and horror. Instead the writers and director effectively allude to the horror without abusing me, the viewer. Some will say the movie is a sanitized view of WWII and they would be right. But it didn't diminish the impact of the story, which is the entire point of the film. The story is one of kindness, bravery, and resilience in the face of Nazi evil. It is simply told in a linear fashion. The movie is well filmed and well acted. As entertainment goes it's good. As far as ""message"", it's as deep as the viewer wants it to be. I found myself thinking, ""What would I do in a similar situation?"" And if I find myself asking myself that question rather than turning away I call that successful story-telling. A good movie doesn't need to beat up the audience to drive home it's point.So, mostly I just wanted to provide a review applauding the restraint of the movie maker. For too long I've had little choice in movies I'd want to watch since so many of them feature explosions, gunplay, graphic scenes of murder and rape, gratuitous use of obscenity, profanity, and vulgarity, and rarely give me credit for having any kind of discernment as they beat me over the head with some heavy-handed ""message"" usually about something with which I completely disagree. ""The Zookeeper's Wife"" doesn't employ any of these tired, ugly devices. I didn't once feel manipulated. It's not a perfect movie but it was entertaining and left me with plenty to ponder and talk about with others.",The Zookeeper's Wife
71,dianeoffutt,Factual and heartbreaking,10,8 June 2018,"The actors were excellent. The movie was based on true facts , so yes , there was ugliness . One of the reviewers wrote ""there have not been nazis since the 40's"", well, I disagree. There are nazis still around , in America, and still filled with hate. Learn from this movie. We must not let history be repeated.",The Zookeeper's Wife
72,josephkorsak,A tad formulaic,3,16 April 2017,"I was disappointed with this movie. Jessica Chastain was difficult to hear, using a Polish accent that was not particularly good. The underlying story is an inspiring one. Unfortunately, every scene where a Nazi materialized did not convey any real sense of danger. The music made you think that a very emotional scene was about to unfold. Wrong, again and again. The re-appearance of her husband at the end of the movie was as formulaic as one could imagine. Hold this film up to a real Holocaust movie (Schlindler's List) and it doesn't do very well.",The Zookeeper's Wife
73,restlesstymes,Easily one of the Best Films of 2017,9,29 March 2017,"The Zookeepers Wife is the true story of Antonina Żabiński, her husband Jan and the Warsaw Zoo they ran in Poland right at the start of World War II. Jan was a respected zoologist and scientist at the time, and Antonina was an equally respected author in her own right. With the bombings in Poland and the Nazi's vying for control of the country, the Żabiński's do all they can to save as many people as they can, putting themselves and their own son at great risk. This is the story of two people, that could not stand by and stand idly by while innocent people die. George Bernard Shaw once said:""The worst sin toward our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them: that's the essence of inhumanity"" and this story is the essence of those words.Nikki Caro, whose brilliant direction has spearheaded multiple highly acclaimed movies (probably best known for North Country), helmed this film.. Caro is able to reflect humanity, sincerity and earnestness in her films, which captivates and entangles the viewer. That's the beauty of film isn't it? To be totally swept up in another person's story, another one's life. Caro's directing prowess brings to mind the ideology of the male gaze vs. the female gaze in films, and while I won't get into detail about that here, Caros perspective is fresh and her films are unique. Different people perceive things differently, and some directors present films through their eyes lens, essentially seeing and interpreting the story with their own eyes (and biases). With Nikki Caro though, I feel as though I'm witnessing a life lived, purely, rather than someone's perspective of that life. I think that's why I appreciate her directing style so much, there is clarity and candor in the way she captures the film and that honestly pulls you in. Caro is a superb director and I cannot understand why the woman has only directed a handful of films, we need her making more films! So you all know how much I love Jessica Chastian, but I left this film loving her and her talent even more. She is the only, I mean the ONLY woman that could've played Antonina. Jessica is a shining light of energy, power, compassion and love and I'd imagine Antonina was the same. Animals know who to trust instinctively, and Chastain's kinship with them spills out of the film and into your heart, this makes her portrayal of Antonina all the more palpable. In many scenes it seemed like Antonina was bathed in light, and I appreciate those subtleties because I think it represents her inner light. I know it seems so silly but I always feel that these little things directors do are very deliberate and calculating. I love and appreciate the little things. I like to see it as the physical light shines on her the way her inner light shined on all the people she saved. Jessica Chastain is by far one of the best actresses working today, and I predict its only a matter of time before she takes an Oscar home.Johan Heldenbergh, the Danish actor who played her husband was great too, he and Chastain were a force to be reckoned with and had great chemistry. Michael McElhatton was also fantastic in his supporting role as Jerzyk, I recognized him from Game of Thrones where he played the conniving Roose Bolton. He is a very talented actor and shined brightly in his supporting role. Also, Daniel Brühl is an exceedingly good actor, he is very good at playing a certain kind of role. That's all I'm going to say about that because I don't want to ruin it for anyone!The Zookeeper's Wife was tough to watch in some parts, but its in tragedy and hardship that hope thrives. This film reminded me that there are angels around us every day, there are good people in this world, no matter how bad it must seem. There is always hope. This message is powerful and really resonates, right now. For some it might seem hopeless, but there are always people that WILL do the right thing even when their life hangs in the balance. I felt filled with compassion and empathy; as I said before I know it seems like compassion is something people can no longer comprehend, but that's not the case. I promise! It is still possible to find love and comfort in the darkest of times. Love is all around us. We must be the vessel through which hope and love spreads. Antonina believed this with her whole heart which is why she and Jan did what they did. There are brave people all around us: fighting for our rights, fighting for theirs, their family, their country - bravery comes in so many forms. This film reflects this: there is bravery in combat and 'silent' bravery. One is not greater than the other.Another thing I want to make sure I note is the effects animals have on healing. It's widely known that animals help people heal. You can read more about that online if you are so inclined, but I think it's so poignant and it pulled on my heart because I can identify on a personal level. My dog Tasha was a rescue from a puppy mill, my best friend had just lost his dog to cancer, I just lost my cat also to cancer, and here I am thinking we saved her when she really saved US. I wanted to note it here, but it will make so much more sense when you see the film. All in all it was great and plus it was incredibly well done, by an incredibly talented director with an amazing cast. This is a spectacular story, more than worthy of a trip to the theater. Go see it, and support women directors!",The Zookeeper's Wife
74,ipekevamy,A Must See!,7,1 April 2017,"This is a movie everyone should see. It's truly inspiring, it makes you think about humanity and shows you the creations of cruelty, hate alongside with what love, compassion, and courage can achieve.The whole cast was great especially the outstanding Jessica Chastain. The natural bond she has with the animals like the real Antonina Zabinski is so magical. Knowing the movie is based on a true story makes your heart break. But seeing these lovely, kindhearted people saving so many others is raising hope even for the times we're living in now.It's a heavy movie, but I definitely recommend it.",The Zookeeper's Wife
75,danaimou,A wasted opportunity by soap opera-like direction on a feature film,4,20 July 2017,"The story itself is very intriguing, and could make for a great, interesting and touching film. Unfortunately, this movie fails on two main aspects, and it fails so badly that makes the movie barely watchable.The most obvious is how unnatural the imposed accent while speaking English feels. It constantly takes the viewer's focus away from the actor's performances, and makes nearly every scene feel awkward and like it is made for a children's movie, which is in stark contrast to the main theme of the film.Most importantly, the directing of the film is soap opera-like, where the characters constantly have to verbally express their thoughts and emotion, and explain situations through scripted dialogue, instead of letting good performances and good direction convey them. In way too many scenes, I found myself thinking about how more impactful the scene would have been if some dialogue was cut. In many cases this was so brutally obvious, it felt like a child was directing this film.Case in point: A woman puts her son to bed and when she goes to close the window curtains observes something atrocious take place outside. The atrocity itself and the woman's reaction are enough to impact the audience. But then we are treated with the dialogue ""Mama, who's shooting?"" ""Mama, they're shooting!"" --> cries in mama's shoulder. This is basic stuff here, we know they are shooting, we just saw it. The only thing this next dialogue contributes to is to dilute the feeling of the scene. And this thing goes on throughout the film, where things happen and then people talk about the things we already saw happen.I literally have seen better directing in the The Bold and the Beautiful! At the end, it just bores and leaves the audience unengaged. Except if you're my grandma. What a wasted opportunity!",The Zookeeper's Wife
76,pedgarshannon,It's a Holocaust Chick Flick!,4,2 September 2017,"Several other reviewers have remarked how this film seems to be lacking any real visceral punch that one would expect from a movie about the Holocaust. When I finished watching it, my reaction was, indeed, ""meh"".This is no Sophie's Choice, no Pianist, no Schindler's List, no Defiance, no Triumph of the Spirit, no Pawnbroker. The necessary elements seem to be present, but the chemistry is lacking. And I discovered the reason: an excess of estrogen.It was the ""making of"" featurette that revealed the cause: this movie was made by women--- producers, writers, director--- and it shows. The featurette even proclaims that the story is told from a ""feminine"" point of view. The star herself opines that ""to be a hero, you don't have to fight and kill; you can be a hero with compassion"". Well, yes, that's certainly true. So just be aware of what you're getting here... it's a chick flick. And a rather interesting study in that regard, from a film-making perspective. But... ""meh""....",The Zookeeper's Wife
77,tubaman-8,"Inspiring story, but only a mediocre treatment",6,26 December 2017,"I don't usually write reviews, but I saw this movie last night and after reading some of the reviews on this page I had to respond. This movie apparently brought out the Nazi apologists who found it necessary to write reviews about how the Nazis ""weren't that bad"" and why do movies keep depicting them that way. These revisionists need to be called out for what they are, white supremacists.This movie tells the true story about a family that used their zoo to rescue 300 Jews from death in the Warsaw Ghetto or ultimately death in a death camp, which is what happened to most of the people who survived the ghetto before it was burned down. These revisionists are trying to say that the Nazis weren't that bad, but I was on the board of directors of the Holocaust Center of Central Florida in the mid 90s and knew a number of holocaust survivors quite well. Their stories if anything make the events portrayed in this film somewhat tame in comparison. The Nazis should have been portrayed as even more callous and evil to be accurate. As for the movie, I did find that it wasn't the most effective telling of this true story. A number of embellishments were made to the story, I assume for dramatic effect, but many of them just didn't work. To me some of them made what was already an incredible story become completely implausible. I'm not going into detail so as not to give out any spoilers, but I suggest that people should read the book if they want to know the real heroism of this couple. I also found the dialog somewhat stilted at times and the story presented in a somewhat disjointed way.Still, the movie provides another reminder of the evil that was Nazi Germany and how there were people who heroically risked their lives to try to fight back against it. I may have liked it more if I hadn't already known the story and read the book, but overall I found it to be a good, if not great movie.",The Zookeeper's Wife
78,AphroditeVenus,High heels and the Holocaust,5,9 August 2017,"I wanted to like this film but from the first scenes of Jessica Castain's character tottering through the zoo holding and tending to huge animals IN STILETTOS (1940s style, about 4 inches) I couldn't take it seriously. Fine for the opening party, but it continued in every scene, bar one where she was wearing boots. The most cursory google images search show Polish women in the war wore flat shoes. If you're ***MINOR SPOILER*** dashing around the city out-running Nazis, or in a zoo tending large, messy animals, flats would surely be the heel of choice.This lack of attention to reality annoyed me. It smacks of oppression, a world where a women's silhouette is unacceptable unless she's in crippling high heels - arguably the Western equivalent of foot-binding. Even though the film has a female director and is about a real life courageous WWII heroine, it falls for this trope. Disappointed that Niki Caro, whose 'Whale Rider' is stunning, made this choice.",The Zookeeper's Wife
79,Cfoudyrun,An emotionally manipulative mess.,2,17 April 2018,"I can see why this film never really garnered a wide-release and was completely under the radar for any televised awards show. This film is worse than bad. It portrays the main characters as incompetent and idiotic instead of the brave and intelligent people that they were. But to be fair, this is due more to the awful writing than the performances (which were fine). The writing devolved a potentially gripping and dramatic story into melodramatic schlock. If you are looking for a good representation of the struggles of the holocaust, watch Schindler's List, Boy in the Striped Pajamas or read ""Maus"" or ""Night""; please do not watch this garbage.",The Zookeeper's Wife

I would have probably even had a better experience staring at a black screen for two hours, eating my popcorn.This movie lacked pretty much everything a movie needs. To say it was a slow pace would be too much credit, there was no pace at all, it dragged itself on with no direction, nothing happening, utterly boring.So many silly goofs going on, like feeding pigs with garbage from the ghetto... garbage from a ghetto? What garbage, they'd eat everything till the very last scrap. Or another idiotic scene near the end of the movie where Lutz makes Rys lock his mother up, after they just walked through the tunnel... that would take you back to the broken down door in like 1 minute... Why would Lutz even bother at all to find out how many Jews escaped through the zoo, what does it matter at that point?

That said, in my 51 years have never taken the time to write a single review, but after seeing this movie last evening, I felt I had to.The story is similar to Schindler's List in that a family/person help Jews escape Nazis. You would think that the story line is played out. That seeing another tear jerker is not worth seeing or that you have seen it all. Not so with this movie.The story is as you can guess both historical and well told. The director has included enough raw scenes that make you cringe, yet not gone so far that the movie is unwatchable. While the story has many moments of pain and suffering, there are equal moments of simple happiness in what really matters in life.The acting is great. I truly felt as if I was there.

83,jennyshell,Bad Book Adaptation - But Decent Movie,6,20 April 2017,"I finished reading The Zookeeper's Wife the day before I went to see the movie. Viewing the movie from a book adaptation perspective - it is highly dramatized and many things were added in that never took place. The biggest different, and drama added to the film is Lutz Heck going after Antonina. He did have a small crush on her, but it never went to the point of visiting the zoo every day and especially not attempting to rape her. There were many other false things added to the movie as well, but I won't make a long list of them. The Lutz Heck part was the biggest difference and the one I had the biggest problem with.Don't say a movie is ""based on a true story"" and then go and butcher the true story. 99% of the time, the true story is far more interesting than what Hollywood has created.Now - viewing the movie from a NON book adaptation, it is good. Jessica Chastain's accent is pretty bad, and they should have just cast someone from that country instead because Americans are not great at accents; but I understand how Hollywood works. They needed a ""known-name"" actor. The music and costumes were good, and acting from the other characters was also well done. That is the only reason I'm giving it a 6 out of 10. If I based it purely on a book adaptation, it would have been a lower score.Worth seeing if you HAVE NOT read the book!",The Zookeeper's Wife
84,ph-swinnen,Get rid of these ridiculous English/foreign accents,5,6 July 2017,"A film with promising actors and based upon an incredible true story, however didn't fill up to its high expectations, sadly. Something that always troubles me, is feeling the need to speak English with an accent to show that they're actually speaking another language. It's in fact ridiculous, knowing that Johan Heldenbergh is pure Belgian (and actually speaks English with a Flemish/Ghent accent) and Jessica Chastain is pure American (her English/polish accent is just ridiculous). Either you just speak plain English or you make the movie with Polish actors. Besides that, Johan Heldenbergh, the zookeeper, (world-renown in Belgium but his first introduction in a bigger US production), was impeccable & perfectly casted.The film didn't blow me away and was predictable from beginning till the end. Fairly enjoyable for a regular weeknight if you have nothing to do, but will most certainly be forgotten the next day - not anywhere near classic holocaust movies like Schindler's list or The Pianist.
