0,TheLittleSongbird,"Great cast, entertaining movie",8,25 September 2010,"There may be the odd joke that is a little hit and miss, but overall !Three Amigos! is very entertaining in my opinion. John Landis once again does a very good job with the direction, while the story was interesting and the script was funny with a lot of quotable dialogue. The pacing is in general secure with only some draggy parts in the middle, while !Three Amigos! has some pleasant production values. The best asset though is definitely the performances and chemistry of the three leads Steve Martin, Chevvy Chase and Martin Short, all three are very likable and show good comic timing. In conclusion, entertaining and worth seeing for the cast. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Three Amigos!
1,bkoganbing,Just another publicity gig,7,28 March 2014,"Three Amigos casts Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short as three Latino cowboy heroes of the silent screen where their obvious Anglo speech patterns will not distract from the image they create. Their actors and have the egos and fragilities of Hollywood cowboys. But they also know they're Hollywood cowboys and don't take themselves too seriously.But in a plot gambit taken from The Magnificent Seven, there's a village in 1916 revolutionary anarchic Mexico that's being plagued by a bandit named El Guapo and his gang. Like kids they take their cowboy heroes seriously and they expect these three to act like their screen images.Not so easy for these guys to do that, but once they get going they're actually inspiring in their own ways. Not to mention that in Chase, Martin, and Short you have three of the very best from the training ground of Saturday Night Live. Individually and collectively they make a very good comedy premise come to life.Best scene is in that Mexican bar when the patrons are told three distinctive tough guys are coming to town and even though these guys break into My Little Buttercup for the crowd, the patrons still act scared.How do they rid the town of El Guapo. Why have the villagers use their own special talents. What they are and how they are employed is for you to see Three Amigos and laugh your heads off.",Three Amigos!
2,Leofwine_draca,Comedy treat,7,4 March 2018,"THREE AMIGOS is one of those amiable, ensemble comedy hits of the 1980s, well directed by John Landis and coming in just behind his horror classics like AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON and INNOCENT BLOOD. The casting of Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short as the heroic trio is irresistable and I loved the nod to silent-era filmmaking. In terms of plotting, this is a virtual reprise of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, with a trio of incompetent actors kicking up a storm in a small Mexican village beset by bandits. The jokes come thick and fast and there are some highlight set-pieces like the bit with Martin in the prison cell that really work. I particularly enjoyed the surrealist moment with the singing bush and invisible swordsman, quite genius. Another surprise is that the action scenes are very well directed and just as good as those seen in mainstream westerns.",Three Amigos!
3,SnoopyStyle,love these guys and their chemistry,8,3 May 2015,"Mexican village of Santo Poco is harassed by El Guapo and his bandits. Carmen goes in search for fighters to defend the village. She watches a Three Amigos movie and assumes that it is real. She telegrams an invitation to the Three Amigos; Lucky Day (Steve Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chevy Chase) and Ned Nederlander (Martin Short). Lucky pushes the studio boss too far and gets all three fired. They misunderstand the telegram and assume they are being asked for a simple personal appearance. A German comes looking for El Guapo and misunderstandings ensue.I love this movie. I love these three actors and their easy chemistry. They are idiotic and lovable. Director John Landis keeps it simple and lets the stars shine. There are some good laughs but more than anything, this movie leaves me with a smile. I have seen some of the comedians who are suppose to be in this movie. They are all great but why I love these three guys is because they are loveably idiotic. They are dumb without any superiority. I really root for these guys.",Three Amigos!
4,lee_eisenberg,Que bueno!,10,5 June 2006,"Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, and Martin Short get the roles of a lifetime in ""Three Amigos!"", where they have to defend a Mexican town from bandits in 1916. Partly an excuse to have the three stars' personalities bounce off of each other, the movie plays everything for all that it's worth. Needless to say, Chase is pretty much the goofiest character in the movie. Probably the three coolest scenes in the movie are the Roy Rogers spoof, the birthday party, and the whole end sequence (although the chain sequence was also pretty neat).All in all, this is another comedy triumph from the director of ""Animal House"" and ""The Blues Brothers"". It's too bad that the three stars didn't all co-star in another movie after this. Also starring Joe Mantegna, Jon Lovitz, Phil Hartman and Alfonso Arau (who also appeared in ""The Wild Bunch"" and directed ""Like Water for Chocolate"").",Three Amigos!
5,jboothmillard,Three Amigos!,5,23 May 2021,"I remember seeing the image for this movie a few times when I was younger, and I knew I was going to watch it one day, so I'm glad it was broadcast on television, directed by John Landis (The Blues Brothers, An American Werewolf in London, Burke and Hare). Basically, set in 1916, Lucky Day (Steve Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chevy Chase), and Ned Nederlander (Martin Short) are silent movie stars from Los Angeles, California, who portray ""The Three Amigos"", a trio of gunfighters, on screen. Meanwhile, in Mexico, the village of Santo Poco is being threatened by the bandit ""El Guapo"" (Alfonso Arau) and his gang. Carmen (Patrice Martinez), daughter of the village leader, searches for someone who can come to the rescue of her townspeople. While visiting the village church, she watches a silent film featuring ""The Three Amigos"" who protect the vulnerable from villains. Believing them to be real heroes, Carmen sends a telegram asking them to come and stop El Guapo. When the three actors demand a salary increase, studio executive Harry Flugleman (Joe Mantegna) fires them. Shortly afterward, they receive Carmen's telegram, which was shortened for words due to expenses. They misinterpret it as an invitation to perform in character at a show for the people of Santo Poco. After breaking into the studio to retrieve their costumes, the Amigos head for Mexico. Stopping at a cantina near Santo Poco, they are mistaken for associates of a fast-shooting German pilot (Kai Wulff), who is also looking for El Guapo. The Amigos perform at the Cantina, singing ""My Little Buttercup"", and leave the locals confused. A relieved Carmen finds the Amigos and takes them to the village, where they are given a room in the best house in town and pampered. The next morning, three of El Guapo's men come to raid the village. The Amigos do a Hollywood-style stunt show that leaves the men bemused. The bandits ride off, making the villagers think that the Amigos have scared them away. While the village throws a party for the Amigos, the men tell El Guapo what happened, and he decides to return the next day to confront the Amigos. The next morning, El Guapo and his gang come to Santo Poco and call out the Amigos, but the Amigos think this is another show. After Lucky gets shot in the arm, the Amigos realise that they are real bandits and beg for mercy. El Guapo allows the Amigos to live, then his men loot the village and kidnap Carmen. The Amigos are humiliated and leave Santo Poco. Ned persuades Lucky and Dusty to save Carmen and defeat El Guapo, saying that they have nothing worth going back to in America and that they a chance to be real heroes. They spot a cargo plane and follow it; the plane is flown by the German, who has brought a shipment of rifles for El Guapo's gang. Preparations are underway for El Guapo's 40th birthday party, and he plans to make Carmen his bride. The Amigos try to sneak into the hideout, with mixed results: Lucky is captured and chained up in a dungeon, Dusty crashes through a window into Carmen's room, and Ned ends up stuck, suspended from a piñata. Lucky frees himself, but Dusty and Ned are taken hostage. The German challenges Ned to a shootout, having idolised his gun skills since childhood. Ned kills the German, and Lucky holds El Guapo at gunpoint long enough for Carmen and the Amigos to escape in the German's plane. Returning to Santo Poco with El Guapo's army in pursuit, the Amigos rally the villagers to stand up for themselves. The bandits arrive, only to find themselves suddenly being shot at by Amigos from all sides and falling into hidden trenches dug by the villagers. El Guapo's men either ride off or are shot, and he takes a fatal wound as well. As he lies dying, the villagers, all dressed as Amigos, step out to confront him. El Guapo congratulates them, then shoots Lucky in the foot and dies. The villagers offer to give the Amigos all the money they have, but the Amigos refuse and quote one of their own movies: ""Our reward is that justice has been done."" They then ride off into the sunset. Also starring Tony Plana as Jefe, Phil Hartman as Sam, Jon Lovitz as Morty, Philip Gordon as Rodrigo, and Randy Newman as the voice of the Singing Bush (also writing). Martin, Chase, and Short make have great chemistry as the trio of hapless actors who are unintentionally drawn into a showdown against a gang of villains, and the gentle digs at the western genre work well, it is just simple entertainment with some little chuckles along the way, a reasonable western comedy. Worth watching!",Three Amigos!
6,Woodyanders,Delightful comedy,8,1 February 2017,"A bumbling silent screen trio are hired by the naive residents of a remote Mexican hamlet to defend said town from a gang of vicious bandits led by the infamous El Guapo (robustly played by Alfonso Arau).Director John Landis ably crafts an amiable lighthearted tone, offers a flavorsome turn of the century south of the border atmosphere, and shows a genuine affection for both silent cinema and Western movie mythology. Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, and Martin Short are utterly engaging as the lovably dim-witted trio; their natural and likable chemistry really gives this film a lot of infectious charm and energy. Moreover, there are sound contributions from Tony Plana as thickskulled henchman Jefe, Patrice Martinez as fair damsel in distress Carmen, Kai Wulff as a vicious German, Joe Mantegna as flamboyant studio head Harry Flugleman, and Jon Lovitz as smarmy studio executive Morty. Better still, this film even has a lovely and uplifting central message about the necessity for courage and heroism in the face of adversity, with our three leads ultimately proving that they have the right stuff when it comes to standing up for all that's good and just. Randy Newman provides several catchy songs and does the voice of a singing bush. Kudos are also in order for Elmer Bernstein's bouncy score and Ronald W. Browne's slick cinematography. A total treat.",Three Amigos!
7,ccthemovieman-1,Might Be The Funniest Film I've Ever Seen,10,2 February 2007,"I was shocked when I discovered I hadn't reviewed this despite writing many reviews, since it is one of my favorite comedies of all time. It may even rank as the funniest movie I've ever seen. It just has a ton of laughs, start-to-finish, and without all the raunch and profanity of today's comedy films - although it's no ""Bambi,"" that's for sure.Not only does the dialog produce numerous laugh-out-loud scenes but so do all the sight gags, nd there are plenty of those. The funniest characters in the film are the villains, led by ""El Guapo,"" played by Alfonso Arau. He is almost indescribable. All he has to do is open his mouth and show his bad teeth and then give his huge smile and I crack up every time.The three leads - played by Steve Martin, Matin Short and Chevy Chase - are all excellent and in the primes of their careers. The film also is directed by John Landis, who has a knack for directing extremely entertaining movies. Just look at his resume on the IMDb. This film was written by Martin, Lorne Michales of ""Saturday Night Live,"" and songwriter Randy Newman. Kudos to all of them for a job well done.In addition to the great comedy, decent language and color characters both good guys and bad guys, was the beautiful cinematography. There is a very colorful-looking film and looks outstanding on DVD.Overall: this is what entertainment is all about.",Three Amigos!
8,Quinoa1984,"Goodnight, Ned",8,1 March 2001,"This film is pretty hilarious.  It is in one of the best feels of director John Landis as a comedic director.  It might've gone bad, but the three stars, Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase make a fantastic duo in hilarity amidst people that might not be as funny.  The campfire scene is classic, as is the scene when the three find that, the guns are real. Jon Lovitz and Phil Hartman come in cameos. A-",Three Amigos!

10,Hey_Sweden,Wherever there is suffering...,8,27 January 2012,"...This movie will be the cause of it! Of course, I am kidding, as this is really a charming tribute to and spoof of the earlier days of filmmaking, as a silent era Western trio, ""Lucky Day"" (Steve Martin), ""Dusty Bottoms"" (Chevy Chase) and Ned Nederlander (Martin Short), find themselves out of work after their last movie flopped and they won't listen to the studio head's suggestion. As fate would have it, a representative of a besieged Mexican village has seen one of their movies and takes it as fact, offering them 100,000 pesos for what they think is a personal appearance when in reality they're being hired to get rid of the fiendish bandit, El Guapo (Alfonso Arau) and his crew who have been terrorizing them. Yes, this is the same basic story also told 13 years later in ""Galaxy Quest"", but quite likable and funny. Some of the jokes are dragged out a little too long, creating some awkwardness, but overall this is just too hard to resist. Written by Martin (who also takes an executive producer credit), producer Lorne Michaels, and singer / songwriter Randy Newman (who provides the voice of The Singing Bush), its look is just perfect, and for the most part it moves along quite well, providing not one but two scenes of climactic action. The second involves a nice bit of trickery and ingenuity; one can't help but like the characters and the bad guys are also very entertaining in their own right. A few catchy musical numbers add to the fun, with enthusiastic performances by the talented star trio, who definitely look like they're enjoying themselves. Future director Arau, who'd also been a key bad guy in ""The Wild Bunch"" 17 years before this, is a hoot as El Guapo, and Patrice Martinez as the impassioned Carmen is just gorgeous and immensely appealing and certainly could have had a solid film career after this. It's also great to see Joe Mantegna as the flamboyant studio head, as well as Jon Lovitz and Phil Hartman as his underlings. Particularly funny sequences include the musical number ""Blue Shadows"" (those horses are hilarious!), the moment where Lucky realizes the danger he and his buddies are truly in, and their assault on the bad guys' stronghold. Of course, the movie isn't just gags; the story is strong enough to sustain its length and keep viewers smiling. There are enough things here to make one laugh out loud and maintain interest (including the fantastic music score by the legendary Elmer Bernstein, whose credits range from ""The Magnificent Seven"" to ""An American Werewolf in London"" to ""Ghost Busters""), right from start to finish. Eight out of 10.",Three Amigos!
11,utgard14,Can I Have Your Watch When You Are Dead?,7,7 December 2013,"Underrated John Landis comedy with fun music. Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short star as three silent film stars who are asked to defend a Mexican town from bandits. A plot reminiscent of The Magnificent Seven. It's such a fun light-hearted movie I don't see why it has so many detractors. Perhaps the humor isn't crude enough. This is certainly one of Landis' least vulgar comedies. To me the movie has an old-school kind of charm about it. It's full of lots of great sight gags, memorable lines, and cute Randy Newman songs. It moves at a nice pace and seems to enjoy its story instead of overloading you with one ""bit"" after another. So give it a shot if you like Landis' work or the work of the three stars. It's one of my favorite 80s comedies.",Three Amigos!
12,Boba_Fett1138,I expected more.,6,2 August 2006,"I expected more from this movie, after all its widely known and formed the inspiration for later movies such as ""A Bug's Life"", ""Mystery Men"" and ""Galaxy Quest"". Not the least movies in the genre.The premise of the movie also is good but this movie is a typical case of; the premise is funnier and more original than the actual movie itself. The jokes are weak and the movie only relies on its premise, which basically forms the only comical situation of the movie. Even the great three main characters are pushed to the background. There aren't really many jokes present, which makes this movie also far from being one of the best or interesting comedies.The three main characters are good and they are a good spoof on '20's serial-movies. There are being played by '80's comedy icons Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase. Especially Steve Martin is at his best as the leader of the bunch. But all of them however get a surprising disappointing amount of fun or interesting to do. The movie really is lacking in jokes and overall the movie itself could had been so much more of a fun one. Also the villains, who seemed to be interesting enough, are heavily underused in the movie. More was to be expected from '80's comedy talents such as John Landis, Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase involved.Hightlights of the movie to me were the musical numbers, which were definitely the most fun sequences of the movie. The songs are from composer Randy Newman. The fine musical score itself is from composer Elmer Bernstein, who ironically also scored ""The Magnificent Seven"", on which this movie is obviously based.Sure the movie is still a fun one to watch, mainly thanks to the premise that is obviously based on the Akira Kurosawa movie ""Shichinin no samurai"" and it's western remake ""The Magnificent Seven"". Still the movie is a bit of a disappointment, considering the fact how well known it is over the world and how many later movies it inspired. Only really recommendable to the fans of '80's comedies.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Three Amigos!
13,view_and_review,Olé Three Amigos,7,21 August 2019,"Lucky Day (Steve Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chevy Chase), and Ned Nederlander (Martin Short) are three actors that are dubbed The Three Amigos. They have done a host of films with various titles all stemming from the word Amigos. Maybe because it's 1916, or maybe it's because she's never seen a movie before, or maybe it's because she was that desperate--in any case, when Carmen (Patrice Martinez) saw the Three Amigos on screen fighting crime she figured they could help her village drive out a bad bandito named El Guapo (Alfonso Arau). In a classic case of misunderstanding/misrepresenting, the Three Amigos were more than happy to go to Mexico to the little village of Santo Poco to ""put on a show."" Carmen was looking for The Magnificent Seven while the Three Amigos were more like the Three Blind Mice.The movie was silly enough to let it be. No need to analyze or dissect, just watch. There were some right funny scenes in there even if the entire movie didn't keep me laughing. Martin, Chase, and Short worked well as a trio. The outfits, the antics, and the story were all humorous.

14,Uriah43,A Plethora of Piñatas,7,11 August 2019,"This film begins with a notorious bandit named ""El Guapo"" (Alfonso Arau) terrorizing the small Mexican village of Santo Poco to the point that one particular woman by the name of ""Carmen"" (Patrice Martinez) decides to recruit men to help their cause at a larger town miles away. However, after finding nobody at the local cantina, she just happens to catch a silent film where three men known as the ""Three Amigos"" battle villains for a living each and every day. Not realizing that these men are just actors she sends a badly worded telegram to them asking for them to come to Santa Poca. Meanwhile, back in Hollywood, the Three Amigos have just been fired and evicted from their homes when the telegram arrives. Needless to say, in desperate need of employment they accept without hesitation and set out for Santo Poco. Of course, what neither ""Lucky Day"" (Steve Martin), ""Dusty Bottoms"" (Chevy Chase) nor ""Ned Nederlander"" (Martin Short) realize is that things are not what they seem and El Guapo is not necessarily one of their fans. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an imaginative comedy which makes good use of the comedic talent of everyone involved. I especially liked the part where El Guapo asks his lieutenant ""Jefe"" (Tony Plana) if he has a plethora of piñatas. Very funny indeed. Be that as it may, I thought that this was a pretty good film and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",Three Amigos!
15,HotToastyRag,A western version of 'Galaxy Quest',7,15 September 2019,"Three Amigos is the western-equivalent to the sci-fi parody Galaxy Quest, so if you liked the basic premise of that comedy, you'll get quite a few laughs out of this one. Three silent film actors-Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short-famous for playing Mexican heroes who rid towns of bandits accept what they think is an acting gig in a small Mexican village. What they don't know is the woman who wrote to them is a poor peasant who believes their film personas and the villains are really bad guys! They give a good show, circling around the bad guys' horses and firing off blank bullets with bravado, but they're in for a rude awakening when their opponents start firing with real bullets.This movie was far funnier than I thought it was going to be, so in case you think it's going to be stupid, give it a chance. It's definitely a spoof, making fun of campfire songs, bunking out under the stars, and stereotypical actors. Randy Newman wrote a few cute songs for the leads to sing, and Elmer Bernstein wrote a classic Hollywood theme to put you in the mood. There are some absolutely ridiculous jokes that you won't be able to help laughing at, so rent it when you're in the mood for something light and silly.",Three Amigos!
16,FlashCallahan,What is a plethora?....,6,10 July 2013,"When silent film stars Lucky Day, Dusty Bottoms and Ned Nederlander get fired, they take a job offer from Mexico, doing a show with El Guapo, supposedly the most famous actor there. Traveling there in expecting good money, they arrive only to learn that El Guapo is a cruel gang leader suppressing people. He abducts the mayor's daughter Carmen, in revenge for the people's cry for help. Now, all hopes of the village folks rest on the weak shoulders of three actors.....Martin was one the biggest comedy actors at the time of this film, as were Chase and Short, so they could do anything they wanted, and with Landis at the helm, that's exactly what they did.The film is way ahead of its time, and its almost Monty Python in its execution, meaning that many of the jokes would go over most people's heads. The first act is pretty slow, but its the build up to the main event.As soon as the Amigos enter Mexico, the film ups its game, and it turns into something not as generic as you would have been led to believe, eg. Its not a studio safe comedy.From singing bushes, invisible swordsman, and song and dance numbers, the movie is beyond bonkers and the three leads play it straight all the way.Its not your typical eighties comedy, hence the poor box office, but its a funny movie, a great companion piece to Tropic Thunder.",Three Amigos!
17,Aaron1375,Three comedic greats just do not make that great of a comedy movie.,6,10 December 2009,"This movie was not bad, but it could have been a bit better if they had tried to make one type of movie and stuck with it. The main problem with this movie is that at times it is a sentimental comedy, a total screwball comedy, and even a dark comedy with elements that were not comedy at all. Another problem is that at times the amigos played by comedy legends Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short do not even have the best lines in the movie. No the guy with some of the best lines in this film is the guy playing the bad guy EL Guapa. His best coming when he talks about the piñatas with his underling. The story at times gets a bit to much too as the Germans and such were a bit much. Still, the film is not a total loss as there are some funny things going on like the ride through the desert where they are in need of water and Chevy is gargling his seemingly do it just to be a jerk for no real reason. After that there is a scene that is one of the problems as their is a singing bush and this just does not seem to fit into the movie at all up to this point as it seems more fitting of an ""Airplane"" type movie or something that has not been as serious. Up to that point there are funny scenes that are a bit goofy, but nothing involving something that strange. If they could have been more consistent with the comedy and the way the movie flowed it might have been rather good, as it stands it is a not so bad movie that has some flashes of really good comedy.",Three Amigos!

The first half is quietly amusing, but kind of dull as you try to catch a grip with the curious happenings. I wasn't laughing and was starting to wonder what the whole hubbub was about (a respected friend of mine cited it as one of his favorite movies).Thankfully, the inventive second half ventures into laugh-out-loud territory starting with the iconic thirst-in-the-desert sequence. In addition, the Southwestern locations are spectacular and there are a few gorgeous Latino women.

I threw out lines in everyday speech, did the pelvic thrust salute, everything. And watching this as an adult, I found the lines coming back like no time had passed. The cast (across the board) is utterly perfect; these roles seem like they were written specifically for the three leads. And it's not just them; Alfonso Arau was born to play El Guapo. What he does with that role is golden. The script plays like a one-liner factory and several scenes are burned into my subconscious: the studio burglary, the singing bush, the campsite (""Goodnight, Ned!""), the canteen gag in the desert. ""¡Three Amigos!"" is hilarious to this day, and I don't think I'll ever tire of this movie. Total classic.8/10",Three Amigos!
21,StevePulaski,Meeeeediocre,4,29 January 2012,"The fish out of water premise rarely works, and here, it doesn't bring justice. Three Amigos is a dry, mediocre comedy that has one central joke, its more than capable leads in goofy, flamboyant outfits. The film somehow thinks the key to its success is dressing up the three main characters and hoping people will find the antics funny just because the characters look funny.I'm here to say it isn't, but of course I don't speak for everyone. The film is cheery, wholesome, but all too dry. There isn't enough desperation with the characters because much of the film they're spent with cocky, boastful attitudes and not realizing the trouble they've gotten themselves into. The story concerns ""The Three Amigos,"" a silent movie comedy team featuring Lucky Day (Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chase), and Ned Nederlander (Short). The three are famous for their plethora of films together and their utterly fashionable costumes. When they request a raise to continue doing films, they are sent packing and helpless.Before we're introduced to them we see Carmen (Martinez), the daughter of a village leader in Santo Poco, Mexico. When seeing a film with ""The Three Amigos"" she sends them a telegram believing they are real crime-fighters. So, immediately, The Amigos get a telegram and are off to save the town of Santo Poco. Or so they think. They believe it's a new job opportunity. In reality they have to try and run the legendary El Guapo (Arau) out of town.The premise sounds acceptable and fun, but the real tragedy is Three Amigos never fully knows what it wants to do. Is this satire, homage, or a shameless parody of the western genre? At times it seems to want to put a satirical spin on the western genre. For example, dressing in those utterly goofy costumes and trash-talking the opponents before opening fire. At other times it seems like it wants to pay a tongue in cheek homage to the cheesy style of some westerns. For example, the fake, Technicolor backgrounds like a cheap play. And if the writing had been polished a bit more involving more jokes instead of dead air, it could come off as a David Zucker, Leslie Nielsen type spoof.The talent here is taken for granted. Steve Martin gets a lot of screen time, it seems Chevy Chase is left with the recycled odds and ends from other successful screenplays as he fumbles in search of his own time, and Martin Short isn't given much to perform with either.Three Amigos has heart, but not comedy. It's one of those comedies that thinks it's being funny, when really, its one note joke has gotten old after a few minutes and we've been expecting some more cutting edge ones for a while. Randy Newman's musical numbers provide fun and smiles, Landis's directing is above average, yet you'd find superior in his other works like The Blues Brothers and National Lampoon's Animal House, but the dry setup, the under-used talents, and the flimsy script make Three Amigos a missed opportunity.Starring: Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, Martin Short, Patricia Martinez, and Alfonso Arau.

22,Smells_Like_Cheese,It was a fun movie to watch,6,5 August 2006,"On I love the 80's, they had mentioned Three Amigos! It looked pretty funny, I mean not to mention three of the funniest actors of our time are in it: Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Chevy Chase. They showed some pretty funny scenes in the show and I asked my mom about it, she said that it was a pretty funny movie. So, when I went to Hollywood Video, I figured to watch it and have a few good laughs when I got home.While Three Amigos has some pretty good laughs in it, I mean, I did laugh out loud a few times, it wasn't exactly what I expected. I think I was expecting too much with the film. But still I would recommend this for a fun film to watch if you have nothing better to do or are looking for a cute comedy.6/10",Three Amigos!
23,MovieAddict2016,"A bit underrated, but still not completely memorable...",7,2 April 2003,"¡Three Amigos!""¡Three Amigos!"" is a decent comedy ruined by some hit-and-misses and boring areas of the film. It's underrated a bit, but not by much.Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase star as film stars in the depression-era; their show is about three Amigos that fight bad guys down in Mexico. Eventually, due to low ratings of some sort, their show is canceled and they are all thrown out of Hollywood. But then, at the low-point of their life and career, they get an offer from a Mexican woman. She has seen their show and, thinking the show and the three men are genuine, wants them to come to Mexico to help rid her town of bad guys that come through every day to steal food, money, etc...Martin and co. think the woman is interested in making a television show, so they eagerly follow her down to Mexico to shoot the film. When they find, upon arrival, that it is NOT a film, but rather all very real. Now the gun-toting fakes will have to learn how to really aim a gun if they wish to succeed.""¡Three Amigos!"" has some pretty weak gags, and the film becomes tiresome after a while, especially some scenes around the town in Mexico. But the scenes like the one where Martin and co. sing ""My Little Buttercup"" in the local bar in town is unmissable.Steve Martin and Martin Short do well. Chase hinders their comedic timing a bit, but not by much. Overall they are a pretty good comic trio. I've always been a fan of Martin and Short, and...well...I liked Chase in ""Vacation,"" so I think they really make this movie. It would be no better than the dirt on my boots if not for the comedians in this film. Because of them--especially if you're fans of the comedians--this film is worth viewing. It's not particularly great, in fact, it's pretty average material, but Martin and co. make it worth seeing at least once. Definitely worth catching on TV, but don't go out of your way to see it.3/5 stars -John Ulmer",Three Amigos!

The plot is about the only normal thing in here.... they THINK they are just putting on a show. Their costumes are over the top. The songs they sing are silly. The real details of their mission are way over the top. Three city slickers taking on a huge gang of bandits, in a foreign country. And off they go! El Guapo is Alfonso Arau, who also directed Water for Chocolate! So the amigos put their hearts into entertaining, and think they are done... but no! Now they have to help the citizens of Santa Poco fight off the bad guys. Singing horses. Dancing owls and tortoises. Showing on the IFC channel. Directed by John Landis, who also did Blues Brothers and Coming to Amurrica. And clearly, he's not afraid to tackle sequels. Although maybe he should have been... sequels hardly ever live up to the originals.

25,lost-in-limbo,"""We have heard of you.""",6,29 September 2010,"A cosy Sunday afternoon matinée comedy feature by director John Landis sees a dependable comic trio (Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short) as silent movie stars that get mistaken for the real deal. Heroes on the silver screen, Lucky Day (Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chase) and Ned Nederlander (short), but in real life they're far from it. But they are given a chance, as after being fired by the studio they come to the aid of a small Mexican town Santa Poco who offered them 10,000 pesos to rid them of some vicious outlaws led by El Guapo. At first they think it's all a show, but they come to realise that these bandits are actually packing heat.As a kid it was one of my favourites and it's still a charming, silly (some downright silly --- singing tree & invisible swordsman) and harmless little slapstick comedy by Landis. Sticking out with its colourful back-lot sets, the concept is pretty much a bright and breezy send-up of ""The Magnificent Seven"" and going along way to making it all work is the crackling chemistry between the three leads and their perfect timing of the gags (numerous visual humour) or dialogues. While not always consistent and at times a little too constraint (strange for Landis), it remained amusing. Martin takes the lead with his eccentricity; Chase is dry and laid-back and Short is a nice balance in between. They looked great in their costumes --- with the bar scene being a pick. Alfonso Arau is good fun as the tyrant El Guapo. The support cast is a strong one too with the likes of Tony Plana, Patrice Martinez, Jon Lovitz, Joe Mantegna, Phil Hartman, Norbert Weisser and Brian Thompson. Elmer Bernstein chips in with a playful music score.Decent madcap fun.",Three Amigos!
26,inkblot11,Three cheers for the Amigos! Most excellent fun for those needing a good laugh,9,26 July 2008,"Lucky Day (Steve Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chevy Chase) and Ned Nederlander (Martin Short) are a silent movie trio known as the ""Three Amigos"". Wealthy landowners in Mexico, they travel around the country, in their spare moments, and rescue the downtrodden from the clutches of evil forces, like a triplets version of Zorro. Lucky is very adept at rope tricks and the others have their shooting skills, too. Their films are one heroic feat after another and very popular. But, in real life, these three actors are studio property and make very little money, depending on the movie moguls for food, lodging, and clothing. When Lucky decides that they should ask for a boost in salary, the unlucky threesome is stripped down to their underwear and tossed out of the set on their ears. But, wait. From Mexico comes a telegram requesting their services, as a small town is being menaced by El Guapo (Alfonso Arau) and company. However, due to the truncated nature of the telegram, the amigos believe that there are being asked only to star in a film and do their usual ""fake"" heroism. What a surprise when they land in Mexico and find out they are expected to save the village from a gang with loaded guns! With everyone in town pitting their entire existence on the amigos, can they deliver? This is a very funny film, with wonderful performances, writing and direction. Not only are the three stars terrific, but Arau is side-splittingly humorous, as are the other hispanic cast members. The scenery in Mexico is both lovely and barren while the costuming is first rate, too. As a co-writer, Martin deserves much praise, also, for there are many memorable lines and laugh-out-loud episodes. From Dusty requesting something other than ""Mexican"" food from his hosts to an accidental shooting of the ""invisible horseman"" and more, most viewers will be transported far away from life's daily routine with any showing. So, three cheers for the Amigos and get ready to laugh up a storm when you get this one into the DVD player.",Three Amigos!
27,leplatypus,Not the crap I think it was (tv),7,5 September 2012,"When you see those three buddies in their ridiculous costumes, you expect wisely a poor movie. But as those three amigos were among the best funny guys in the eighties and Landis isn't a baby with a camera, surely, all those great names imply that something good was due to come. And it's true: the comedy ingredients here were able to make me support the dust, the rust, the hot sun, the horses, the gunfight, the saloon, the campfire, the final attack and everything else that makes a western, a genre that i usually dislike.The script is written with intelligence as all the funny moments are not wasted but helps to build a real progression in the drama. The characters are well done: the amigos work like a team, all the others are native, the bad guys having ugly faces and the peasants pretty and kind. If all the clichés of western are indeed twisted in a ridiculous way, the huge regret comes from that the fabulous cast isn't more explosive. In other words, the movie is funny but not hilarious. For whatever reasons, adding Chevy plus Martin plus Steve plus Landis doesn't add the laughs: It's a bit like nobody dare to do something too much personal. However, this kind of humor even shy is still better than the actual comedies (see ""Fockers"" for example).",Three Amigos!
28,Anonymous_Maxine,"Classic comedy, but not for all tastes.",7,5 February 2003,"The Three Amigos is one of those movies that can be hugely entertaining and amusing but only if you keep in mind that it is not a serious film. Chevy Chase, Martin Short, and Steve Martin, some of the funniest men ever to work in comedy, all team up here as The Three Amigos, a group of out of work actors in early Hollywood cinema. The unfortunate thing is that this is not a movie that is greater than the sum of its parts, since I would expect more from actors with the caliber of Martin, Chase, and Short, even working individually, but even the fact that they are all not used to their full potential is not enough to bring down the rest of the comedy here.The story involves the three out of work silent film actors, who suddenly find themselves unemployed and broke when they receive a telegram from a small village in Mexico desperately asking their assistance. I liked how clever the ploy was where the woman who sent the message was so poor that she could not afford enough words to make her desires clear, so the Amigos read the message and think that they are about to be paid a fortune just to make an appearance in this village. Naturally they jump at the chance since they have nothing better to do.Most of the rest of the film deals with their adventures in this village, which they are supposed to be protecting from an evil villain but do not realize that this is real life until one of them gets shot. You would think that they would have caught on sooner, but on the other hand, they DID happen to stumble into the only tiny village in Mexico where no one speaks Spanish, so it's not hard to understand why they thought the whole thing was a set up. If I went to Mexico and was walking around a dusty village with nothing but endless desert on every side and every single person was speaking only English, I would also wonder what movie set I had just wandered onto. There is some interesting biblical content, which is made interesting really only because of the great satire. As the Amigos are walking through the valley in the shadow of death, they come upon not the talking bush or the burning bush, but the SINGING bush, and can't seem to get it to stop singing long enough to answer their question. `Will you please stop singing and tell us if you are the singing bush!' There's a hilarious sequence right after this about the invisible horseman, and just before was one of my favorite moments in the entire film, when Chase attempts to get off his horse but only succeeds in getting onto the horse next to him facing backwards and seems to be unsure about what just happened. A lot of this movie is made up of funny skits which are strung along a thin and less than convincing clothesline of a plot, but even though the plot itself is not very believable the movie is still very entertaining. There are a lot of scenes that seem to go too far or just don't really seem to fit with the rest of the film (such as the campfire scene where all the animals join in to the campfire singing), but for the most part the comedy is very good and there are a lot of memorable scenes (the canteen scene in the desert for example, is one to remember!). Not a film that was meant to win any Oscars, but there is definitely some great comic entertainment to be had with  The Three Amigos.",Three Amigos!

31,PWNYCNY,Any movie with a character named Dusty Bottoms has to be funny.,10,9 March 2009,"There are few if any movies more hilarious than Three Amigos. In this wild and goofy movie, Martin Short, Steve Martin and Chevy Chase are at their comical best. They are assisted by an outstanding supporting cast, including Alphonso Arau, whose portrayal of the villain ""El Guapo"" is absolutely hilarious. The movie is essentially a spoof on actors who play actions heroes, mere figments of others' imaginations, yet perceived by the public as being real. What happens when the actors are forced to be the actual characters that they play? The results in this movie are hilarious as the three amigos are confronted with real-life bad guys who themselves are spoofs of Hollywood bad guys. All in all, this is a wonderfully amusing movie. After all, what would you expect from a movie in which Chevy Chase plays a character named Dusty Bottoms?This is one of the funniest and cleverest movies Hollywood has ever made. Not only are the three main characters hilarious, the bad guys are hilarious too, which makes the movie even more ... hilarious. The story is a spoof on the phoniness of Hollywood movies and how easily people can mistake what is shown on the screen for reality. Given the nature of cinema, this is all too understandable. The heroes and villains projected on the screen are but the products of others' imaginations, yet they are presented in such a clever manner that audience comes to believe that those characters are real or at least wish that they were. Martin Short, Steve Matin and Chevy Chase are at their comical best as three bungling actors who find themselves having to play their roles for real. Although some of the humor may seem corny and contrived, it is the very corniness of the humor that makes this movie so laughable. The name of Mr. Martin's character, Dusty Bottoms, is in itself goofy. What would YOU think of anyone with a name Dusty Bottoms",Three Amigos!

Rather than turn tail they decide to help the locals defeat the raiders in true Magnificent Seven style. Dressed as three Duncan Renaldo (Cisco Kid, remember?) impersonators SNL cutups Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase are anything but funny in this execrable comedy of forced hot air. Under the over the top self indulgent direction of John Lands the bits by the boys land with a thud as they do the same zany mugging that made them TV stars. Short and Martin do their funny face contortions while Chase offers little more than a series of smug and clueless expressions. They the lack the chemistry of a team such as The Three Stooges as they wander off to do their tepid sometimes grating thing that Landis usually allows to run too long in hopes of squeezing some laughter out of the slapstick. In such moments it becomes painfully aware they even lack the sophistication of the Stooges.On paper the moguls must have loved the idea of teaming Animal House director Landis with the three comedians at the height of their popularity, especially with Martin penning the script. Instead it exposes their incompetence in the process as well as the dearth of their talent. Comedy films are not five minute SNL skits and in The Three Amigos the boys wear out fast while Landis' ham fisted style seals the deal. Where's Moe when you need him?",Three Amigos!

In some respects it does work; the set up to the story is good as are the evil Mexican bandits (with the leader clearly being an Eli Wallach type), but sadly this western spoof doesn't work consistently enough....Where it doesn't consistently work is in the amount of laughs that the film throws up; it is fitfully amusing in areas, but not really as a whole. The film has a slapstick and silly feel to it (which sometimes works) when for example there is a good visual gag or examples of amusing dialogue, but far too often there are stretches in this film where neither element exists and you're left with some sequences that aren't that funny - some of the song and dance numbers don't really work and the camp-fire scene produces rather mixed results in the comedy stakes.Where the film works slightly better is in the occasional way that it shows the flaws with our protagonists; all of them are idiots, but in different ways; I did like the way that Steve Martin's character is called Lucky Day yet more often than not, it was him that messed everything up for his Amigos - clearly an intentional irony exists with his character. Likewise, the same exists with the other 2 Amigos with Chevy Chase being notably dim-witted; the chemistry between all 3 leads is what really keeps this picture above the water and as I said despite there being a distinct unevenness with the writing and directing it does kind of work from time to time.Whilst for me, this film was OK and quite funny at times, it is very uneven and it never works as well as it should do. Clearly, it is intended as a parody of The Magnificent Seven, but sadly it is never as good as the material that it is parodying and for that reason it can only be seen as something as a failure (despite it having some amusing moments).",Three Amigos!

The characters are so funny, and the performances of the lead trio are spectacular. I also like the setup of the comedic sequences. The series of scenes in the bar is a superb example of how to setup a joke, and keep drawing laughs from it. They get a bit fantastical with the story at one point. I think it works because of how silly the premise is, but I could see others taking issue with the singing bush and invisible horseman section of the movie. There are a couple of divine songs in the film that feel like they could have come from a more sincere movie of this type. They have great catchy tunes that I find myself humming for hours after watching. I can't say enough to properly praise Three Amigos, it's a masterpiece",Three Amigos!

Well,those inspired gags(physical AND verbal)coupled with a fitfully funny musical number or two(co-composed by none other than super prolific composer RAndy NEwman,underscored by another legend:Elmer BErnstein)make for a gloriously fun romp.

Great costumes,sets and a inspired photography allows for a story and plotting that might catch a few discerning eyes(i.e. painted,fake sky one scene,natural,full on-location landscape;some plot twists that seem a more than a little contrived and which I won't say so as to let any spoilers go)to be mostly forgivable.I first caught this movie when it was first released over twenty years ago in the theater,back when I mostly only went to comedies starring familiar faces or sort of brainless actioners,and I probably would've caught ANYTHING with Martin,Chase or Short,so I feel quite fortunate as well as edified that I caught this when it was a fresh release and it was as good as advertised.

43,Beta_Gallinger,"Not a consistently hilarious western spoof, but still an overall good one",7,24 April 2010,"This is a western spoof starring Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short. It was released the year I was born, 1986, but I knew nothing about it until March 2007. I watched it for the first time that month, just before I first watched ""Galaxy Quest"", which is like a sci-fi version of this film. Before seeing ""¡Three Amigos!"", I had looked at its IMDb rating, which didn't suggest it was that great, but it wasn't enough for me to expect a horrible comedy. So, when I first saw the polarizing western comedy, it didn't surprise me when it turned out to be far from the most consistently funny comedy I've ever seen, but I still thought it was pretty good, even though I could only remember parts of it. A second viewing three years later was much like my first.In 1916, the residents of a Mexican village called Santa Poco have become victims of an outlaw named El Guapo and his gang! A village resident named Carmen goes searching for help, and during her search, she sees a film starring the Three Amigos (Lucky Day, Dusty Bottoms and Ned Nederlander) playing in a church. She sees what they do in this film and thinks they would be able to fight off the intruders, so she has a letter sent to them. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, the three renowned silent movie stars are fired, and they lose their studio lot homes and clothing. They then get the letter from Carmen, which they think is an offer for them to come to Santa Poco and put on a show for 100,000 pesos, and they also think El Guapo is an actor who will be playing the antagonist! So, they steal back their movie clothing and set out to Mexico to take this job offer, totally unaware of the fact that they will be doing it for real this time! I remember the beginning of this film from both viewings, with the Three Amigos riding horses and singing ""The Ballad of the Three Amigos"" (a song written by Randy Newman), featuring a very long falsetto note, which I found funny both times. After this part, it doesn't stay the same, as the film is no more than mildly amusing for a while, and some of the gags are perhaps a little TOO silly. However, there are eventually more really funny parts, such as the German thug in the saloon, the Three Amigos coming in after him and singing ""My Little Buttercup"" (also written by Newman) to the frightened men inside who think they are friends of the German, and the actors saying their lines to the village intruders! There are also some highlights later in the film, such as the protagonists riding through the desert, with Lucky and Ned out of water, watching Dusty waste his! Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short all show their talents in this film, and so do other cast members, such as Alfonso Arau as El Guapo and Kai Wulff as German. Some of these supporting characters have some really funny lines. In addition to often being funny, sometimes very much so and sometimes just a little, ""¡Three Amigos!"" can be exciting with the action and adventure.When I first saw this 1986 comedy, I had never seen ""Blazing Saddles"", a much more popular western spoof from 1974. I didn't see that one until January this year, and I think I found it funnier than ""¡Three Amigos!"" overall, like probably most people who have seen both movies (though I didn't find it as funny as many others clearly have through the decades), but it didn't seem to affect my opinion on this later film of the same genre. Unlike some viewers, I can't exactly call this particular western spoof an underrated gem or something to that effect, but overall, I would say it is a reasonably funny and often exciting adventure, with a talented cast to help out. Randy Newman also did a good job writing the songs (""The Ballad of the Three Amigos"", ""My Little Buttercup"", and ""Blue Shadows""). If you're a fan of the three comedians who play the starring roles here, you like western movies, and you want a laugh, you COULD still find this flick disappointing, but it's probably still worth a try.",Three Amigos!

47,Igenlode Wordsmith,I know who Dorothy Gish is,5,1 August 2006,"This could have been good -- should have been good -- but... wasn't.Aimed at a particular type of humour, I think, and it's not mine. I first heard of this film while eulogising ""Galaxy Quest"", and it's perfectly true: ""Three Amigos"" did do the same idea first. Unfortunately the result for me isn't nearly so funny, because in this case the film doesn't even make a gesture at taking itself seriously -- ""Galaxy Quest"" manages to have its cake and eat it by being both a spoof of pulp SF and an exciting pulp SF adventure in its own right, but ""Three Amigos"" doesn't attempt to be internally consistent. A character gets shot in one scene and proceeds to do a song-and-dance routine a couple of minutes later without so much as a wince, for example: a laugh could equally well have been got by having him attempt energetic gestures without thinking and so break off hopping around in agony (I wouldn't have found that terribly funny myself, but it would have been on a level with the comedy in the rest of the film), but that would have involved a petty-minded concern for continuity that the writers of this script clearly shrug aside.Basically, I found the level of humour a bit puerile; if that makes me a snob, then so be it. (Since I didn't like ""Blazing Saddles"" either, I'm beyond the pale already!) There's a good deal of comic potential, but a lot of it gets wasted: the cantina scene, as has been noted, is probably the best, being set up neatly and capped with a twist at the end. Much of the film, though, came across as a series of improvised skits that needed editing by a less indulgent hand, and it's hard for me to like a picture where I find the characters so unsympathetic: I don't find stupidity inherently endearing.It's unfair to criticise a spoof for misrepresenting its source material (and somebody did a good research job in mocking-up those title cards), but a song-and-dance trio really aren't the most likely stars of *silent* Westerns (singing cowboy films, for obvious reasons, didn't come in for another twenty years), and the characters in the 'film within a film' that Carmen sees aren't making even the slightest attempt at silent film style acting: they're simply reciting lines rather pointlessly at the screen and then having a caption pop up to explain what they said... But then I have a problem. I actually know who Dorothy Gish is :-) I still think the basic idea is a good one, but I don't think this treatment is a particularly funny result. It does have its entertaining moments, but they're surrounded by an awful lot of flat jokes, and I prefer my comedies to have some internal logic, however topsy-turvy their world: where are the three actors riding off to in the finale, for example? They've already explained that they've got nothing and nowhere to go back to, and (unlike for the characters in ""Galaxy Quest"") nothing has happened to change that. I know you're very clearly not supposed to worry about that sort of minor detail, but in the sort of comedy I'm used to, the finale is the place to tie up loose ends -- not create new ones...It would be interesting to see what the Monty Python team, Ealing Studios, Waner Brothers circa 1935, or Buster Keaton, respectively, could have made of this same material. A lot of potentially very different films could have been based around the original concept, and sadly most of them would probably have suited my taste better than this particular one. I did laugh in places, but overall I found the humour was outweighed by the general frustration factor.",Three Amigos!
48,Son_of_Mansfield,Those Darn Amigos!,5,4 June 2005,"Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Chevy Chase are THE THREE AMIGOS!(cue the Amigo salute, which is a cross between the Macarana and a hernia exam.) This is an funny, but uneven spoof of old westerns, especially The Magnificent Seven(Seven Samurai). The song and dance scenes are the highlights. Martin, Chase, and Short siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing The Ballad of The Three Amigos, Martin and Short, shaking it fast, do a lover's number with Chase on piano, and Martin, Chase, and Short sing one in the obviously fake night trail. Also, watching the three try to scare of bandits by spouting silly dialogue and riding in slaloms is very amusing. The music by Randy Newman(songs) and Elmer ""The Magnificent Seven"" Berstein(score) add a western feel to the movie. The supporting cast of Patrice Martinez(Beetle Juice), Kai Wulff(MacGuyver), Alfonso Arau(The Wild Bunch, Romancing The Stone), Tony Plana(An Officer and a Gentleman, Monk), and Brian Thompson(The Terminator, Buffy The Vampire Slayer) add value as well as cameos by Joe Mantegna, Jon Lovitz, and Phil Hartman. The movie fails by giving us a village with few people to care about, sometimes jarring scene transitions, overused jokes, and another ""hey, I am an idiot"" performance from Chevy Chase. Landis tries too hard to stick to the plot of The Magnificent Seven when he should have let the amigos run wild and the movie buckles whenever there is an action scene. This is still a pleasant distraction for fans of it's three leads.P.S. My cousin and I will always be THE TWO AMIGOS!",Three Amigos!
49,Bogmeister,"Wherever There is Injustice, You Will Find Three Buffoons",7,19 April 2006,"By rights, judging by appearance, this comedy should have rated 9 or 10 stars with most viewers. In the mid-eighties, both Martin & Chase were at the top of their field & game, and Short was the new hot kid on the block. It seemed a 'no chance to lose' scenario. This is not a worthless comedy, but the first half-hour is especially lame, almost amateur hour. Rather than getting caught up in the tribulations of these 3 idiotic western/comedic actors of the silent era, you're actually embarrassed to be watching them as they strain to squeeze a few laughs from a clichéd plot. Much of the blame for the beginning can be laid with director Landis, who was unable to utilize their prodigious talents for some reason, indulging in cringe-inducing slapstick. Then, slowly & gradually, the pace and the laughs pick up, until we're all enjoying the three masters of comedy at their best moments. They all have the physicality down pat, emphasizing an almost effeminate way of moving when up against real cowboys or bandits (the 3 are really naive pansy actors, after all).Besides the obvious parallels to The Three Musketeers tale, this is mainly a parody of ""The Magnificent Seven"" storyline (in this case, with only 3 heroes, rather than 7). Once down in Mexico, running about in the desert or crooning with the wildlife, the 3 stars make the most of it. Some of the scenes turn out to be classic Martin, especially when he informs his 2 compadres that their make-believe show is suddenly 'real' and the whole magic chant stuff involving the invisible swordsman (whacky stuff, but kind of inspired). It's also interesting to watch Martin up against the more clownish and more stupid Chase in this pic. As said, they were both tops in comedy during those days, but Martin seems to dominate in the first half (maybe 'cause he was also co-writer); then Chase sort of comes into his own towards the last third. Short manages to outshine both of them a couple of times when it involves physical mannerisms (check out his horse-riding,gun-playing style). This also reminded me of ""The Wild Bunch"" in some scenes, what with German arms dealers interacting with the Mexican bandit gang. It's worth a 2nd viewing just to catch a few of the better amusing scenes again, which also means it's an uneven product taken all together.",Three Amigos!

It's okay funny overall, definitely enjoyable. There are peaks, but no low drops. It remains fine all along.The premise is pretty funny in itself, and is really a difficult effort to maintain: how are the movie-creators going to have those lead characters, three idiot loser actors, actually save the day ?

51,elicopperman,Hit or Miss Cult Classic Comic Western,5,8 June 2021,"Looking back at cult classic comedies from the 1980s, there are some moves that end up becoming more interesting than legitimately funny flicks. In the case of Three Amigos, the brainchild of Steve Martin and one of the directorial efforts of filmmaker John Landis, the film was not very well received when it initially came out in 1986, but later grew a cult following for the iconic performances of Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short (a then newcomer to cinema). Now after 35 years of cult status, the film might be seen as an underrated and misunderstood gem to some, but for others, it might also not be as strong as they perceive.Set in Mexico in 1916, three silent film Hollywood stars known as the Three Amigos are mistaken for real heroes by the suffering village of Santo Poco. Despite their facade identities, they must find a way to live up to their reputation and stop the malevolent bandit El Guapo. Pretty standard premise for a movie in general, but given the absurdity in the concept alone, the film does have the right amount of potential to make the plot rather wacky in execution. Steve Martin himself conceived the idea for SNL producer Lorne Michaels to co-write the movie with him, and the film does have some absurd laugh out loud moments that do feel like an old timey cartoony western. Also, in addition to having distinctive personalities, Martin, Chase and Short play off one another as the amigos so well that the trio really do end up feeling like family in a way. Their charisma, energy and sense of humor allows for even presumably darker scenes in the film to feel funnier had they not done their jobs so well. It really shows how much one whole comedic trio can still make newer decades chuckle quite successfully.Unfortunately, not even the strongest efforts from the main actors and the comedic highlights can save the movie's weak story. Due to having a very routine storyline where the whole plot can be figured out beat by beat, it ends up making the experience rather dull and predictable. It doesn't help that most of the humor throughout the movie comes off rather stiff and even almost nonexistent, as if the filmmakers wanted to rely on the stars to do the job for them in entertaining the viewers. Also, the tone often jumps all over the place from relatively serious to full on goofy, especially with a very catchy albeit pointless campfire song sequence and other bizarre plot points that are forgotten about once they're done being shown. Many scenes also feel oddly edited out, with several scenes jumping from one to another without feeling properly cohesive. This was apparently because the studio behind the film had heavily trimmed out director John Landis' final cut due to his absence in the editing stage. It shows that too many cooks ain't always a good idea to solve a puzzle.However, even with those flaws, that's not to outright say this is an overall bad movie, as it at least has its heart in the right place. While the film doesn't seem to know whether to be a straight up wacky cartoon movie or a more straightforward Hollywood western comedy, its loving tribute to retro silent filmmaking is quite admirable in its own right. With the main trio being washed up actors that are mistaken for gunfighting heroes, their contrast between the glamorous Hollywood and rough & tough outskirts of Mexico end up developing them quite well into fully realized characters. In addition, the occasional musical numbers from co-writer Randy Newman add a nice flavor to the film's love for old Hollywood and vaudeville, especially the Amigos Ballad and My Little Buttercup. Besides, it's nice to have a rather ruthless villain with at least some hint of sardonicism in a movie that just needs more looniness to stand out from the crowd, and that goes to El Guapo. So it is fascinating when other aspects surrounding a motion picture can make it up more than the main attraction.So despite its full potential not being met that well in the execution, Three Amigos is still a good natured western romp that only gets by its paper thin premise with wonderful leading roles and some occasional moments of hysteria. While it might not rank on anyone's top 10 favorite comedies of all time list, there's just enough charm here and there to make the viewing experience tolerable to say the least. My best recommendation would be to only watch it if you're a die hard comedy movie buff or really into Steve Martin's filmography. The people behind this flick have certainly done better, but this should be worth at least one go.",Three Amigos!

Martin wears Chaplin's derby and Chase wears Keaton's boater...otherwise, it contains every Western cliché, and everyone's acutely aware of it.These guys really could've done something smart here. Look at what you have: an audience believing the movie icons are real heroes, and the actors believing the real world is a movie set.The problem is that Martin and Michaels are unable to squeeze very much out of the skits. It's on fumes well before halfway through.And Landis' poor editing just makes it worse. This stuff is paper thin, but he has to stretch every cut to make the end result feature length, thinking the comic presences will be enough. Compare this to the smart editing of ""Blues Brothers"" or ""Spies Like Us"" and it's painfully clear.Martin and Chase are both comedians who have to be in the right environment: for Martin, movies about movies (""L.A. Story"", ""Bowfinger""). Chase can't play an outright imbecile, he has to do layered performances(""Fletch"") or play it not-as-smart-as-he-thinks-he-is (""Funny Farm"").",Three Amigos!

Now I may be in the minority, but I like Chevy Chase, his slapstick is good in the movie but close to being as good as in ""Vacation"". Steve Martin is the writer and producer of the movie, and he didn't give himself as many funny lines as other 2 stars in the movie.Martin Short is the one who is out of place, he is likable, but he never really established himself as a good movie comedian.

When it comes to humor and an interesting plot, this lacked it for me.Perhaps the best part are the comedic lines, most notably ""You son of a motherless goat!"" , and the overall plot of 3 actors thinking they are in a movie when they are really under criminal attack is genius.Though not every moment stuck with me, I still recommend this movie.

Randy Newman co-wrote this and indeed the songs used in the movie are funny. My favorite scene is the silly sing around the campfire scene. I have to admit that one of the reasons why I enjoy this movie is that it was filmed at Old Tucson studios, and I love seeing the Tucson mountains and beautiful blue sky (and some monsoon clouds as well). Chevy Chase isn't given much to do, sadly enough, but you can tell that the 3 leads are friends and that they had fun making the movie, regardless of the outcome.

59,jbartelone,I Found Myself Sleeping and Fast-Forwarding Through This,2,7 December 2008,"The Three Amigos is little more than a slapstick comic farce featuring, Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short who portray silent film cowboys. After losing their jobs by insulting their producer, they set out to Mexico and are initially believed that they are putting on a show for the locals. The only problem is, they are now involved with the real thing. The movie shows them trying to assimilate to the culture and people of Mexico, looking for adventure in the country, and eventually discovering that they can ride together to ""save the bad guys"" in a series of slapstick, Three Stooges, type of comic gags and stunts.I have never cared for Martin Short. However, the talents of Steve Martin and Chevy Chase are shamefully thrown away in this film. I kept waiting and waiting for something memorable to happen. Meanwhile, the film gets sillier and sillier, rapidly descending into farce. The script is strained, and the comedy is forced, where you might get a ""ha-ha"" reaction from an audience 8 years old or less. But I would rather see Steve and Chevy in the great films that made them legends, such as Steve Martin's ""Navin Johnson"" in ""The Jerk"" or Chevy Chase, as ""Clark W. Griswald"" in the ""Vacation"" movies. As for Martin Short, I have no interest in seeing him.The writing in this film appears to imply that if these three actors can do good to great comedy on their own, let's put them together and we'll have a classic film. NOTHING could be farther from the truth! The stunts and gags are straight out of ""Gilligan's Island"" fare.

64,jerome_horwitz,We are the Three Amigos! arrriba aaahhaaaa!,8,4 March 2005,"This movie is really an interesting comedy film. It's not necessarily the story or production values. More the combination of having super star comedian's Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short share the silver screen in one film. This was the first and last film with this particular cast of talented comedians.The Three Amigos is about three early film heroes with funny names who lose their favor with the film studio they work for. Afterwards, these three doofuses in real life, mistakenly except a show appearance in Mexico. Of course the Amigos have no idea their soon to be ""infamous"" co-star is actually a real villain, and the show is a real life struggle with a group of bandits. It's a real showdown.By the end of the film, the Amigos become the film stars they were, but in real life. There are trials and difficulties they must face along the way, providing for some interesting and varying situations. There is simple comedy throughout the film, from beginning to ending. This movie will not challenge you to think, but it will appeal to your funny bone. Really intellectual comedy would not have fit into this film, giving the sort of thick headed nature of the main characters.Timing of these comedy masters is excellent, which makes the movie appealing and entertaining and that is why the film is successful. Above all, that is what is so great about this film. It's three stars giving their best, plus a great supporting cast of well-known and not so well-known actors and actresses.Technically this film is put together pretty well. You'll appreciate varying camera angles, nice sets, and colorful outdoor scenery. Production values are at least average, and there's some nice attention to detail. You will notice for example many of the bandidos have bad teeth. Something classic western movies are often knocked for, but this movie takes into account.Over all for most watching this film should be an enjoyable for those with average sense of humor.

However, the stooges (and hey, there's three of them!) mistake the letter to mean that they are being asked to act in a play sort of a thing. They then go and find out what's going on.

One of the areas in which John Landis and crew excelled was the cinematography. The locations shooting as well as the stuff filmed on the soundstage are colorful, perfectly lit and framed and are basically eye candy. Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack is perfect in every way. Randy Newman's songs are fabulous (and his singing as the 'singing bush' is hilarious). The absolute best part of the movie is the ""Blue Shadows"" sequence, featuring Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short, singing a western ballad written by Randy Newman while surrounded by a campfire, singing horses (with mouth movements hand-animated that are better than much of today's CGI), lots of animatronics critters listening in and probably the most beautiful sunset ever filmed (indoors, on a soundstage I might add). I could never tire of that song or the segment. Otherwise, there are much better movies with Chase, Short and Martin (although not together). Either you love this film or you don't. I fall in the 'love' category, but it's still not a great movie. The predictable plot and sometimes repetitive slapstick can be grating on the nerves at times.

77,spear88,Steve Martin shines bright but Martin Short dimly flickers,6,30 September 2019,"The three main stars here; Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short all perform at different levels and it's this inconsistency that drags the overall quality of the movie down a mark or two. Steve Martin is brilliant, Chevy Chase is simply ok but Martin Short is really poor and most of his comedic lines really fall flat. Steve Martin is one of those performers that even with the slightest change of facial expression can make you laugh and the majority of the laughs thorughout Three Amigos cam from him. Today's comedy is more about vulgarity , which I personally don't mind either, but I will always be impressed with the comedy giants of yesteryear such as Steve Martin and Chevy Chase who can make the audience belly laugh without the heavy reliance on strong language and obscenities. The story here is quite predictable but what was I to expect from a silly eighties comedy and while some of the comedy is really smart and witty, unfortunately some elements of the comedy haven't aged well and don't transfer into the 21st century all that well.",Three Amigos!

79,tvsterling,My Theory of Why People Don't Like It,10,4 June 2006,"I have come to believe that many people put down this obvious masterpiece because it makes them uncomfortable. Like every other part of the film this is on several levels. First, Steve Martin's humor (he is billed as head writer) is difficult for many people. People who are uptight have trouble with his 'Jerk' humor; much like the other great jerk, Jerry Lewis. Second, the film deliberately breaks the invisible barrier between 'them' on the stage or in the movie & us; the watchers. Things like switching to the sound stage hokey set for the camp scene are calculated to rub a sore spot on those who must have total continuity of style & no bending of the illusion of a real life experience. We call these people unsophisticated (there are other less kind terms). All these 'change-ups' in style, back references to the fact that this is only a movie & bending of the rules of continuity/ suspension of dis-belief are tailor made to get under the skin of those who cannot separate themselves from the work itself. I imagine that the 'true believers' out there find the film extremely uncomfortable to watch.The humor in the film is amazingly plentiful & runs the gamut from boffo belly laugh physical humor thru delicious sexy lines to very sophisticated word plays. I can't off hand think of another film that displays this remarkable range. In keeping with the 'change-up' I was talking about there are many heartfelt, even tender, references to early film-making & Hollywood. There are many humanity type touches in little bits between the players all of whom, right down to the least bit actor are excellent & perfectly cast. I believe that there was competition & inspiration going on between the three comedy leads & this illuminated the rest of the cast & inspired them to greater heights too. If I could belabor a couple of great truths illustrated by the film. I specially liked the part where the Amigos (admitted devout cowards) rally the townspeople to defeat El Guapo. It's a simple thing but true throughout history; you have to stand together & conquer your fear to free yourselves from oppression. One of America's great core principles. Also what do you think of the naive belief of the heroine in the Amigos. Does she have the ultimate problem with suspension of dis-belief or does she see something no one else does? Not a few men have reached their fullest potential because a good woman believed in them.Finally , Steve Martin stands out as the prime moving force in the film. My personal belief is that the film is his masterpiece. I firmly believe too that the film will stand the test of time.",Three Amigos!

It's not their best work, but when you look at the performances combined, it's pretty cool. No Oscars here, but as comedians, the actors should be proud.Landis, while not always hitting home-runs, is a pretty reliable director. I've enjoyed most of his films to one degree or another. He's just screwing around here, but that doesn't mean he wasn't an active director. I'm sure his sense of humor helped many of the jokes work.",Three Amigos!
82,yourbigpalal83,The secrete love child of monthy python and Mel brooks.,9,3 April 2006,"If monthy python and mel brooks made a movie child together, chances are, the three amigos would be the bastard offspring.The three amigos is one of those film's who captures the style and humor of mel brooks, and the silliness of monthy python, yet, nether were involved in the making of this film.With 3 comic gems of the 80's (unfortuntley they cant be called that today), Steve Martin, Chevey Chase, and Martin Short star as a group of out of work silent film stars, who are mistaken by a small Mexican village for heros because thats who they play on the silver screen. When they head down to Mexico to star with the ""In famous"" El Guapo, they think its all a show, yet find out that they are in way over there heads. What follows is a classic, non stop laugh riot.The film works because it never take's itself too seriously, much like mel brooks films (like blazing saddles) and interjects monthy python in it as well, yet, none of the jokes seems like a rip off of either films.As for the acting, Steve, Chevy and Martin are in top form. Steve Martain plays the groups unofficial leader lucky day, were Chevy Chase is the group's dim wit, Dusty Bottoms, and the then young Steve Martin as Ned Nederlander, the little brother of the group and each one plays off each other well. There's no real comic star here, since all 3 work perfectly together.As for the villain, Alfonso Arau plays the Infamous El Guapo, with just the right amount of evilness and humor. With his evil head hanco Jefe, the two come off like an Mexican version of Mr Burns and Smithers from the simpsons.Overall, this is a must see film if your in the mood for a good laugh. What is unfortunate, is that the current incarnations of this film on DVD are bare bones, meaning little if any extra features. We don't get any deleted scenes, documentaries, or any other nifty features, just the movie. But, for 10 dollars in your local circuit city's bargen bin (probley less) its a steal.",Three Amigos!
83,billyweeds,An okay movie with one great scene,7,21 July 2003,"This comedy is uneven, to put it mildly, and only mediocre on balance.

But, with Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short in the cast, you can bet there'll be some memorable scenes.  The trio are silent film stars, who are fired and, they are recruited to get rid of ""El Guapo"", who is a vigilante in a small town. They think it is all an act, but the town believes that they are really heroes (I mean, who wouldn't?  They do heroic stuff on the screen!!) Throughout the film, you get musical acts, comedy, drama, etc, and the final product keeps you laughing.  Maybe it isn't the BEST movie, but definitely a must-see.

Since this movie has Steve Martin in it, there are times where you laugh so hard that your sides ache.  It also has a great blend of comedic sight gags, dialogue and yes, even the cheesy stuff is funny.  Plus, the musical numbers are classic; ""My Little Buttercup"" and the song around the campfire (""Goodnight, Ned"") are awesome.  Three Amigos! is a great comedy, highly recommended for anyone who likes to have a good laugh involving three funny film stars named Chevy Chase (well, he used to be funny), Martin Short and Steve Martin.",Three Amigos!
86,Movie-Timer,Don't be fooled by its rating,8,14 January 2013,"From the three buffoonic Amigos to el Guapo and his sweater-knitting henchmen, this farcical comedy-western is a mindless journey of snickers and chuckles. Make no mistake, this movie IS stupid -- on purpose. The singing bush?...the Invisible Swordsman?...campfire-singing animals?...please. But the comedic brilliance of Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short sells even the silliest shtick.On the other hand, there are some classic pieces and one-liners in here that demonstrate the film's writing depth, which shouldn't be overlooked, including the surprisingly deep relationship between el Guapo (Alfonso Arau) and his right-hand-man, Jefe (Tony Plana).All in all, you don't really watch this to digest a movie and follow the evolution of characters, you watch it in chunks as skit after skit that affords endless enjoyment if you allow it.So give it a go and have fun...you might be surprised.",Three Amigos!

Silly in places, but never too much, some actually quite fun set pieces, and personally (despite so many poor reviews) I think almost every gag lands perfectly for me.

89,ajudki20,Well Known 'Inane Comedy',4,22 April 2012,"Three Amigos is a well known example of what I call 'inane comedy'. The jokes are silly and unfocused, while the film's comedy strategy and type seems uncertain. It is as thought the writers and comedian-stars weren't really quite sure what to do once the talent was assembled and threw together the first concept that came to mind, and the first comedy ideas they could conjure up to fit into the basic premise of the film.The makings of a decent comedy are here: We have three comedian actors, a workable concept and a good comedic director at the helm (Landis). But names aren't everything. Three stars under-deliver. We get Martin Short doing his prototypical goony movements, Steve Martin's slightly less goony movements and smarminess, and Chevy Chase's buffoonery with vintage obnoxious baritone singing from time to time. But perhaps worse than the lack luster and tired performances is the fact the film has no comic direction to speak of. I'm not trying to hold this film to high standards at all---I just want some laughs from it, but more often than not you need some sort of comedy philosophy and tone to build from in order to make people laugh as much as they should. The film starts out as though it may be a satire, making fun of silent movie Hollywood and the hubris of Hollywood in general. Quickly it gets away from that and moves to making fun of three egotistical idiot-stars. From there the film turns into a 'we thought this was fake, but it is real' farce. Some seriousness is added to parts of the plot to fuel this farce scenario. The heroes then become a version of what they faked in silent movies to end the film, in both a not touching and not funny way. Some of the jokes are misunderstanding driven, some try to satirize, some are character driven (look how dumb this character is, and how egotistical this one is!) some are absurdist, while some of the better jokes are old time gags such as the canteen/desert scene and the troubled plane that lands perfectly after an obviously incongruent cut.But the inanity of the writing, the scattered comedy focus and average performances aren't the only problems here. The execution of potentially good jokes stands out as a feature of this film. The one that comes to my mind is the strange camp-out scene with the super fake set and singing animals (including a tortoise!). The scene is odd and is full of potential laughs, but falls flat. Even those who get a chuckle out of it will be laughing less than they should. An odd feature of the film is that many of these negative aspects make it seem like a rushed, money making project, but the film was made with obvious care. The sets are really nice, the scenery is great and the supporting actors and extras are fantastic (often providing needed little laughs). Even the costumes are well made. I got as much enjoyment looking at the little Mexican village and surrounding scenery as I did from laughs.Landis has directed many fantastic comedies, such as Animal House and Blues Brothers. This is not his best work, nor is it Steve Martin's or Chase's. It is an OK movie to watch if bored---it is slightly above average for a comedy, and slightly below average for a typical film, in my mind. There are many better places to look for laughs despite the big names. Four and ½ stars.",Three Amigos!
90,egypttigerlily,My Little Buttercup...has the sweetest smile...,10,17 February 2007,"This is the greatest comedy that I have ever seen. All three of the Amigos were on SNL, so the comedy is very physical--it's full of sight gags, but my favorite part is when they are singing ""My Little Buttercup"" in the cantina. Another SNL cast member in this movie is Phil Hartman--he's in the office with that guy who fires them. This film is hilarious and its lines are easy to remember and easy to retell. There are some dirty jokes like the woman at El Guapo's asking Carmen ""do you know what foreplay is?""; ""neither does El Guapo"", but small kids won't get it anyway. If you like old school Saturday Night Live, you'll love this movie. It is like one big SNL skit.",Three Amigos!

I am so in love with the craft of this movie that I can't poke a single hole in it. And I am someone who rarely says that about any film. It is a classic.I'm one of the few people in this country to sing and dance to ""My little buttercup"" in the same fashion as the too effeminate Amigos, and I have no problem with it. I'm not sure what people want from the film. I can't think of a scene that doesn't work. Shooting the invisible swordsman, come on. The singing bush, come on. The cowboy song with animal accompaniment, COME ON! That very last scene, as the Amigos are saying their farewells. Martin had his Carmen, Chase does his thing, and Short pulls it out with perhaps the sexiest women ever submitted to print.

Chevy Chase plays off the more outlandish antics of Steve Martin and Martin Short like the comedy veteran that he is. His facial expressions while the three are desperately seeking water in the desert made me laugh my head off.The Three Amigos is by no means a serious comedy. By that I mean that unlike Caddyshack, Trading Places, Stripes or Ghostbusters, it does not even make an attempt at character development or a coherent story line.

The scene with Dusty Bottoms (Chase), singing at the celebrations as if he has a frog in his throat makes me laugh every time, My little buttercup scene in the tavern with Ned (Short) with the hankerchief on his head, the calls they have to make to summon the invisible swordsman, the part in the desert...""lip balm?""

This movie really has an old-times comedy vibe. It doesn't have a lot of gags and they mostly try to make you sincerely smile instead of making you laugh your lungs out. So it's silly but it's also pretty refined while doing it.
It features some great talents, it's a parody of westerns but that's not the only purpose of the movie, it's... great at what it was meant to do.
I feel like, since it's comedy, people expected today's standards or even 80s laugh-your-lungs-out standards (like ""Airplane!"" or something). Guess what, their expectations don't define the movie's goodness and there's a lot of it.",Three Amigos!

The first time I saw it (early 90s), I thought it was funny, but just one film among many funny films.  I watched it often, and my senses became dull to its humor.  I watched it a month ago, and I realized that this film is really genius.Almost every scene has some element of brilliance in it.For instance - the ""Blue Shadows"" campfire scene.  Its done on a sound stage with ridiculous cardboard cut-outs in the background - like the crappy films of yore - it has the older guys calming the younger guy (who is obviously an adult, not a child who needs a bedtime song), and talking animals.  Its so cheesy its wonderful.SPOILER WARNING: And there's the final fight scene.  Every shot of the fight scene uses Chevy, Steve, and Martin in it - but when the townspeople come out, dressed like the Amigos, it is obvious that these are not the people we saw during the fight.  The fight outfits have all sorts of embroidery on them - not like the townspeople's outfits at all.  You know that what the movie has just claimed has happened, has not happened that way at all.

I kept hoping for the moment when one of the three would step up and steal the show but they're all equally bland.The pieces were all there, it's a great idea for a comedy, but the three principles were wasted.

It's the perfect fun film that in my opinion did not fit into a decade where the moto was greed is good and patroitic action films as well as teen movies/special effects/chart music and the latest fashions controlled what was being produced out of Hollywood.I think had ""Three Amigos !"" come out pre-1984 ""Ghostbusters, Gremlins, Back to the Future"" it just might have been a much bigger hit. Having said that, it has generated a huge following over the years which brings me to say that, ""time always tells !"" and period settings in films generally have difficulty finding a young audience, especially in the 80's. The amount of people that laughed at me for saying back then that Three Amigos ! was a great film and now they all say it's a classic !!! It just wasn't ""hip'thing to say back then. The same happened with John Carpenter's The Thing and Blade Runner. So, it was either too late coming out in 1986 when the decade took a drastic turn or it was 20 years ahead of it's time. I think box office wise it was didn't have much of a chance but it's great that audiences of today love itWhat I've noticed over the years is that kids who grew up on Three Amigos ! all love it today.However, there is on thing that I have also noticed is that a lot of women I know don't like the film at all.

Lucky Day (Steve Martin) trying to get his buddies' attention as they break into the studio--progressing from an owl's soft ""hoo"" to a crowing ""LOOKUPHERE...LOOKUPHERE"" 3. The opening song and Elmer Bernstein's great score (he also scored the classic comedies ""Animal House"" and ""Stripes"") 4. The Three Amigos singing ""My Little Buttercup"" in a Mexican cantina 5. The Amigos fighting back tears as Lucky Day informs his buddies that, in fact, they have been summoned not to perform, but actually to fight the evil El Guapo--Martin Short's tearful line, ""Why am I in Mexico?"" is hilarious, almost as funny as Steve Martin's follow-up, ""I've been shot already!""This is an intelligent comedy, one that pokes fun not only at the mythology of the Hollywood western, but at Hollywood itself.

My favorite part was probably the scene in the cantina in which the German enters, and the ensuing song-and-dance scene that just mortifies the present crowd. The pair of gunmen entering afterwards was grand as well. In addition to being a fine movie in its own right, this one is especially good if you have seen The Magnificent Seven, which it is something of a pastiche of.

However, the telegraph operator edits her message since she has very little money to pay for it.Meanwhile, Lucky Day (Steve Martin), Dusty Bottoms (Chevy Chase), and little Ned Nederlander (Martin Short) are Hollywood silent film actors who portray the heroic Amigos on screen. When they demand a salary increase, studio boss Harry Flugleman (Joe Mantegna) fires them and evicts them from their studio- owned housing. Shortly afterward, they receive Carmen's telegram, but misinterpret it as an invitation to make an appearance with El Guapo.After breaking into the studio to retrieve their costumes, the Amigos head for Mexico. Stopping at a cantina near Santo Poco, they are mistaken for associates of a fast-shooting German pilot (Kai Wulff), who is also looking for El Guapo and who arrived just before they did. The Amigos perform a show at the Cantina, singing ""My Little Buttercup"", and leave the locals confused. The German's real associates then arrive at the cantina, proving themselves adept with their pistols. A relieved Carmen picks up the Amigos and takes them to the village, where they are put up in the best house in town and treated very well.The next morning, when three of El Guapo's men come to raid the village, the Amigos do a Hollywood-style stunt show that leaves the men very confused. The bandits ride off, making everyone think that the Amigos have defeated the enemy. In reality, the men inform El Guapo of what has happened, and he decides to return in full force the next day and kill the Amigos.The village throws a boisterous celebration for the Amigos and their (supposed) victory. The next morning, El Guapo and his gang come to Santo Poco and call out the Amigos, who confess that they have only been acting and are too scared to confront him after Lucky gets shot in the arm. El Guapo allows his men to loot the village and kidnaps Carmen, and the Amigos leave Santo Poco in disgrace.With nothing waiting for them back home, Ned persuades Lucky and Dusty to become real-life heroes and go after El Guapo. Their first attempt to find his hideout fails when Dusty accidentally kills the Invisible Swordsman who can show them the way, but they spot an airplane and follow it to El Guapo; the plane is flown by the German, who has brought a shipment of rifles for the gang with his associates' help. Preparations are underway for El Guapo's 40th birthday party, and he plans to make Carmen his bride. The Amigos try to sneak into the hideout, with mixed results: Lucky is captured and chained up in a dungeon, Dusty crashes through a window and into Carmen's room, and Ned gets his spurs stuck in a piñata hanging overhead.As Lucky frees himself and Dusty sneaks out only to be caught, Ned falls loose and is also captured. The German, having idolized Ned's quick-draw and gunspinning pistol skills since childhood, challenges him to a shootout. Ned wins, killing the German, and Lucky holds El Guapo at gunpoint long enough for Carmen and the Amigos to escape—first on horseback, then in the German's plane.Returning to Santo Poco with El Guapo's entire army in pursuit, the Amigos rally the villagers to stand up for themselves and plan a defense. The bandits arrive in the seemingly empty village, only to find themselves suddenly being shot at by Amigos from all sides and falling into hidden water-filled trenches dug by the villagers. Eventually all of El Guapo's men either desert him or die in the gunfire, and he takes a fatal wound as well. As he lies dying, the villagers, all armed and wearing replicas of the Amigos' costumes, step out to confront him. El Guapo congratulates them on this plan, then shoots Lucky in the foot and dies.The villagers offer to give the Amigos all the money they have, but the Amigos refuse it, saying (as in their movies) that seeing justice done is enough of a reward for them. They then ride off into the sunset.Overall Mark: B",Three Amigos!
113,rworrell,You'll learn to love it,8,31 December 1999,"I just watched Three Amigos! again, for maybe the fifth time.  Each time I see the movie, I like it more than I did before.  There's an inherent sweetness to the movie, and a lot of slapstick that's easily missed, that I think grows on the viewer with repeat viewings.  The first time I saw this movie, I would have given it about a 4.If you saw it once and didn't like it, give it one more shot.  This is one of those movies where knowing the outcome actually enhances your enjoyment of the film as it develops.",Three Amigos!
114,libco,It's a hoot!,10,29 June 2002,"This is an extremely underrated move.  From musical numbers and dance routines to some fine comedy by Short, Martin, and Chase.  It also has one of the best lines of all time from El Guapo, ""Are Gringos falling from the sky?!""  That and Short saying, ""Sew, old woman, sew! Like the wind!""  Who could not like this movie?",Three Amigos!
115,russ888,Brilliant,9,11 March 2008,"The first time I saw this movie I thought it was alright. In the roughly ten times I've watched it since I've laughed more and more! It gets better each time. Amongst friends, it's probably the most quoted movie we laugh about (yes, Caddyshack and Blazing Saddles are right up there in the top ranks of quotes, too). It's a comedy gem! The heroes have an awesome comedy chemistry, the villains are funny, and the smaller roles have their moments, too. I'm laughing as I write this reflecting on it -- a good sign! It's also timeless. The subject, setting, and dialog will allow it to be appreciated by the next generation and the one after that. The laughs make this picture not just famous... but IN-famous!",Three Amigos!
116,AUevans78,I still know the salute,10,3 June 2003,"I can't really remember the first movie I ever saw.  I'm sure it was something from Disney and I probably loved it, but the first movie I ever idolized was Three Amigos.  Ever since, I have thought that Steve Martin is quite possibly the funniest man on the planet.  From the time that our VHS tape broke from massive viewings to the movies distribution on DVD, about 13 years passed and I still knew all of words.  In my opinion, it is the funniest movie without a sequel.",Three Amigos!

118,nialldude3,Not amazing but good,5,5 July 2014,"Three amigos may not be John Landis's best work but it is a enjoyable movie. The film, spoofing movies like seven samurai and the magnificent seven, has a number of good jokes and good acting from Steve Martin and Chevy chase. Martin short not so much.Landis claims the studio took it out of he's control and it shows because compared to Animal house and Blues brothers, it's nothing special. But three amigos is funny watch that I recommend you watch though don't go out of you're to. The is currently available on Netflix as of July 2014",Three Amigos!
119,aspence26,Why can't people enjoy its simplicity,10,21 April 2002,"Personally I think this is one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen. I remember when I was 8 and saw it the first time, I didn't get many of the jokes but the visuals and voices were funny. It could keep my attention day after day, which is sometimes hard to do. The VHS tape we had of it broke because it was viewed so many times. I just recently bought the DVD of this movie and showed it to many of my college friends who had not seen it before. They all thought it was one of the funniest movies they had seen in awhile. Many critics of the movie talk about missed opportunities for jokes and it's seemingly slow pace. Its a simple movie with simple jokes and simple plot. Some people can't enjoy a simplistic movie, they need constant reassurances they are watching a funny movie. I am not saying that these people should be ashamed. I am just adding my thoughts so if someone is reading these posting trying to figure out if they should watch it or not, they can have another opinion.",Three Amigos!

Chevy Chase, Steve Martin & Martin Short! I loved it and I think it deserves a better rating then what it got!! It was a very underrated movie, and all in all very funny. If you like slapstick comedy, or any of the actors in it I think that you should definately see it!!!!",Three Amigos!
122,Timlarsen7,One of the funniest movies yet.,10,5 December 2004,"This movie is the funniest ever. If you don't find it funny, you just don't get it. I was happy to read that so many others like this movie as well. Just reading other users favourite lines from it, made me laugh. The movie is packed with the funniest lines from start to end and the actors are superb, everyone. Every time I see it I notice a new detail. The stereotypes in the movie I never get tired of and I could go on and on with plenty of great scenes. I say again, if you don't like it, you simply don't get it.",Three Amigos!
123,emz_mingo,Great Comedy,10,6 July 2005,"Steve Martin is a comic genius! This film was great! I loved the invisible swordsman scene, and the when they attempt to break into El Guapo's residence...My favorite scene is the one of Steve Martin walking down the hall...its amazing that he can make walking into one of the funniest parts of the movie. The plot line is your basic ""man finds who he is"" type thing, and its a bit cheesy, but everyone needs a break from deep, philosophical, symbolism-in-everything, or murder mystery, end of the world movies. Chevy Chase and Martin Short put on a great show as well...the stories of Little Neddy are hilarious, and Chase did a wonderful job in the canteen scene.",Three Amigos!
124,kamatarise,Nannnnny,8,26 September 2018,This film is great from start to finish. Its light hearted as all comedies should be. I do not understand how it's rated so low.The chemistry between the 3 amigos is perfect on screen. Interesting characters and genuinely funny moments. Highly recommended.,Three Amigos!
125,bondbrook,"Great, go watch it.",9,23 December 2005,"I agree with Jerbeargood from Arizona, Phoenix. This is a fantastic comedy I don't understand why it has a low rating here. I would give this 9/10. Great cast and good Plot. One of the best parts of the film:Riding through the desert, HOT. The first Amigo, Steve Martin, opens his flask with great anticipation, only to discover there is about a teaspoon's worth of water in it. The next Amigo, Martin Short, pours the contents of his flask in his mouth. The flask is full of sand. Then Chevy Chase, the third Amigo, opens his flask and it seems as if it has an endless supply of water. It pours all over his mouth and face and shirt. He has enough water to gargle, spit, swish water in his mouth, and spit again. After his fill, then tosses the flask aside. The flask hits the ground and water comes pouring out of it. The other two Amigos have been watching this the whole time. The scene ends with Chevy Chase applying lip balm and then offering it to the other two.",Three Amigos!

127,l84sumluvin,"If you have any sense of humor whatsoever, you will enjoy this movie.",10,4 November 1999,"Well maybe I exaggerated a bit. This is more of a movie for that specific type of humor shared by guys who haven't quite ""grown up"" yet. If you fit this description then you will definitely love this movie. As for you others, you may or may not like it. I find Steve Martin to be one of the funniest people in Hollywood with a humor which is always witty, wacky, and downright hilarious. His character fits perfectly with that of Chevy Chase and Martin Short, who are equally funny in this movie. I've never laughed harder than during the ""singing bush"" scene. My other two amigos and I must have re-wound and played that one scene at least two dozen times.",Three Amigos!
128,oscarthemouse,My Favorite Comedy!,10,25 April 2006,"I loved it the first time I saw it on the big screen way back in 1986, and I love it today... I have seen this movie, with its excellent corny comedy, 30+ times! I rarely view movies a second time around... I remember details easily and am an armchair critic much to the chagrin of my husband. ""Three Amigos"" is a classic, well-written comedy with phenomenal chemistry between the cast of characters. It provides a mostly family-friendly plot; young children will miss the few bits of language and innuendo. The good guys are a trio of almost squeaky-clean, bumbling, out-of-work actors and the bad guys are a gang of mangy-looking bandits who terrorize a small village in Mexico. The trio head to Mexico with dollar-signs (or shall we say, pesos) shining in their eyes, but leave having gained self-respect and true hero-identity through helping the villagers stand up to and conquer the enemy. And all this is done with a ""plethora"" of hilarious comedic punches. No movie could truly be a perfect 10, but I give this one top rating for coming close to achieving perfection; it will stand the test of time. Add it to your DVD library!",Three Amigos!
129,twguyton,This movie made me wretch,1,6 July 2006,"Without a doubt the worst comedy ever screened. You would have to be drunk to tolerate this. Don't even waste your time let alone money. Hell, don't waste the booze. This should be used to interrogate terrorists. I do not believe children could find it funny. It was so silly it was painful. I can find more humor in an animal shelter. I am more disappointed in Steve Martin and Chevy Chase, I have the utmost respect for their other works, but I have never cared for Martin Short. I would give some spoilers to prevent someone from watching this, but I would not care to recount most of this movie. I wish there was a way to score this lower than one or perhaps a negative score. It is beyond me how anyone remotely found any entertainment value what so ever. A masterpiece of understatement.",Three Amigos!
130,fcanon01,Strong Slapstick,8,1 August 2006,"Although this may not be a must-own film, I believe it to be a must-see film, especially for a slapstick comedy lover.As is the case with almost all slapstick comedies, the strength of this film lies not in its plot, but in its extremely creative writing.A mix of physical comedy and flat out hilarious scenarios, the origin of which I cannot possibly fathom - are what sets this film apart from the average slapstick film. Throw in the stellar cast, and this film is an instant classic.Of course, there are a few ""groaners,"" almost impossible to avoid in this genre - and a musical scene - which I've never been a real fan of. However, the overall quality of the rest of the film far outweighs those small detracting elements.",Three Amigos!

I find it hilarious! I think that every single person in the movie, including the amigos, can represent one of my family members. Its a great movie that doesn't need to be lude or vulgar to be funny (if you have kids, this would be a movie I would recommend. Its got some innuendos, but for the most part its kid-approved.)Its got awesome jokes, good songs, and is basically a movie you can laugh and talk through. You probably wont get lost in the movie if you decide to get up to get some popcorn. I don't want to get into too many details of the movie, but if your looking for a fun movie to watch on a Saturday night, this would be it! Bravo to Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short on a wonderful performance!",Three Amigos!

We still laugh throughout the whole movie. Anyone who pans it simply hasn't seen it enough times. I tell people that they won't understand it the first 4-5 times. You WILL die like dogs! My 40th Bday party was a 3 amigos party. I was Lucky Day. My 2 boys were Dusty and Ned. My wife was CARMEN...see, a rose can bloom in the desert. We had a singing bush w/ a boom box hidden in it. A 7 pc mariachi band. lots of margaritas. Am I up to 10 lines yet? What a strange requirement! Anyway, enjoy the movie and feel free to share your favorite parts with me.",Three Amigos!

I completely disagree. Where some would say it's slow it is simply developing the characters and allowing time for silly jokes and fun. And yes, the jokes are silly. If you don't like silly humor, that's silly, not slap-stick, then you probably won't like this movie. This movie had me laughing the entire time. I would definitely reccomend it to anyone looking for a light-hearted comedy.",Three Amigos!

Yes there are a few scenes that wouldn't be appropriate for small children, but that goes over small heads. Steve Martin's intonations are hilarious. Chevy Chase has great physical comedy. Martin Short can steal a scene with a simple facial expression. And of course there's the classic music... I guarantee that you'll be humming ""My Little Buttercup"" or the ""We Are The Three Amigos"" for weeks after you watch. One of the best comedies of the 80s and still great today!",Three Amigos!

138,PattiAZ,Hokey Fun!,8,16 May 2004,"This movie IS silly, but it is one of the rare just-for-fun kind of movies that the whole family can enjoy together. The kids laugh at the antics of Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase and the adults can't help but laugh over the hokey-ness of the storyline as they re-live the movies of the ""good old days"" of 50's-60's ""black hats versus white hats"" westerns. This movie is a genuine throw-back to the days when the bad guys were always thwarted even if the good guys were sappy, idealistic and, let's be frank, not too bright. No nudity, no swearing, no real violence (one character gets shot but it appears like a mosquito bite and is forgotten about as the movie finishes up) and has classical lines that my kids love to repeat, such as the insult ""You are the son of a motherless goat!"" In other words, nonsensical but fun. :o)",Three Amigos!
139,nabilrast,Three Amigos review,7,11 March 2012,"Three Amigos is a film that holds the test of time, the star studded film includes the likes of Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short. These three make an excellent trio together in this adventure set in1916 Mexico in which our hero's (former film actors) are thrust into the heart of a gang war between a beautiful village in the countryside called Santo Poco against a large group of evil, but hilarious banditos under the command of the ""infamous"" El Guapo (played by Alfonso Arau). The film has some key references to several ""Spaghetti Westerns"" and the concept of it is very clever, and has itself been adapted into other films such as ""A Bugs life"" and ""My Name Is Bruce"". My personal favourite part of the film is when the Amigos sing ""Arizona Moon"" in the desert, amongst many other small but vital parts of the film that makes it as a whole a good, funny film. The film had the potential to be at least a 9/10 but lacked the madness to do so. Another way it could have improved is making the film longer to allow more time to learn about the characters past, present and there perception of the future.By Nabil Rastani",Three Amigos!
140,jefflynneelo,One of the funniest and most memorable comedies ever made!,10,13 July 2004,"There is little doubt that this movie could be one of the top ten comedies of all time (up there with Airplane! Trains,Planes & Automobiles and Zoolander) Honestly, if one has seen this movie and not laughed or sat back and relaxed enough to at least enjoy its humor, then one is WAY too uptight and should probably stick to documentaries or war films. First of all, any ONE of the three leads could carry a terrific comedy on his own; but Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short together are simply three times as funny, that cannot even be argued. There are so many people who blurt out random lines from this movie even 18 years later, proving that this movie earns its rightful statue as a comedy classic.",Three Amigos!

The story is sweet, the supporting cast is uniformly terrific, the musical bits are wonderful, and the lines--this is the most quotable movie you will ever watch. The spoof of old westerns is spot on, look for saloon railings that obviously break away from being pre-sawed, bad guys not noticing good guys being ""stealthy"", and some excellent animal acting. Will put a smile on your face at any age, every time. And IMDb, please don't recommend City Slickers II if you like this movie. Maybe Galaxy Quest.",Three Amigos!
142,tech_savvy1,"Excellent, fine family film",8,23 March 2005,"I give it an 8, should be a 9 or 10 but it's not perfect. Although, my family and I have watched this movie so many times, that we got the thing practically memorized. All the characters are well developed, the story is pretty funny, and the subtle jokes are made even better in that they are from some great comedians of the old SNL days. Steve Martin, Martin Short and Chevy Chase. They work really well together and really fit their characters roles. The supporting cast does an excellent job of developing the storyline of the poor innocent village in trouble by a notorious Mexican Bandit and his desperadoes. If you like the a silly comedy that doesn't get old too quickly...this is a must see! I mean, the main bad guy's name is el Guapo (the handsome one)!",Three Amigos!

Everything from asking if the bush that is singing is the singing bush to the ridiculous 3 Amigos chant that they have. I love this movie from start to finish and couldn't think of a better way to spend an evening with someone, especially if they haven't seen it. Never gets old, never will get old.

Aside from the fact that it contains 3 of the greatest comedic actors of the decade, it also produces one of the best plots and set of characters of its genre. Steve, Chevy and Martin are in their prime. The chemistry between the three of them is undeniable. They must have had a ball shooting the movie. They will NEVER make them like that again. I equate the comedy in this film with movies such as The Money Pit, Some Like it Hot, and the Big Lebowski. The songs rival with those in Blazing Saddles. Three Amigos laughs at itself, its plot and Hollywood. Its humor never misses the mark. I laugh tears every time.",Three Amigos!

They find themselves out-numbered 5:1 by the infamous (""More than Famous, He's In-Famous!""), El Guapo (Alfonso Arau) and his Banditos.This impossible situation is soon turned around by quick thinking (Girl A:""I like the one who is not so clever"". Girl B:""Which one is that?"") and lots of sewing... yes, I said ""sewing""!If you listen to this movie closely, you'll pick-up on a lot of humour that would otherwise be lost.",Three Amigos!
