0,TheLittleSongbird,"Great cast, uneven film",6,7 August 2010,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, but I watched it anyway, because I like a lot of the people in the cast. My overall thoughts on Valentine's Day was that it wasn't terrible but it was very uneven and I do have to agree with anyone who says Love Actually did it better, it did.Starting off with Valentine's Day, it does have a great cast. Jennifer Garner and Anne Hathaway especially are very charming, and I liked the little boy who had a crush on Garner. It was also really nice to see Hector Elizondo and Shirley McLaine again, same with Patrick Dempsey and I also thought Taylor Swift was delightfully ditzy in her debut. I didn't mind Julia Roberts either, however the only ones I didn't like so much were Jessica Alba, who doesn't have that much to do and Taylor Lautner who was rather bland, and it seemed ironic that his character didn't want to take his shirt off, when in New Moon(horrible film by the way) Lautner spends most of the time with it off. Asides from the cast, Valentine's Day was nicely filmed and had a lovely soundtrack. And I thought several of the stories worked, especially Garner's.However, I wasn't completely sure about the phone sex idea and Eric Dane's story is painfully underdeveloped. The script also has its weak spots with nothing really sticking out in the mind, in fact there were only a few amusing moments as the film is more bittersweet than funny, particularly the one in the restaurant with the conversation about the pig's meal. The film also drags badly, while the direction isn't quite as focused as it would have liked.Overall, it isn't terrible, but it is very uneven. Worth seeing once or twice, but it isn't a movie for me that is to watch every day of the week. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Valentine's Day
1,SnoopyStyle,Inoffensive superficial and a total logjam,5,22 December 2013,"Director Garry Marshall brings us an intertwining series of love stories in Los Angeles on Valentine's Day. They're mostly inoffensive sugar coated superficial stories. And then there are the Taylors, Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner. They're trying to be the comic relief. I'm not sure why Garry Marshall thought they would be good at comedy. At least they stand out in this A-list lovefest. One of these are not like the others. Their complete ignorance and their oddity has its own charm. They're somewhat funny in one scene being interview by a news reporter.It's a mess of too many characters in too many stories. After the first two or three plot lines, the rest starts becoming one big confused mishmash. I couldn't tell you what half of their stories are. And they just keep adding more characters. It's an avalanche of hot acting talents.",Valentine's Day
2,Prismark10,Not too fragrant,3,7 August 2015,"Director Garry Marshall struck it big with Pretty Woman and since then rom-coms have been a forte of his. He makes a big deal here of Valentine's Day and almost equates to Christmas or Thanksgiving.Valentine's Day is his Robert Altman moment. An array of Hollywood stars criss crossing on the most romantic day of the year. There are literally a dozen or so plot lines in the mix here and all of them not very good and some actors are literally wasted such as Kathy Bates who appears in two scenes.Jamie Foxx is a second tier sports commentator trying to find that big story rather than care for human interest stories who falls for Jessica Biel, a publicist for an over the hill football star whose agent is Queen Latifah.Ashton Kutcher is a romantic florist on the busiest day of the year but his fiancée Jessica Alba is having cold feet and he realises the right woman for him could be his best friend Jennifer Garner a school teacher who is having a fling with a doctor who she later realises is married.Shirley MacLaine is a 1950s starlet married for 50 years to Hector Elizondo but confesses to him of a past betrayal. Their grandson has a first crush and wants Kutcher to deliver a special bouquet for Valentines Day.Bradley Cooper and Julia Roberts are sitting next to each other on a long distance flight, she is a soldier taking leave to get home to spend a few hours with someone special. They seem to get on well and flirt a little but who does Cooper really care for?Anne Hathaway has got a new job working for Queen Latifah but she moonlights as a phone sex operator and just started a relationship with Topher Grace.There are also plot lines featuring Taylor Swift, Taylor Lautner and Emma Roberts which is as tedious as Hathaway talking sexy every five minutes when the phone goes off wherever she is at work, at home or in a restaurant.I liked the young kid bothering Kutcher for the delivery of his roses but you can guess who he really had a crush on. The Roberts/Cooper strand was intriguing and interesting especially as the air hostess also had the hots for Cooper as well. The Hathaway phone sex story just sucked and the other plot lines aroused little interest in me.This is a film that needed to be tighter, more funnier and the stories more interesting. It actually also needed to be more romantic.",Valentine's Day
3,claudio_carvalho,Sweet Movie,7,7 March 2011,"On the Valentine's Day in Los Angeles, the lives of several dwellers are entwined and affected somehow by love. The florist and owner of the Siena Bouquet Reed Bennett (Ashton Kutcher) proposes his insecure girlfriend Morley Clarkson (Jessica Alba) that says yes to him. His best friend Julia Fitzpatrick (Jennifer Garner) is in love with Dr. Harrison Copeland (Patrick Dempsey), but she does not know that he is married and celebrating his fifteenth wedding anniversary with his wife Pamela Copeland (Katherine LaNasa). The bitter TV sports reporter Kelvin Moore (Jamie Foxx) is assigned by his boss to cover stories of people in love in LA. The phone sex entertainer Liz (Anne Hathaway) hides her profession from her boyfriend Jason (Topher Grace). The grandson of the couple Edgar (Hector Elizondo) and Estelle (Shirley MacLaine), Edison (Bryce Robinson), has a secret unrequited love at school while his grandparents are facing a crisis in their marriage. The executive Holden Wilson (Bradley Cooper) befriends Captain Kate Hazeltine (Julia Roberts) that is eleven months away from home in the fourteen-hour flight back to LA. The contract of the veteran quarterback Sean Jackson (Eric Dane) is not renewed by his team and he schedules an interview to the press with his neurotic publisher Kara Monahan (Jessica Biel) that hates Valentine's Day. The teenagers Alex (Carter Jenkins) and Grace (Emma Roberts) are planning to have sex for the first time. The cheerleader Felicia (Taylor Swift) is in deep love with her boyfriend, the athlete Willy (Taylor Lautner). In the end of the day, revelations will fortify or end loves. ""Valentine's Day"" is a sweet movie of director Gary Marshall with a constellation of stars in the cast. The concise screenplay succeeds in developing characters and entwined stories along 125 minutes running time. There are some excellent lines, with jokes (Taylor Lautner telling that he feels uncomfortable taking his shirt off in public is hilarious) and surprises (the revelation of Holden and Kate loves are among the best). I was surprised with the bad reviews in IMDb. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Idas e Vindas do Amor"" (""Comings and Goings of the Love"")",Valentine's Day
4,kosmasp,"Romantic Day, isn't it?",7,9 September 2010,"There are good romantic comedies and there are bad ones. Of course for some there are only good or bad ones out there. And even me saying that I liked this one, will be almost an offense to some people (the rating at this moment indicates this).Still, if you are going to watch a movie with a title like this, you should be aware, what you are getting yourself into. If you expect something else, even without having read at least the summary line, you are in for a big bad surprise. Yes the characters are not getting that much screen time (which can be a bad or good thing, depending on your view of things) and yes there are quite a few clichés. But this is not here to re-invent the wheel. It's here to entertain. And in that, it succeeds!",Valentine's Day
5,jboothmillard,Valentine's Day,4,17 September 2010,"Love Actually was the big romantic comedy of the time with an all-star ensemble cast, and this one from Hollywood wanted to be the one to have more, and apparently it does, from director Garry Marshall (Beaches, Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride). Basically, it is Valentine's Day in Los Angeles, couples wake up and spend time together, singles look for love and sex, telephone sex is very popular, TV news is made about the day, straight, gay and bisexuals are in on the action, and there are people who debate that it is a waste of time. Florist Reed Bennett (Razzie winning Ashton Kutcher) sells and delivers plenty of flowers while hoping to marry Morley Clarkson (Razzie winning Jessica Alba), Liz Corynn (Anne Hathaway) earns money having phone sex with paying customers while wanting a relationship with Jason Morris (Topher Grace), and high school students Alex Franklin (Carter Jenkins) and Grace Smart (Emma Roberts, Julia's niece) plan to lose their virginity to each other. Also, young grade school student Edison Hazeltine (Bryce Robinson) wants a bunch of flowers for teacher Julia Fitzpatrick (Jennifer Garner), she is in love with Dr. Harrison Copeland (Patrick Dempsey) who is already married to Pamela (Katherine LaNasa), TV sports reporter Kelvin Moore (Jamie Foxx) has been sent by producer Susan Moralez (Kathy Bates) to find romantic stories in the city and he kisses publicist Kara Monahan (Jessica Biel), and U.S. army Captain Kate Hazeltine (Julia Roberts) and Holden Wilson (Bradley Cooper) meet each other on a plane. Finally Willy Harrington (Twilight's Razzie nominated Taylor Lautner) and Felicia Miller (Taylor Swift) (the are together in real life) spend time together in high school, Estelle Paddington (Shirley MacLaine) and husband Edgar (Hector Elizondo) have been married for years and need a kick start, Liz's boss Paula Thomas (Queen Latifah) has a sexy phone call, professional football player Sean Jackson (Eric Dane) comes out of the closet, and Alphonso Rodriguez (Razzie nominated George Lopez) is friends with almost everyone. Also starring Joe Mantegna as Angry Driver, Larry Miller as Over-sized Baggage Agent and Alex Williams as Josh Curts. Like Love Actually the makers seem a bit more interested in getting the big names in and not concentrating enough on trying to make the audience laugh a lot, the romantic element is alright, and Hathaway having phone sex is great viewing, but it is typical old fashioned chick flick mush, a not that great but alright romantic comedy. Okay!",Valentine's Day
6,tavm,Valentine's Day was a pretty enjoyable all-star romantic comedy,7,22 February 2010,"I just watched this romantic comedy that was released two days before the actual holiday and managed to be mostly charmed by the whole thing despite this movie being no great shakes. Still, there were plenty of charming performances, witty lines, and a good old-fashioned, well, maybe not too much of that considering some of the revelations, feel-good atmosphere that director Garry Marshall has often provided in spades during his long film and TV career. Of the all-star cast, Jennifer Garner and Anne Hathaway are the ones who really stand out though Ashton Kutcher, Hector Elizondo, and Topher Grace are also good here. Actually, Jessica Alba was the only one I thought was wasted. Like I said, no great shakes, but if you're in the mood for some entertaining fluff, you can't do any better than Valentine's Day.",Valentine's Day
7,edwagreen,"Valentine's Day-No Love, But Lost Here 1/2*",1,23 January 2011,"Another colossal bomb of a picture.They say that love makes the world go round. Love would head southward at all times, if it depended upon this miserable film.Remember how the Oscar winning film of 2004, ""Crash,"" attempted to show inter-connecting relationships in bigotry in L.A.? This film attempts to do the same insofar as love on Valentine's Day. It fails because basically nothing connects and we're left with players in short romances which are meaningless like the rest of the film.We see betrayal, admission of affairs and all sorts of nonsense in this film. Despite big names such as Ashton Kutcher, Julia Roberts, Kathy Bates, Anne Hathaway and others, nothing of interest and sanity materializes here.A real misery in every sense of the word.",Valentine's Day
8,studioAT,"Lots of nice moments, but...",3,21 March 2015,"Garry Marshall has proved time and time again that he knows his way around a romantic comedy but even for him telling 8 or 9 is a big ask. And it's the task he sets himself with this Valentine's Day themed film.The comparisons with Love Actually are inevitable and well deserved. The formula is the same. However, Marshall does try to tell some interesting and varied stories and in many cases succeeds. However I felt that too many of them didn't work and too much /too little time was dedicated to them.It has its moments but for me (and I'm aware it's not a popular opinion) I prefer Marshall's sort of follow up 'New Years Eve'.",Valentine's Day
9,sunwarrior13,A Romcom With An All-Star Cast,8,11 October 2012,"An all-star ensemble cast that stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Garner and it also includes Taylor Swift, Jamie Foxx, Jessica Alba, Kathy Bates, Jessica Biel, Eric Dane, Patrick Dempsey, Hector Elizondo, Topher Grace, Anne Hathaway, Ashton Kutcher, Queen Latifah, Taylor Lautner, George Lopez, Shirley Maclaine, Emma Roberts and Julia Roberts comes together in ""Valentine's Day,"" which follows the intertwining story lines of a diverse group of people from Los Angeles as they navigate their way through romance.Director Gary Marshall's ensemble romantic comedy follows nearly two dozen people as they find and lose love in all its many forms over the course of the title holiday.The numerous characters include a very busy florist and his schoolteacher best friend. She's having an affair with a married doctor. Meanwhile, a businessman and a military captain on leave share a long conversation during an international flight. There's also an elderly couple who are caring for their elementary school-age grandson, who is pining for a classmate and missing his mother.Valentine's Day is a passing nod to love, like a box of chocolates or flowers that soon wilt. It's star-studded amiable fluff with no real value, but it's kind of a tickle if you're in the mood.If you mainly watch movies in order to see actors you like,this is a bargain at twice the price. The minute per movie star average is off the chart here. If you watch movies for any other reason, there's no reason to see this.",Valentine's Day
10,dbborroughs,Marginally better than the Canonball Run movies,3,5 June 2010,"Scatter shot film about various people on the title day.Full of stars, most in walk on parts the film feels as though everyone is walking through their parts which seems they were filmed as a series of stand alone scenes. I think everyone did this as a favor for director Garry Marshall. Its not a bad movie but one of the most artificial and unreal one's I've ever seen. Its like watching other people have fun while you sit outside a restaurant.While a better movie than the Cannonball Run movies, its worse in that no one seems to be in the same movie, at least in the cannonball movies everyone seemed to be at the same party. A waste of an evening.",Valentine's Day
11,writers_reign,Funny (Peculiar) Valentine,6,12 February 2010,"Watching this I felt that director Gary Marshall had ac perverse streak as time and again he used in the background decidedly upbeat versions of romantic songs - I'm In The Mood For Love, On The Street Where You Live, etc - which created, of course, an anti-romantic feel in a film celebrating Valentine's day, arguably THE romantic day of the year. When we got to the end and he had omitted - and it had to be deliberate, there's no way he could have accidentally overlooked it - the most celebrated Valentine's day number of them all, Rodgers and Hart's My Funny Valentine, I knew he was perverse. This is the kind of cavalier approach I'd expect from one of the young Turks who appear to be taking over Hollywood but Gary Marshall is seventy-five years old so what the hell is he playing at. Opting for a scatter-gun approach which cuts between a half dozen stories inevitably some are going to turn out okay but it's instantly forgettable and worth six out of ten at best.",Valentine's Day
12,neil-476,Slight but amiable,6,24 February 2010,"Valentine's Day has a huge cast involved in at least 10 different but intertwined tales taking part on Valentine's Day in Los Angeles. I imagine it will be billed as a rom-com, but it isn't. All the plot threads are mildly romantic, but it would be more accurate to call it a light drama - although it raises frequent wry smiles, it isn't actually that funny.But it's amiable. All the stories hold your attention even though there are a number of moments when you wonder why so-and-so didn't simply do this, or say this, thus avoiding the plot complications which follow. This is no profound statement on the human condition, but it is a satisfactory time-passer even though none of the romantic threads actually seems to have very much at stake.On the negative side, I can't believe that LA is actually quite as Valentine's Day obsessed as this.On the plus side, the multiplicity of threads and actors, and the fact that each is given relatively short bursts of attention, means that one of the threads end up with a really good, but totally unanticipated payoff.I enjoyed this, but will have forgotten it by the end of the week.",Valentine's Day
13,ferguson-6,Leaving Muncie,4,13 February 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. Really no need to offer commentary on the story. If you have seen the preview (how could you have missed it?), you know it's a major chick flick with a long list of Hollywood celebrities who come together and display the trials and tribulations that we have come to celebrate as Valentine's Day - surely a concoction of greeting card companies, florists and confectioneries.For most of the movie, one song kept popping in my head - Marilyn Manson's ""The Beautiful People"". I have never seen so many beautiful people in one film. As you have noticed, the word ""actor"" has purposefully been avoided - celebrities and beautiful people are a more accurate description of what director Garry Marshall has delivered.Thankfully, he tossed in Hector Elizonda, Shirley Maclaine and George Lopez or the movie would have done for plastic surgery what ""Urban Cowboy"" did for C&W dancing. On top of the beauty, we are subjected to an endless stream of downright SKINNY people! Everyone has noticed Taylor Swift is rail thin, but she doesn't even stand out here. Jessica Biel, who once had a real-life body, looks cadaverous. Even her character exists on candy and treadmills. Throw in Ashton Kutcher, Topher Grace, Jennifer Garner and Jessica Alba, and one can make the argument that the cast was paid for by the lack of necessity for an on-set lunch buffet.Look, I realize this is just a chick flick comedy that is designed to poke a bit of fun at our need to love and be loved ... or rather just not be alone. But a touch of reality could have helped. Raise your hand if you believe Julia Roberts might be miscast as the soldier returning home on leave from the front lines of war. Or that a brilliant doctor (Patrick Dempsey) might be a little more careful in covering his tracks of indiscretion? Or that Anne Hathaway couldn't find a slightly more rewarding way to earn a living than her ""phone entertainer"" job?Couldn't help but notice the ""Pretty Woman"" connections with Garry Marshall, Julia Roberts, Hector Elizando and Larry Miller. Ms. Roberts even has a funny little jab over the closing credits. Some attempt was made to interconnect the multiple story lines and I do appreciate the struggle to show intimacy in the mess of Los Angeles ... just too many obvious skits and stereotypes to make this anything more than a half-hearted effort by all involved.",Valentine's Day
14,anaconda-40658,Kutcher and Garner Make This A Passable Date.,6,6 May 2015,"Valentine's Day (2010): Dir: Garry Marshall / Cast: Ashton Kutcher, Jennifer Garner, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Biel, Jessica Alba: Here is a romantic comedy that has the right theme but not quite the right delivery. Garry Marshall's film addresses how Valentine's Day can surprise in both positive and negative ways. The problem is that Marshall fails in dealing with several subplots especially since nearly everybody acts like an idiot. Marshall is capable for good projects such as Georgia Rule, and he is capable of producing garbage such as the overrated Runaway Bride. Among the saving graces are Ashton Kutcher as a florist who proposed to his girlfriend and must warn a friend about her date who is actually married. Jennifer Garner is also good as a teacher in a deceitful relationship and who is targeted for a surprise valentine. The rest of the ensemble struggle through shameful circumstances. Anne Hathaway as a phone sex person who keeps her phone on during the most inconvenient times. Her scenes are painful to watch especially since turning her phone off during work hours might be the intelligent thing to do. Her reconcile with her boyfriend is also phony. Jessica Biel plays a promoter who hates Valentine's Day and must deal with a sports figure. She ends up checking empty e-mail boxes and mourns the lack of attention. Jessica Alba plays Kutcher's girlfriend in the film's opening but that relationship goes south pretty bloody fast. The film could have been better constructed but some superb concluding twists on identities save this from total hate thus preserving the theme of the day. Score: 6 / 10",Valentine's Day
15,HotToastyRag,The cutest of the holiday titled movies,7,26 June 2017,"Of all the named-after-holiday Garry Marshall movies, Valentine's Day is by far the best. Told in several vignettes and featuring an all-star cast, audiences can delight in any number of romantic short stories that revolve around the most romantic holiday of the year.In one, Julia Roberts plays a soldier flying home who sits next to a kind and nicely dressed Bradley Cooper. In another, Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift give an absolutely adorable performance as two high schoolers spending their first Valentine's together. And on the other end of the spectrum, Shirley MacLaine and Hector Elizondo play a decades-long couple who attend a drive-in showing of one of Shirley's old movies, Hot Spell--too cute! And in what might be my favorite (although it's really hard to choose one), Jessica Biel throws an anti-Valentine's Day party for her single friends.There's a story for everyone in this movie; it's seriously cute!",Valentine's Day
16,FlashCallahan,Love your cousin day.......,2,18 February 2015,"Three couples awake together, but each relationship will have its own problems. A grade-school boy wants flowers for his first true love, two high school seniors plan first- time love-making, and a TV sports reporter gets the assignment to find romance in LA.Also...... star quarterback contemplates his future, two strangers meet on a plane, grandparents, together for years, face a crisis, and finally, thank goodness, an ""I Hate Valentine's Day"" dinner beckons the lonely and the lied to. Can Cupid finish his work by midnight, and was the script actually written by somebody who had an ounce of realism?If you've seen 'Love Actually', stop reading, stand in front of a mirror and congratulate yourself, there is no need to see this. Actually, do the same if you've never seen this, this film is poison.Like New Years Eve and He's Just Not That Into You, the film features a lot of highly unlikeable characters, surrounding and taking up most of the film from the two most likable characters in the film, Cooper and Roberts.If there was a film, or even a short TV drama about these two characters, I'd watch that definitely, but the rest of the characters are insufferable consumerist obsessed people, who really do deserve to be alone.These intertwining stories are not good, in fact, some are downright offensive. How can a story about a high school couple wanting to consummate their relationship constitute romantic comedy? Oh that's right, because he runs around town with nothing on, hilarious.A couple who have been married for years, find out one of them was unfaithful years ago, my sides have just split.And then there's Taylor Swift. My gosh. I have seen some bad acting in my life, but this is hands down the worst performance by anyone in anything. And to think that her and Lautner were in a relationship is mind boggling, they have zero chemistry in this.Oh well, she got a hit song out of it.So all in all, it's an abhorrent mess, devoid of anything, and apart from Roberts and Cooper, who play the most realistic characters, every one should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.Especially Queen Latifah, whose final joke at the end is demeaning to her.An awful, rubbish movie.Watch this on Valentines day, you deserve to be dumped.",Valentine's Day
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review Valentine's Day,5,17 February 2010,"It's a great marketing ploy to have this released over the Valentine's Day weekend, and more so with that extra number of holidays thanks to Lunar New Year to ensure the halls are packed with couples planning a night's out with a movie. And what better way than for a romantic flick with dozens of eye candy cast, each playing characters with various love issues (or not) to tackle, and basically deliver a crowd pleaser romantic-comedy to top the box office in receipts.I was thinking whether having a not-so-easy-on-the-eye cast will have as positive an impact though. Given the names in the cast list, if I have to rattle off, tell me who's not ""hot"" - Jessica Alba, Jessica Biel, Jennifer Garner (I was comparing who had the better toned biceps,, and Biel is the undisputed winner), Anne Hathaway, Emma Roberts, Julia Roberts, Taylor Swift, or if you swing the other way, then feast your eyes on Ashton Kutcher, Patrick Demsey, Topher Grace, Bradley Cooper, and the list goes on, covering the entire spectrum from kids to the elderly, ensuring that there's something for everyone, with all kinds of narrative threads from first love to mature ones, from heart-breaking moments (hey, not all V-days stories end on a happy note, you know?) to reaffirmation of best friendships and family too, which I'm sure the former would be missed out by a lot of folks focused only on the romance.An ensemble cast also means a rather mixed treatment in the stories told, with some given short shrift and being nothing more than just a lightweight filler segment in between other tales, and mostly centered primarily around Ashton Kutcher's floral shop owner who sells flowers at 55 bucks per pop (what the!), since it's one of those staple items that the day has to revolve around, and provides a convenient platform to weave that web of relationships between characters. And if you dread your mind going into overdrive to figure out who's related to who and what's what, don't fret as the filmmakers had done a decent job in keeping things under wraps until the right moment to show and tell, which to a certain extent, worked wonders for some ""voila!""moments to be revealed.In some ways this can be viewed more like a Los Angeles, I Love You with an ode to the city of angels, given the landmarks that sneak in, and the landscape backdrops especially with the pick up shots for continuity between narratives, although everything here happens within a span of about 17 hours from morning till midnight, and I mean everything, such as realizing who your one true love is, suddenly, within hours of an emotional flip-flop even. If it is only that simple. As mentioned there are some touching moments in the film, but these are few and far between, and in my opinion, didn't evoke as much feelings or move as much as I would have preferred it to, with even ""lessons learnt"" being terribly sterile and straightforward.Surprisingly, I felt that the film had a lot of negativity going for it, given that it's supposed to be a film that celebrates love, with a title like that. Like in real life, not everything turns out happy or the way we would like it to be. Deceit turns out to be the name of the game, and hesitation for honesty and and lack of frankness being very much some of the tools here, given that hurt, though temporary, is easy to bring upon. It's as if to say that honesty is not the best policy, and that ignorance may be bliss. If there's one takeaway from the film, it's that love blinds us all to the not-so-good traits of someone which of course should be accepted wholly, but it is almost always up to the people around who can sense some warning signs that things aren't going too well, and should knock some sense back to a lovestruck friend to cut short the suffering and misery, especially if you've found out some deep, dark and dirty secret. I may be wrong of course since I'm sitting on the other (single) side of the fence, but hey, it's just a personal takeaway.I suppose with the film's success, we'll likely see more of such ensemble films for commercial festivities such as this one, with a ready market to milk. In previous years there had been Love Actually, He's Just Not That Into You, and I'd like to bet that there are already plans for something similar next year. A clear winner as a date movie, but with a runtime of slightly over two hours because of a bloated story that can do away with some subplots. Sit through when the end credits start to roll for some blooper reels, and an inconsequential coda at the end.",Valentine's Day
18,namashi_1,Below Average...,4,3 May 2010,"Garry Marshall's Multi-Starrer 'Valentine's Day' is a dull show. The Veteran-filmmaker just isn't in form in here, his work is a lull. Despite soo many Stars, this one is a body beautiful of minus soul.'Valentine's Day' anyways is one of the most boring days in the World. So what happens when 30 love stories come in a film? They surely are not exciting here. The only story that makes sense is the one with Topher Grace-Anne Hathaway, nothing else is good.I have to write about the acting, Topher Grace and Anne Hathaway are charming in their parts. Anne is Incredible! Julia Roberts is wasted. Bradley Cooper is gay. Ashton Kutcher is good, as always. Jennifer Garner is a big yawn this time. She looks least interested in the goings-on. George Lopez is quite good. Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner are a misery in poorly written roles. Eric Dane is bland. Rest are restless.'Valentine's Day' is a gargantuan disappointment. Thumbs Down!",Valentine's Day
19,Robert_duder,Garry Marshall puts together an all star cast for a simple good time,7,8 July 2010,"Valentines Day is guilty of being a few things but the biggest thing is its guilty of being a bunch of big name stars getting together for a little fun to entertain, have some laughs and have a good time. If this was the sole purpose behind the film then it was a smash success. In truth Valentines Day is truly very entertaining but there is so much star power in the film that it is truly overwhelming. If anyone can handle a star studded cast its Garry Marshall but this is less of a story and more of a series of small stories and happenings...skits almost if you will. Some of them intersect and everything ties together and its almost like getting a host of romantic comedies all in one film. In some ways it can be compared to a previously similar concept of 'He's Just Not That Into You' only the cast is stronger, older, and better performers. And Marshall is a legend of comedy, romances and drama to a certain extent. With legendary films like Pretty Woman, Princess Diaries, and TV Classics Garry Marshall can tell a better story than what Valentines Day provides so I think this was rushed out to impress and make some money (and in many ways it did both.) How do I go through this enormous cast. If you really need to see the incredibly huge cast list of over two dozen legitimately big Hollywood stars check out the IMDb list. Instead I'd like to mention a few of the key players who really give a solid performance. Bradley Cooper is quickly becoming one of the biggest leading men in Hollywood. His charm and charisma make him just fun and easy to watch in the film. His performance itself might not be anything brilliant but the chemistry on screen is. Patrick Dempsey is terrific playing anything but a sweet dreamy doctor. He could have carried the entire film on his own and he's almost the villain of the entire film. He gives perhaps the best performance of the film. Hector Elizondo must be in a Garry Marshall film having shown up already in every film of his since Pretty Woman. Fortunately Elizondo is an amazing actor and gives every performance his all. As half of a long married couple who hit a major rough patch he is truly excellent. Equally as good is his wife played by the legendary Shirley MacLaine. They have great chemistry together. Jennifer Garner is a solid female lead as the hopeless romantic Julia. She even is not as 'soft' as I usually find her characters in romance films. She almost actually gets some depth throughout the story. Ashton Kutcher does a terrific job being what everyone loves him for being...himself. He is probably the highlight of the romantic storyline making Hollywood sweetheart Jessica Alba an unfortunate mark as she breaks Kutcher's heart. Julia Roberts doesn't play a huge role but her storyline is insatiably cute and her and Bradley Cooper, whom she shares most of her screen time with are great together. Jennifer Garner and Jessica Biel both have solid roles as love scorned women who at the same time are not 'weak and whiny' by any means. They both play solid female leads.The lack of mentioning anyone else is NOT from poor performances but rather they don't necessarily really stand out. Valentines Day is in many ways the definitive 'chick flick' for a number of reasons. Obviously the sexy, drop dead gorgeous cast helps, and the dozen romantic story lines told all at once and the essentially feel good ending to the stories and the less than desirables getting their just end when everything is said and done. So if you're one of those people who complain and hate so called 'chick flicks,' then you won't enjoy this one but if you wanna impress your lady friend then this is one she will love and it is decently entertaining, a little overwhelming but a good time nonetheless. 7/10",Valentine's Day
20,MLDinTN,unrealistic tales of love,3,18 November 2010,"This movie was awful in my opinion. It consists of multiple story lines that occur on Valentine's Day. There are so many stories, you never really find out a lot about anyone. I guess I liked Ashton Kutcher and Jennifer Garner's story the best; only because they were given the most screen time.The part that I hated the most was the press conference by football star Sean Jackson. That was so unrealistic and pointless. Why would an athlete call a press conference just to announce he's gay. That was dumb.And Taylor Swift may be the worst actress ever. She can't act, it looked like she was just reading lines off a card. Her part should have been recast and reshot.FINAL VERDICT: Not worth watching.",Valentine's Day
21,lesleyharris30,"Every Rom-Com Cliché is Evident in this Extreme Mess,",4,24 June 2015,"Valentine's Day is a brutal movie with a very poorly developed storyline and a star studded cast that sadly aren't enough to make this any bit more watchable. It has some good moments, the part at the end with Julia Roberts is nice and the scenes between Hector Elizondo and Shirley MacLaine are very well acted, but any sort of joy and sympathy these scenes bring us are destroyed by the many endless, predictable and boring ones. Every story in this would have been better if they were there own movie, Ashton Kutcher and Jessica Biel's story could have been good as a solo movie and Jamie Foxx's story definitely could have made for an original romantic comedy, but when we put all these stories together we never get to see as much as we could with any, all the characters are very underdeveloped, we forget about most of them when they aren't shown for a while, and other stories literally go nowhere, the characters are in the same position that they were at the start of the film (such as Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner's parts), which is completely pointless. There are also some offensive moments in this film, some parts are quite racist, there are some homophobic jokes made towards the end and it's portrayal of both men and women is generally very typical. I did not have a good time watching this movie, and unless you love romantic comedies no matter what, I would not recommend Valentine's Day. The lives of several couples and singles collide when they make up and break up during Valentine's Day. Best Performance: Hector Elizondo Worst Performance: Jessica Alba",Valentine's Day
22,CuriosityKilledShawn,Dated and rather anti-male drivel,1,16 February 2010,"I was dragged to see this film against my will and my manhood and self-respect may never recover. I am so sick of ensemble-cast romantic comedies (and the entire genre), especially ones with generic titles such as this. I am also sick of the generic posters which feature nothing but smiling faces.Garry Marshall shoots and directs this extremely clichéd film like it's still the 1970s. The individual plots are simplistic and although the threads connecting them are supposed to lead to eventual surprises it often confuses the viewer as to how the characters know each other as no clear explanation is given.Some of the stories and characters are completely extraneous, such as Taylor Lautner and his perpetually on-display front teeth (shut your mouth dude, it's easy to do) and the little Indian girl who seems to be unnaturally shoehorned into the film after the success of Slumdog Millionaire.There's no sense of humor to Valentine's Day. The cast seem to be under the impression that any quirky or good-natured line they have is a thigh-slapper but I just found it cringe-inducing. And whoever told Eric Dane he could act should be ashamed of themselves. The man makes Seagal look like Olivier.And of course the film doesn't have much to say about men. After all it's okay to humiliate male characters (would it be funny if a dad caught a naked girlfriend in his son's room and kicked her out? NO!) and portray men as villains and the type of people who constantly need to explain themselves and apologise to women.I expect this film to die after the first week. I am amazed it has done so well since it contains nothing you've not seen in hundreds of other dreary rom-coms.",Valentine's Day

See Valentine's Day soon, its adorable!",8,18 February 2010,"In Los Angeles, a disc jockey announces that the most romantic day of the year is here, Valentine's Day, and he begins playing love songs. But, depending upon one's situation, this can be great or dismal. For Reed (Ashton Kutcher), a florist, this is a very good day, for not only will he be raking in the dough, his girlfriend, Morley (Jessica Alba) says yes when he presents her with a ring. Also enjoying the day are a pair of high school sweethearts (Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner) and a classmate (Emma Roberts) who is arranging a serious encounter with her boyfriend. There are, however, others who are not happy. Teacher Julia (Jennifer Garner) is in love but, her honey, Dr. Harrison (Patrick Dempsey) has to work that evening, leaving her alone. Also, although he is a sports reporter, Kelvin (Jamie Foxx) has been assigned to interview the folks of the area about their Valentine's Day celebrations. Ugh. As Kelvin says, its a horrible holiday, you don't even get the day off and men are expected to give spectacular gifts and promises. That's so not him. However, his chance meeting with a publicist (Jessica Biel) may turn his day around. Then, too, a new couple, Jason and Liz (Topher Grace and Anne Hathaway) are just getting to know each other but definitely like the late nights they have had so far. Too bad Jason is oblivious to the fact that Liz is secretly a phone sex operator, which helps pay her massive school debts. Also in the picture are a 50 year married couple (Hector Elizondo and Shirley Maclaine), who are taking care of their grandson while his mother is away, a pair of airplane passengers seated next to each other (Bradley Cooper and Julia Roberts) and a football player who has just been released from his team (Eric Dane). Who will find true love this holiday? Well, I say, go ahead, make your day and see this charming, adorable new romantic comedy. Yes, it does take a page out of the ""Love Actually"" book, in that there are many story lines but, they are all beautifully braided together. The cast is truly wonderful, although some, like Alba and Dempsey, have less screen time than the others. Also, additional stars Queen Latifah and George Lopez are very funny, too. There are also some great one-liners and an imaginative dialogue, so kudos to the screenwriter, and the direction is likewise zesty and fun. Add on very lovely costumes, a beautiful, sunny setting and high production values and you have a very nice film indeed. In a word, enjoy.",Valentine's Day
24,callanvass,I actually really enjoyed it. This Valentine's day is particularly entertaining.,7,12 October 2010,"|Credit. IMDb| Intertwining couples and singles in Los Angeles break-up and make-up based on the pressures and expectations of Valentine's Day.I was initially dreading the release of this. I didn't really enjoy ""He's Just Not That Into You."" all that much, and I figured this would be the same sort of corny BS. Much to my surprise, I got into this very much, and found it to be an enjoyable, romantic-viewing. The characters were easy to emphasize with, and I especially enjoyed the storyline between Ashton Kutcher and Jennifer Garner the most. Taylor Lautner didn't embarrass himself, nor did Taylor Swift, even if her character was grating to the nerves. Only overly silly thing, had to be the Kid claiming he was in love. Bit over the top if you ask me.Performances. Ashton Kutcher is likable and goofy as usual. He's not a great actor, but he has a presence and a certain charisma you can't deny. Jennifer Garner is lovely to look at, and a likable actress to boot. She was my favorite female character. Jessica Alba is gorgeous, no doubt. But she doesn't have much of a part to play, other than being somewhat manipulative and fearful. She does that well. Kathy Bates is solid in her role. Jessica Biel is OK, but is rather silly in parts. Bradley Cooper is alright, I didn't find anything particularly impressive about him here. Eric Dane is good as the reluctant gay-man. Patrick Dempsey plays a despicable cheater very well. Hector Elizondo and Shirley MacLaine play a cute couple. Jamie Fox is rather cold, but that was the point. Topher Grace felt a bit awkward. Anne Hathaway is cute, and likable in her role. Latifah and George Lopez do OK in the comedic supporting roles. Taylor Lautner doesn't embarrass himself, he was adequate. Taylor Swift is annoying, but good in her role. Julia Roberts is charming in her limited screen time.Bottom line. It's a bit of a mess, but an entertaining one. It certainly beats He's Just Not That Into You. If you're in a weepy sort of mood, this will do the trick. Recommended7/10",Valentine's Day
25,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,20 May 2010,"Valentine's DayLike menstrual cycles and the Winter Olympics, Valentine's Day only affects half of the world's population. Fortunately, the ugly, the smelly and really nice guys aren't in this movie's demographic. Set on February 14, Valentine's Day follows a number of LA-area couples – Julia (Jennifer Garner), Dr. Harrison (Patrick Dempsey); Kara (Jessica Biel), Kelvin (Jamie Foxx); Reed (Ashton Kutcher), Morley (Jessica Alba); Liz (Anne Hathaway) Jason (Topher Grace); Kate (Julia Roberts), Holden (Bradley Cooper); and Edgar (Hector Elizondo), Estelle (Shirley MacLaine) – as they cope with their relationship woes.An overabundant anthology, Valentine's Day is spread waffer thin, donating equal time to lesser vignettes (Taylor Lautner, Taylor Swift) that distract from the few intriguing ones (Eric Dane, Queen Latifah). But even the more significant yarns aren't enough to save this schmaltzy salute to L-O-V-E.Furthermore, if you really want to see the ultimate homage to amour that involves numerous couples...throw an orgy.

26,tabuno,An Appropriate Valentine Day's Treat,7,19 January 2019,"14 February 2010. Director Gary Marshall manages to hold together what could have been an unwieldy script overloaded with stars and characters that flew apart and crashed on landing. Fortunately, the script and basic theme and relational ties in this movie have enough connectivity to make this movie entertaining as well as particularly meaningful on its release during Valentine Day weekend. Except for a few jarring reveals that seem to cater to political correctness and sometimes difficult to follow story lines with so much going on, this predictable though a few unpredictable moment movie accomplishes what it sets out to do, to provide its lover audiences with the dose of love bites that hurt, titillate, and soothe the broken heart. Julia Robert has one of the more interesting roles in this movie. Anne Hathaway doesn't get to really break out in this movie reprising in part her DEVIL WEARS PRADA persona (along with Hector Elizondo though they don't really share much, if any screen time). There really isn't that much is new to this movie, but it has a few nips and tucks that make for a romantic comedy, drama film best seen around Valentine's Day.",Valentine's Day
27,ironhorse_iv,"I guess Cupid miss the arrow for me, loving this movie. I thought it was mediocre, at best.",6,14 February 2014,"It's like the 2005's movie, 'Crash' telling multiples stories of characters in Los Angeles, but instead of dealing with the topic of racism. It's a comedy about love and Valentine Day. Directed by Garry Marshall, this movie is so gimmicky that it can't be watch on, any other day than that holiday. All the movie stars couldn't make this movie, any better. The movie have way too much characters. I guess, it was trying a little too hard to appeal to everybody. You got everything from ranging from the old couple play by legends, Shirley MacLaine & Hector Elizondo to Emma Roberts & Carter Jerkins playing clueless teenagers. They even add on gay & interracial story lines to the mix so every love affair is focused on. It really could had cut some of these characters out of the movie. It's get really confusing with all the stories, going on, at once. The move jumps around from character to character way too much. It doesn't really enter lock that way. I hate how the movie jumps around when things are getting good. The British 2003's movie 'Love Actually"" does the basic premise of multiple story lines occurring around a popular holiday, but a lot better. It's somewhat funny, and the jokes kinda work. I do like the lying stinking pig dish sequence, and the airport scene, the most. Some of the scenes, they could had cut out. Honestly, was there any good reason why Taylor Lautner & Taylor Swift's characters were in this movie besides comedy relief? Both are not that great as actors, anyways. I do like the inside joke about Lautner being unconformable about taking his shirt off. That got me a laugh. There are a lot of clever inside jokes such as the 1970's cell phone tone when talking a certain foreman or 1958's Hot Spell being shown to a certain woman. Another inside joke at the end that got me, laughing. Something about a certain pretty woman. Another thing that should had been cut was Liz (Anna Hatchaway) and Jason (Topher Grace)'s story. It didn't really felt like a big deal story, and it rarely interlocks with the other stories. So why have it! I thought it should had been taking off. The whole football sub-plot with Shawn Johnson (Eric Dane) kinda took us away from the main theme of Valentine Day to the point; that it felt like I was watching a different movie. I thought it would had been left off the editing table as well. The only story that should had focus more on, is the whole Reed Bennett (Ashton Kutner) & Julia Flitzpatrick (Julia Garner) plot. Is it just me, or did I have to say that Jessica Biel and Jennifer Garner look alike to the point, I forgot which characters, they were playing. I got confused, really quick. The things, I didn't like about the film. I didn't like how every character in the film felt like they live in some odd type of millionaire lifestyle. Nobody really felt like really real characters here. They were all way too pretty. Juliet Roberts as a soldier. I don't buy it. The airport guy giving Reed, a free airline ticket. I don't buy it. The kid, Edison (Bryce Robinson) going all the way, just to show his love for valentine day. I really doubt that unrealistic plot line. The movie does follow some of the rom-com clichés like guy getting dump by hot girl to only fall in love with his best girl/friend or girl get cheated by dream guy to only to fall in love with her best boy/friend. It does make fun of the overused click flick clichés too, like example with the whole love rush to the airport and the whole awkward kiss behind friends. There were several sexual references throughout the film and mild language. For a PG-13 movie, it was somewhat OK. It wasn't as bad, as certain critics are saying. Still, I doubt I will ever go back and watch this movie, again. The movie somewhat success in the box office cause a spin off movie in 2011's New Year's Eve. I'll get to that, one day. This movie can be sums up from one line in the film. This is what I thought about it. There you have it, folks. Young love. Full of promise, full of hope, ignorant to reality. Indeed, this movie is ignorant to reality",Valentine's Day
28,Floated2,where was the comedy?,3,6 August 2010,"Valentine's Day is a romantic comedy about a bunch of star actors with little plot lines and stories to make the movie interesting. This movie was very weird and boring (at least for the first hour). The movie picked up when the conflicts happened towards the second half of the film, but in all the movie was actually boring and hard to watch at many scenes and moments.The limited time for acting also diminished the performances of almost every single star in the movie. However, the acting performances of the younger tots (Taylor Swift, Emma Roberts, Taylor Lautner, Carter Jenkins) were much weaker when compared to the veterans Julia Roberts, Jamie Foxx, Shirley MacLaine, and Héctor Elizondo. One other note: Ashton Kutcher, Topher Grace, and Bradley Cooper are three men that given the little time in this movie delivered swell performances that was undermined only by the writing. Their comic timing kept the movie afloat when the flick was threatening to totally flounder.Like I said before, some stories worked, and other stories were absolutely dreadful to watch. The high school-based stories in Valentine's Day were the weakest, shortest, and the most pointless. In the meantime, the Anne Hathaway/Topher Grace story and the conflict involving Kutcher, Alba, Jennifer Garner, and Patrick Dempsey were the most entertaining to watch. Nearly all the stories had their share of clichés, with only one of them containing a surprise or two. The chemistry wasn't that intense, because there was no time for it to happen. The dialogue was never allowed to intensify or dwell deeper into the concept of love. A few good one-liners here and there, but nothing really worth remembering. I felt that the acting wasn't than great, it could have been better and many of the stories were unrealistic and very weak Overall, the problem with Valentine's Day is very simple: we've seen it before and after 2009 being such a good year for romantic comedies, the expectations are higher. It takes more than just a bunch of big stars to propel a Rom-com to quality heights; you need strong writing, good chemistry, strong direction, and a hintage of unpredictability. Valentine's Day has its moments indeed (Anne Hathaway is hilarious), but don't expect it to be anything better than mediocre. Simply there were too many stories and most of them with less depth than a puddle.My opinion like many people have said, the weakest stories were the high schoolers, and that elementary kid love story. That was really painful and just unnecessary. I was thinking the whole time tat this was a mistake, like why would tehy put that in their. It wasn't funny or nice in any way. The little kid's crush was supposedly his teacher (Jennifer Gardner), but in reality it ended up being a little Indian girl in his class (Woah!). Real bad writing for that story imo.The good stories were Ahton Kutcher with Gorge Lopez & Jennifer Gardner, Jessica Alba's relationship. Also Topher Grace & Anne Hathway, and Jamie Foxx & Jessica Biel. Another decent one was Julia Roberts & Bradley Coopers. One of the worst one was the gay relationship between Dane Cane. His character was a football player about to retire and he supposedly lets the news go at a conference that he's gay. That was horrible and awful writing altogether and completely unbelievable.Overall the movie could have been MUCH better, it was dragged on but had its moments. And it wasn't funny like man wth! Id recommend it to those who like these kind of movies but they shouldn't get their hopes too high. The movie wasn't that good and was hard to watch at certain parts. Though whatever.",Valentine's Day
29,pennyelenabooks,too many stories,2,12 February 2014,"The movies where more than five famous actors are playing in, are usually boring and complicated. This one is no exception. Too many stories are taking place on 14th of February, on Valentine's day. It shows many aspects of love, between many couples, some of them without chemistry - actually they seem not to belong with each other. The endless changing of the story is confusing and tiring - in my opinion, if the movie had fewer stories it would have been better and easier to follow through.

I took my girlfriend to the movies and she chose it, so i didn't have any other option.This is a romantic comedy dedicated 100% for the mainstream. What do I mean? Well it has a commercial plot, popular score, and most noticeable, it features the most ""in"" actors. I mean, the kind of actors that star in big budget productions, appear in all magazines, and teen sensations.I have to admit that the movie's dynamic was perfect for the events and situations. You don't have a chance to get bored unless you don't like these kind of movies.Anne Hathaway is a very fine actress. She's by far the most talented celebrity in this movie and I say that because you totally buy her role. Bradley Cooper, Julia Roberts, Héctor Elizondo, and Shirley McLane are great also. Taylor Swift's performance hurts too much. It's painful. Queen Latifah steals the show with her funny line that deals with an African Queen. You know what I'm talking about. Emma Roberts is very cute and I see a potential in her for romantic comedies. Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Alba, and Jessica Biel got on my nerves but I guess their roles asked for it. Jamie Foxx is just decent, the same goes for Joe Mantegna's cameo! Overall this is a perfect date movie. You will get laid if you comment it adequately ;)The movie has plenty of funny moments. I was surprised to find quality humor in this one. For example, Jamie Foxx's ""I Will Survive"" moment was really funny. While some dialogs by Anne Hathaway were sexy and funny. Héctor Elizondo delivered another type of humor and it deals with his histrionic qualities. This is a movie that should please those who enjoy romantic comedies of all kind. Not everything is ""You've Got Mail"".I have to get this off my chest: The female cast was really hot. Jessica Biel's body deserves a statue. Anne Hathaway looks cute and hot. Alba's body is just too hot to be true while Emma Roberts is very cute.",Valentine's Day

34,PWNYCNY,This movie is a dramedy.,6,5 May 2013,"This is a good movie about people looking for love. The performances are excellent and the story engaging. There is nothing schmaltzy about this movie. In fact, it explores a serious theme: the tenuous nature of relationships. Relationships are fragile and people have to deal with all kinds of conflicting feelings. This movie uses a series of vignettes to make that point. Now, the movie is not high drama nor is it low comedy. It is something in between: a dramedy This movie uses a fine brush to explore the nature of love and the fear of loneliness which motivates the people to seek out the company of others. The movie brings this out and by doing so, sends a message: that it is bad to be alone. Of course, that is a value judgment that one can accept or reject, but when it is being peddled by a movie the message takes on a credibility that is difficult to ignore. This movie show how feelings of love distort people and make them do things that normally they would not do. In other words, love upsets one's emotional equilibrium The problem with this movie is that some of the vignettes are contrived and the acting in them stagy, meaning that the performances come off as artificial. The movie seems to bite off more than it can chew. The vignette with Hector Elizondo and Shirley MacLaine is strong; the one with Bradley Cooper and Julia Roberts is weak. Ashton Kutsher is good; he plays the principal character, a florist. Another problem with this movie is that it lacks continuity. That is, there is no one story, but rather mini-stories. And the movie generates no laughs. Many of the characters are in awkward situations that are not funny. The scene when Jennifer Garner confronts Patrick Dempsey is strained. The theme of the movie is that love is a powerful emotional which can bring joy but also sorrow. So, what else is new?",Valentine's Day

Veteran Director Gary Marshall's marshal plan of having a star studded lineup did work to a certain extent but it somehow it got too muddled along the way. Too many stories, too little time, what can he do? Kathryn Fugate's screenplay was imaginative in some stories while mundane in most others. The performances that were the most valuable in ""Valentine's Day"" were of Hathaway, Grace, Swift, and Dane. The atrocious ones that broke my heart were of Garner, Biel, Foxx, Lautner, Kutcher, and ""a forgot to mention"" George Lopez (playing Reed's best friend & flower co. subordinate).

Meanwhile, Edison's babysitter Grace (Emma Roberts) is planning to lose her virginity to her boyfriend; TV sports reporter Kelvin (Jaime Foxx) has been ordered to do a series of puff pieces on the holiday; mailroom clerk Jason (Topher Grace) finally hooks up with the very pretty Liz (Anne Hathaway) without knowing she's a phone sex operator; teen lovebirds Willy and Felicia (Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift) show off their naïve affection; Edison's grandparents (Hector Elizondo and Shirley MacLaine) confront an old secret; and two strangers (Julia Roberts and Bradley Cooper) strike up a conversation on a plane.This legion of the loved and lovelorn experience hope and heartbreak, disappointment and elation. Some end up together, some end up apart and some are left lonely. Anne Hathaway is quite sexy, Taylor Swift is charmingly ditzy, Ashton Kutcher demonstrates that he did his best work on Punk'd while writer Katherine Fugate and director Garry Marshall manage to pull off a couple of very lovely twists that tie up everything in a nice bow.Apparently, most critics are pretty negative about Valentine's Day and I don't understand it. Yes, it's a sappy and fairly clichéd romantic comedy, but it isn't dumb or poorly acted or insultingly sexist or gratingly unbelievable. It may be shallow and formulaic but it's also well intentioned and funny more often than not. It offers up sentiment and not sarcasm while its happy endings manage to avoid going over the line into shmaltz. This is an above average example of the romcom genre that probably should have had at least 20 minutes and a few characters edited out of it. None of that merits any harsh criticism.This is the sort of film where on several different occasions, something funny will happen and director Marshall will cut away to a reaction shot by a dog. If that sort of thing irritates you, you won't like Valentine's Day. Everybody else will find it to be cute, fun and perfectly acceptable entertainment.",Valentine's Day
37,estebangonzalez10,An Expensive Valentine's Day Gift,5,30 July 2010,"¨There you have it, folks. Young love. Full of promise, full of hope, ignorant of reality. ¨ This romantic comedy is exactly what Valentine's Day is all about: commercialization. First of all you have Garry Marshall involved in the project, who has directed many hits such as Pretty Woman, Frankie and Jhonny, Beaches, The Princess Diaries, among many others. He gets the dream team of actors to get involved as well: Ashton Kutcher, Taylor Lautner, Julia Roberts, Emma Roberts, Taylor Swift, Jessica Biel, Jessica Alba, Anne Hathaway, Topher Grace, Bradley Cooper, Patrick Dempsey, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, George Lopez, Hector Elizondo, and Shirley MacLaine. With all these names there is no reason why someone wouldn't want to go see this film, we all at least like someone in this movie (if not all), it's a cast of All-Stars; between them they have more than 15 Oscar nominations combined. There is one major problem however: the movie is a huge disappointment. The screenplay, written by Katherine Fugate, doesn't seem to work and it gave me the sense of being in a crowded room because it introduces one character after another without allowing for any character development or attachment on the part of the viewer with any one of them. This movie tries really hard to be Love Actually, which was a very successful romantic British comedy that also had a star cast, but the difference was that Love Actually was actually a good movie and Valentine's Day isn't. I didn't have problems with the performances as much as I did with the predictable stories and clichés. Out of the more than ten different stories that are told here only one really caught me off guard, and if you've seen this movie then you probably know which one I am talking about.The stories all take place in Los Angeles on Valentine's Day. Reed (Ashton Kutcher) is a florist who wakes up next to his girlfriend Morley (Jessica Alba) and proposes to her. She says yes, and he goes to work excited on the busiest day of the year for him. His best friend is Julia (Jennifer Garner) who is having an affair with Dr. Harrison (Patrick Dempsey), although she really doesn't know he is married. One of Julia's students from school, Edison (Bryce Robinson) claims to be in love, and he lives with his grandparents Edgar (Hector Elizondo) and Estelle (Shirley MacLaine) who have been married for years and have been faithful to each other all their lives, or at least that was what Edgar thought. Since Edgar and Estella are going out on a date, Grace (Emma Roberts) is going to babysit Edison. She is planning on having sex for the first time with her High School sweetheart Alex (Carter Jenkins). Willy (Taylor Lautner), the School jock, gives Alex some advice. He is dating Felicia (Taylor Swift) and they are interviewed by a reporter who is covering a story about the most romantic day of the year. Kelvin (Jamie Foxx) is the sports reporter who is covering the story, but abandons it to cover the story on Sean Jackson (Eric Dane), a veteran QB who is giving a press conference about his next career move. That is where Kelvin meets his PR agent, Kara (Jessica Biel). Jason (Topher Grace) also wakes up next to his girlfriend Liz (Anne Hathaway) who he has just begun dating. Two strangers travel on a plane back to LA together: Holden (Bradley Cooper) and Captain Hazeltine (Julia Roberts).As you can see the movie just tries to juggle all these different stories in a very short time and there is no room for character development. The actors don't have enough screen time to build their characters or work any chemistry between them. The movie also is a bit long for a romantic comedy and by the end you are left expecting much more from this all star cast. The film had the potential to be great and I don't know how they managed to get all these actors into the film with such a mediocre script. No matter what I say about this film you are probably going to see it anyway because there is a good chance one of your favorite actors is in this movie. I just wished they could've done more with such a great cast. Taking your date to this movie might end up being a much more expensive gift then you should of wished for.",Valentine's Day
38,mattkratz,:-),8,8 August 2014,"This was a decently funny film with several interlocking stories, all on the titular Valentine's Day. It opens with Jessica Alba accepting Ashton Kutcher's wedding proposal while waking up (how romantic!), and proceeds from there. My favorite scenes include those with the football player, Anne Hathaway's role as a ""phone sex operator,"" George Lopez's scenes, the ""I Hate Valentine's Dance,"" Jamie Foxx's scenes as a sports reporter, and Taylor Swift carrying that huge bear around! You might be surprised who Julia Roberts is going to see at the end. I also loved Jennifer Garner's scenes. Some of the scenes and stories actually interacted! Perhaps the most impressive part of this movie is the large ensemble cast. All the actors in the stories worked well together.

39,barnabyrudge,"An exercise in making money from a commercial ""event day"" - very little to recommend it as a film.",4,30 April 2012,"This sort of portmanteau movie was pretty popular back in the 60s and 70s, especially in the horror genre (Torture Garden, Dr. Terror's House of Horrors, The House That Dripped Blood, etc.) and the comedy genre (California Suite, Sunday Lovers, etc). It fell out of fashion for a considerable while, with occasional attempts at a revival in small movies like Grim Prairie Tales, but overall portmanteau movies have been a thing of the past for several decades. The film that kick-started a new fascination with the genre was probably the Brit flick Love, Actually. which, in turn, led to American variations like New Year's Eve and Valentine's Day.Valentine's Day follows a group of disparate characters through their turbulent February 14th, with their stories interlocking at different points in the movie. Where to begin? Well, there's Reed, a nice guy florist who romantically proposes to his girlfriend, only later to discover that she doesn't truly love him and doesn't want to be married. Reed's friend, a pretty school teacher, considers herself in love with a rich businessman but little does she know that he's already married. Plus a young kid in her class is determined to declare his love for his teacher whatever it takes. Then there's an ambitious sports journalist who is forced to go out interviewing loved-up couples, even though he would rather pursue a far more interesting story about the fate of a washed-up pro footballer. He gets his chance when the same pro-footballer announces a press conference, where he confesses that he is actually a closet homosexual. What else? An elderly couple about to renew their wedding vows are torn apart by the revelation of her infidelity many years earlier; a young mailroom clerk discovers that his new girlfriend is actually a phone sex operator; an army captain has one-day leave to visit her loved ones and befriends a guy on the plane; a couple of high school sweethearts spend the entire day gushing about each other. There are probably more mini-stories that I've missed, but I'm sure you get the gist The main problem with Garry Marshall's film is the sheer excess of mini-episodes that are crammed into the two hour running time. Each story could on its own make for an interesting 90 minute movie, but jumping around from one to the other in such haphazard fashion makes the film completely uninvolving. It's hard to care about the outcome in any of the individual stories. Case in point: Hector Elizondo and Shirley MacLaine's late-life marriage crisis could and should be such a moving and powerful predicament, but is dealt with in the briefest and most cursory manner imaginable, rendering it emotionless. Each actor does their bit professionally enough and some are better than others... but where's the heart, where's the emotion, where's the core that would make us give a damn?? All this film does is cash in on a day of the year, hoping that enough couples will pay to see it and make its fortune at the box office. Any real interest in the art of movie making and film narrative is merely an afterthought and, for that reason, Valentine's Day is nothing more than cynical manipulation of the cinematic form as a dollar-grabbing opportunity.",Valentine's Day

It was clever how every single story line was connected (and there are a ton of them). There's also a couple of huge surprises towards the end that I definitely didn't see coming, but on that note the audience is deliberately steered in different directions. All round cute, feel-good movie with a ton of big name stars all revolving around, yup Valentines day.Patrick Dempsey is essentially his 'Greys Anatomy' character, Jessica Alba is funny, Taylor Swift impressed me -also quite funny, Taylor Lautner is embarrassed to take his shirt off in public and very athletic, Jennifer Garner knows how to swing a baseball bat, Julia Roberts is not annoying with a shout out to 'Pretty Woman', Ashton Kutcher plays a large role, nothing remarkable, Jamie Fox is wasted in another role and seemed kind of lost, and Eric Dane... that look his character gives to his valentine after the press conference, just melted me.Yeah, I'll probably watch this again the next time I catch it on TV, much like how I always get sucked into 'Love Actually'. 05.13",Valentine's Day

It has great actors (and a lot of them LOL) that give strong performances all around. It has good writing as far as the script goes. It also has really cute touching heartwarming story lines that intertwine very well together, which is the whole plot of the film. I absolutely adored Julia and Emma Roberts, Queen Latifah, Ashton kutcher (and I don't usually like him), Eric Dane and Bradley cooper in this movie! It was also hilarious at times, between Anne Hathaway's awkward phone sex moments and Queen Latifah's funny lines. Also Shirley MacLaine and her husband in the film has a super sweet heart warming storyline of their own. It tackles old romance, young high school romance, gay romance, and Middle Aged romance.

43,EUyeshima,"Unmemorable, Studio-Packaged Filler Showcases Twenty Stars in Trivial Pursuit of Romance",3,24 May 2010,"This heavily packaged 2010 omnibus rom-com brings new meaning to the term - trivial pursuit. Never have so many Hollywood stars served a movie so bereft of any dramatic gravity or emotional resonance. Overlong at 122 minutes, this enterprise is directed with little nuance by Garry Marshall who seems to be throwing his film back to the broad shenanigans of his late-1970's sitcoms like ""Laverne & Shirley"" and ""Mork & Mindy"". However, even more than Marshall's superficial direction, the real culprit is Katharine Fugate's (""Army Wives"") cliché-ridden, laugh-free screenplay. The contrived storyline she concocts forces about twenty recognizable actors to play out the slings and arrows of romance over the course of Valentine's Day in present-day Los Angeles.If you keep count of such things, there appears to be five interconnecting major stories. Character names are irrelevant in keeping track of them since we are meant to be awestruck by the star wattage of the cast, so I will just refer to the actors directly in my synopsis. Story #1: Julia Roberts is an uptight US Army captain on a one-day leave from Iraq and Bradley Cooper is her seatmate on the plane ride home to LA. Story #2: In the San Fernando Valley, Ashton Kutcher is a harried florist who has just proposed to his selfish, careerist girlfriend Jessica Alba, while his best friend Jennifer Garner has fallen in love with Patrick Dempsey, a deceptive doctor whom she doesn't know is married. Story #3: Emma Roberts (Julia's niece) turns 18 and methodically plans to lose her virginity with boyfriend Carter Jenkins that afternoon while her parents are presumptively away from the house. Story #4: Eric Dane is a closeted professional football player who struggles with inevitable retirement and complicates the livelihoods of both his romantically challenged publicist Jessica Biel and tough-minded über-agent Queen Latifah.Story #5: Anne Hathaway is Latifah's receptionist moonlighting as a phone sex operator as she begins to date mail clerk Topher Grace. The various plots intertwine with each other, and even more actors are thrown in for good measure like Jamie Foxx as a roving TV reporter and Shirley MacLaine and Hector Elizondo as grandparents hitting a rough spot. Does anybody shine above the others? You know you're in trouble when Kutcher is the one who gives the most dimensional performance in the film. Garner somehow survives with her appeal intact even in the silly revenge scene in the restaurant and the ""Alias""-inspired throttling of the heart-shaped piñata that follows. Biel and Hathaway both work a bit too strenuously in their predictable parts, though both manage amusing moments. Alba continues to be a vacuous screen beauty, and the same could be said of Dempsey. It's not too surprising that both play characters who end up with the fuzzy end of the lollipop.Julia Roberts is wasted in her constricted role, but her niece Emma acquits herself even as singer Taylor Swift plays her gangly, airheaded best friend with surprising élan. Dane is wooden as if he doesn't know how to play a conflicted character, but Cooper manages to register in his equally ambivalent part. Foxx, Latifah and Grace play their accustomed roles with little surprise or impact. 76-year-old MacLaine gets the benefit of playing a romantic scene with Elizondo in front of a movie screen showing her 24-year-old self in 1958's ""Hot Spell"". Before you can say ""Love Actually"", it all ends rather neatly with nary a trace. Poof! The 2010 DVD has a predictable set of extras - a bland commentary track from Marshall that matches the bland tone of the movie, a six-minute featurette that allows some of stars to share their Valentine's Day stories, a five-minute cast tribute to Marshall, a disposable music video from Jewel, a few deleted scenes, and a three-minute sneak preview of ""Sex and the City 2"", appropriate since that movie caters to the same demographic audience.",Valentine's Day

It is about of course, playing Cupid. For some people, they love to hate Valentines and for some, it means love doesn't come at all. As it spends a whole day from the young(Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Biel, Topher Grace, Anne Hathaway), middle-age(Patrick Dempsey, Jennifer Garner, Julia Roberts, Bradley Cooper, Eric Dane), and the old(Hector Elizondo(A Marshall go to guy favorite in twelve movies)& Shirley McClane).

45,Samiam3,Lots of little plastic hearts,5,26 December 2010,"Valentine's Day is one of those movies where the studio probably had total faith in the project, despite the fact that they have clearly invested nothing in it, outside of face value. What we get is a multi-million dollar star cast in the service of a five cent screenplay. The whole thing is just a big soap opera. It is totally NOT romantic...however at times it can be funny, unfortunately not on a consistent basis. The acting style is plastic, and the whole thing has really nowhere to go. We are asked to spend the twenty four hours of Valentine's day with a half a dozen uninteresting unoriginal stories.It's amazing how big a waste of talent the film is. I'm sure the cast had a lot of fun, and I'm sure there were a few exciting ego clashes behind the scenes, but the scenes themselves have very little excitement. Valentine's Day is obsessed with stardom as a device to lure young audiences, but it is a mistake to believe that their presence is enough. One device that bothers me is Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift. Their story covers almost no screen time, and they interact with no other members of the cast, contributing in no way to the picture. All they do is take screen time away from the more talented members of the cast.As lame as Valentine's Day is, it's not completely dead in the water. There is a sporadic dose humour which breaks the tedium of the cardboard sentimentality. I laughed in a few places, the best of which are Anne Hathoway doing a funny routine as a phone sex call girl, and Jennifer Garner delivers a painful funny scene pulling a dirty prank to embarrass her former lover. Movies like Valentine's Day could easily work, but not when they are treated as a product, which this is. Humorous bits aside, nothing and nobody in the movie gets a chance to shine, and with no thought process going into the script and/or direction, what we are left with is artificial, low in credibility, and not for an intelligent viewer.",Valentine's Day

Hot mess! Jessica Alba and Kathy Bates were lucky to have had the shortest scenes and the quickest exits from this bowl of crap. Mcdreamy as a cheating SOB, Mcsteamy as a gay athlete + Taylor Swift trying to act is like watching a fish trying to walk. It was painful.

Every single aspect is precisely calculated to get the maximum amount of ""awwww"" from the females in the audience.Still, it's all relatively harmless.

You know, like  the script that would lead to really good performances. Didn't happen. And, the scenes skipped around so fast that no one could center on anything. Just when we were about to learn more about a character or a couple, the scene changed to another character or couple. Were there too many beans in the pot? Probably. But, as we went on we did get to know some of the main characters and it wasn't all bad. Just seemed so for a while. But, this still doesn't excuse the script. Kinda bland. Nothing funny, no good lines, no good sight gags, and the most important of all: no romance that we could feel good about. We just didn't see any real romance, so we just didn't care. I just amused myself with watching all the star power in here and that was okay. Here is what we have: A couple wanting to lose their virginity; a teenage couple giving out sex advice; a soldier going home for two days before she has to go back to the war; a florist popping The Question; a two-timing doctor; a woman engaging in phone sex; a well known football player coming out; a school teacher thinking she has found Mr. Right; a married woman admitting to infidelity; a sports journalist embarrassed to do man-in-the-street interviews; a 10-year old buying flowers for his Valentine; and a normal married couple who put all into perspective. Again, too many beans in the pot? Hmmmm..Parting shots. I hope Taylor Swift keeps her day job as her comic relief in here was kind of embarrassing to watch. Also, many of the male characters kind of looked alike and it took a while to figure out what story and female character each was associated with. Too much star power doesn't mean a great film or even a good one. Yes, too many beans in the pot is not a good thing. Still, this is watchable if you don't expect too much.

51,MartianOctocretr5,Love Boat style romances without the boat,6,18 February 2010,"Some good natured, brainless fun. It's one of those ""for the fans"" type films, and with a title like this, what you expect to see is pretty much what the film is all about. It's like Love Boat on dry land, but without Captain Stubing or his crew, and casts enough stars to fill a fleet of cruise ships. The movie is light and breezy, and never takes itself seriously.It's a collage of interlocking stories, visited on the Feb. 14 holiday. Opening with dawn as everybody's getting up, wending through the day with each relationship's ups and downs, on up to midnight. All of the characters have not only their own spotlight story, but advise, inspire, or affect many others in the overlapping stories. There's characters and actors for anybody in the audience. Twi-fan idol Taylor Lautner, along with Taylor Swift took their intentionally clichéd dumb jock and bubble-brain cheerleader characters, and did the nonsense slapstick well. Most of the cast follow suit, being audience-pleasing good sports and poking fun at themselves. Oddball characters and clever sight gags pop up at just the right times. Like the old Love Boat format, everybody encounters and resolves issues in 100-yard-dash fashion, but that just goes to make the silly exaggeration even better. The guy who is cheating gets his come uppance, and his victims get revenge. The ""wrong girl"" bows out, the kid gets his first taste of Valentine's angst, the hopeless romantic guy gets a happy ending with the girl next door. In fact, all the nice folks have happy endings. Even the jaded one who holds a ""hate the holiday"" party (with a great pinata scene). Silly? Gooey sweet? Predictable? Guilty on all counts, but that's what a film with this title is aiming at. Call me a hopeless romantic, but I thought the happily married couple on playground swings was just plain sweet.Overall, the movie balances silliness with a lot of heart. It's sentimental yet fun and makes for a nice date night. And now I have to close so my wife and I can sneak off to some playground swings.",Valentine's Day

55,Troy_Campbell,Revisit Love Actually on DVD instead.,3,11 February 2010,"Did you read that cast list? Gives the term 'star-studded' a new meaning. Imagine what kind of film you could make with all that talent. Well, Valentine's Day is not that film. Far from it in fact. This who's who of a cast hampers any chance of real emotion due to the need to share screen time among them all. When you start getting interested in a character you'll most likely not see them again for another 45 minutes, pretty annoying when there are so few likable characters in the first place.What is perhaps the scariest is that despite a plethora of plots, subplots and sub-subplots – all intertwining somehow – there isn't a shred of originality. Sure, you might be surprised who Bradley Cooper hooks up with at the end, but one small unforeseen twist barely counts. Bulge and fluff replace characterization and narrative development whilst the corny dialogue comes off as cutesy more than cute. It all goes back to the bloated cast: with over 20 stars that need their quota of jokes, sobs and happy endings filled, it's majorly difficult to dedicate any real time to exploring the unique intricacies of love and loss. See the far superior Love Actually for how it's done.Saving it from complete dreadfulness is a handful of these big names – probably not the ones you would suspect – who manage to squeeze a laugh from their one-dimensional roles. The two Taylor's, Lautner and Swift, play their love-struck high school couple with a cheerful amount of tongue-in-cheek; Kutcher proves his charisma can go a long way as a heartbroken florist; and Cooper and Roberts (Julia, that is) are intriguing as plane passengers who don't know each other. Biel should hang her head in shame though, her standout woeful performance surely an early front runner for this year's Razzies.Save your money and revisit its British counterpart on DVD instead.1.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Valentine's Day

57,napierslogs,Valentine's Day offers romance and eye-candy and little else,6,6 June 2010,"""Valentine's Day"" is a star-studded, multi-character romantic comedy. Pretty much everything about this movie screams that it won't be any good, but I was pleasantly surprised.With that many actors how could we ever get into all the characters? Well we actually do. They kept all the story lines simple, and focused on some characters more than others. A romantic comedy more than two hours long, it must be self-indulgent and boring. In fact, I didn't find it was either at all (well, maybe a little self-indulgent it is Hollywood afterall). I, however, was still entertained the whole way through.Sure, there is nothing original here, and not overly funny but enjoyable none the less. The A-list cast was required because I probably wouldn't have been able to keep all the characters straight if I didn't already know who they were. There were a number of characters that I connected with and found myself cheering on towards the inevitable endings.This is just another romantic comedy, low on the comedy, higher on the romance, supplying us with some Hollywood eye-candy, and little else. But there always seems to be room for romantic comedies in today's video market.",Valentine's Day
58,jon.h.ochiai,"Like Sunshine in ""Valentine's Day""",8,14 February 2010,"In ""Valentine's Day"" Ashton Kutcher's Reed Bennett confesses to over-sized baggage check-in guy that he needs to save his best friend from heart ache, ""She is like sunshine"" Reed suddenly realizes that he is in love with her. Kutcher is at his disarmingly charming and vulnerable best. So is Director Garry Marshall's (""Pretty Woman"") ""Valentine's Day"". I really liked this movie. Granted I am a sucker for romantic comedies. ""Valentine's Day"" is not ground breaking romantic comedy—there are predictable threads, and some miscasting like Jessica Alba. However, Marshall and screenwriter Katherine Fugate orchestrate the huge attractive and charming cast, about 7 or so story lines, finally wrangling everything full circle in the end.On the upside there are a number of highlights. Kutcher is great as the florist who discovers his true love, who has always been right in front of him. Anne Hathaway is comic genius as the office temp, who moonlights as phone sex provider. Hearing Hathaway's raunchy talk in German accent is inspired. Jennifer Garner is wonderful as the lonely schoolteacher, who thinks she has found Mr. Right in Harrison (smooth Patrick Dempsey). Eric Dane is charismatic and understated as pro quarterback Sean Jackson, who has arrived at his life's crossroad. Jessica Biel is surprisingly funny and goofy in what could have been an otherwise superfluous role as Kara. And Taylor Swift may have a career as a light comic actress. Swift also contributes a couple new songs to the movie. Veteran Marshall is engaging in that he always celebrates the best in people, and has an emotional resonance. He has Bradley Cooper and Julia Roberts as co-passengers on a flight that on the surface is casual banter. This leads to closure of story lines, and love and forgiveness does indeed make the world work.Surprisingly, ""Valentine's Day"" runs a little over 2 hours. It is a sweet and funny couple hours. Jamie Foxx is hysterical as the narrative center as second string sportscaster Kelvin Moore doing a feature on Valentine's Day. Perhaps, Valentine's Day is over commercialized and one can get jaded about love. Fortunately Marshall reminds us that compassion and love never get old, and always live on.",Valentine's Day
59,Ruskington,Too many A-listers spoil the dross,3,13 April 2020,"Every scene, every character and every bit of dialogue in this film felt like a personal attack. Mocking me for not being perfectly attractive, with shiny white teeth, razor-sharp cheekbones and visible abs. Mocking me for not having a glamorous job, a swanky apartment and a bespoke wardrobe. Mocking me for not fully embracing this perfect multicultural liberal utopia where men can love men and sex-workers shall not be judged. And, most of all, mocking me for not being so self-important that my love life requires a romantic soundtrack.Rarely have I seen such a self-congratulatory Hollywood back-slapping spectacle as this. The swollen cast of A-listers, the glamorous Californian backdrop, the cocktails-by-the-beach music. The plot, the character development and the cinematography all play second fiddle to the projected social idealism that is forced down our throats relentlessly.Maybe this film could have been a success had it been stripped down, purged of unnecessary characters (Taylor Swift and Jessica Alba take a bow) and focused on actual storytelling. But clearly, that would be too much work and might require actual writing talent. If you ever wanted a clear definition of what the word 'bilge' means, this is it.",Valentine's Day

Valentine's day is the biggest piece of crap i've seen so far this year. It's a dud. It bombs from the minute it starts. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it looked bad. But when it came out, I heard it was very,very bad. I wanted to know why,so we rented it. Now I know.Valentine's day has the same story plot as Love actually and He's just not that into you, except this one goes out of it's way to steal ideas. Instead of being in London or Baltimore, this one takes place in L.A. A bunch of Los Angelenoes fall in love and are connected in some way.My problem with Valentine's day: It is shamefully unoriginal. The characters aren't original. The film is unfeasible. I didn't laugh. I wasn't interested. It's way too long. It's overly cliché'd, predictable, poor dialogue, talent wasted,not one genuine moment, and you know what? I can't tell you anymore. Because There are so many flaws I can't remember them all. The American's don't have what The English have. He's just not that into you wasn't as bad as this. It was at least a little interesting. The characters there were written.Here, they are severely underwritten.All of the situations are the same. Jennifer Gardner's character is like Gigi In He's just not that into you. There is a boy who is in love. That was stolen from Love actually. Then it was cute, here it's just retarded.I'm getting agitated just talking about this movie. So, i'm, gonna wrap this up. Why did people go see this? Cause America is easily amused. My friend liked this movie. But he also liked All about Steve so there is no talking. Overall, I loathed this movie, and stay away from it.Valentine's day: D+",Valentine's Day

63,Imdbidia,A quickie chickie-flickie,4,15 February 2011,"A mediocre romance multi-story with a weak predictable and clichéd script, and uneven acting.The bunch of stories try to reflect the many ages of love, from teenager love, adult and mature age, homosexual love and mother-son love. The only part of the story that I thought was lovely and heartfelt was the one between Reed and Julia (played by Kutcher and Gardner). I mean, you cannot even believe that Liz (played by Hattaway) dressing so classy and posh and business class would work both as an adult phone ""entertainer"" and a secretary in a posh place. Most of the stories are really sketches of a story. Regarding the acting, here my votes:The good: Bates, Hathaway, Lopez, Taylor Swift, Kutcher, and Garner. The Bad: Alba, Biel, and Taylor Lautner. The Wasted: Fox, Latiffa, Roberts, McLain, and Elizondo. The ones always play the same role: Cooper, Dempsey, and Dane. I'm getting tired of them. The Surprise: Taylor Swift! The other actors are OK.This is a mediocre chick flick shot to cash-in quickly without even taking the time to create a good mix of stories. However, the movie is unpretentious and has a lightness about it that makes the viewing enjoyable. A quickie chickie-flickie.",Valentine's Day
64,the-movie-guy,Some will find romance and others will find heartbreak on Valentine's Day,7,9 February 2010,"(Synopsis) February 14th, Valentine's Day, is not a national holiday, but it is one of those days that must be celebrated. There are ""special someones"" in your life who expects to receive romantic gifts from their lovers. Commercialism has put a tremendous amount of pressure on men to give their lovers a romantic day with all the trimmings. Women are under pressure to have a man, or they feel desperate and unloved. ""Valentine's Day"" follows the lives of several couples during this day. Their stories are told through the interconnections they have with each other. Some will find romance in their relationship, and others will feel the heartbreak of ending a relationship. In this Russian roulette world of finding love, everyone in the film is asking for advice on how to find and keep true love.(My Comment) What timing! The producers are releasing ""Valentine's Day"" two days before the real event. Under Valentine rules, the movie is right on target. As with life, the story tells of the pitfalls men and women endure in finding love. Some will succeed and some will fail. The movie has a large cast of well known actors and actresses looking for love. To name a few, Jessica Alba, Jessica Biel, Jennifer Garner, Anne Hathaway, Taylor Swift, Bradley Cooper, Jamie Foxx, Ashton Kutcher, Taylor Lautner. The movie includes sweet stories of young love, new love, and long lasting love. It is not just a romantic comedy, but good entertainment with lots of humor and romance.

65,LazySod,Love actually,5,22 March 2010,"Valentine's Day. For some it's a day to show their love to someone that didn't know they were loved, for some others it's a day of moping around, and then there is the group that makes up with people they hurt during the process of loving them. This film, as the title tells, plays on that day and shows love and its different faces by exploring the stories of a number of people.Writing this review I can't escape the need to compare this film with a 2003 film: Love Actually. The two of them use exactly the same build up - many different stories intertwining, the many faces of love, a special day. Only differences are to be found in the fact that the one uses Valentine's day and the other uses Christmas and the voice over that is used to tie some bits of film together.Quite sadly this film is of a far less quality than Love Actually. The main reason for that is that this film all too often drops to an almost immature level to make for a filler scene where the other never has to do that. I guess the reason for that can be found in there being too little of a backing story to write out all the different characters - there's a lot, just not enough.And that's where the final conclusion stands: there's a lot, just not enough. The film builds up something nice, and then breaks it down again by unnecessary clutter. Could have been a lot better and doesn't stand a single chance in the comparison to Love Actually.5 out of 10 hearts broken",Valentine's Day
66,cinematic_aficionado,Too many unfulfilled expectations,2,12 February 2010,"One of the few times where i experience an all-round disappointment by an all star cast. By trying to say too many stories in little time makes the whole storyline looked shallow and even the refreshing performances fail to make that up. It is a film that just doesn't go anywhere. Despite the prevailing charm which admittedly is ever-present, it nevertheless is superficial; the humour is dry, the funny moments too few to mention, the serious moments not serious enough. Therefore this endeavour has failed as a comedy and it is not a serious film either. Overall and concluding I would say this is a pleasant and charming film. Your visit to the theatre will not disappoint you but you will not leave thrilled either. Nothing more, nothing less.",Valentine's Day

Some of the reviews here ask, ""what did people expect?"" Well, I expected to be entertained, and this film was neither funny, touching, nor dramatic, and it features some of the most annoying child actors I've ever seen. My fiancé just looked at me after some of the dialog, and rolled her eyes. She actually tried to sleep while this was on, but since I paid for it on ""On Demand,"" and only picked it because I thought she'd like it, I forced her to suffer through it with me.

68,bbewnylorac,"Tries too hard, and fails.",6,26 August 2021,"How can a movie with Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Julia Roberts, Patrick Dempsey, Aston Kutcher and Taylor Swift be so mediocre? All the actors are super intelligent and charismatic and try to have fun. The setting aims for a New York style in Los Angeles - and it does well in that respect. The locations are urbane and sophisticated, and it's nice. I love how the characters range in age from a child to an elderly Shirley McLaine. It's the tone and the script, I think, that go too far in being ditzy and screwball. In the second half, especially, it's like someone's gone through the lines and decided every few sentences needs to contain a joke. It's too forced and shows no trust in the actors. Bradley Cooper, who I'm usually no fan of, is actually the best in this movie, as a man who, on a plane, meets a depressed woman, played very well, too, by Roberts. Overall in the movie, there is too much dialogue, and there are too many characters. The whole movie is obviously trying to emulate the British movie Love Actually, but the latter has far more depth and unforced humour. You can be funny and meaningful, too.",Valentine's Day

Oh, but that's not fair, because at least Bride Wars had some good laughs. There aren't any real laughs in Valentine's Day, so I don't think it can be called a romantic ""comedy,"" but it also fails as a straight up romance, because there are so many stories going on at the same time that we are never allowed to get involved with or even keep up with what's happening to any one couple. Pretty much everything in Valentine's Day is borrowed, most transparently the idea of the romantic child borrowed from the TV show Modern Family. The all star cast is wasted because nobody gets more than a few minutes of screen time to act out their clichéd roles. And for the most part it's all predictable and the few surprises pass by in a matter of seconds so don't go to the bathroom or doze off because you'll miss the point of an entire episode. Apparently Valentine's Day was the number one movie at the box office on Valentine's Day weekend, but only for that reason I suppose.

70,lagudafuad,The movie is cool...,6,2 April 2013,"Valentine's Day is a nice movie, I enjoyed the movie so much and out of all the romantic stories that are all intertwined together in this very wonderful love combination, the love stories that got me is the stories that had to do with Cpt. Katherine ""Kate"" Hazeltine (Julia Roberts) and Edison Hazeltine (Bryce Robinson). Their tale made all the other love stories look so insignificant. The acting that the two (Julia Roberts and Bryce Robinson) put into the film made it up for the crap that I witnessed from Jessica Alba and Aston Kutcher, as both seemed out of it for me. The funny part is that Bryce Robinson is a child actor, that itself so impressed me I found myself smiling every time he was on the screen.The movie featured a large ensemble cast that included Jessica Alba, Kathy Bates, Jessica Biel, Bradley Cooper, Eric Dane, Patrick Dempsey, Hector Elizondo, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Topher Grace, Anne Hathaway, Ashton Kutcher, Queen Latifah, Taylor Lautner, George Lopez, Shirley MacLaine, Emma Roberts, Julia Roberts and Taylor Swift.The movie is simple and the plot is not overly complex just the element of surprise here and there, and then in some other tales the whole surprise does not exist as the tale looked too familiar to even matter, but all in all I loved many of the tales.The movie plot focuses on what is happening in the lives of many of the above listed actors on Valentine's Day, some of them are facing lack of love, others are discovering love and there is some heartbreak.The movie was received with negative reviews, but in the teen choice award it was voted best romantic film. Also Gary Marshall's movie was a box office success making over 4 times its $52 million production cost. I really enjoyed this movie and its New Year's Eve counterpart done in 2011. The whole idea of pulling out the best of a huge ensemble cast is one thing I give credit to the director for, everyone had enough screen time and no one was over used. Alba on the other hand in the short time she had on the screen seemed like she wanted to be in another movie.In conclusion, if you are into romantic comedies or a helpless romantic then this is a movie for you, and although the critics say it isn't good I beg to differ it is that good.www.lagsreviews.com",Valentine's Day
71,diac228,"Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Romantic Comedy",6,12 February 2010,"As a disgruntledly (not a word, shut up) unemployed film critic, I must take drastic measures in concealing my opinion towards a movie you are going to wind up seeing regardless. This time, I have taken my single self to see Valentine's Day, to see if it can measure up to last year's star-sprinkled surprise-surprise hit comedy He's Just Not That into You. I wanted to see that if despite without the lovey-dovey person by my side (which has been a vacant position for a while) the movie can still deliver, entertain, and touch the soul.Also, I wanted to see if people working at the theater would dedicate a bit of time from their ordinary day to point out that it's strange that I am watching a movie called Valentine's Day by myself. I approached the ticket counter and asked for my ticket. After momentary laughter the man at the counter presented me with my ticket. I then enter through the doors and approach the lady ripping the tickets and sending me in the right direction. After her laughter subdued, she pointed me to theater #1.Valentine's Day works in the tradition of last year's February romantic success story, and Love Actually, a British dramatic rom-com that jump-started the technique of applying multiple love stories in a film. That way, if one story doesn't work, you have multiple other chances to still enjoy the movie. To spice things up, the movie contains one of the biggest casts of stars since the never-duplicated insanity of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. What other movie can boast the collaboration of Jennifer Garner, Julia Roberts, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Biel, Jamie Foxx, and even Shirley MacLaine? But of course, when you have this many stars, that means so many stories; and less time for character development. This is where the film mostly disappoints, very little developing or changing from anyone associated with the movie. Without revealing too much, there is literally 10 or 11 (lost count) plot lines mixing and intertwining together in a span of just two hours. This equals an average of 12 minutes per story. In actuality however, some stories are actually shorter than others. Katherine Fugate had the right idea when writing the screenplay, but the execution wasn't the best considering that some stories worked and some were just boring to the core. Poor Garry Marshall can only do so much, even though his best days (Pretty Woman, Happy Days) are long gone.The limited time for acting also diminished the performances of almost every single star in the movie. However, the acting performances of the younger tots (Taylor Swift, Emma Roberts, Taylor Lautner, Carter Jenkins) were much weaker when compared to the veterans Julia Roberts, Jamie Foxx, Shirley MacLaine, and Héctor Elizondo. One other note: Ashton Kutcher, Topher Grace, and Bradley Cooper are three men that given the little time in this movie delivered swell performances that was undermined only by the writing. Their comic timing kept the movie afloat when the flick was threatening to totally flounder.Like I said before, some stories worked, and other stories were absolutely dreadful to watch. The high school-based stories in Valentine's Day were the weakest, shortest, and the most pointless. In the meantime, the Anne Hathaway/Topher Grace story and the conflict involving Kutcher, Alba, Jennifer Garner, and Patrick Dempsey were the most entertaining to watch. Nearly all the stories had their share of clichés, with only one of them containing a surprise or two. The chemistry wasn't that intense, because there was no time for it to happen. The dialogue was never allowed to intensify or dwell deeper into the concept of love. A few good one-liners here and there, but nothing really worth remembering.Bottom Line: The problem with Valentine's Day is very simple: we've seen it before and after 2009 being such a good year for romantic comedies, the expectations are higher. It takes more than just a bunch of big stars to propel a rom-com to quality heights; you need strong writing, good chemistry, strong direction, and a hintage of unpredictability. That's how The Proposal, He's Just Not That Into You, The Ugly Truth, and especially (500) Days of Summer made 2009 one of the greatest years for romance in a long time. This was also the issue with Couple's Retreat, the last blockbuster romantic comedy of 09. Valentine's Day has its moments indeed (Anne Hathaway is hilarious), but don't expect it to be anything better than mediocre. Simply there were too many stories and most of them with less depth than a puddle.And none of this criticism has to do with the fact that I saw the movie by myself.Honestly.",Valentine's Day

But the main attraction is Jennifer Garner as Julia, madly in love with a charming surgeon who says he is divorced.

Luckily, this is one those on again films. As usual, Marshall has crammed a large cast into a pretty long film. Valentine's Day has an unusually large cast of people, and perfectly connects everyone of their lives into one very funny film.

There's also a couple (Topher Grace & Anne Hathaway) with a few secrets of their own or a man (Patrick Dempsey) who's cheating on an elementary school teacher (Jennifer Garner) who's friends with a florist (Ashton Kutcher) who's engaged to another woman (Jessica Alba). Other stories include a teenage girl (Emma Roberts) who's supposed to have sex with her boyfriend (Carter Jenkins), a teenage couple (Taylor Swift, great in her role, and Taylor Lautner) being a teenage couple, a loveless woman (Jessica Biel) who's friends with a news reporter (Jamie Foxx), an old couple (Hector Elizondo and Shirley Maclaine) with a few deep,dark secrets, and a kid (Bryce Robinson) with a secret crush.

This was so charming and it put a smile on my face most of the time, and watching it felt so good.It's very similar to Love Actually, a Christmas movie with 9 plots on the meaning of true love. This, however, has about 10 plots, and maybe more, but who could count?This is my brief synopsis of what happens:1. A student gets flowers for his true love-his teacher.2.This teacher, who is actually married, finds her husband cheating on her.3. A high school dating couple attempt to go home during lunch to have sex for the first time. (This has a hilarious moment I will not mention for your sake.)4.A grandmother finds out that her husband once had an affair when they were dating(or early in their marriage.)5. A veteran mother goes home for one night to see her son.6. A male florist finds love.7. A weather man also finds love.8. A man proposes to his girlfriend-and they change their mind.9. A business woman runs a phone sex line.10. A celebrity confesses to being gay-and finds love from his confession.I hope you can use this to help you understand the movie a little more. There may be a couple of plots that I am missing.This movie also has a literal all-star cast, including: Jessica Alba, Kathy Bates, Jessica Biel, Bradley Cooper, Patrick Dempsey, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Anne Hathaway, Ashton Kutcher, Queen Latifah, George Lopez, Shirley MacLaine, Julia Roberts, Taylor Swift, and many more celebrities.That made the movie fun to watch as well-trying to point everyone out. (Though that is a complaint for some people.)This has had a lot of critical hate. Roger Ebert, on his 4 star scale, gave it only 2. He ended his review with these words: ""Valentine's Day"" is being marketed as a Date Movie. I think it's more of a First-Date Movie. If your date likes it, do not date that person again. And if you like it, there may not be a second date.""Even here on IMDB, this has many low ratings! It shocks me. I can think of few rom-coms I could recommend more than this. It's fun, sweet, and joyful.There is something that I must applaud this movie for-there is very little sex in this movie. I mentioned the high school couple. They actually decide to not make love, but rather make out. I thought that was a sweet way to end that plot.There is one scene with pre-marital sex-but when it starts it skips to another plot, and the couple actually were actually in love, not ""we made love, so we are in love"" like in Going The Distance.I could nick pick a few things-the movie COULD have done with a couple less plots, there COULD be less flowers and pink, and there is so much that happens that I can't recall every detail, and I had issues with that , albeit briefly, as I saw it. (I had a few moments of ""what was going on?...oh, yeah."")Still, these are all faults that I can forgive, because of how wonderful this movie is.My title of this review is ""Valentine's Day is a sweeter treat than a box of chocolates."" I mean that. This would be a great Valentine's date flick, despite what Roger Ebert said. In fact, it would be perfect.There's so much more I could say about this funny, sweet, and charming movie.

There seems no theme uniting the various stories as well as no parameters to how all could be squeezed successfully into the same two hour movie which drags and ultimately disappoints.,Valentine's Day
78,jemps918,"Hathaway, Dane and Cooper make this movie funny",6,17 February 2010,"I have always been leery of stellar cast movies that are usually so thin plot-wise, with the bulk of the budget probably allocated to the salaries of its stars. ""Valentine's Day"" shamelessly borrows from ""Love, Actually"", a movie about young and old folks whose love lives intertwine and come together but instead of on Christmas Day, everything happens on Valentine's Day.Another warning sign that a movie is desperate is when they still tout its director Garry Marshall as the one behind ""Pretty Woman""—a movie released in 1990—when he's directed nine other movies in between.And yet, I trooped to the theater a day before V Day with a galpal with the secret wish to be proved wrong, because I like some of these stars and I want to see them succeed.There's careerist Morley Clarkson (Jessica Alba), florist Reed Bennett (Ashton Kutcher)'s girlfriend. Reed divulges his proposal plans to his bestfriend Alphonso (George Lopez), who is lukewarm about it. Reed's bestfriend is grade school teacher Julia Fitzpatrick (Jennifer Garner), who is also not so hot about the grand engagement but is too busy dating the dreamy Dr. Harrison Copeland (Patrick Dempsey) to involve herself.Meanwhile, sports reporter Kelvin Moore (Jamie Foxx) is forced to do a lifestyle piece on Valentine's Day by his producer Susan (Kathy Bates) and interviews the love struck Reed, as well as high school sweethearts Willy (Taylor Lautner) and Felicia (Taylor Swift). Steamy football star Sean Jackson (Eric Dane) is in a career limbo and tries to set things straight with the help of his public relations agent Kara Monahan (Jessica Biel), who is an emotional wreck after seeing that no one is going to her annual Anti-Valentine's Day party. Office messenger Jason (Topher Grace) just started dating the mysterious new office temp Liz (Anne Hathaway), who is trying to balance working for Paula Thomas (Queen Latifah) and moonlighting as a Naughty Nympho. On a plane ride home are Holden (Bradley Cooper), who tries to get his seatmate Captain Kate Hazeltine (Julia Roberts) to warm up to him by asking her if she has a special guy back home.There is also kiddie drama in the world of Edison (Bryce Robinson), Ms. Fitzpatrick's student and Reed's customer. Edison's babysitter Grace (Emma Roberts) and her boyfriend Alex (Carter Jenkins) have planned their first time to have sex during their lunch break but not without the likely snag! She confesses her troubles to her grandma Estelle (Shirley MacLaine) and grandpa Edgar (Hector Elizondo), who have their own revelations to deal with despite their 51 years of marriage.Alas, it all unravels in abominable cheesy fashion, as expected, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. With a cast this big, don't expect time for character development, but it did have its priceless moments (all thanks to Hathaway, Dane and Cooper). I believe it was also because I saw it in a theater full of people who wanted to have a good time. During the gay parts, especially, you could hear shrieks of delight from the gay group sitting up front and that made it funnier.",Valentine's Day
79,GirishGowda,"Sorry, did not feel the love..!",4,20 May 2010,"I mean, come on! How can a film with so many famous actors even be compelling to watch if it is a romantic film which has a very predictable plot? The things which I liked in the movie were the Bradley Cooper - Julia Roberts angle, Taylor Laytner - Taylor Swift angle and Jennifer Garner is simply very lovable. The Taylors were hilarious.This film interweaves many real people's lives on a single Valentine's Day. Their baggages of previous relationships, breakups, getting back together, getting to love someone new, etc. You know how these things go right? Well, I will describe the 'plot' to you anyway. Anne Hathaway is a phone sex entertainer and her boyfriend doesn't know that, Ashton Kutcher is engaged to Jessica Alba, Jennifer Garner's lover, Patrick Dempsey is married to another woman, Emma Roberts is trying to give her virginity to her boyfriend who is also a virgin, the little boy has a huge crush on his teacher, the Taylors are the typical high school couple, Julia Roberts is a very loving mother, I thought Bradley Cooper played a gay, Jamie Foxx and Jessica Biel hate Valentine's Day, there's also an old couple in love. There's also other stories which I haven't told about here. Pretty standard stuff which would have worked if it was made into separate movies concentrating on their lives much more.Well, I am a 20 year old guy and basically their target audience was me. But, I didn't go to see this movie on Valentine's Day this year as I had no date. The soundtrack for the movie is wonderful. One more thing, I am a huge fan of mushy romantic films where the plot is predictable from start to finish. So, I don't judge a film based on other films most of the time. So, I rented it out last night as there are so many actors I like - Jennifer Garner, Emma Roberts, Julia Roberts, Taylor Swift and Lautner, Jessica Alba, Jamie Foxx, Anne Hathaway. With these many talented actors (whom I like) and more, this is a very mushy film which I really didn't like that much. I don't get it, Ashton Kutcher is not a good actor, but even so, he has millions of fans. This film preaches more, rather than entertaining its audiences. But, Jennifer Garner, Taylors and Cooper-Roberts story was very good. That was the redeeming feature of the movie. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone, except teens and probably newly-weds.4/10",Valentine's Day
80,blrnani,Cannot be accused of false marketing,7,6 March 2019,"This film delivers precisely what it's title suggests - a look at the St Valentine's Day tradition in sunny California. As such, we glimpse the intertwined lives of a very simpatico cast of characters, along with a number of potential scenarios linked to that celebration.
It's not deep, it's not intellectual, but it's a very safe bet to entertain people every year when this day comes around - ideally the weekend before, so they don't forget ;o)
Oh, and there are a couple of interesting twists near the end (no, not the obvious one you probably spotted near the beginning).",Valentine's Day

A cast of thousands all find love even though they're already in relationships and the acting could not be more ""write it in"". Jessica Alba breaks up with Ashton Kutcher and he makes no attempt to get her back and simply accepts the fact that she left him the same day she agreed to marry him with not even getting the least bit upset.Jessica Biel is a gorgeous woman who somehow can't get a date and hates Valentine's day. Julia Roberts is in the army for some reason. Jamie Foxx is just plain bad and there is this ridiculous side story about an 8 year old in love with a grown woman.A sloppy, silly, farcical mess of a movie. Not even cute for a date movie.

82,neenahhh,That's it?,5,16 January 2011,"When I first saw rumors about a movie being made with Emma Roberts, Taylor Swift, Anne Hathaway, Julia Roberts, Taylor Lautner, Jennifer Garner, Ashton Kutcher and the whole lot, I thought it was just a baseless rumor made by some crazy fan. Because seriously, could THAT many A-listed stars share one big screen? Imagine my surprise when I found out that it was true.My initial reaction was, ""OH MY GAAAAHD, SO MANY CELEBRITIES! THIS MUST BE ONE HOT MOVIE!"" I'm sure that my sentiments were shared by many others. Way to go, Hollywood, for making my expectations go sky-high with all those familiar names, and then crushing me with your heel.The first time I saw this movie with my friends, I was left staring at the screen after the end, thinking, ""That's it?"" I don't know what I was expecting, but that definitely wasn't it. I wanted to feel a very fuzzy feeling. Didn't get it, though. But I liked the part with Sean Jackson and Holden Wilson. I was pleasantly surprised. :D WHY DIDN'T THEY KISS, THOUGH?! Is homosexuality seriously still a touchy issue for people? Makes me mad.The couple that I hated were Jessica Biel and that news anchor guy. It just didn't fit in. Whenever they came on, I found my attention waning. I was tempted to skip their parts! Just didn't fit in and it wasn't interesting at all.I thought it was cute when the little school boy had a crush on his teacher. I think that I was also laughing very hard in the theater when Emma Roberts and Carter Jenkins (BOTH FROM UNFABULOUS, I JUST NOTICED!) were having their little scene. That was hilarious. Taylor and Taylor were just so adorable! I loved the high school couples! Overall though, I think my favorite couple was Estelle and Edgar, though. I found that drive-in movie scene sweet. What can I say? I love old people and gay men. :) I really wish that there were more Sean and Holden scenes. :( That last ending scene was not enough! Not the best romance-comedy movie, but I think it could serve as adequate entertainment for two hours and four minutes.I can't decide what I like better. Love Actually or this one. I think Love Actually was better when portraying the issue of love. This one was just popular because of all the A-listed celebrities. Next time someone decides to make a movie, they should think of a good plot BEFORE thinking of which stars to hire.",Valentine's Day
83,AscendeSuperius,It's good just not great,7,7 August 2021,"Was it life changing, well no, but hey, for a Love Actually esqe kind of film, not bad at all. This is probably controversial but I enjoyed it more that Love Actually. However I still do think that it suffers from the format of the film. Having so many storyline happening parallel to each other does prevent one from fully investing into any one storyline. If it were made into a full movie each, I'd have watched most of them and thoroughly enjoy it. Moreover, not all were great. Most were, but some just had way to little air time to even get a full storyline.And thus I'd say, is my life better watching this movie? No. But I'd say that for a romance film, it still does warms my heart.",Valentine's Day
84,MovieProductions,A huge running time and numerous A-list actors don't amount to a great film,5,5 June 2010,"** out of (****)""Valentine's Day"" is the kind of film that has a contrived script, is only occasionally funny, and is so predictable that you'll probably guess the resolution within the first fifteen minutes. It's also the kind of film that has those major shortcomings, so it decides to cover it up with a huge selection of A-list actors, eye-popping visuals, and a massive budget. Although, here's something the director should think about: Why put so much devotion and effort into a film that has been done countless times, when you can show forth this much work in a fresh script and a new start. A unique direction? From Hollywood? That's like Lindsay Lohan asking to play the lead female in ""The Dark Knight"". We both know the answer to both of those situations is a resounding no. And, please. I'm tired of the cliché, ""why can't you just enjoy a movie for what it is?"". So basically, if a film has a lousy script and phony actors, yet it's entertaining, it should be considered high art?I'm not going to go into depth with Valentine's Day's script because it really is pointless. First of all, the script is paper-thin. Second of all, the reason why you want to watch the film is for the A-list actors and to be tugged on your heart strings. So, now I'm talking about the negatives. Besides the weak script and recycled script, I thought that this movie was very dry when it came to humor. I laughed maybe three times at the most? And for a romantic comedy, I only cared about one couple out of like twenty? That has to be a red flag already. To put the icing on the cake, the ending is so embarrassingly cliché and overdone, that you may find yourself shaking your head.Well, at least they're some things going for it. For the first time, we are treated with a few twists and they aren't like bologna, they are some really juicy stuff. Moreover, if you like movies that keep at a fast and constant pace, this one is for you. It never seems to lag or grow tedious. Also, the cinematography is phenomenal. Every scene is polished to the fullest extent. Overall, ""Valentine's Day"" may look flashy and snazzy, but underneath it all, it lacks a backbone. Shoot, Marshall could even fit Lady Gaga in there and it wouldn't enhance the experience or make it unique. I will say that it isn't too bad and there are some things going for it, but anything more than a matinée is not worth your time and money. ""Valentine's Day"" is kind of like a Christmas present. The wrapping may be beautiful and full of style, but once you open the box, there's nothing in it.",Valentine's Day
85,kelvinselimor,Very romantic movie!,10,9 February 2020,Valentine's Day. Very romantic movie! Director Garry Marshall created a truly touching and emotional picture. The story of Edgar and Estelle every time makes you drop a touching tear. Valentine's Day is one of the best films to watch with your soulmate.,Valentine's Day
86,toll-8,A bad movie that is a bit of a laugh,4,28 November 2012,"Valentine's Day is one of those really typical films that uses a well known day across the globe to stitch together a host of famous actors/actresses and thread them loosely together using very thin story threads. Here we have Julia Roberts, Jamie Fox, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Alba, Ahston Kutcher, Jessica Biel, Queen Lafitah, Bradley Cooper, Kathy Bates, Patrick Dempsey, Jennifer Garner, and Topher Grace all in the same film. The surprising thing is despite the amount of names I have just reeled off; there are other well known faces among the crowd. Does this then make Valentine's Day a good film? The answer is no. Does it make Valentine's Day a fun film, which I let wash over me? Yes.The plot interweaves many of these characters so that they all have some connection to each other no matter how small it is. The main thread though seems to be with Ashton Kutcher's character Reed, who proposes to his girlfriend Jessica Alba on the morning of Valentine's Day. She says yes before realising she has made a mistake and leaves. Reed owns the florist in town and it is here that he mopes about his situation and also comes into contact with many of the characters. Here is my attempt at how these threads connect, without giving too much away; Ashton is best friends with Jennifer Garner who is in a relationship with Patrick Dempsey but doesn't know he is married, however Ashton finds out and tries to tell her. Jennifer is the teacher of a young boy whose grandparents are looking after him. This boy has also met Ashton as he is trying to get a bunch of flowers sent to his valentine. Jennifer is also friends with Jessica Biel, who hates Valentine's Day, and is the PR for Eric Dane's pro-footballer who announces he is gay. Due to this Biel is chased by news reporter Jamie Foxx who wants an exclusive. Eric Dane's agent is then Queen Latifah who employs as her receptionist, Anne Hathaway who moonlights as an adult phone entertainer. Hathaway is in a new relationship with Topher Grace who ends up meeting the young boys Grandfather. On top of this we have school kids attempting to lose their 'v' plates and two people having a chance meeting on a plane. I hope that was easy to follow. There is no major through thread other than that all these people's stories interconnect. It seems to start on Kutcher but there is a big gap in the middle where his thread isn't seen so perhaps they just got his part out the way first.The connections are done rather well but they are slightly generic and something a British audience would have seen before in the much better Love Actually. The stories fail to ever really connect emotionally other than a smaller one right at the end. If anything the better threads are the daft ones such as Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift's relationship which is just kissing lots in the school field, or Emma Robert's pursuit at losing her virginity. The stories that are supposed to tug at your heart strings don't so much and instead seem rather contrived. I may have said the connections are done well but that is only with some of them, others are done so blatantly in order to get them to meet and seem very set up. Then again there are a ridiculous number of stories they are trying to connect.Some of the emotional problems come from the fact that the actors aren't in the mood to step it up a gear. It is one of those typical films with a large cast who have such little screen time that they just play their own selves. It really seems like the performances are for the pay check instead of the morality. One thing that really annoyed me was the scene with Jamie Foxx playing keyboard when it was obvious he wasn't playing it. Why have him act like he is playing the keyboard when you can quite simply remove the keyboard playing all together. It is moments like these that show the lack of enthusiasm gone into the film.It is a bad film but I did watch it not giving much of a care, meaning that I actually quite enjoyed some moments. There are a few laughs to enjoy and some emotion right at the end, involving two characters that seemed throw away at the start. If you watch this expecting to see something good you will view it as garbage but if you view it expecting garbage you may find it to be alright. It will never win any awards, or many plaudits, but to watch if you're chilling out as a daft naff film that you like than you won't be so disappointed.2 / 5",Valentine's Day
87,Joejoesan,"This ain't a movie, but a big cameo show!",3,9 May 2010,"As a movie loving male I enjoy a good romantic film (The Notebook, Definitely Maybe, Notting Hill). As a matter of fact, even if they're not that good I usually like watching them (Maid in Manhattan). Enter Valentine's Day. Well, I watched the whole 100 (or so) minutes but I must confess that I haven't seen such a bad movie in a long while. This is utter crap!The story is about a whole bunch of ordinary people (played by big Hollywood celebrities) who are trying to cope with love on Valentine's Day. Most of the story lines are pretty predictable and I think Ashton Kutcher gets most of the screen time. Too bad his role is the dullest of them all. Jessica Alba, Jennifer Garner...there are so many big Hollywood stars playing in this movie that watching this film turns into playing a movie trivia popquiz. Hey, who's that? That could be... Joe Mantagna? Mister McDreamy? My God, that's Taylor Swift. But why did she get this role while it's obvious she can't act? And so on. As a European this thing about being alone on Valentine's Day seems too fabricated. Everyone knows Valentine's Day was created (and kept alive) by commercial parties. It doesn't have a real heart like Christmas or even Thanksgiving Day. Making a problem out of Valentine's Day therefor seems so far fetched. I didn't buy it. Like I can't buy the fact that a girl like Jessica Biel is still single in this story. She hasn't been dating for so long that she even organises an Anti-Valentine's Day party every year. Mmm, can you believe that?Garry Marshall gave us the surprise hit Pretty Woman. He gave us the immensely adorable Frankie and Johnny. But Valentine's Day sucks big time. It's a far cry from the brilliant Love Actually (to which it will always be compared I'm sure) - a movie that actually gets better every time you see it. There was only one storyline that I thought was exciting to watch, though. Brad Cooper meets soldier (!) Julia Roberts on a plane and you start wondering why he doesn't hit on her. In the end you find out why. I could see the Julia Roberts part coming. But the outcome of Brad Cooper's storyline was a real surprise.3/10",Valentine's Day

89,montera_iulian,Not the best Valentine Movie but one of the most enjoyable!,6,30 April 2010,"This movie has something that many other Valentine movies don't have and that is a great great cast, but just the cast doesn't make the movie great. The movie is based on some couples and their Valentine experience and I must admit It covers most of the problems and funny moments, tho some are pretty cheesy. What makes this movie enjoyable is that it's a very entertaining movie, probably because of the cast which makes you like the movie just because you love to see these actors all together but it it has also a nice delivery and presentation.Other than that, the acting was not over-acted and it was perfect for this Valentine flick because it's not suppose to hit you with that melodramatic acting, I mean for this type of movie you need it at one point to be cheesy especially if you watch it with your chick (I mean hell... who watches it without her?)... The cinematography and screen capture was good and the music fits the personality of this movie.What I Hate about it? TAYLOR SWIFT!!!... Taylor Lautner?.... What?... Some couples that don't make sense and you're obvious not that interested in... and the dialogue which sometimes gets TOO predictable and lame. The point is the movie is great for a Valentine's Day and that was it's target to be enjoyable and to get a big audience in that period of time. It's not a movie you would watch a second time (unless you are some Jessica Alba or Biel stalker) but I recommend it at least once just to... feel better.",Valentine's Day
90,EmDee-427-469344,"""Love Actually"" has a younger copycat sibling and it's ugly",1,14 February 2014,"As said in the Summary, this film is trying to imitate Love Actually (LA) and failing abysmally.People of all generations with love interests and stories etc that are only there to draw a crowd of all ages. Except for the teen-aged love stories which are absent in LA and might as well have been absent here too - blatantly obvious they are only there to further Taylor Swift's singing career (since she can't act and her song is in it).This film has too many characters and spends too little time on most of the relationships for them to even matter in the scheme of things.In addition to this the producers of this film were unoriginal when naming characters and the plots for said characters: A male chasing after a female in the clichéd airport scene where he hopes to not regret telling her something (also done in LA). A character named Julia in this and a character named Juliet in LA. A character named Kara in this character named Karen in LA. A character named Harrison in this who is cheating on his wife and a character named Harry in LA who is cheating on his wife. A phone sex operator in this and two porn stars in LA for ""comedy"" (done better in LA). A single parent in this and a single parent in LA. A child who says he needs to tell his love interest how he feels by himself when asked if he needs help (done in both).This film threw in a token gay relationship which was really quite pointless and was akin to the president in LA and the staffer when their relationship was made public. They didn't even have the guys kissing or anything - maybe the actors didn't want to, but this makes it unbelievable and apparently ""token"". Talking of token, both this and LA have the token ""dark skin tone and white skin tone"" relationships with adults and children.The people in this film fell in love so quickly it was ridiculous and went out on dates just because they had no one...typical Hollywood agenda there.",Valentine's Day

But instead it was about random people doing random things.First off it, whoa my head is spinning just trying to put the movie into some kind of order.... you know what I'll just list:1. Makes no sense that all these people will magically interact with each other; Los Angeles is a BIG CITY. It has MANY people in it and flower shops.2. The people's actions make no sense; A solider getting 1 day off for THIS holiday!? A guy allowing the ""love of his life"" to date another man. A boss being so mean yet understanding at the same time. A man being so shallow yet so deep. Why did the woman suddenly admit to her husband she cheated? WHAT? More confusion.3. ah who cares....I'm just tired trying to even review this movie. It's like describing a dog's cr@p to someone. It's so disgusting, why do it? You know it's a piece of $#!t.

92,MetalAngel,"An awful film, simple as that.",1,7 June 2010,"Valentine's day will from now on remind me of three things: a) that special day where people are free to express their love for their partners as cornily as they want, b) that rueful day where partner-less people are forced to endure those who are in love and their corny clichés, and c) that awful film called ""Valentine's Day"" which Garry Marshall has managed to inflict upon unsuspecting audiences and therefore transformed one of the cutest holidays around into a bad experience. Yes, it's THAT bad. Marshall had earned the respect of his fellow filmmakers and audiences with cute, poignant films such as ""Pretty Woman"", ""Runaway Bride"" and ""The Princess Diaries"", but his latest ""Valentine's Day"" will have people worldwide fleeing the Cineplexes in terror from now on.The movie features no less than twenty-one famous actors and actresses acting badly, portraying (according to them) a mosaic of interconnected Los Angeles couples during Valentine's Day. Spare me the emotional exhaustion of describing them all, and don't even think I remember a single one of the characters' names (it isn't even worth the effort to look them up in IMDb.com). All of the story lines are messed up, all the characters are flat and unimportant, all the actors do a bad job (but what can you expect when they're all fighting for some screen time?), and the film, which runs for a little over two hours never accomplishes a single emotional or romantic moment.I'll try enumerating those story lines I've been unfortunate to remember. Let's see...there's Ashton Kutcher who's a florist in the busiest day of the year and who's proposed to his girlfriend, Jessica Alba, and there's Jennifer Garner who's his best friend and who's boyfriend, Patrick Dempsey, is a busy doctor (I chuckle at the ""Gray's Anatomy"" reference). Um, there's Emma Roberts who goes about planning on having sex for the first time in a coldly-calculating and repulsive way, and she's the babysitter of some cute kid whose grandparents are Shirley MacLaine and Hector Elizondo. There's Topher Grace whose girlfriend is Anne Hathaway, who's a phone sex playgirl and who works for Queen Latifah, who in turn works with Jessica Biel managing the life of Eric Dane who's (not a doctor!) a football player. Umm...there's Jamie Foxx, whose boss is Kathy Bates; there's Bradley Cooper and Julia Roberts who meet on a plane and there's Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift who are a high-school couple. Oh, and there's George Lopez, who's Ashton Kutcher's confidante and co-worker. There! Make sense? Don't worry if it doesn't, cause it's just as unimportant as the film.Many people have gone wild comparing and contrasting this abysmal movie with Richard Curtis' ""Love Actually"" (which is another romantic film about couples), but they ALL agree in the fact that Curtis' film is actually poignant, has an excellent characterization, involves us in the lives of each of the couples and reaches over to audiences...while ""Valentine's Day"" repels us, feels too long, is boring, and makes us wonder what the heck so many good actors and actresses where thinking when they accepted the part. I mean, I wanna shake the likes of Julia Roberts, Kathy Bates, Anne Hathaway and Shirley MacLaine! Why go along with this self-degradation?! Was it because of the money? Was it because of the famous actors? And even if they had minuscule eight-minute parts, didn't Judi Dench win an Oscar once for an eight-minute performance? So many excellent, Academy Award-winning thespians, and you can't squeeze one minute of true emotion from any of them! I mean, I can understand Garry Marshall's reason for doing the film. He got the screenplay written by Katherine Fugate (""The Prince and Me"") which was bound to appeal to brain-dead tween girls even through its rancid-ness. Then he called some of his long-time actors such as Julia Roberts, Hector Elizondo and Anne Hathaway and convinced them to act in it; then he got the rest of the famous actors convincing them that a star-studded romantic mosaic would hit the pot of gold with audiences; he added Taylor Swift, who would win over every tween in the world; and finally he decided to screen it on Valentine's Day to attract the love-struck couples with big names and a romantic plot. I can see those poor, embezzled beaus who were no-doubt dragged into the Cineplex by their V-day dates, and the hoards of girl-friends who went arm in arm to see this latest chick-flick. I tell you, it's amazing what young people will subject themselves to just to see their favorite stars in the same movie.Frankly, I have no idea why I stuck to the end of this film. I'd like to say I stood bravely till the end just to see if the film could redeem itself during the last scenes, but I suppose it's much more dramatic to say that I was so horror-struck by how silly the movie is that I simply couldn't move. I can't give a film zero stars, so I'll justify the half-star I gave ""Valentine's Day"" with the facts that a) Julia Roberts doesn't demean herself much in the only mediocre role there is, b) Anne Hathaway has an amusing Russian accent when talking to one of her phone sex clients, and c) Taylor Swift's song ""Today was a Fairytale"", which was written exclusively for the movie, wasn't half bad.Rating: Half a star out of 4.",Valentine's Day

Well, we will never know what the Tiger Year brings but ""Valentine's Day"" the film is so predictable, contrived and clichéd that it probably describes the celebration itself.""Valentine's Day"" is set in Los Angeles where love and heartbreaks are intertwined all within those 24 hours. Florist Reed Bennett (Ashton Kutcher) proposes to his girlfriend Morley (Jessica Alba) and he is all excited about it. His best friend Julia (Jennifer Garner) is having an affair with Dr Harrison Copeland (Patrick Dempsey), while talent agent in training Josh Morris (Topher Grace) has just met the receptionist Liz (Anne Hathaway), who moonlights as a phone sex entertainer.Meanwhile 10-year-old Edison (Bryce Robinson) who is one of Julia's pupils, wants to send flowers to his Valentine; his grandparents Estelle (Shirley MacLaine) and Edgar (Hector Elizondo) also have a surprise after being married for so long. And up in the air, an off-duty soldier (Julia Roberts) travels from afar just to spend one day with someone she loves...Watching this film is like spending Valentine's Day with the 'Who's Who' of Hollywood. There are so many big-name performers here that you will be struggling to name them - unless you are a star-gazer yourself. However, instead of being distracting, it is kinda fun - especially if you are fans of say, Grey's Anatomy, and get thrilled by seeing its famous doctors on screen.And while the script may be predictable, it is only fair to say that writer Katherine Fugate has a few nice surprises up her sleeves too. Overall, Valentine's Day is about flowers, candy and fluff. And this see-and-forget movie is a guilty pleasure. - by LIM CHANG MOH (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",Valentine's Day

I'm to old to waste time. Clock's a tickin.",Valentine's Day
95,Supachewy,A Pure Piece of Hollywood Fluff,3,9 October 2010,"The romantic comedy Valentine's Day is directed by Garry Marshall and stars (breathes in) Jessica Alba, Kathy Bates, Jessica Biel, Bradley Cooper, Eric Dane, Patrick Dempsey, Hector Elizondo, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Topher Grace, Anne Hathaway, Carter Jenkins, Ashton Kutcher, Queen Latifah, Taylor Lautner, George Lopez, Shirley MacLaine, Emma Roberts, Julia Roberts, Bryce Robinson, and Taylor Swift. Excuse me for a moment while I catch my breath. The film takes place in modern day Los Angeles.The film is about all these people's romantic lives on valentine's day and how so many of them have problems. Ashton Kutcher's character finds out that Jennifer Garner's character's boyfriend Patrick Dempsey's character is really married. By the way I am not going to look up the names of the actual characters because I could never remember any of their names during the film. Topher Grace's character is dating Anne Hathaway's character but he does not realize that she is a phone sex operator. Ashton Kutcher's character proposed to Jessica Alba's character and she said yes. Emma Roberts's character and Carter Jenkins's character are trying to have sex for the first time. Julia Roberts's character and Bradley Cooper's character are sitting next to each other on a plane for 14 hours. I can't even get through the rest of the plots there are just too many.Alright, now the screenplay for this film is quite terrible. When I think ensemble cast I think around six stories max. This one had over ten. Now with so many stories one is not able to get attached to any of the characters because they are all so paper thin just like their stories. The only way to get attached to the character is just saying how much you like Ashton Kutcher in real life so I am going to like him in the movie. The film was extremely corny and was an audience pleaser, it was pure fluff.The direction for this film was also pretty bad. I was not able to get attached to any character, now that was mostly due to the thin screenplay but if I was the director I would say how we need to cut a few of these stories and strengthen the others. Nothing at all was impressive from the direction shot wise, like the writing it was pure fluff as well.The acting for this film is decent, but it is hard to judge really with the limited screen time each actor had. I am just going to say that none of them did a terrible job except for Taylor Swift, Taylor Lautner, and Carter Jenkins. I'm sure the real reason most of the actors are in this film is because they got a decently large check for not that much work. None of them ever really made me laugh or feel moved so they are also at fault.Overall I give this film a 3/10. I would recommend this to anyone who likes light romantic comedies where you don't need to think about it afterwords.",Valentine's Day
96,Jules45,If this film got a pound for every cliché used then it would make more than at the box office.,2,14 February 2010,"After the critical kicking this film has received it might feel like the next two hours of your life will be wasted. Well you're almost right. The clichés in this film are unbelievably frequent and it often feels unbearable at points but the (dare I say it?) emotive ending makes the effort of watching just worth it.Valentine's Day is basically giving Love Actually the finger by making the cast bigger, prettier and well that's about it. But this film sadly doesn't juggle the characters as effectively and the massive amount of cast makes it difficult to particularly emphasize with any of them. Also the characters are either scarcely used or so overused that it becomes unbearable or in Taylor Swift's case embarrassing to watch them - sorry love but that dance routine was funny for 3 seconds tops.So the acting is dismal but what about the plot? Don't expect a massive amount of improvement here, the lack of fresh ideas and surprises prove to be severe speed bumps in the story. If the audience hadn't laughed at everything considered 'funny' then this would have undoubtedly been given 1 out of 5 but because of this, the abysmal narrative felt watchable. Admittedly some ideas feel fresh but then return to the clichés roots they came from, which is a shame considering what the cast and director have clearly established themselves of being capable off.",Valentine's Day
97,ron-fernandez-pittsburgh,Not the greatest...BUT,6,19 May 2010,"VALENTINES DAY is far from the greatest romantic comedy ever made, BUT it does have some enjoyable moments and doesn't deserve the bad rap the critics and most movie goers have said. It is a bit long and sometimes difficult to get all the characters sorted out with several of them quite under-developed. On the plus side most of the acting is fun and delightful, especially ANNE HATHAWAY as the (SPOILER ALERT) ""adult phone entertainer"". And JENNIFER GARNER'S restaurant scene is a classic bit of comic genius. The best of the lot however, is the always great JULIA ROBERTS. A pity she didn't have more screen time. Her story is the best and her last scene is wonderful...worth the ""price of admission"" Movies like this and say, CRASH, depend on lots of circumstances and are quite unbelivalbe, but they are movies and no one expects actual reality in movies, otherwise why would one see them? A wonderful homage to JULIA ROBERTS and BRADLEY COOPER for those in the KNOW. On the plane as seat mates the pilot announces that the weather in their destination, Los Angeles is clear after THREE DAYS OF RAIN. Both Julia and Bradley appeared on Broadway a few years back in ""Three Days of Rain"". Another ""inside"" joke is during the credits in the outtakes or deleted scenes, the driver of the limo tells the Julia Robets character ""This is Rodeo Drive. Have you ever shopped here"". Julia responds with ""Oh yes. It was a mistake. A big mistake. Huge"". Well we all know that's a line from her breakthrough film PRETTY WOMAN. Another inside job is in the cemetery scene where the movie showing is an old SHIRLEY MCLAINE film when she was an ingénue. She's seen as she is now against the old movie and her young self. Very clever indeed. DO see this movie and enjoy it for what it is and not for what it should be.",Valentine's Day
98,Andreapworth,Not deep but really fun,7,27 June 2010,"Having read all the negative reviews, I see their point. SO MUCH TALENT and they wanted more. Which is something I understand, but honestly, it was a cute, enjoyable film to watch.No, you couldn't tell where some plots were heading, but that was enjoyable. The two Taylors were a big grin and Kutcher's desperate love was enjoyable and showed some of his acting chops.The fun twist with Foxx and the quarterback was enjoyable, as well as the surprise ending to the quarterback's 'steady'. Couldn't see that one coming.Enjoyed Anne Hathaway's turn as a woman making money any way she can to repay school loans. And the final happy ending that turned out with her sticky situation.So yes, Love Actually was more complete, but don't turn your nose up at this one. It's a fun, enjoyable time. And really liked the last few words that Julia had to say about shopping on Rodeo Drive, almost verbatim from that other film with Garry Marshall.",Valentine's Day
99,moviesaccordingtodes,Valentine's Day made me want to punch cupid,3,21 October 2010,"I have found something newly popular in today's movies, a plot where all of the characters and plots intertwine. We find this method quite successful in Love Actually and Vantage Point. Though I do like this idea a lot, it was a failed attempt in Valentine's Day. There were so many different characters and story lines that it took too long to rotate them all. By the time they got to characters we saw a while ago, it makes you say ""oh yeah, I forgot about them"".This film consisted of an all star cast. I am not quite sure if it was to accomplish a fun loving film or if it was begging for viewers. Either way it was overkill. The begging of viewers was blatantly obvious with the pairing of Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner as a couple in High School. As everyone is well aware, they are a real life item.Valentine's Day was much too long. Two hours! And did anyone else notice it is eerily similar to He's Just Not That Into You? Interesting.None of the characters were exactly likable. The soundtrack was though! There weren't exactly shockers in the movie but there were a few moments that made me go ""oh. Hmmm. I never would have guessed."" And then I went back to not caring.",Valentine's Day
100,CindyH,"Cute, but overshadowed.",5,19 February 2010,"I'm not going to go into a long spiel about the movie, nor am I going to bore you with a synopsis that so many do instead of actually reviewing the movie.Overall it was a really cute movie. I laughed, I cried. It moved quickly without speeding through, but also didn't drag. It's a great date movie and I like the fact that sex wasn't in your face even though it was a romantic movie.That said, it is way too Hollywood for me. I don't mean too many stars because let us be fair, most of those were not real stars but just trendy attractive actors. In 10 years we'll see who is still around.Instead I'm talking about the typical Hollywood in-your-face social issues parade. We've got homosexuality, inter-racial marriage, cultural diversity ... and the list goes on. Puh-leez! We want a great story, not someone's politically correct agenda here. I'm not saying that I'm against all of that, I'm just against forcing it into a film where it doesn't fit properly. A story is like a jigsaw puzzle. You have to put the pieces together neatly. However this story seems to just throw it all together without making it sensible, like forcing the pieces in there when the fit isn't really right to begin with.Nope. It's a cute film, but not a great one. Love Actually, even with it's ""I hate America"" speech, was done so much better. It had moments that were just amazing; the Colin Firth restaurant scene simply cannot be competed with. All in all, I give it 5 of 10.",Valentine's Day
101,magee-42745,Heart Warming Romantic Comedy,9,17 February 2018,Some people give this movie bad reviews....but I don't know why. Yes there are lots of famous people and the plot/people can get confusing at times. But seriously it is so cute and will warm your heart. I just watched this on Valentine's Day and my wife and I loved it. EXTRA: Taylor Swift dances in this movie and it is pretty magical.,Valentine's Day
102,femaleanimefan,"Not that bad, but definitely not a must see",4,13 February 2010,"I hate romantic comedies, so I didn't have high hopes for this movie. The reviews were bad, the trailer didn't look promising, so I went in expecting to hate it.I didn't. But I didn't like it too much either. It had a few sweet moments, a few mildly funny moments, but it ultimately was too predictable and had too many stars. I could tell what was going to happen in every storyline. Nothing surprised me. There was nothing new or fresh, which I expected.The actors are, honestly, mostly charming in their roles, but aren't given enough screen time to build on that charm. They are all good-looking, likable performers, but they are given absolutely nothing to work with. I would say the best performance would have to go to Jennifer Garner, who has a few funny moments but a completely uninteresting storyline. The worst would definitely have to be Taylor Swift. I don't hate the girl, but even playing an airhead bimbo, she is awful. She completely overacts, and I didn't laugh once. Taylor Lautner isn't too bad, he at least pokes fun at himself but he is still pretty stiff. There are tons of other stars who turn in admirable work (I particularly enjoyed the Bradley Cooper and Julia Roberts scenes), but are otherwise wasted. But Jessica Alba, who is top-billed, is only in about four scenes! She isn't even the greatest actress, but she had absolutely nothing to do.If you want a good date movie, I don't recommend this one. It is definitely an inferior version of the imperfect but ultimately heartfelt Love, Actually. While it wasn't as horrible as I thought it would be, the script is too weak and there are too many story lines. I say skip it.",Valentine's Day
103,Dunkaccino,An all-star copycat,5,11 February 2021,"I am gonna be true here. I have read Roger Ebert's review of this film and it is exactly what i thought about this film. You can just visit there.This film's plot is way too much to explain. Just look at the cast. Julia Roberts, Bradley Cooper, Taylor Swift. Sort of like Love Actually right? Cause that's exactly what Valentine's Day is.The same things of these two films include a cheating husband, a kid falling in love, a public figure's relationship life, a man breaking in the airport just to say thing to his (girl)friend and a TV star.The problem of this film is they force way too much relationship into the characters. Love Actually, on the other hand, did not make this mistake.However there are some unexpected moments in this film. Not gonna lie they shocked me a little.I'd rather watch Love Actually twice than watch this commercially successful, unnecessarily long, all-star date movie. Think carefully.",Valentine's Day

105,TomCruiseFan99,A guy's review... and I loved it!,10,16 February 2010,"With the huge assemblance of well-known faces, it's easy to dismiss this romantic comedy as a shameless rip-off of ""Love, Actually"" and, to a lesser extent, ""He's Just Not That Into You"", but personally, I see it as more of a companion piece. Mining similar patterns, of interweaving multiple-character plot lines, it might seem clichéd at first, but I found it to be quite surprising at times and highly enjoyable. Is it schmaltzy? Yes. Is it contrived and hokey? I didn't think so.Of course, there has to be bits of cheesiness, 'cos it's dealing with the subject matter of romance, on the most contrived holiday of all, but the film handled it smoothly I thought. And yes, some of the time, you could see who'd end up with whom, but a lot of the character arcs still managed to go down unpredictable paths.The performances from the wide array of stars were all impressive, although some were under-utilised, most notably Jessica Alba, Queen Latifah and Patrick Dempsey. But the way the remainder of the cast all managed to click was a testament to these actors and actresses all seemingly having a great time together. The most impressive performers were Jennifer Garner and Jessica Biel, while Anne Hathaway definitely had some of the funniest scenes.So while the movie is set in only one day, it's interesting to see who'll find love, who'll lose love, and who'll hold on to their love. Definitely a team effort, I thought the movie worked on every level, and from a guy's point of view, there are sufficient belly laughs to be had mixed in with the romantic quotient, so it's certainly a romantic comedy well worth watching.",Valentine's Day
106,east-emerald,"The angst, anxiety and ambivalence caused by Feb.14th",4,25 May 2010,"With about 25 highly recognizable names and interconnected story lines that orbit an upcoming holiday, ""Valentine's Day"" has been compared mostly negatively to 2003's ""Love Actually"". ""Love Actually"" starred just about every British actor/actress I would expect average American movie goers to easily recognize, took place during the weeks before Christmas and chronicled the loves and losses of a group of Londoners. ""Valentine's Day"" is set in L.A. and you get the feeling of different ""types"" all bumping up against each other (in cute ways of course, no ""Crash"" like edginess simmering in this large multi-ethnic L.A.). The most outright accusation I can make of ripping off ""Love Actually"" is the presence of an overly serious adult like child who is struggling to express his feelings to a first love. He has the absent mother too and all of the cute bells and whistles that are expected. Not to antagonize a child actor, but I did find Thomas Sangster in ""Love Actually"" cuter and just a tad bit more precocious without going overboard. Most of the individual stories in ""Valentine's Day"" are fairly predictable. For example we have a ""running through the airport"" scene which I would love one day to see played out with the character tasered, facing charges and on a nefarious no fly list. With that said, there are some charms. Anne Hathaway as a young woman juggling a temp job, a new boyfriend and a secret live as a phone sex operator made me laugh out loud a few times but I was a bit disappointed that the boyfriend (Topher Grace) immediately wanted to break up with her when he found out about the phone sex job. I can't be the only person who would think that was titillating and let's be honest, cool. My final estimation is that if you are ever faced with just these two choices on movie night, choose ""Love Actually"". Now that will probably never happen; so rent ""Love Actually"" and wait for ""Valentine's Day"" to show up on cable. One more thing (spoiler alert), despite what the trailer may show, Bradley Cooper and Julia Roberts' characters are not hooking up.......",Valentine's Day
107,cl777,A romantic comedy that is neither romantic nor funny,5,26 February 2010,"Valentine's Day, Garry Marshall's (Pretty Woman) latest movie packs in an all star cast. In alphabetical order: Jessica Alba, Kathy Bates, Jessica Biel, Bradley Cooper, Eric Dane and Patrick Dempsey from Grey's Anatomy, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Topher Grace, Anne Hathaway, Ashton Kutcher, Queen Latifah, Taylor Lautner (Twilight), Shirley MacLaine, Julia Roberts, Taylor Swift and more, all share the spotlight in this messy romantic comedy. Unfortunately, an ensemble as strong as this one does not suffice to make Valentine's Day a film worth seeing.If you are expecting a light, airy, fun romantic comedy like I was you will be disappointed because this was neither very romantic nor very funny. Everywhere you look you will see a beautiful, famous, smiling actor but the film is extremely shallow with a terrible plot and very little character development. We follow the intertwining lives and love tribulations of many different couples and singles as they handle the joys, and mostly the burdens, of Valentine's Day. Lots of people are saying it and it is true, the film is a knock-off of Love Actually, except much worse.Ashton Kutcher, a heartbroken florist, and Jennifer Garner who plays his best friend, have the most screen time. Their acting is typical and what is happening to them remotely interesting compared to the dozen or so other subplots. But the scene where Garner pretends to be a waitress to confront her lying boyfriend (who proceeds to choke on his drink, what else...) while he is having a meal with his wife was just too much. Anne Hathaway as an undercover phone sex entertainer was absurd, as was Queen Latifah, her boss who overhears a raunchy conversation but lets her carry on and even takes a call herself. Bradley Cooper's character, though charming, was absolutely not credible- from his sweet, flirtatious interactions with Julia Roberts on the plane, to the final surprise revelation. The teenage high school couples were dreadful to watch, especially the part where one of the boys gets caught naked with only a guitar for cover by his girlfriend's mother. Like the rest of the cast, even the cute, little boy had a ridiculously predictable role and it was clear from the start who he was in love with. It's a pity to see so much talent go to waste, particularly Julia Roberts who really does not belong in this chaos.The second half of the movie was even worse than the first and started veering towards the outrageous during a male bashing dinner party that single and disgruntled Jessica Biel hosts yearly (who organizes an ""I hate Valentine's Day"" dinner in the same room as a wedding is taking place???). Things really started to go downhill for me at that point and the last 30 minutes or so I was literally rolling my eyes to myself.There were too many actors, too many side plots, none of which were engaging or developed enough. Of course, everything ties together nicely and neatly at the end, like a Valentine's Day gift with a bow. But don't be fooled, this movie is no present. If you have nothing better to do, go ahead and watch it. Otherwise, treat yourself to a nice romantic evening with your loved one or by yourself. It will be time much better spent.My rating: 5 Please visit http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com and become a follower to read more reviews!",Valentine's Day
108,46yroldmale,Modern love stories,6,19 June 2010,"Hiding behind the facade of being the perfect politically correct movie, as it turns out this may have been the most ironic movie of the year. The film does a wonderful and sensitive job of showing how gay relationships are as sweet as heterosexual relationships, evoking the pain as well as the potential of fulfilled romance in coming out. The irony, of course is that all the marketing of the movie is toward the film being a heterosexual Valentines Day movie; ""She said yes!"". Why keep that aspect of the film behind closed doors? If it was because they were looking for a ""Crying Game"" type moment it would be understandable, but I think in 2010 we are way beyond gay being shocking, and it would be wrong headed to think the movie would have you come away thinking that a loving, gay relationship is supposed to be anything less than natural.",Valentine's Day

It was so sugary and mushy-mushy from beginning itself that audience hardly find any connection.Almost all actors were irritating but Jennifer Garner and Jessica Biel tops the list. In my opinion, role and performance of Anne Hathaway was the best. Good actors like Kathy Bates, Julia Roberts and Queen Latifah were completely wasted in minute roles. Country Music star Taylor Swift should better stick to her music talent though she as teenage charm as shown in the movie.Apart from weak in every aspect the soundtrack was run of the mill and boring.

110,mysteryfan04,Some Romantic Comedies Just Aren't Meant to Be...,4,28 August 2010,"This latest rom-com features remarkable talent who deserve better material. Valentine's Day follows an ensemble of characters falling in and out of love on Valentine's Day. That is IT. The film has no proper narrative, and is out of touch with the real world (e.g. Anne Hathaway's character talking dirty in the middle of the street on her phone). Every character and story is clichéd and predictable. The plot is misguided and implausible, even offensive at times (you'll see what I mean). Attempts to provoke laughter nearly always fail simply because the dialogue is bland and the scenes are unrealistic. Despite some enjoyable moments, the film has too thin of a plot to fully engage you. The film has too many characters and as a result, the ending feels unbearably dragged out.

I began repeatedly staring at my watch about an hour into the mess. Most of the stories were predictable, vacuous and lacked any sort of emotional depth. The old couple and elementary school kid's plot has been done to death a million times before, and the resolution of Ashton Kutcher's and Jennifer Garner's dilemma was at least twenty minutes too long. I only enjoyed the Julia Roberts' plot line, but its short penultimate scene does not alone make a good movie. Especially when you have to sit through a scene as ridiculous as the one with the black and white movie in the cemetery. If you really want to see this movie, I suggest it's better to wait for the DVD rental.",Valentine's Day
112,katie-sirles,"Love Actually 2... er... I mean, Valentine's Day",4,20 January 2011,"Love Actually 2 I mean, Valentine's Day gee, slip of the tongue. But seriously folks, this movie was like a bad sequel to Love Actually. Or a movie that was trying desperately to be what Love Actually was. The two movies are very much the same in the sense that they both follow the many stories of the star-studded cast. Everyone is falling into and out of love.The difference between the two is that in Love Actually, the audience is given a chance to see the back story on the characters. We get to know them — and for the most part — love them. In Valentine's Day, there are so many people crammed into this film that we barely learn their names before someone else is introduced.Let's get this out of the way I am drawing in a deep breath here is the list of characters for you: Jessica Alba as Morley Clarkson, Jessica Biel as Kara Monahan, Bradley Cooper as Holden Wilson, Eric Dane as Sean Jackson, Patrick Dempsey as Dr. Harrison Copeland, Hector Elizondo as Edgar, Jamie Foxx as Kelvin Moore, Jennifer Garner as Julia Fitzpatrick, Topher Grace as Jason, Anne Hathaway as Liz Another breath Carter Jenkins as Alex, Ashton Kutcher as Reed Bennet, Queen Latifah as Paula Thomas, Taylor Lautner as Willy, George Lopez as Alphonso, Shirley MacLaine as Estelle, Emma Roberts as Grace, Julia Roberts as Captain Kate Hazeltine, Taylor Swift as Felicia enough! Sheesh! Was it necessary to enlist the majority of the so-so actors in Hollywood? Throw in a couple of really big names and some eye candy for the boys and girls and you've got a hit, right? Wrong! Wrong. A thousand times wrong.I find it completely unnecessary to delve deeply into the plot of this movie because, well, the ""plot"" was a rampageous mess. Most of the scenes are cut before they feel like they are finished. It would appear, most of the time, that a character in a given scene is just about to say something when we're snapped to another scene with another mismatched pair.Beware, below there are exorbitantly predictable spoilers. Dun dun dun Dr. Harrison Copeland (Dempsey) plays a two-timer who is messing around with Julia (Garner) but happens to be married. He leaves Julia to go do heart surgery on Valentine's Day but actually goes to his palatial home where he greets his kid and wife. As he begins juggling for the youngin' his wife says, and I quote: ""Doesn't daddy juggle well?"" Barf. Later in the film, after Julia discovers the truth, she beats the candy out of heart-shaped piñata and then sits down huffing and puffing and says ""Now that's open heart surgery."" har har har.Reed (Kutcher) proposes to his girlfriend, Morley (Alba) Valentine's Day morn, and is dumped by his new fiancé the same day. Kara (Biel) is planning her annual Valentine's Day haters party. Taylor Swift shouldn't quit her day job. Taylor Lautner shouldn't open his mouth  Sorry, I fell out of my chair and knocked myself unconscious on the boring plot that is still lingering in the room.Readers, please if you take only one piece of advice from me, let it be this: skip this movie. Skip it. Leap over it with all of your might. When you hit the ground on the other side, run as fast as you can.To be fair, there is one endearing moment in this hodge podge of plot that juts out every which way. The cute young boy in the movie who can't help but be in love (did someone say Love Actually?) is in bed at the end of the film. After a 14-hour flight, his mother who has been away in the service, Captain Kate Hazeltine (Roberts), comes in. They share a warm embrace and this is the only one moment when I am actually feeling touched.What can I say? I'm a sucker for kids.I am most thankful for the fact that Valentine's Day was only 125 minutes long. Had it been 126 minutes long, I would write off romcoms from here to eternity.

It's packed-full of movie stars without a lot to do, with minimal character and story development, with every cliché in the book. It fails because we just don't care. We never get involved in the story and never get to root for any of the characters in their quest for love. The writers, directors, producers obviously thought that the film was so packed full of stars that charisma alone would carry it and simply sat back and waited for something to happen. It doesn't!

115,wwefreakjon,Not that Bad,7,12 February 2010,"Is it corny? Yes. Is it incredibly predictable? Yes. Does it to heavily rely on its all star cast? Definitely. Does it work as a romantic date movie? Without a doubt. This corny tear jerking star studded romantic comedy is one of the best in recent years and is perfect if you are looking for some unbelievable comedy. The plot is well confusing. It has a dozen different components ranging from Aston Kutcher proposing and being dumped by Jessica Alba to Anne Hathaway having a secret job as an ""adult conversational phone partner"" to pay off student loans. It is unbelievable how many plots there are in this movie and despite a truly terrible one coming from Taylor Lautner and Swift they fit together pretty well. They start off having very little relation to each other but in the end you see all the puzzle pieces come into place and create some heart wrenching moments. The secret to this movie is how it was able to overcome the biggest challenge that faces all romantic comedies; the cliché. Most romantic comedies fall into this trap and can never recover because the audience is able to predict every plot point. Valentine's Day has a charm that you get lost in. You believe all of these ridiculous stories to be true and eventually they intertwine and you really have no idea what is coming next. This is the magic of the movie and I wonder if it was put there to try and mimic the story's lesson. Love is confusing. Overall a pretty good movie and really good for dates.

A little less than half way into the movie, the parallel stories begin to cross and tangle themselves into a web of both serendipity and mishap. These interrelated stories provide overall coherency like Traffic or Crash. But unlike those two movies, the value added is minimal. The side stories do help a to change things up so as to keep your interest. It also allows the movie to be a dozen chick flicks in one. You won't have to watch another for a year! (Yea right) It's like taking a multi-vitamin instead of just one.The movie features the entire spectrum of relationships and all the crap Valentine's Day subjects them to. You have enduring love, new love, puppy love, no love, and my favorite – ignorant teenage love.There are a few hilarious scenes, but with the right context if you watched just those few clips you'd probably get about the same amount of entertainment value out of it.Men: If your lady asks you to watch this on Valentine's Day, you don't have much of a choice.

119,expatinasia,A dismal waste,1,24 February 2010,"With the large ensemble cast, you might think this is similar to a Robert Altman film. Wish it were true. Garry Marshall has never been much for subtlety. In this movie, his only directions to the actors were ""louder"" and ""broader"". The only things that were missing was the splat of the cream pie, and an annoying spring-related ""boing"". Ms. Hathaway reprized her EA role in ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Unfortunately, with Queen Latifah doing her best Meryl Streep impression, it was more like ""The Devil Wears Large, Cheap Sunglasses"". There should be a warning to diabetic that this movie could induce a coma. Julia Roberts plays a soldier enduring a 17-hour flight, just to spend a day home. That's not ""horror"", that's just inconvenient. The fact that the incompetent Tommy Franks was allowed to retire with his four stars intact, is the real horror of war. The only high point of the film was a glimpse of the Frank Gehry designed Walt Disney concert hall.",Valentine's Day
120,Jaybird248,And you thought that the 70s sitcom Love American Style was dead and gone.,3,19 July 2010,"Back in the 70s, TV producer Aaron Spelling hit on a formula first seen in his hourly series, ""Love American Style"". Combine a bunch of hackneyed independent rom-com mini-plots, mix in a plethora of B-list stars each coming in for one day's shooting, and spread the resulting mess across the screen.That's ""Valentine's Day"", writ 60 feet large and charging $9 a ticket. Fortunately, I got it on DVD for a buck at the local supermarket kiosk and I have to tell you: It wasn't worth that.Pass on this one, unless you're ready to reactivate your disco ball and renew your acquaintance with TV's ""Rhoda.""",Valentine's Day
121,love_for_nails,Really awful!,1,25 December 2012,"This is the first movie I rated like this for it's worth. It's really awful. No plot, no real characters, just a couple of laughs, but even those a bit forced. I like to think that the writer and director for this movie wanted to make the actors have some fun. And I think they did. Actors are having a lot of fun when they do bad movies (I watched the extras from The Turist). Next time when I will see too much celebrities in a movie I will pay way more attention to the content before I will watch it.Not that I hate the movie, I'm not one of those folks who are obsessed that a good movie needs to have 10 Oscar nominations or something. On the contrary, my all time favorite movie has only 1 win and 1 nomination, and even those not so important, but I don't care. This movie is really stupid, but it's stupidity I think it's what makes people laugh.1/10 for sure!",Valentine's Day
122,StarDragyn,V-Day strikes,5,13 February 2010,"Though I can't say it entirely strikes out. For all the star-power, one could have anticipated something more, but at least there are a lot of familiar faces to improve the general mediocrity.Conceptually, it's a good idea. Reminiscent of ""Love Actually"", with many couples whose lives are intertwined in some way or other, but not done so well, in my opinion. The review of the ups and downs, the expectations and disappointments, of Valentine's Day, rings all too true to most of us, and it is the being able to relate that makes this movie any good. Even the disheartening parts, have got to make you laugh sometimes with, ""Isn't that just how it goes?"" sort of feeling.A couple of 50+ years of marriage; couples and friends in the prime of life, in different stages of relationships; employer/employee interactions; high-school dramas of ""love""; the love of parents/grandparents; and childhood emotions. This movie attempts to show love and relationships from all parts of life.Having watched this in my hometown in Indiana, I've got to say that the little ""shots"" made about Hoosiers had the whole theater laughing! I think that's a good analogy for the entire movie: sometimes things are funny just because you can get the humor in it, not because it is perfectly portrayed.",Valentine's Day
123,shawneuser,Unoriginal and tedious but better than critics say,6,5 March 2012,"I have to gladly disagree with most of the reviews regarding this movie. This is not a great movie. It is not a terrible movie. It is decent. In short, it is a movie worth seeing at least once, especially if you normally like rom-coms. My guess is that the ridiculously star-studded cast raised expectations to a level that no normal rom-com could ever match, leading to over-stated disappointment. Since I didn't see the movie until after the critics panned it, I had a completely different set of expectations. As is usually the case in that situation, I came out of the experience somewhat mystified that it got the response that it did.Yes, the movie has too many story lines, and yes, most the romances were as predictable as rain on a cloudy day. The most unoriginal was the center romance between Ashton Kucher and Jennifer Garner. We've seen the recent break up leads me to realize I love my best friend who also happens to be gorgeous and newly single more times than can be recollected. However, for completely lacking novelty, it still ends up being the best storyline in the movie. Mostly probably because it got the most screen time, and also because Kucher and Garner simply work well as a romantic couple. The other worthwhile plot lines involved Topher Grace and Ann Hathaway in probably the most original and best written romance, and Bradley Cooper and Julia Roberts in an underused storyline that lacks romance but does yield the movie's only surprises in the final 15 minutes.Frankly, despite the stars that would have been jettisoned, these are the only subplots the movie needed, and it probably would have been better off just splitting the screen time into 3 parts versus the 8 or so that it did instead. Yes, this would include leaving out the gorgeous Jessica Biel. Frankly, her part with Jamie Foxx was beyond unrealistic. Yeah, I'm sure her and Fox have a real hard time finding lovers on V-Day. Another failing of the movie is that it isn't very funny. The romance, what there is, works better than the comedy. Still, altogether a viewable movie, even if your main reason to do so is to see some pretty faces.",Valentine's Day
124,little-greenmen,I love this type's story.,9,9 October 2013,"This is the wonderful story. It is love comedy, and there are lots of the points of laugh. It is described the main person who is the florist and his around people in valentine day. In the U.S, many men and boys sends the flowers for their girlfriend or important person. So florist is too busy in that day though he ties to propose to his girlfriend. The other hand, his company, friends and friend's friend, their each valentine are described. I like this movie because all people enjoyed the valentine day. I want to watch it again with my boyfriend in the valentine day. The characters made me happy. Also a lot of actors and actresses have appearance in this movie, so many people can enjoy this movie about story and cast. I'm glad to appearance my favorite actress, Jessica Beal and Ann Hathaway. They are so beautiful. Jessica played the woman who has very weak mind, so her character is cute and it makes us fun. Ann's role is the career women, but she has a big secret about her job. I'm satisfied they role because they are important person each other. The other actors were so cool. I thought that this movie uses the famous actor and actress, and it's gorgeous.",Valentine's Day

126,AndyInThePieWithAlmonds,Sickened by Syrup Overdose,3,13 February 2010,"I was the classic husband dragged to see this on Valentine's Day weekend as a goodwill gesture. It was every bit as bad as could be possibly imagined. Half of Hollywood's A List star as vacuous stereotypes, moronically obsessed with the holiday in question. This despite the fact they are all living millionaire lifestyles, with perfect tans and the whitest of teeth. It's Love Actually, without a sense of humour or any depth whatsoever. No- one and nothing is remotely realistic - every storyline has a trite and convenient resolution and none is convincing or interesting. There is a perfect and unlikely ratio of ethnicities and sexualities. The sex trade is entirely trivialised and sanitised. No-one stays upset about relationship breakdowns for more than one scene. People break into spontaneous dance sequences in which everyone knows the pre-rehearsed moves but the film doesn't have the conviction to show it for more than 3 seconds... Just utter pointless and patronising bilge...",Valentine's Day

The movie is way too long. And I mean... way way too long. You can see where it is going after the first half hour. But most of these genre movies are like that, so that is not even the worst part. Too many plot lines make things confusing and even more slow. Don't get me wrong, there are still some surprises in this film... but they cannot make up for the predictability and slow pace of the film. Just watch ""Love Actually"" which is so much more fun to watch and also have a look at the Dutch remake ""Alles is Liefde"" which has been done very well.",Valentine's Day

130,juiceman10712,A god-awful mess. Don't fall for it.,1,15 February 2010,"Take 2 dozen stars. Mix in a dozen plots. Add a dash of horribly unfunny and painfully unrealistic dialogue. NOw top it off with every romantic comedy cliché in the book, clone it a few times and top it off again.The end result is worse than it sounds.It physically pains me to hear that people came out of this movie having enjoyed it . This is no doubt the biggest pile exploitive tripe that I have ever seen.Not only is it poorly written and laugh-less, the abundance of different stories that are going on ( there is honestly about 9 or 10 main stories) leads to terribly underdeveloped characters and a choppy, dishevelled pacing that allows the movie to reach it's climaxing point 10 different times throughout the movie.Not only are there too many stories but half of them are god awful and absolutely POINTLESS. Taylor Swift/Taylor Lautner's story for example, added NOTHING to the over all plot and it was just another way of cramming more familiar faces into the movie. Also half of the stars that are first billed appear in the movie for only minutes. It's pure exploitation and an obvious attempt to snare a huge audience. Unfortunately for the world and for the sake of film, it WILL snare that audience and most will come out liking it.The movie had a few (only a few) nice tender moments and plot twists but the amount of bad overshadows this by a long shot.A god-awful mess. Don't fall for it.",Valentine's Day
131,brian_dines,"Yeah, this movie blows, but there's something interesting to see",3,17 February 2011,"No question, this was a dog of a movie from the outset, the very premise wreaking of schlock, but whenever you get of these ensemble casts together it's interesting to compare what each of the actors brings to the screen. In particular, how often are you going to get Jessica Alba, Jessica Biel, Jennifer Garner and Anne Hathaway together in the same movie? With the four leading ladies, I think you've really got two different groups: the two Jessicas are known more for ""serious"" roles rather than comedy, and there's a pretty good reason for that: neither are funny. There are a couple of scene where Biel and Garner share the screen for a few seconds, and Garner's enormous charisma and humor dominates the scene, though I'm sure unintentionally. Garner can't help be but funny.It has to be said that Jessica Alba is the worst actress on the planet and it shows clearly in this film. She is painful to watch. The woman has got to take some acting lessons and get out of her head; she may well be the re-incarnation of Natalie Wood. Biel is much better and honest.So that leaves the two comic actors, Anne Hathaway and Jennifer Garner. Garner is just mesmerizing to watch as all that energy and enthusiasm explodes like an over-full can of whipped cream on the camera lens. Hathaway is exactly the opposite. You get the sense from this film, more from other films, that Hathaway is deliberately holding something back, dishing out her intensity in metered amounts. They're both are funny, but you get the impression that Hathaway's performance is a thoughtful bit of acting, while Garner is just cranking out another funny performance. Watching these two reminds me of watching John Wayne and Henry Fonda: both did Westerns, but you never forgot you were watching John Wayne while Henry Fonda got lost in his roles. Hathaway is Henry Fonda and Garner is John Wayne, but I think in today's world, Hathaway will have the longer and stronger career. Anyone wanting to see a good performance from Hathaway should see ""Love and other Drugs"", which she's absolute great in.",Valentine's Day
132,anaraguilar,"30 minutes in, still introducing the main characters",2,9 March 2020,"The first 30 minutes of this film were literally made up of 30 pointless1 minute clips introducing all the characters.
I hoped that the movie would pick up steam after the characters were introduced, however, the rest of the movie consisted of 2 minute cameos as though the creators were running out of time and they needed to give all the characters the same amount of screen time.
I only finished watching the movie hoping the movie would explain the meaning behind all the worthless crap... that didn't happen.",Valentine's Day

But myself, i honestly liked every bit of it. Good acting, and surprisingly well put together. It was one of those movies that made me feel good after watching it. I feel bad for the people who didn't enjoy it. You must all be lonely, miserable, and well sad?? I don't understand how you cannot like this movie.

134,smiley_pat77,"Watch it only once, if that",6,17 July 2010,"Most formulaic romantic comedies tend to have only a handful of interesting peaks to create the skeleton that furthers the story, with the meat, more often than not, tending to be nothing but puny fluff. But what makes Valentine's Day interesting, is that it has about a dozen story lines going on at once, so there really is no time for moments of pure fluff. Almost every scene is forced to serve a purpose or else there won't be a chance for the story to play out. It's as if 8 or 10 different films are combined into one digestible whole to spare us the gruesome filler of wannabe comedy.That's not to say that any or all of the plots are even all that interesting. The cleverest and most charming would be the one with Anne Hathaway and Topher Grace (there are way too many well-known actors in this movie to bother citing character names... in fact the characters probably should have just been named after the actors) as a couple only 2 weeks into their relationship. The most hollow would be one with Emma Roberts and Carter Jenkins as a teenage couple planning to give up their virginity during lunch hour on a school day. Surprise: mishaps occur and it doesn't work out so they decide to hold off. The consolation: ""At least we can make out.""There are plenty of cliché moments, some slightly more deserved than others, but some of the dialogue plays out fairly decently. The smartest thing that writer Kathrine Fugate did was intertwine these stories in as many possible places to the point that I think it kept me distracted enough to avoid cynical developments. I was too busy piecing together the stories in my head. But the scenes are organized intuitively enough. Quite often I found myself trying to remember what was going on in the storyline of a character related to one on display when all of a sudden, there they were in the next scene! Also, the transitions between plot lines were fairly smooth and allowed for things to progress relatively well. On an interesting note, Taylor Swift showed some acting chops as a ditsy high school blonde.I'll probably never watch this movie again. There is nothing to gain from ever watching it again. None of the many stories are very well developed to sustain me another time through. But it worked well the first time. Valentine's Day seems to have been made simply to provide couples a holiday-relevant option at the movie theatre and the chance to go ""Ohh, it's *insert celebrity*!"" on more occasions in one sitting than ever before. But if you are seeing it post- February 14th, then do not necessarily count on a favorable experience.",Valentine's Day

I am not a huge fan of romantic comedies anyway, but I thought I'd take the chance and go in with no preconceived ideas.After about half an hour, I was a bit puzzled. Well, very puzzled.There seemed to be about 10 stories going on at the same time, none of which were very interesting. All the characters were hugely underdeveloped and grossly unbelievable. A HUGE miscasting of Julia Roberts as someone from the army. Every sugary sappy cliché done to death until i was nearly drowning in schmaltz! so in summary...lots of stories are going on, in which not very much is going on. all the characters are hugely unlikeable, it is massively boring, lots of girly clichés for the audience to go ""awwwwwwwww"" at. this film is a mess. it has no substance. no heart. it is all that is dark about cinema. it is a producer's wet dream. an easy way to make a few million quid on valentines day weekend. most people will be gullible enough to swallow the sap.My girlfriend turned to me half way through it and said...""this is a bit crap isn't it?""

The movie was slow, the story lines predictable, and, for us, the movie didn't get interesting until the last 15 minutes, which is how I ended up giving it 2 stars. I originally was going to give it 1 star (awful). The movie was dragging and I kept looking at my watch and hoping the movie would end. I asked my wife several times if we could just leave.

After reading all of the negative reviews, I was prepared for a poor script and a poorly done movie. We found a pleasant movie with some humorous moments and a nice script. It wasn't crude and it wasn't stupid. If it wasn't as deep and the characters weren't as developed as in similar movies, we did not think that detracted from a nice night at a pleasant movie.

The most promising story lines were not given enough time. I will say this had a lot of potential but failed in the end. Taylor Swift's song is great and her performance was not bad.

It might be a combination of several things that fell together on that day and made me feel about the movie the way I do. I love it! It is so funny and romantic! It is hilarious even. It is just the thing. If you have nothing spacial to do on the 14th of February do go see this movie. It will bring you the spirit of the Valentine's. It is perfect for everybody - lovers and haters, romantics and not so much. First of all, the movie has a bunch of well-known and really good actors staring. I say, there was hardly anyone that I couldn't name or point out a film he or she had been seen in. That is a real delight! Second thing is the really good humor. It is not just a cheesy, romantic movie. It has good quality jokes which combined with the sweet stories of people of different ages makes for a good entertainment. So, as I said before, it is perfect for this day of love. Even if you are alone and have no Valentine of your own, it will set the mood and you will feel the love that is in the air at this time of year.So have a great Valentine's Day!!! :D",Valentine's Day
141,mchael_skunk,cheesy rom-com,5,14 February 2010,"Valentine's Day is a who's who of famous people, a very Hollywood romance movie with a severe case of A.D.D. Most stars check in as if paying back some favour to the director. It is a people movie full of people for the Facebook generation. Is it serious film-making? Well, it's one of those films that has bloopers during the credits, so definitely not; so we shouldn't judge it on that. It's simply a schmaltzy whimsical chick flick. The film takes place over one fine Valentine's Day from early morning to late at night in flawless Hollywood California. We follow random individuals, who are each connected within 5 degrees of each other, as they deal with love. The movie has been marketed as being choc-block full of superstars, so lets see how they did. Kathy Bates has two scenes, I completely forgot she was in it until the second time she popped up, She is very likable as the butch TV News executive who is the boss of career driven Kelvin Moore (Jamie Foxx), a B-Grade sports commentator trying to make his mark, but given a vox-pops job. Foxx seems way too charming to be such an unlikeable character, as publicist Kara (Jessica Biel) slowly falls for him, but we're not really given enough time as we cut to florist Reed (Ashton Kutcher) a hopeless romantic who has fallen for Morley (Jessica Alba), and Julia (Jennifer Garner) in a 30-something love triangle. Garner is a teacher at a primary school where young Edison (Bryce Robinson) has his first crush, and desperately tries to send his mystery girl a special delivery. Robinson brings the cute to this movie, and holds his own against the army of celebrities he's acting with, namely Shirley MacLaine as Edison's grandmother, Estelle. Estelle is a Golden Age Actress, (MacLaine playing herself, as we see from actual footage of MacLaine in 1958's Hot Spell) who is in a fifty year marriage with Edgar (Hector Elizondo). Both performances are top notch, Elizondo arguably the best in the entire film. He is soulful, gentle, and wise. For the teens, the majority market, we have Grace and Alex (Emma Roberts and Carter Jenkins) awkwardly trying to plan the next level of their relationship in scenes right out of the American Pie book on how to write teen comedy, and Willy and Felicia (Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift) the jock and the bimbo, who 13 to 19 year old girls will literally cheer at the screen for, yet they bring little. Swift is cringe-worthy and Lautner makes an out of place reference to his abs that is just odd in the context of the film. We also have Liz (Anne Hathaway in a solid enough comedic performance, she does funny voices) who moonlights as a phone sex operator, and hides this from boyfriend of two weeks Jason (Topher Grace, slighty less annoying than usual). Also thrown into the mix is McDreamy as the cheating swine Dr. Harrison Copeland, and McSteamy as ageing single footballer Sean Jackson. Stuck on a plane are Holden and Captain Kate Hazeltine (Bradley Cooper, and Julia Roberts), as they meet, and chat, and flirt, and seem like those two old grumpy muppets in the booth. Queen Latifah also features as Liz's evil boss Paula Thomas who delivers the biggest laugh in the movie, right at the end. Alphonso (George Lopez) also stars as Kutcher's co-worker and go-to-guy for the Valentine's Day blues. Every actor does a good enough job of playing movie versions of themselves and no one tries to steal the show or go over the top crazy, but the amount of stars in the movie work both for it and against it. It is a very unique romance film, and is good for people who are likely to get sick of the same two actors, but we really don't see enough of anyone to care, or even follow what's going on. Characters are thrown at us, and before we have a moment to connect, we cut to someone else, and this happens for two straight hours as love, romance, sex, and relationships are examined and theorized. It's like a fish bowl with way too many fish, but we get to see characters just enough to get a laugh or two in. The film tries to find the true meaning of Valentine's Day, and the true meaning of love, in a cutesy comedic way. It's modern and fun, but very shallow on the surface.",Valentine's Day
142,lyndacatherine,"Romantic, fun, good acting - what else do you need?!",9,14 February 2010,"I think a lot of the criticisms of this film are unduly harsh. Obviously, if you don't enjoy the kind of film with several different plot-lines running through then this might not be the film for you. Similarly, if you are a hard-hearted cynic who cringes at the first sign of romance and happy endings, then look elsewhere. But if, like me, you enjoy a bit of light-hearted, heart-warming romance with a sprinkling of comic moments thrown in, then this is a great film. The fact that it truly is a star-studded cast should not be held against it. All of the performances were strong, with the majority of lead roles being played to perfection. Personally, I liked following the different stories being played out, and seeing the connections between them, and for my money this was done better than in Love Actually, in which there were only two stories I found appealing. Obviously there was less time given for characterisation, which is where the quality acting was an essential ingredient. As others have mentioned, there were a couple of surprise twists, which, given the format of the film and the short amount of time given to each story, I think was something of a triumph. Take it for what it is - a star-studded romance with multiple story-lines - and settle back for an enjoyable and entertaining film.",Valentine's Day

146,merrilltoyco,Simply a Photograph of Love- Eluding Critics and Winning Big,10,15 February 2010,"I just wanted to pop in and defend this movie. I think that when you make a film with as many top-billing actors as this film has, you automatically create unconquerable expectations in almost everyone. And I'm not talking about expectations as to whether or not it will be good, but even just what it will be like in the first place.I don't think that most people who went to review this movie for their magazines and blogs were expecting to see a bunch of very famous actors lining up to pour sugar syrup down their throat. Well that's exactly what they're doing. Real romance is confusing, sweet, harsh, joyful, stupefying, and unique to each couple. And frankly, I don't think that a cynic is going to react well to a film that simply celebrates love in all it's forms. They can't complicate it enough to analyze it with their minds- so it therefore eludes them, and they minimize or even get annoyed by it. This movie is like that couple in love who are staring into each others eyes at the table next to you- and you're either going to adore it, or dislike the contrast that it provides.For anyone who has ever been in love, I can't recommend this film enough. Not only is it truly hilarious, very well done, full of couple chemistry, totally colorful, considerate, and truly original- it is more than that. It's an important film. It's important because it will really check your pulse and tell you if you can still feel that soft tickle of joy that is innocent love. People with hearts will love this movie, heartless intellectuals will vomit and pass out. It's just that excellent. Note the difference between what critics think of this movie and what audiences think; the audience that I was in seemed to love it. I myself like all sorts of films, and I took this film for what it was trying to do, and ended up loving every minute of it. The only thing that detracted from it at all was how continually disgusted I was in realizing how poorly this film is being treated by critics.This film is like one big, scented valentine's card tucked into the desk of the world. It's the perfect date movie, not a chick flick, not a cliché- and when you read it, if you really do, you can't help but admit that it hits right on the money. It knows what you expect, knows what people will try to make it, and continually dodges bullets to turn what you know will be a cliché moment into a hilarious surprise. It's delightfully naughty at times, but without going overboard, and it has enough heart, creativity, and life for ten movies of it's kind.It also crossed my mind that- though the message of the film is very simple, being simply a photograph of love- the arrangement of characters and the actually believable way that they are all connected is a fun juggle, and perhaps too much for the incoherent mind. In that one way, it's a challenging film that might have embarrassed a few critics who didn't expect that and got lost- something you wouldn't want to admit if you pride yourself on intelligence.I also have to put in a plug for Taylor Swift. I feel truly indignant about how everyone is slamming her performance. I don't know what they are talking about. I'm an actor, a filmmaker, and a connoisseur- and I can tell you that Swift's performance was perfectly silly, hilarious, and awesome. It's extremely brave for a multi-grammy award winning superstar who has nothing to prove to get crazy and play a total ditz, when most people in her shoes would have stayed way inside the safe zone. She is NOT a bad actor, she is playing a caricature of a standard valley girl- and taking it as far as it can go. She was freaking funny.Everyone else, of course, was right on par. Jamie Foxx was especially good, Jessica Biel is magnetic, Jennifer Garner always converts you, and Ashton Kutcher carries his larger role with classic Kutcher ease. And I've heard of people calling Jessica Alba miscast, but if you look at where the filmmakers end her character up at, it is typical of how they defy your expectations with almost every part of this film. Everything except the happy endings, with which it is defiantly adamant about including.So, if you've ever been in love, I highly recommend this film. It's exceptional. And if you've never been in love, alone- but still believe in it- this is it. Relationships get a lot more complicated, but what brings us together is too simple for words, and can only be described with repeated viewings from every angle, a'la this film: THE Valentine's Day movie, case closed.So like it or not, it was born a huge film, and cannot be stopped- it was packed at every showing the night I saw it- real people love it, and it's here to stay. Expect to see it on television every Valentine's Day, suckas. This movie will work it's magic on cynics in a long, warm hug- wearing a baby nap to catch the spit up.",Valentine's Day
147,j-cherry-630-782328,and the point of this film was?????,1,7 March 2010,"first off i did not want to see this film as i am no fan what so ever of romantic comedies, given half a chance i would have charged straight in to see the wolf man,however two friends of mine were dying to see it so i thought why spoil it for them? what beggars belief is that despite the fact that i was expecting a load of sentimental tripe i still managed to be disappointed and down right horrified by the utter waste of time this film was.there were about ten different stories all muddled up in an incomprehensible mix of unlikely love affairs, instant breakups followed by even more instant makeups, sloppy teenage relationships and awful jokes followed by the usual happy clappy ""believe in yourself and everything will be OK"" ending.What was even more infuriating is the fact that the film is riddled with people jumping into bed with anyone every ten seconds e.g. Anne Hathaway's character has sex with someone before they even consider starting a relationship and the only character's who actually have a little self respect are portrayed as morons, hereby implying that the only way to have a good relationship is to basically have a few one night stands until Mr Right comes along (or until you get an std but they don't tell you that). apparently this film is aimed at teenagers(females in particular), well i am 17 and a girl and i was thoroughly disgusted at the complete lack of any good values portrayed in this film. i felt physically sick after leaving the cinema and i would warn all those who are considering wasting their hard earned money on this piece of corny trash PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT WATCH!!!!!",Valentine's Day
148,tintosecco,"Congratulations for this work, you all!",7,29 April 2011,"This movie surprised me. I understand that if is for the Valentine's Day, should pleased everyone, OK, but in mine point of view, it was so well written and so close to a anachronistic kind of history, gathering around different 'common' people, that it made a unique commercial movie. And this is the why I congratulate the writer, the studio, and the many great actors that were involved in this work. We can agree that we don't see this every day, the simplicity of showing how difficult it is to find The One that will be by your side every single day of your life, by your choice, sometimes it seems to be so far way, that none of us can accept it.

149,fifibelle,Nope! Not worth seeing this one.,3,9 February 2010,"Way too predictable -- too fluffy! I will admit that I love Ashton Kutcher more than before. But I knew where his story line was going early on. Same with Jessica Alba (who should NOT be a blonde!!), Jennifer Garner's story, Jamie Fox's story, Topher Grace's, Anne Hathaway, McDreamy, McSteamy and Bradley Cooper's -- I saw their endings coming like a train wreck. SPOILER COMING!!!! Taylor Swift, Taylor Lautener, Emma Roberts -- They were just added to the cast to pull in young audiences but totally stupid, wasted story lines. They were unnecessary and took up too much valuable space. Jessica Biel was very good and surprising. Hector Elizandro (sp?) and Shirley Maclaine were wasted --their story should have been fleshed out more about them. Julia Roberts' storyline was also predictable and wasn't enough -- I wanted more on her character's life. She didn't really have to act but her character had some quirks that could have been a good story by itself. And Queen Latifah should sue! Her story line was paper thin and the way it ended with her story was stupid and disrespectful of her skills. Garry Marshall wasted a lot of good people's talent and my time. Friends who were at the same sneak preview LOVED it, even dropped a few tears. I couldn't wait to leave. I may be a little jaded but I can't wait to see what the real movie goers (the critics) say.

The premise and style is all Love Actually and the crux lies on the story that has Ashton Kutcher and that girl from Ghosts of the.....That particular story was terrible and had no substance at all. The others were shallow and stupid and you dont like any one of the stories or the characters. Particularly terrible was the one with an old couple and the one that has Bradley Cooper(in his worst role) and Julia Roberts(still playing Vivian from Pretty Woman).

I forgot about the Hollywood ""agenda"" until the movie started. Just think of every Hollywood culture stereotype you can imagine of and it's in this flick.Once again, they push their ""agenda"", force feeding gayness on the audience along with one ""would never happen"" event after another. This movie is pure regurgitation. As the movie went on and they only displayed bit part obvious gay characters I kept thinking, ""when's it coming?"" I thought they'd be more obvious with it, but no, they thought they'd bang it out.So in short, if you have basic moral values this flick will be a bit offensive to you. If you're a typical social liberal, then consider this review a raving endorsement. It's not for me.Anyway, it's my fault for watching this thing. I knew better.

153,brookeb3393,Nothing New,6,9 March 2010,"All in all, this movie was not terrible. The acting was good, ending wasn't predictable (AT ALL!), and I even laughed a few times. However, it's nothing I haven't seen before in a movie. Love Actually and He's Just Not That Into You both have a large cast and numerous stories going on at a time too but in my opinion, both were better. Taylor Swift should stick to singing. Her acting skills are cringe-worthy and after the movie, most people in the audience wanted to just punch her in the face because of how annoying she was. Other actors made up for it though, such as Ashton Kutcher, Bradley Cooper, and Julia Roberts. Not memorable, but not the worst I've seen.",Valentine's Day
154,ecbarth,Went in expecting the worst,7,15 February 2010,"I went into this movie thinking it was just a juggernaut of a cast brought together purely to throw together a film to capitalize on V-day but i ate my words after watching it.The movie is lovey-dubby to say the least but keeps track of each story arch very well and the twists that weave them all together are a lot better than you'd expect. The ensemble cast really shines in this light romantic movie, especially Ashton Kutcher, whose been absent from the limelight for a bit, makes a pleasant return as the florist who is as much of romantic as they come, and George Lopez is also great in his role of the family man with all the right views on love.This review would go on forever if I broke down the whole cast but they all play their parts very well and portray the many types of love you see, young love, mature love, new relationships, and the also the type of love for someone you didn't realize you had. Love story as it may be its very entertaining and greatly portrays the randomness of love and how in its truest form is more important than anything else.I don't make a habit of seeing chick flicks and had this movie shot down before I even saw it and was joking the whole time before how it would be awful, but here Im willing to say I judged to soon. I give the movie 3 out of four stars",Valentine's Day
155,barbie-pombo,"Nice cute film, with some pretty surprising endings",7,12 February 2010,"This is one of those films where a big bunch of actors and actresses get together and make this pretty wonderful film about a lot of stories (in this case, love stories) that, somehow, get laced showing us a one story plot (such as Love Actually and He's Just Not That Into You). In the case of this film, this dynamic becomes more complex given that all of these stories must get laced during just one day: Valentine's day. The actors (or, at least, most of them) give lovely (yet not amazing) performances, especially Bradley Cooper, Ashton Kutcher, Eric Dane and Anne Hathaway who played characters they are not so used to play... On what comes to the younger cast, i gotta say Bryce Robinson is the most memorable one, but the teen cast? Emma Roberts and Carter Jenkins were fine, and i'd probably have to say the same about the Taylors (no need to ""last name"" them)but the lines were really cheesy and dumb, and i would love to believe that's only due to their characters and not due to self stupidity, cause i'm 17 years old and i bet you i've never talked like that, folks. Now putting that aside (and the fact that some things are quite predictable on everyone of this films)I feel myself almost obligated to point out that some of the endings of this laced stories were quite moving because of being so unexpected and unimaginable, and that, i believe, had given a total new meaning to this movie.

The cast, as you have probably seen, is fantastic and all the big stars give compelling performances, apart from Jessica Alba who looks bored and unenthused in the movie, thankfully she only has a small part.The script is quite clever and manages to keep you guessing as to who will end up with who all the way to the end, its well done too.The best part of this movie is the humor, this is one funny movie.

That's really saying something because I don't have high movie standards and can appreciate a movie with mediocre acting/writing. I had reasonable expectations, obviously I knew the acting and writing would be subpar, it would just be a cheesy romance movie to entertain on a boring night. It was far worse than that though. Nobody in the entire movie acted realistically, whatsoever. As the lines were so god awful. They made Valentine's Day seem of ultimate importance equal to Thanksgiving or Christmas, when in reality very few people don't give it a second thought.

I like Swift as a singer mostly, because she has one of the most greatest voices I've ever heard. In fact, she is my #1 favorite singer, tied along with Michael Jackson. If you are a Taylor Swift fan, such as myself, you should get this movie. It's simple and funny! You will enjoy it and it would be too hard not to laugh your head off.

163,teeleigh417,One Big Blackberry Product Placement--And Apparently Some Romance Too,2,23 May 2010,"Forget the plots or whatever those underdeveloped stories were supposed to be called--all I saw was Blackberries. Jessica Alba held one in her sleep, and Jessice Biel used its vibrating sensation when lonely. I cannot recall exactly what other instances they were used or seen, but I know there are many more there.But besides the domination of Blackberries on the screen, I found most of the stories to be complete drivel. I went into the movie theater with an open mind, and came out seeing what I thought it would be. Every story line was completely predictable--with the exception of Eric Dane's and Bradley Cooper's. It was obvious from the beginning who would end up with whom, and where's the fun in that? Some of them didn't even really make that much sense due to the lack of chemistry (even compared to the rest who were supposed to have chemistry, but didn't), like Jessica Biel's and Jamie Foxx's.The actors did not do a bad job with their parts--it was only the story that needs work. Or, even better, burned in a ceremonial fire and banished from human memory. Simply put, it seems that this was yet another attempt to exploit what Valentine's Day actually is as opposed to what consumerism poses it as. Unrealistic, lacking chemistry and charm, and only appeals to the commercial side of Valentine's Day, though I did laugh at some of the quips.",Valentine's Day
164,jshadle0807,Take It For What It Is,6,6 June 2010,"The second you heard Taylor Swift and George Lopez were in the cast, you should have known that it was going to be one of those films. One, Taylor Swift is not even an actress so you knew they just wanted more money and two, well . . . it's George Lopez. Yeah . . .Yes there are way too many plots and yes there are way too many people but you knew that when you went in. So let's drop it, huh? I didn't think the dialogue was THAT bad. Was the banter great like Sherlock Holmes? Were there any quotable lines? No, not at all but it certainly wasn't as bad as any Disney movie.However, there were some surprises. The Julia Roberts story was beautiful, don't lie. And someone tell me that they were surprised at who Eric Dane's lover turned out to be! And Queen Latifah made my day when she took over Anne Hathaway's job for a bit.Several of the couples had good chemistry. Such as Topher Grace and Anne Hathaway, Shirley MacLaine and Hecter Elizondo, Ashton Kutcher and his 'surprise' partner are okay but not fabulous, Kathy Bates and Jamie Foxx (not lovers) are great for the five seconds they're together, and Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift were kinda cute in their own way.I left certain people out on purpose.On the other hand, I had some major issues with this film. One, how dare they use Kathy Bates for less than five minutes? She is better than that. Two, Jessica Biel... put your tail between your legs because that was a complete and utter epic FAIL. Three, what was the point of the Taylor/Taylor plot? It wasn't even funny and didn't move with the rest of the movie. At least the other plots had some potential.No, it wasn't Love Actually and even for someone who has never seen Love Actually, it really wasn't all that great.

As per the title of this review, it's like what would happen if someone gave me the plot outline and i had a stab at it.With Love Actually, by the time you reach the heart-warming climax scenes the viewer has been taken on a journey that makes them buy in to the characters.

Long faces, long noses, big teeth, and wavy long brown hair. Maybe they all go to the same surgery in L.A. to get the required Hollywood cosmetic work done. All they needed to add was Sarah Jessica Paker and you would have the Kentucky derby!!I watched this on a plane as an in flight movie and i preferred to turn it off and stare at the back of the seat in front of me than watch this drivel.

169,The_Rogue_Phoenix,"Love ""Actually"" Ends ""Perfectly""",5,21 February 2010,"Valentine's Day: a day we ""love,"" a day we hate, and a day that one way or another makes us crazy. The film by the same name (2010) ensures its audience receives a dose of all three, but not without wrapping it up with a tidy happy ending. From the moment I saw the trailer for this film I immediately pegged it in my mind ""Americanized Love Actually (2006)"" based on the multi-plot but ""cleverly"" intertwined story lines demonstrating 6 degrees of separation, the all famous American cast with a handful of unknowns for good measure, and the fact that it takes place around a holiday.And I was right. They tried to do Love Actually, and the film had its moments in the reveals that weren't cliché, the boy and who his crush is, the sports star and who his boyfriend is, or the son and who his mom is. I was sincerely surprised at each reveal, and the last one was the most touching; it almost earned a tear. Almost. For each of these refreshing moments there were about a dozen stale predictable moments, from the best friends with their significant others who realize ""maybe we should be together,"" to the intense epiphanies that occurs to each character once that causes them to do a 180 and finish his or her plot line the way the audience wants. So what's Hollywood teaching us? That everything ends the way you want it togood lesson—not.The film was advertised as being directed by the director of Pretty Woman (1990), but honestly I would've been more excited if it was written by J.F Lawton, the writer of Pretty Woman; the story might've been better. No one advertises V Day as written by Katherine Fugate the woman who wrote The Prince & Me (2004), because if I'd known such a thing before watching, I would've been turned off instantly. The Prince & Me being the most hypocritical romantic comedy I've ever seen, since Julia Stiles throws away all her life long dreams and everything she is just to marry some guy she met ten minutes ago and becomes a princess. Her actions teach women to what? Forget ambition, but only for your honey? Thankfully Fugate doesn't make as big a faux pas in this film, throwing in fresher tidbits such as the occupation of phone sex operator and strangers on an airplane.There's a clash of pushing forward and staying in the same place. We're led to believe Hollywood is progressing, presenting two guys in a relationship, but they're on screen together briefly and I guess there can't be kiss or any suggestive touching because then people might think they're gay! Wouldn't want to make any homophobes a little queasy with a simple peck on the lips or anything. Then there's the presentation of the women characters, which surprises me as the writer is a woman. We have the best friend woman whose male best friend rescues her, we have the weepy woman who hates V day but really just wants a man, the pretty high school girl always making out with boyfriend, smart girl who wants sex with boyfriend then decides to wait, and woman hiding her second profession from her beginner boyfriend. The only woman who is portrayed as independent and self-reliant is the ""bad guy"" in one of the relationships because she decides she's not ready and still needs to explore herself more. All the other women suffer the clichés of dependence, weakness, over emotional, etc. without demonstrating any inner ability to be strong because they have a man nearby.V Day does not even come close to matching the endearment and goodness of Love Actually, which stays true to its name in portraying relationships in their awkwardness, difficulties, and failures of love and friendship. Not everyone is paired up at the end and some of them are characters I wanted to get together. Valentine's Day is the opposite, in which only the people who ""wronged"" a main character in love ended up loveless while everyone else gets a special someone. There are laughs on top of the staleness, and the reveals are somewhat worth it, but if you want a romantic comedy to move you, to identify with then Love Actually is the way to go. Us Americans always steal good ideas from the British, only this time we didn't improve it or keep it the same. We made it much worse.",Valentine's Day

Some EXCELLENT topical coverage - social reality and somewhat dry, non-juicy romantic quasi-reality. Good job getting a lot of topical variety. This movie could have been edited for speed of topical transitions and because the action is reality-based it would not have hurt the viewing cohesion. When the major, major stars are on (and there are many of them, which I always really enjoy) they really produce exactly the right amount of focus so this director really has hit their stride when it comes to scene delivery using the giant talent.There was coverage of high school age premarital relations that seemed very sensitive but the dialog was over-mature for the age level (there may be some people that mature at that age, but not likely)...might better have been treated as a fantasy sequence, or a parental fantasy scene (what my daughter should be saying...). There was a token assortment of cultures that were treated a bit superficially, but as a reflection of society this movie does a great job showing how people see each other in general.

The actors are the best thing about this film. I fell in love with Jennifer Garner all over again. Ashton Kutcher, Topher Grace, Anne Hathway and Jamie Foxx aren't bad either. Kathy Bates is there for 2 scenes, I wonder if she even deserves a credit. But the fact is, small stories are effectively brought together to affirm the fact that falling in love is perhaps the warmest feeling in the world.

Even reading many of these Reviews I gathered the same idea. But I just watched this star studded romantic comedy for the first time on a random Saturday night in July. Not fuelled by romance, love or even the Valentines day spirit I actually fell in LOVE with this movie. OK, well maybe not deep passionate love, but love none-the-less! Kutcher provided a great deal of humour and class that I haven't seen from him in awhile. Garner, a personal favourite, was glamorous and elegant in her role, plus her romantic wows and brilliant conclusion kept me interested. It also provided me with a major heartbreak, the only flaw I found in the movie, when Dempsey became a lying cheater, as a major Grey's Anatomy Fan my McDreamy broke my heart! No more crying over that though... I lover Grace and Hathaway because the kinky phone sex kept me laughing and his awkward humour kept me smiling. George Lopez is great for a laugh. Cooper and Auntie Julia Roberts (as her and her niece are in the movie) had amazing romantic chemistry, until the twist hit which was probably the most romantic scene in the movie when Cooper came in to greet his partner Eric Dane the football player... I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED IT! Now the Teenage couples were exact opposites but they complimented each other, the intelligent couple (including Emma Roberts)were perfectly cute and their 'sex scene' was bizarre and almost made me cry! Now the Taylors were stupid and annoying but the perfect picture of teenage love! And when Lautner fell I replayed it like 20times! Werewolves fall, who knew? Fox and Beil were the perfect romance hating couple to top off the movies re-inactment of diverse styles of love. Finally, the cutest thing was the young boy, Edisson! He was Amazing! I loved him.

That kinda reflects the whole problem with this film. It puts a whole lot of ""stuff"" into it and yet doesn't get much back. Let's start with the cast. The poster advertises nineteen stars, most of whom could be considered A-list talents (Oscar winners, box-office darlings, a cute country crooner, etc.). They are packed like sardines into a film that runs just over two hours, and most of them (like the aforementioned Roberts) are used in roles that are little more than cameos. Only Ashton Kutcher and Jennifer Garner manage to become full-fledged leads, and their syrupy sweet story is easily the film's best; everything else feels like one, big, unnecessary distraction. Sure, it's nice to Anne Hathaway in a film but, if you have absolutely nothing for her to do, then why waste her time...and, for that matter, ours? I have a suspicion that we will see more films like ""Valentine's Day""; all they require is a big-name cast and some semblance of a screenplay. It helps, of course, if that screenplay is actually only a series of other ideas that have been snipped down to under ten minutes and then glued together with the faintest traces of connectivity.Please read my full review on my blog: www.thelastcritic.blogspot.com",Valentine's Day
176,drewkennedy,Confusing and contrived,2,16 October 2021,"What a huge waste of money. So many big names, but too many stories, trying too hard to be clever and just ending up vapid, all of them trite and predictable. Nothing new or insightful, highly traditionalist and therefore irrelevant. Acting itself isn't bad.",Valentine's Day

178,jwparis-40037,worst movie ever,1,1 January 2016,"First of all the reason I wanted to watch this movie because of the great line up of cast. Anne Hathaway, Jamie Foxx and loads more. Why wouldn't you watch this movie right? Well that was clearly a mistake and the longest hour and a half ever! I am going to now give you 3 reason to stay clear of this movie 1. Anne Hathaway is personally one of my favorite actresses. She is great in movies such as Princess Diaries, Devil wears Prada and many more. But in this movie I felt like her talents were discarded completely. Also her character was not suited to her at all. 2.Taylor Swift is a great performer on stage but not on the acting stage.I think that she should just stay singing. She is a terrible actress except for her role in the Lorax. She had no skills and it looked like through the entire movie she was reading off of cue cards behind the camera. 3. The story line is so weird. I personally didn't like this movie because of the main reason the story line. If you do ever watch this movie ( and why would you?!) you will know what I am taking about. It had no point what so ever and made no sense at all.So there you have it the worst movie ever.",Valentine's Day
179,janicechancy,Too many roses in one bouquet!,5,1 August 2019,"There was way too much going on at once, they couldn't give enough time or dedication to each storyline. It was messy, and I couldn't get invested into each of their love stories. But the scene where Roberts reunited with her son still touched me. Anyways, if the purpose of this movie was for someone to feel something on Valentine's Day, this movie really didn't do it justice. In this case, it was breadth instead of depth.... and that's where it failed to be good.",Valentine's Day

He was as into it as I was, which was weird for me, because I was mostly going to see it for all the attractive guys. Regardless, we were both pleasantly surprised. We laughed, I cried, we gasped, we had a good time. And when it comes down to it that's what going to the movies is all about. Some of the writing wasn't exactly perfect, but the acting was good. The story had some cheesy parts, but it managed to hold together nicely. I thought Taylor Swift was adorable in her role. And Ashton Kutcher was the most tolerable that I have ever seen him. Julia Roberts, though she wasn't in it too much, was wonderful. All in all it was a good movie, and a good time.",Valentine's Day
182,JVfade,Do NOT see Valentine's Day!,1,14 February 2010,"Poor script, tacky comedy, basically a Hollywood rip off! Surprised to see so many good actors in this movie. There is nothing to like about this movie. Do not even wait for the DVD! The movie was dragging and I kept looking at my watch and hoping the movie would end. I asked my wife several times if we could just leave. Shame on all those stars, who were filmed in this movie! I could not believe that this movie made in the Hollywood I hope to not see anything like this again, otherwise I will stop my trust to the movies, where big stars are playing. I could not believe my eyes. It was just bad dream.Don't waste your money! Feel sorry for my time (1:57)!",Valentine's Day
183,WegmansSubs,Love Actually has been surpassed- just kidding this movie is garbage,2,13 February 2010,"If you ever wondered what would happen if someone forced a 5th grader to rewrite the script of Love Actually on a roll of wet paper towel with a crayon, and then forced that same child, to act in the movie without telling him how, then you should go see Valentine's Day. If you did not wonder what would happen in the scenario above, that's great, don't see this movie. If for some reason you did, read on so that you can satisfy your curiosity without wasting $22 like I did. On a side note, the kid in the movie should not be blamed for acting poorly; he was just trying to keep up with the rest of the cast.In order to jam all of the ""stars"" into this movie somehow, the kid who wrote it had to have 10 plot lines going on at once. Unfortunately, half way through the movie I realized that only 1 story line was remotely entertaining, and included actors that I wasn't completely annoyed by. By the end of the movie I realized that that one plot line was garbage as well, it just took longer than the others to get there.It's impossible not to compare this movie to Love Actually, but you really have to feel bad for all of the people who were involved with Love actually who are still alive and have to see the comparisons being drawn. It would be the same as if when ""Ninja Assassin"" came out, reviewers all commented on how similar it was to Saving Private Ryan.There is nothing to like about this movie. It contains every imaginable cliché that has ever been put into a movie, these have been listed below for your convenience: Stunning millionaire Jessica Biel can't find a date on Valentine's Day her whole life (sad face); Old people making out after they make up about something; Guy gets dumped by hot girl but finds he always loved his best friend Best; friend from previous line realizes she loves said guy when 9 year old boy asks her if she has ever fallen in love with her best friend; Small town guy has to overcome big city girl's ""crazy"" lifestyle to make 2 week relationship work; Kid (assumed writer of the screenplay) runs away from home to deliver flowers to the love of his life on a bike; Man runs through airport barefoot to chase a girl (of course)You have been warned.",Valentine's Day
184,manna77,Not a complete disaster just a partial one,6,3 May 2010,"I have to say I had a pretty good idea what I was getting myself into when I started watching this movie so I'm not disappointed.It was exactly what you would expect from this kind of Hollywood lemonade. This is a romantic flick or at least it's trying to be one.But that's not so easy to achieve with so many storyline's. I would recommend this to people who want to take their minds of things,or people like me who like hard dramatic movies so something light as this comes good for a change. I'm surprised when people criticize movies like this.Come on you can not tell me you expected to get The Godfather or something brilliant like that, that should be clear just by looking at the poster. If you want to see some good looking ""movie stars"" that's another reason you should see this. When I say ""movie stars"" keep in mind these are not exactly De Niro,Streep,Blanchett etc.caliber. Anne Hathaway, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Garner,Jessica Biel, Shirley MacLaine(as always) I thought were good (as good as you can be in a movie like this). As for the rest (this is just my opinion): Ashton Kutcher should stick to Punk'd (or something like that). Julia Roberts I don't really know what she's thinking lately (like turning down The Blind Side-what? to be in this). Guys from G.Anatomy thank God they're nice to look at (and that's about it). Jamie Foxx I feel like he plays the same guy in every movie,every music video, every TV appearance he does. Taylor & Taylor:one should hang on to the guitar and the other should be thankful to Stephenie Meyer for the rest of his life. And to save ""the best"" for last: Jessica Alba - I don't really know what she should stick to because she's not a ""multi-career"" individual like some of these other ones (as far as I know). She should just stay pretty and say nothing (oh that voice-drives me crazy).Anyway if you keep your expectations low for this movie it might mot be so bad to see.",Valentine's Day
185,Black_October,"Not quite as good as Love Actually, but a good romance",8,19 February 2010,"I went in to the theater expecting some shocking movie, but I was quite surprised. Valentines Day had a good twist and it kept me captivated and at the end...wanting more. The only bit that was a bit random was Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner. I thought there roles were annoying and Taylor Swift was acting like a dumb blonde which was extremely misguiding. Jennifer Garner was likable as were Bradley Cooper and Julia Roberts (although her role could've been extended)I also found the fact that Bradley Cooper turned out to be gay disappointing since we all wanted him to get with Julia Roberts. Jessica Alba's role was...tiny and Anne Hathaway's job as a adult phone entertainer was extremely awkward. Emma Roberts and her boyfriend were kind of...irrelevant to the story and I WAS ANNOYED THAT WHEN JENNIFER G AND THE FLORIST DUDE KISSED THEY THOUGHT IT WAS AWKWARD. Otherwise, great movie. Not quite as good as Love Actually, but they set the bar extremely high!!",Valentine's Day
186,callmebond,hell lot of fun. :),9,16 February 2010,"This is one of the movies that i've waited the most since last year and it's worth the wait. Watching it is a hell lot of fun. It's romantic, it's funny, it's rom-com. It's all about LOVE-LOVE-LOVE. :)) I enjoyed the movie so much. The movie revolves around the intertwined lives of different people in LA on that particular day-Valentines Day. And yeah, most of those people are played by some of the biggest names in Hollywood.The story of their lives on that day are so cute. And somehow I can relate to Kara's (Jessica Biel) story. lol. Also, it seemed to me that Ashton Kutcher was the main character. I don't know if its just me, but..whatever. :)) Have I already mentioned how cute Taylor Swift was? She was like this chic that was like so lovable. She was like my major crush. lol. Also, Anne Hathaway was hot as ever. In this movie love comes in different ways. From the so-called puppy love, to high school love, to mid-aged love and the old-aged love. The puppy love story was so fun to watch. The boy (i forgot his name) made me laugh when he had his teacher as his Valentine. Another interesting story was the one that involved Kutcher, Garner, Alba, and Dempsey, I wouldn't spoil it for you so you better watch it. The Taylors make a good couple too. And oh, keep your eyes open because there was this some sort of a surprise that made me say WTF inside the cinema. Let's just say it was an unusual relationship to avoid spoilers. And I have to admit, I didn't see that coming.So overall, the movie is very entertaining. However, I must say, don't expect much from its trailer. But one thing's for sure, you'll start and end the movie with a smile on your face.PS: And yes, for singles out there who are undecided to watch it, go for it. It's OK. It will take your bitterness away. ;D",Valentine's Day
187,Iknowthatnow,Pleasantly surprised,7,13 February 2010,"I was the token husband who took this in on opening night with my wife. I liked most of the actors in the film, which certainly helps, but found the stories engaging. As the movie progressed, I became a bit annoyed at the parallels with Love Actually. I hadn't seen or heard the comparisons, or even any reviews prior to seeing the movie, other than noting a 2 star review in the Trib. I love Love Actually, and was noting enough similarities which is why I came to this site tonight after seeing the movie to see if the writer/producer or anyone of note was the same.Spoiler....The intertwined stories, holiday romantic comedy, little boy with one parent, in love (ending up being an ethnic enchantment in both cases), the girl with the constant ringing phone which perpetually interrupts her love life, the infidelities & heartbreak, airport scenes, etc. It certainly seems to pay homage to LA. In the end I found it entertaining, and a great movie to see with your significant other for Valentine's or whenever for that matter.",Valentine's Day
188,Teayo,Not what I expected,2,14 March 2010,"This movie while a star studded affair really didn't stack up to what I thought it would be.From Kathy Bates cheating on her husband to Taylor Lautner playing a dumb jock.. Taylor Swift proving herself as a dumb blond and Anne Hathaway surprising everyone in being a phone sex operator(which after most her movies is quite out there).. Then you have the Bradley Cooper and Eric Dane Gay scene..Honestly Way to many story lines, Leaves one wanting to know where there is head. You just get wrapped up in one store and it switches to another. Nothing connected and made the movie flow. I was waiting for what seemed like for it to end. I wouldn't recommend this for avid movie goers or watchers as it will drive you insane with all of the non sense..",Valentine's Day

Sit back and enjoy it and don't worry if it is somewhat obvious what will happen in most cases (aren't most movies anyway?). It is a little long but does not drag very much. I enjoyed it and think you will as well. A number of couples are featured and their exploits about how they get together, stay together or if they should split up. I enjoyed the roles played by Jamie Fox and Jessica Biel and I always like any movie that Julia Roberts is in. Shirley MacLaine also looks great. If you are having issues in your love life, one of them is sure to be covered in this movie.",Valentine's Day
190,alicenwndrln,Cute movie,8,11 February 2010,"It's hard for me to be totally impartial, since I worked on this movie, but here's what I will say: Jessica Biel & Jennifer Garner have charisma to spare. Taylor Swift is surprisingly funny. She was a pleasant edition. Taylor Lautner is underused. I loved the Bradley Cooper/Julia Robert's storyline. Jessica Alba is charming but underused. Queen Latifah & George Lopez are as funny as always. Topher Grace...I always thought he was cute on ""That '70s Show,"" but DANG, when did he get HOT?!?!? And just to reiterate, Jennifer Garner just charmed the boots off me. Cute movie, some laugh out loud moments, & a very sweet poignant surprise twist at the end (well, a couple of those, I guess), I would recommend this movie.",Valentine's Day

It is very Garry Marshall, the man knows his stuff and I seriously doubt he set out to remake Doctor Zhivago when making this. I cannot imagine all these stellar actors and actresses signing up for this unless they expected to have some fun doing it.
Unlike some movies where I like actually none of the characters I like all in this one. And that's because the people playing the character are 1 very good at their craft and 2 comedy Ain't Easy. You have to appreciate this many people pulling it off successfully.
I'm not sure exactly who I would steer toward this movie or when. I watched it alone and typically Valentine's Day is simply another day for me. I liked it. It was entertaining. At some point early on I got distracted out of sight of the screen and only hearing the dialogue. The often recognizable voices speaking - the dialogue- brought me back and I Backed up to where I stepped away, sat down, stayed put and enjoyed myself.",Valentine's Day
192,Chickory,A nice sweet movie,7,13 April 2010,"This is a sweet little movie about how love is a major factor in everyone's life, for better or for worse. There are many stories going on here and I think fewer would have been better, though I cannot say which ones would have been the ones to cut. The nice thing about having so many stories is that it brings home the point that everyone has issues and something going on, even if their lives look settled and perfect from the outside. There was something to love about each of the stories. Ann Hathaway can really do dialects. That was just fun! I thought the 2 Taylors' interview scene was one of the funniest things I have seen in a long time. I laugh a lot every time I think of it. There were some really great moments in each story and a couple of really memorable lines. It is an enjoyable movie. It is not attempting to be the dark movie about the futility of life or enlightening us about some complete mystery. It is a light piece about probably the biggest driving force of our lives.",Valentine's Day

Although I'm a women I'm not overly fond of the typical ""chick flick"", so this scored highly for me as it wasn't.It was a film about love yes,but not a sappy, gooey one.A great ensemble cast acts out the lives of various LA dwellers on loves biggest day. Though their eyes you see the different ways this day is viewed - and in turn how love is. Cynically, idealized, sensationalized, and just plain old celebrated.The all star cast is terrific, and the story lines segue into each other effortlessly. The script was littered with fantastic humor and kept you laughing all the way.It reminded me very much of an American take on the British film Love Actually - which is also a big name ensemble cast. If you've ever seen it and liked it, you will love Valentines Day Go and see this movie. You won't be sorry - and yes take your men with, they'll enjoy it too!",Valentine's Day
195,jtodahyland1,Don't know what all these bad reviews are about...,8,15 February 2010,"My girlfriend dragged me to this movie yesterday, but I came out pleasantly surprised. No, Valentine's Day is not as good as Love Actually, which seems to be the main reason everyone is bashing it, but it still has a lot to offer. Of course, there are awkward and cheesy moments; it's a romantic comedy. But the stories and connections between the characters were brilliant. While some of the stories were overly predictable, I found myself surprised more often than bored during this movie. Some weak points of VDay: 1. The acting- Yes, I know it's an all-star cast, but some of the acting (especially between the high schoolers) was downright bad. 2. Predictability- In about half of the stories, you'll know what's going to happen about 15 minutes into the movie.Some strong points of VDay: 1. It was FUNNY!!! I was laughing out loud constantly during this movie. 2. The character connections were well-done and kept me interested throughout the entire film. 3. The ending- Of course I won't ruin anything here, but the end of this movie was amazing. While Love Actually's ending is over-the-top, VDay got it right.Overall, this is a very good romantic comedy that definitely deserves better than these 1-star reviews I've been reading. My advice is to not compare every single part of it to Love Actually, although the two are very similar. Enjoy it for what it is, not for how it compares to another movie.",Valentine's Day

My wife finally agreed to leave thirty-two minutes into the film. This is a bad movie with no plot, no story,no characters, and a director 20 years past his prime. It is completely not worth waisting your valuable time seeing. To every actor in this film that is not named George Lopez, you should be ashamed for being in this movie and pray that you have not ended your career (Bradley Cooper). George's career is over as he is simply not funny anymore. He also has the tied for all time worst talk show (tied with Chevy Chase).Oh wait, George just might be the Mexican Chevy Chase. Bradley, please be careful, this is two really bad movies in a row. By the way, does anyone else agree that Ann Hathaway is the most over rated actress in Hollywood?",Valentine's Day
197,Egg24,"Disappointing, with one saving grace.",3,28 April 2010,"I was thrilled to finally see a movie in which a homosexual relationship played side-by-side with heterosexual relationships. In fact, I thought it was the most well-written and acted relationship in the movie. Bradley Cooper's performance, especially in his final scene, was genuine and moving. However, aside from this and Julia Roberts' performance, I was terribly disappointed with this movie. It clearly wanted to be ""Love Actually"" but didn't come close to making it. Taylor Swift's performance was one of the worst I have ever seen. Most of the story lines were trite and contrived. I am a fan of many of the actors in this movie, and I did not enjoy most of the performances.",Valentine's Day

This movie is all around a good fun film for a whole family to enjoy. One of the funniest things about the movie is when Taylor Swift is carrying around a giant white bear that says I LOVE YOU. It's so funny I could not stop laughing. Also if you have seen the movie, ""I am gay, so let me play!"" Go see this movie if you haven't. Trust me, it's worth the ticket price. Go and see the movie now. It's playing everywhere. George Lopez wasn't that funny in this movie though. The rest of the cast was good especially Taylor Swift.

This film is not a historical document or trying to change the world. its just trying to make you smile,and in that right alone this film wins. This movie is a who's ,who of current popular(and may i say very HOT) Hollywood. From the opening scene of Ashton Kutcher(who this film seems to be a starring vehicle for since he is in it more then anyone else)and jessica Alba, to the end with Julia Roberts,Hector Elizondo ,and Shirley Mclain.

I'm not a big fan of ""chick flicks"" and this one did actually surprise me a bit. The story line is somewhat predictable, but then again what movie isn't these days? The one thing this movie has working for it is the fact that the audience can completely understand both perspectives, that meaning the guys/girls.The movie itself is polluted with many stars that are on the rise, and many of them do a decent job in the roles that they play. The movie does move around a lot from person to person but it accomplishes that aspect at a good pace. Unless you are asleep during the whole movie, the audience should know what is happening throughout the movie.Will this win any awards? Probably not. Will you be bragging to your friends about how good this movie was? Same direction..Probably not. This is one of those movies that, while it may not be worth the eight to ten bucks you spend at the theater for it, it is definitely one of those movies that you should watch at some point if you have a spare moment. This movie isn't going to blow you off your feet and you will be able to predict what happens during some parts of the movie. However, i don't believe the intention of this movie was to blow people off their feet but instead, was made as a simple, energetic, romantic comedy about Valentines Day. It accomplishes just that.",Valentine's Day

OK, so it's not anything we haven't seen before but it isn't trying to be. I went and saw Valentine's Day with my friend earlier today, just for something to do and I thought it was fine for what it is. It's just completely harmless and innocent. OK, so it's really cheesy but that's what you would expect from a film called Valentine's Day. There are a lot of story lines going on in this film so none of them go in to much detail which I didn't mind really because if there's a storyline or characters that you don't like, at least the film doesn't stay in one place for too long! And there are a couple of really cute little twists near the end. I'd say go and watch it if you like romantic films and aren't expecting some deep and meaningful film- it's just a bit of fun. I'm not going to rush out and buy this as soon as it comes out but I would happily sit through it again and think it's a great film for a girlie night in.",Valentine's Day

Don't get me wrong this is no rag on the Percy Jackson and the Olympians movie. i personally love those books the movie was just disappointing but still good I suppose if you didn't read the books. But this movie was just a mess I mean a mess. Sure it had some great actors I love Jennifer garner and the two Jessica's even the handsome Bradley cooper but having a few great actors doesn't make it a good movie.

203,ben-voegele,Someone please help me understand....,8,22 June 2010,"...Why everyone hates this movie so much! I'll never understand people that go into Rom-Com's with any kind of expectations at all. Pretty much every Rom-Com ever written follows the exact same formula, so expecting Valentine's Day to be some kind of ground-breaking world-changer just shows your own ignorance regarding film, not the writers or actors.This movie is pure fluff, the kind of film you go to see to shut your mind off for a couple of hours. It's not deep or layered or full of any kind of overtones - and it never pretends that it is.As someone who has no real belief in love or any interest in a relationship (why buy the cow when the milk is always free in LA?), I was still able to suspend my cynicism long enough to enjoy the film.It's no Love Actually, I know, but again, this movie NEVER TRIES TO BE. It is unabashedly 2 hours of cutesy, formulaic puff - and for what it's trying to be - it succeeds very well.I never found myself bored or questioning the logic of the characters motives, and this is all knowing exactly what was around every corner. THAT'S OKAY, PEOPLE. It's okay for a movie to be predictable and formulaic, as it's a Rom-Com and EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM is predictable and formulaic! I have seen hundreds, probably thousands of films, and I can think of about 50 off the top of my head that were FAR worse than this one.Valentine's Day is exactly what you expect it to be, and if that's not for you, that's perfectly fine. But as far as Rom-Com's go, this one is pretty solid overall in its delivery.I'd honestly give it a 5 overall (6 or 7 being highest I could ever rate a Rom-Com), but I'm giving it an 8 to off-set some of the incredibly unnecessary harsh criticism it's receiving.If you rated this film a 1, then I can't fathom how you could rate either of the Transformers any higher.This movie is what it is. Stop expecting more than that.",Valentine's Day

While the film dies have it's moments of sincere laughter (Jamie Foxx knows comedy) and undeniable cuteness (the young actor who portrays little Edison is too adorable for words), the majority of the film relies on all to familiar romantic comedy story lines and plot twists. At least one storyline used in this film is pertinent to any other similar film in the past couple years (*cough*He's Just Not That Into You*cough*), so you may find that you're asking yourself if you've seen this movie before...? Chances are you probably have. And with better dialogue and acting. It's such a pity that many of the prolific actor featured in this ensemble are forced to work with what can only be described as a sloppy and hastily written screenplay. It's as if the production company was more worried about snagging high profile celebrities rather than greenlighting a decent script. Which makes me wonder, did a casting director just walk around LA asking actors if they wanted to be in a movie today? It also makes me ponder which actors were also approached, but wisely said no...All in all, if you're looking to spend your time (not to mention money) watching something that's been done and redone several times before then go ahead. Otherwise, wait for the DVD or see something worth it (ie. ""The Hurt Locker"").",Valentine's Day
206,mbraun-1,"Valentine's Day: 23 actors, zero stars",1,15 February 2010,"Ever sat through 120 minutes of Tasters Choice commercials in a row?WE bought the VIP seating and dinner for this god-awful mess. Started at 7:18 and when I checked my watch at 8:30, my wife asked me how long it was. ""2 hours, 23 minutes"" I said. She was not amused... and neither were the couple of couples who existed at 9 pm in front of us. Tepid, shop-worn cuts of lives that criss-cross each other, this worked for Altman much of the time but not here. Titles ran for way, way too long and cardboard direction (i.e. silent people holding conversations behind actors) was too dumb to be believed. The humor was lightweight when it happened at all, and we, the audience always felt like there's got to be a payoff somewhere. Editing was sloppy when not entirely flat. It was as if we'd just missed the direction: ""aaaand walk,"" over and over again.I have a rule that only a true piece of junk uses gag reels for end titles, and sadly, this did, too. In fact, the best line in the film wasn't really in the film at all, but out of Julia Roberts' mouth as reference to PRETTY WOMAN which was a gem. If anything, this stands as a mess worthy f $1 rental just to see how bad it can get.",Valentine's Day
207,chpapoutsis,Not so bad,7,14 February 2013,"Maybe I am the minority, but it was not so bad. OK Love Actually was better, but if i gave a 10 to the movie Love Actually, here i think that the movie deserves a 7. It was not so funny, but it was funny. It was not a masterpiece, but i am sure that it was interesting, and i had a nice experience, having seen a movie, that promises a good time, and not a Merryl Streep performance. Fair enough! Anyway it was better than the reviews. I suppose that many people remember the experience from the movie love actually, and they are looking forward to feel it again. OK i would like also to see the next love actually, but this is unfair expectation for a pleasant movie like this. Let' s not be so hard with the romantic movies. 7/10",Valentine's Day

I don't even like romcoms, but I thought this was pretty good. It's definitely a little bad at times, and the acting isn't great... But it's not like it's BAD.

211,pranavgupta-56553,Valentines Day Review (Bust),1,28 February 2019,"This was one of the most poorly edited, poorly directed movies I have ever seen. With virtually no plot it was hard to watch. There was no real connection throughout the movie to it was basically a bunch of random scenes compiled together. There was not enough backstory as to Jennifer Gardners relationship, Brandley Coopers, or Jessica Albas and Ashton Kutchers. As small characters in the movie, there was also no backstory as to Taylor Lautners relationship with Taylor swift. We were left to imagine the depth of their relationships instead of witnessing them on the screen. To my surprise Bradley Cooper plays gay with Sean Jackson( NFL football player) but theres no backstory on their relationship, or why he is gay when he clearly had a strong relationship with Julia Roberts throughout the movie. Overall I thought this movie was absolutely terrible.",Valentine's Day
212,statgirl2003,Not as cheesy as reviewed,7,21 February 2010,"I was very torn after reading the reviews on this site once I had decided to go see it. I went anyway and was very glad I did. It was a good date movie. (Even my husband thought it wasn't as bad as people said it was!)George Lopez and Ashton Kutcher have a great relationship in this movie. They are very comical to watch together and they complement each other very well. Jessica Biel and Jennifer Garner also did a great job battling love and drama while still holding true to their bond as friends. It was great to see how their story lines flowed through the whole movie - these four actors really pulled the whole movie together.It has sappy parts but for the most part it keeps true to the idea of Valentine's Day! Some people hate it, some people love it but it always seems to cause chaos in everyones lives.",Valentine's Day

214,purplewombat20,Not sure what people wanted but it is a cute movie,9,30 May 2010,"I'm really not sure what is with all the negative reviews. I thought this was very cute movie and that is all it was trying to be. It was just going for sappy cute romantic comedy, not some world changing movie. And with that goal in mind I thought it very much succeeded. I had no trouble figuring out who was dating who, nor did I feel like I didn't see enough of each cast member.I had my doubts before I saw this movie and now I want my own copy. I loved the way Bradley Cooper's story line was handled, that it wasn't made any bigger deal than any of the others. I thought all the acting was good for the type of movie it was. Again, I don't feel it was the intention to break new ground in romantic comedies. But it was a lovely movie. And I also don't understand why I'm not allowed to enjoy both 'Love Actually' and 'Valentine's Day'.I suggest renting this movie and judging for yourself. Just make sure you understand what you're renting before hand! It is a light romantic comedy and that is all it wants to be.",Valentine's Day
215,manpreetbhasin,This movie is piece of $hit,1,31 May 2020,"About Movie: I watched whole movie. That tells my courage because i was duped by the cast of movie. I was talking to somebody yesterday, saying Julia Roberts has not done one bad move, and boy was I proven wrong so quickly. (Her role was not that bad, and Bradley cooper was fine too. ) Whole movie is just sporadic pieces of information, floating around. I would give C to anybody in my class if I was teaching in Cinema school. Script was extremely bad, story was disconnected, had totally senseless characters thrown here and there. Somebody was really burning their money, bringing such high flying names to their passion project. They successfully created one of the worst movies just to put their names on credits. (No) thanks to Netflix also, for showing having this label in their line.For watchers: Please do not watch this movie. Or, please do. I tried to warn.",Valentine's Day
216,Rocbrah,Much Better Than Expected,8,11 February 2010,"First of all, i'm a guy. I'm into movies of all kinds, so I didn't have to get dragged to see a romantic comedy by my girlfriend. I was in two minds about this movie before we watched it, having so many big name actors all in one movie I thought might detract from the story somewhat, but I thought it might work if they do it right. Well, they did. This movie had me feeling for, well, MOST of the main characters. Ashton Kutcher was very good in this movie, he also had one of the bigger roles and he pulled it off really well. The others were mostly good too, Taylor Swift's character was kind of annoying, but I think she was supposed to be. The story had me intrigued from beginning to end, seeing how all the different characters were connected and the chemistry between each couple was very believable also. If you watch this with your partner, it will make you feel closer. If you watch this without your partner, it will make you miss them. If you watch this while single, it will give you hope that there's someone out there for you. I'd recommend this to anyone who's looking for a good valentines day romance or even just a good movie. 8/10",Valentine's Day
217,dan769,This Really Is As Bad As All The Reviews Said,2,23 February 2010,"I don't think I've ever seen a more shameless attempt to rid the general public of some of there spare cash. This film is just awful from start to finish! The plot is virtually non existent which works in films where story is replaced with characterisation. Unfortunately for this movie there are far too many stars trying to fill the screen time that you never really care for a single one of them. Virtually none of the characters are developed at all, Ashton Kutcher is about the only person you really learn anything about.The two Taylor's (Swift & Lautner) are blatantly just put in the film to attract the teenage girl fan base which has worked. Just look on any FaceBook group to read how many teens are falling over this film because Taylor Lautner is hot. This wouldn't be so annoying if it wasn't for the fact his part in the story is totally irrelevant and so short that if it was removed in a new edit nobody would notice.I don't remember watching a comedy film that doesn't have a single funny moment within the entire film. Coupled with no plot, no character development, poor acting and a barrage of Rom-Com clichés you end up with one of the worst films in recent years And it was still a number 1 box office smash. God help us all",Valentine's Day
218,bateman-tj,soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad.,1,17 July 2010,"awful, just awful. shamelessly sets out to be love actually and fails, badly. the dialogue is forced and contrived, the characters are shallow and unappealing, the story lines are recycled and uninspired. don't waste your time. really. i have seen some bad movies in my day, but this one takes the cake. it's not even that good kind of bad you can watch with friends over a few drinks to laugh at and talk over. this movie is overwhelmingly awful, especially given the number of mediocre to adequate stars in it. the acting is fine, but the script is painfully awkward and totally unoriginal. the movie did evoke some emotional reaction in me, though- i was actually embarrassed for the production team as i watched it. though i've never been terribly impressed with the level of intelligent decision making in Hollywood, i'm surprised this one made it through. i don't think i've ever seen a worse movie.",Valentine's Day
219,helinozupekce,Watchable but totally not a Love Actually,5,12 February 2010,"This movie just like a red carpet, a series of stars. It is convincing you to watch it but not convincing enough to ""love"" it. I am really a romantic comedy person, I like the happy endings etc. But if the movie is only about it, not containing any originality, you are asking if your time is worth it? Only the Julia Roberts story's ending was made me smile, and the child's love to his teacher. I even couldn't feel the ""love"" in the movie. The concept is same with the Love Actually which still makes me smile when I remember the scenes from the movie, but the effect of this movie ended after 15 minutes, and I can't remember a scene that hit me. Still watchable, can make you smile and happy in Valentine's Day, but if you didn't watched the Love Actually, it is better to watch a remarkable one than this one.",Valentine's Day

Coming out on the weekend of ""Single Awareness"" Day, laughter is the best medicine for those alone on Valentines Day. It is comparable to Love Actually, but an American version, so there are many more people twisted into the story line, and the love is definitely not as deep or serious. The movie says so much about America, and how much of an emphasis we put on this one day. It even shows the side of those who loathe the day, or could care less about another day to tell someone you love them. I would recommend this movie to just about anyone, except for young audiences. There are some unexpected twists and turns that keep the movie from being predictable, and even at times had the entire female population of the audience screaming. If you are looking to enjoy the holiday a light hearted way, Valentine's Day is the way to go.",Valentine's Day
222,mani2604,Valentine's day: This one is for everybody,7,12 February 2010,"well it ain't a movie you wud remember for ages but its quite cool love stories fest.. the clever part of the film is its presentation of love to different age groups ranging from kids to old age as well as the portrayal of different stages of love- first love,infatuation,confusing love,pretty serious,marriage,deception and whatnot! the plot line of lautner & swift is quite funny. Biel's valentine day haters party is real fun. OK i don't want to put any spoilers. So my verdict is JUS SIT BACK AND ENJOY. The background score is good wid couple of tracks from taylor swift,winehouse,michael franti.. And the fun part at the end credits where gary marshall inserted a reference to his ' pretty woman' Limodriver: have u ever taken a turn at this rodeo drive.

223,shandance,If you loved 'Love Actually' do NOT see Valentine's Day,1,10 February 2010,"All star cast, great premise and timely release unfortunately do not make up for poor script, tacky comedy and a general go nowhere film. Basically a Hollywood rip off of something that the UK has already done to glorious success. While each of the characters were stand alone acceptable the need for the script to somehow tie them all together in a Love Actually fashion became tiresome and somewhat irrelevant. After watching the film you'll find yourself counting how many of the stars and starlets on the poster were even necessary in the film and start realising that the number of 'name' actors in the film is directly proportionate to the number of dollars it cost you for the ticket. Had they dropped 8 of the major players out and actually investigated the remaining stories a little further, rather than jumping back and forward between around a dozen limp ones, it may have been two dollars well spent. Don't waste your money - $12 will buy cheap roses from the petrol station and will probably be a more memorable gift to your significant other.",Valentine's Day
224,adrengimdb,Extremely superficial,1,17 February 2010,"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen, which is quite an achievement for a film with so many well-known actors.I think I agree with many people that the film is very boring, too long, too predictable and that the humor is rather flat and not very original.However, many people seem to think that this is a romantic comedy, and while this is probably really the genre for which this film is classified, there is very little about love and romance in this film. But I disagree. Yes, the characters do have sex quite often and they sometimes flirt, but there are no deep feelings in the film, no love, no romance, everything is very superficial - superficial people, superficial feelings, very superficial stories.When I watched the film, I even thought that this might be a way in which one could appreciate it: as a kind of horror film about a world without love in which people flirt superficially and have sex, but are completely unable to have deeper feelings for someone. If viewed this way, the film might almost be interesting. But obviously, this would mean interpreting too much into this film. The film is extremely commercial, and a film with the name 'Valentine's Day' that comes out around Valentine's day and has many famous actors in it is bound to have some success, and therefore, more interesting stories and the depiction of expressions of real feelings would be a waste of resources. Sex is obviously easier to depict that deeper feelings, therefore, there is just sex and no love - the makers of this film are very parsimonious.There is nothing original about this film, and luckily we can be quite sure that it will soon be forgotten.",Valentine's Day

I guess the camera work is okay.I went to see this film with a couple of friends who are recently single. I can honestly say i wish i had sat at home and banged my head against a door for a couple of hours. The best part about the film was leaving and going to the pub afterwards. The so called ""interlinked"" story lines was the worst bit i thought, i don't know if anyone else found this, but i found it exhausting to keep up with what was happening with who, seeing as all the actors and actresses look like clones of each other anyway. For a film that is tipped to be like Love Actually (my fave romcom), this is embarrassingly rubbish and comes nowhere close to others of it's kind. Sorry Ashton, but i think you're a bit...past it now. My advice is, if you like films, don't go and see this.",Valentine's Day

On the contrary, we found it funny, fresh, with a few twists we did not see coming...(and we are the people we figured out Sixth Sense 5 minutes into the movie!) Valentine's Day is a feel-good movie...and in this day and time, just what we needed. We easily kept up with the many characters, it was cleverly written, visually pleasing, Taylor Swift was hilarious, who knew? The clever connections with Shirley McClaine and Julia Roberts, wonderfully done...and wait and see, this movie will take off by word of mouth...we found it wonderful!

How can directors and producers look at this film at post-production and say, ""yes, this is good, people will like it."" You would think one production assistant with a spine, would stand up and tell his or her peers that this film is a pile of c-r-a-p and here is how to fix it.

228,turtle_egg,made me physically gag,1,25 February 2010,"This film had no redeeming qualities. It rolled out cliché after cliché and all of them were achingly unfunny. The script, storyline, visuals, acting, you name it were dire. I never usually write reviews but I was compelled to owed to the fact that I actually felt ANGRY and depressed when I left the cinema last night! ALL of the characters were awful and here are a few of the lowlights: Sickening child ""in love"" made me physically gag and it's probably the third time (1st & 2nd - kids in love actually) i've wished for a child character to die on screen.The sports star coming out of the closet was unrealistic and vile. The quote ""I'm gay and it's time to play"" was actually cringlingly out of character for the badly drawn and limited personality.At least three of the men and women all looked the same and it was difficult to decipher who was doing what. Then again, I was trying to conserve brain cells by watching with eyes half closed.Aston Kutcher was even more wooden than usual. In fact when I saw his acting it was the only thing that made me laugh in the whole film.The worst thing though. The WORST thing... were the complete cretinous, moronic mongoloids and waste of human cells sitting directly behind me. They laughed at every single inane, obvious and dire moment captured in the film. I despair for the fate of humankind.",Valentine's Day

I watch a lot of films and am quite critical but this was straightforward fun-you'll leave with a smile on your face! Make your own decision-go and see it! So it's not rocket science but it has a good cast, surprise endings and is generally the feel good film it intends to be. It's not annoyingly schmaltzy and some of the messages are quite apt even if you don't live in a Hollywood movie! OK so the cast are sickeningly good looking but so what-that's part of the fun. It's not fair to compare this to 'Love Actually' as they are very different films but I have to confess that whilst I did enjoy Love Actually I actually far preferred this.",Valentine's Day
230,franciscafei,For people who hate Valentine's Day.,4,5 April 2010,"I sure remember the first reaction of my girlfriends, when I showed them the trailer of ""Valentine's Day"". We all agreed to watch it.What looked promising in the beginning, was quite a let-down, if you consider the cast chosen, which was the main reason for this movie to be so popular (to people, who haven't seen it yet, obviously). And the reason for it to be such a flop.Again, I have to point out, that the main problem is the number of people in the story. Motion pictures tend to do it like short stories. Same or familiar places, short time span (although there are a few exceptions) and most importantly: a small amount of characters.In this movie, the number was so big, that I had troubles remembering the characters' names. Except for ""Reed"" (Ashton Kutcher had a great deal of scenes), ""Felicia"" (because her character was utterly annoying) and ""Edgar"" (since his names was screamed aloud many times on that particular graveyard), I can hardly recall any. It's come to the point where people write things like: ""I liked the twist in the end, with Bradley Cooper's sexual orientation."", using the actors name, because they simply forgot the one of his character. And the firstly mentioned Jessica Alba (see trailer) had all in all - I guess - 5 minutes in the movie or so.It is also highly unrealistic, that on a single day, a guy proposing to his girlfriend (and gets turned down) would realize his love for his BEST friend.The problem of the names would not bother me, if there was a development in character, but the sad thing is, that even those were portrayed incompletely. There was no history whatsoever, no depth in their personality.However, the movie still has some humorous parts, where the watchers smirk once in a while or break out in laughter. Jessica Biel's role (again, I forgot the name) was acted out very dramatically, maybe showing, how every one of us singles feel on Valentine's Day.So my advice: Save yourself the money. Buy it on DVD when it's released and watch it with your girlfriends on the next Valentine's Day (IF you are single). Get some chocolate and some reminder that somewhere out there, there may be a guy for you. Or a girl.",Valentine's Day

But in this gently following dancing 2 hours, the sweetness of love just hovering in the air to invade all my senses, yet left the freshness for me to savor. A surprisingly engaging and enjoyable but not so Hollywood style romance, I've almost mistaken it as a British movie. All the actors and actresses have presented a moving story, and I truly enjoyed it. I think I will put it into the list of my perennial favorite list.PS: The system says there are spelling mistakes, but actually, they are not the American spelling, dug it up on Google, and fixed it...Errrr....",Valentine's Day

Money thrown, time wasted... Instead, I really would enjoy to watch Love Actually again, or at least a later movie, like He's just not that into you...

This movie is beyond awful, its painful. Who needs water boarding, show this movie to terrorists and promise to turn it off if they supply useful information to us. I can only wonder why a cast of such stars would all agree to shoot a movie without having read the script beforehand. Ashton Kutcher was especially unwatchable. This movie was so bad and yet had so many good actors that I thought it was Ocean's 14 for a minute. The movie was free and I still want my money back. At least Jamie Fox was good.",Valentine's Day

The two Taylor's, Lautner and Swift, play their love-struck high school couple with a cheerful amount of tongue-in-cheek; Kutcher proves his charisma can go a long way as a heartbroken florist; and Cooper and Roberts (Julia, that is) are intriguing as plane passengers who don't know each other.

236,Elilovesfilms,Best Rom-Com in a long time!,10,18 August 2010,"This film falls under the category of 'chick flick' or 'Rom-Com' and if you usually like a good Rom-Com then i'd say this film is definitely for you! I watched this film with a group of two teenage girls, two teenage boys, a twenty five year old boy, and a forty-five year old couple. Every single one of us enjoyed this film! It is often hard to find a film which satisfies every person, especially in a large group but afterwards we all came away happy with our choice of entertainment for the evening.This film gives you a bit of hope in love and may even bring a pessimist who believes valentines day is purely a commercially driven hallmark holiday created to make us spend more money to prove we love, or in fact lust, someone a different and maybe even happier view on the holiday or maybe even love itself. Dare I say that although I went into the film with the views stated above, I came away almost wishing I had a valentine this year! Although this film is predictable, that is common of most movies in this genre so I wouldn't say it was a very surprising feature but at the same time (sorry to contradict myself) it did have one or two moments where we all went 'Oh, well i wasn't expecting that!' If you are looking for a philosophical, intellectual film - this is not it! If you are looking for a nice bit of light hearted banter and a bit of mushy gushy love story - this is your film! As well as having a great story line which changed frequently enough for you not to get bored but not too much for you to lose connection with each individual person/section of the story it also has a star studded cast and let's be honest... that many famous people would not have decided to be in this film if it was awful, would they?So if, like me, you love a good Rom-Com now and again ignore these cynics and watch it! Believe me, you won't be disappointed.",Valentine's Day
237,horsmanem,Valentine's Day,9,29 August 2010,"I watched the movie Valentine's Day for the movie review. This is one of my favorite movies, so there are many things I liked about it. I really enjoyed the different relationships present throughout the movie. The multiple relationships made the movie interesting so one doesn't get bored with just one love story. There were many different points of view of the relationships which helps you better understand the situations. I was pleased with the way the director had the movie going from one relationship to another. It would change characters at a good point to make a viewer want to know more, but didn't show you too much at once. This kept me really interested in the movie because I was constantly wanting to know what was going to happen with each relationship next. The filming was done in a way that I felt like it actually happened. There was a car wreck and a big press conference and the whole filming crew did a good job at making it completely believable that it actually happened. This is something I look for in a movie, because in many movies and it seems obvious that everything was staged.The acting in this movie wasn't the best; Taylor Swift was an annoying character the way she was trying to act like a young high school student. I didn't like her character or most of the other teenage characters because I felt the teenage plot lines were very insignificant. They weren't interesting enough to interrupt the other relationships that I was really interested in. Those plot lines didn't seem very realistic and seemed too overdone. I also didn't like the way some of the relationships turned out, that was a big disappointment for me towards the end. There should have been more sexual tension in the movie. The characters were too blunt about how they felt about each other which caused the sexual tension to not be able to be present in the movie. Sexual tension would have kept me more interested and I would have definitely enjoyed the movie a little more.Grease reminded me a little of Valentine's Day in the multitude of relationships throughout the movie. There was also the mystery of not knowing exactly what's going to happen within the relationships. I did enjoy how they weren't as straight forward about what was going to happen next between the characters. In Grease there were also relationships where one member was not loyal to the other like when Danny didn't stay loyal to Sandy the whole time. This is similar to the relationship between the doctor and Julia in Valentine's Day because he had a wife and a girlfriend. Both movies had relationships at a high school age but I enjoyed those younger relationships in Grease more. These seemed more realistic and kept me more interested than the ones in Valentine's Day. Since Grease is a musical it is hard to compare the directors of the two movies because they were both trying to direct in a different way. The musical aspect of Grease made the movie more interesting because all the feelings of people and points they were trying to get across were done in song. Overall I enjoyed Valentine's Day more than I did Grease because of the plot line of Valentine's Day.",Valentine's Day
238,rosie-p-osie,Disappointed,6,28 January 2011,"Not being a romantic person myself, I was disappointed with this movie.Although having a star cast, the amount of characters made it hard to follow from the beginning. I found it to be more or less a rip-off of Love Actually.Even though some parts were sweet, most were clichéd. I wouldn't pay to see this again.If you are into a clichéd, romantic movie, I would recommend this one, though it may not appeal to all viewers.With maybe a few less characters, this movie would have been easier to follow, so I rate this a 6/10.",Valentine's Day
239,MI_DVD_renter,They Must Have Done It for the Money,1,27 February 2011,"Don't let the incredible cast fool you: this movie is painfully horrible. Apparently a whole bunch of first-tier Hollywood types had a little time to kill, and figured they could score a good payday by selling their reputations.Garry Marshall is one of my favorite directors, and many of the stars of this 80-minute piece of trash are people I look to for quality entertainment. Not this time.The DVD doesn't include any outtakes (just deleted scenes). My guess is that they don't have outtakes because they used the first take of every scene.No worry about a spoiler alert from us. We turned the movie off after 20 minutes and really don't care how it ended.",Valentine's Day
240,niloofarnazari26,Valentine's Day,7,5 May 2011,"when i heard the name of movie i said to my self this movie should be great and after that when i watched it i like it!yes i like because this is a good movie that we can see and enjoy . this movie shows how people connecting to each other . it shows love Especially between Jason)and (Anne Hathaway). it shows well Eventually betrayed.plus it shows you can choice your work ,you can think that your job is better than love but after that your will be alone .so why we say this is not good movie i think this is a good and Promising . because when some one watch they said to them self some one waiting for me at the out door. plus this movie has big star as Jessica Alba ,Bradley Cooper,Ashton Kutcher ,Jennifer Garner and other. now you have two reason to see this movie.",Valentine's Day
241,heehawchoke,For parents (heads up on iff-eee parts),8,18 June 2011,"Really Good movie! I loved the ending. My 11 year old sister watched it with me and my friend and her older sister who is 18. We all loved the movie, though my 11 year old sister got a little embarrassed about the tiny little mention of sex, but honestly, its only a little bit and the rest of us found it humorous. So, for all and any parents... Two of the main characters are planning to have sex at lunch while the parents are away at work, mom comes home when only the boyfriend is at the girlfriends house sees him naked, (they don't show any parts 8)!!!!) and he runs out of the house runs into the girlfriend while running down the street naked see is on her way to house to have sex. It is really funny. The only other kinda weird part is that one of the other girls is broke that the only job she could find that pays good and keeps her like not having to do sex or be a stripper is to be a adult phone entertainer where she says all the naughty things she'll do to your body when you call in. Really good movie.I think its good for 11-any age.",Valentine's Day
242,rockindaddy08,Most romantic movie eva (says my wife),9,17 July 2020,"I don't understand the low score....What do people want from a movie??? This is a feel good movie, should be watched with your significant other every year on VALENTINES DAY! It even has the classic ""The End"" with some fun bloopers afterwards. Highly recommend.",Valentine's Day

244,coloradoaussie,Too many names not enough story,2,6 November 2010,"After watching the online trailers, reading all about the buzz of the film with it's commanding list of quality actors, I was quite keen to watch Garry Marshall's take on Valentines Day.I had hoped for a crossed storyline set up similar to 'Love Actually' but instead sat through a fractured mess of wasted talent without even the slight chance of cheering on any particular character. The most annoying character had to be Taylor Swift. I couldn't stand her over the top acting or her obnoxious character.The film may have appeared like a good idea on paper but it just didn't carry onto film..too many actors, not enough story and no real character development. Apart from Anne Hathaway's fabulous take on phone sex operators, the rest of the film was a long winded snooze fest.The only enjoyable moment was the outtake of Julia Roberts in the limo at the end.",Valentine's Day
245,majoros-maria,It could have been a really good movie... but its director was Garry Marshall,3,26 October 2015,"I remember, I haven't seen this movie for years. Garry Marshall is an awful director, but I'm unable to dislike him since I've grown up through his films. This film has a great cast. All of them are talented, or at least famous celebrities which can attract every generation. Shirley Maclaine and Hector Elizondo for elderly people, Julia Robert, Bradley Cooper, Queen Latifah for middle-aged people and starts like Taylor Swift (who is a great singer but a terrible actress), Jessica Alba, Taylor Lautner for teenagers. But its horrible. Jessica Alba is one of the most overrated actresses nowadays, Taylor Swift danced on my nerves with her disgusting Teddy-bear. I feel sorry for Shirley Maclaine, who was great as Mrs Levinson in Downton Abbey or the lesbian teacher in The Children's Hour. However I would have felt delighted if I had been casted in this movie, because there are a lot of actors and actresses I adore.",Valentine's Day
246,ted-985-618100,Worst Movie Ever,1,10 October 2016,"Wife made me watch this with her because it had ""star power"". The only power it had was to make me constantly throw up in my mouth over and over again. This was honestly the worst movie I have ever seen. Terrible acting, worse writing, and everything was predictable from the start to the end. I'm hoping it ends soon.Oh God. It's still going. Now my wife is laughing. I'm wondering if this is grounds for divorce.My review does not contain enough lines. What else can I say besides the fact that this is so awful? Please kill me.Still not enough????? OMG. Taylor Swift is on again. Now I want to puke again. Please let it be over!!!!",Valentine's Day
247,working_titles,Utter rubbish,1,15 February 2019,"Read the other reviews for more details but if you want to watch a really bad rip off of love actually with a surprisingly star studded cast then this will be your bag. Otherwise save yourself the agony of this pointless film. Terrible script, average acting.",Valentine's Day
