0,MartinHafer,Essentially just a booby pic.,1,22 March 2019,"""Piranha 3DD"" is a film which is mostly just an excuse to show very naked women. The movie is essentially a bad disaster film combined with a soft core porno flick. I don't understand the combination and would recommend viewers who want to see copious nudity find something better and without the silly piranha plot...either a good porno or a good disaster film.The film is set at a water park where the owner has hired strippers as lifeguards. In addition to seeing various sexy ladies naked, you eventually see insane fish show up and chomp on everyone. 'Nuff said about the plot!The fact that ""Piranha 3DD"" is on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list isn't much of a surprise. After all, it's got '3DD' in the title and is rauchier and sillier than a Porky's film. Add to that cartoonish characters and dopey dialog and you have a film which seems bound to lose a lot of money. In the US, the distributors barely tried to recoup their losses but amazingly the picture did reasonably well overseas.As for me, I'm a bit ashamed I watched it. While I have been working hard to see every one of the Bottom 100, this one is dumber and dirtier than pretty much all the rest.",Piranha 3DD
1,Leofwine_draca,Execrable nonsense,2,5 April 2013,"I love PIRANHA 3D; I went to see it at the cinema a couple of times and picked it up on Blu-ray as soon as it came out. I still enjoy it now, even though I know the story by heart: it's an affectionately-made B-movie packed with gore, thrills and genuine laughs. There's little not to love about it.Inevitably, I was excited to learn that a sequel was being made, although less so when I found out that none of the creative team were returning. Then I saw the trailer. Then I found out the director was John Gulager, the man behind the godawful FEAST movies. Then I read the reviews. And I decided to hold off seeing it.Now the movie can be picked up for a couple of quid, I thought it was about time I checked it out, and boy, am I glad I waited: PIRANHA DD is an absolutely execrable movie, a pile of piddling nonsense that vomits noisily all over the original film's undeniable charms. I thought the story was slim in the first film, but this hour-long production (the rest is padding) jettisons any plotting completely and just consists of one cheesy piranha attack after another.Even worse, the story from the original isn't carried on; instead, we get a weak retread of what happened in the first. Imagine PIRANHA 3D made as a no-budget, low brow comedy and you'll be close. It's hard to choose what's worse: Gulager's embarrassing direction, which is either all over the place or so overblown as to be cringeworthy, or the shameful script, crafted by about a zillion screenwriters.The piranhas look good, but there's no gore to speak of, and the special effects are really crappy. The acting is poor, too, and the presence of some blink-and-you'll-miss-'em actors like Gary Busey and the returning Ving Rhames/Christopher Lloyd doesn't add up to much. Way too much screen time is given to David Hasselhoff, as the second half of the film forgets its format and genre and just becomes one weak gag after the next. Truly, this is a terrible film, one I'll banish the memories of as quickly as I can.",Piranha 3DD
2,SnoopyStyle,You get exactly what you expect.,5,26 August 2013,"The title tells you what to expect. This is an unabashed silly exploitation B-movie. We have a waterpark with strippers, uncaring owner, a fierce heroine played by Dannielle Panabaker, and a fitting cameo from David Hasselhoff. Who else is going to run slow-motion in his swimming trunks if not the Hoff. The underwater shots start off scary, but I get used to it after awhile. They lose their power pretty quickly. The one scene that jumped the shark is the vagina piranha. It's really stupid and really awkward. I think it's supposed to be shocking. Instead of shock, I felt annoyed.",Piranha 3DD
3,claudio_carvalho,Shutdown Your Brain and Enjoy This Gross and Funny B-Movie,6,24 November 2012,"Lake Victory is a dead place after the tragic events with the invasion of prehistoric flesh-eaters piranhas. In Cross Lake, Merkin County, the greedy Chet (David Koechner) opens The Big Wet Water Park against the will of his stepdaughter Maddy (Danielle Panabaker). When the van of her friends Travis (Paul James Jordan) and Ashley (Meagan Tandy) is found in the water and the couple is missing, Maddy and her friend Shelby (Katrina Bowden) miss them and they talk on a wooden deck on the lake; out of the blue, they are attacked by piranhas. Maddy visits the specialist in piranhas Mr. Carl Goodman (Christopher Lloyd) with her former school friend Barry (Matt Bush), who works at The Big Wet, and with her former boyfriend, Deputy Kyle (Chris Zylka), and they discover piranhas in the lake. However Chet refuses to shutdown his water park and soon his costumers are under the attack of the fearful piranhas.I saw ""Piranha 3DD"" on DVD and I found it a gross and funny B-Movie, with stupid but hilarious characters. The director knows the B-movie formula, with teats and beautiful girls. Christopher Lloyd has become stereotyped as the mad scientist in American comedies in the end of his career. The uncredited Ving Rhames afraid of the water and shooting with his leg is comical. But David Hasselhoff steals the movie making fun of himself as the most famous lifeguard of all times. If you shutdown your brain, you will certainly enjoy this movie. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Piranha 2"" (""Piranha 2"")",Piranha 3DD
4,nogodnomasters,Sold out of puppies,6,10 February 2018,"Piranha 3DD is the sequel to Piranha 3D and other than the prehistoric origin of the title critters, it is connected through its use of gratuitous nudity, Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd. The original story has Richard Dreyfus getting killed in the first scene. In this production we are happy to see it is Gary Busey. In the original feature, porn stars provided most of the topless scenes. In this one they opt to use main stream women. Perhaps the first feature should be called 3DD and this one 3D.This story takes place in Arizona where Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) is dismayed that her stepfather (David Koechner) has changed the water park into an adult water park with topless ""certified"" strippers acting as lifeguards. Meanwhile the late Gary Busey has released the hideous piranha into the town's lake. So how do we get piranha from the lake into the swimming pools? Christopher Lloyd gives us clues.The movie is a teen sex romp. It has lines which are an adolescent's dream, such as ""Let's take off all our clothes and go swimming"" and a few I can't repeat. The van scene was interesting if not sacrilegious. There is an intense lake scene with our heroine and one of the weirdest sex scenes since ""Teeth."" Up to this point I was thinking how much I liked what they did, with some new bits. Then at the climax scene, they made it ridiculous, especially the part with David Koechner.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, full frontal nudity, nudity (Irina Voronina, Cody Kennedy, plus many others)",Piranha 3DD
5,kosmasp,Joke(s) of the month,3,1 August 2012,"I really hoped this could've been (at least) as fun as the other Piranha 3D movie by A. Aja. But this never achieves those heights. Too aware and too much effort put into trying to make it cool. Even the surprise (?) cameo by a man playing a lifeguard, is something that has almost more misses than hits.The scenes during the credits (outtakes mostly) have the same vibe as the movie. Some are kind of funny, but most just miss their mark. You get a lot of nudity of course and a moment that might remind you of something out of Alien (more or less), but even that last moment is something you will see coming (no pun intended). The ending could be seen as sort of an ""evolution"", or as an ""devolution"" depending on how you look at it, I suppose ...",Piranha 3DD
6,gavin6942,Haters Gonna Hate -- I Loved This Movie!,6,29 August 2012,"After the events at Lake Victoria, the pre-historic school of blood-thirsty piranhas make their way into a newly opened water park.Judging from other reviews and the rating of this film on IMDb, it is pretty much hated by everyone. Odd then that my girlfriend and I -- who do not often share a taste in films -- both enjoyed it.Yes, the film has no plot, terrible CGI, and wastes good talent like Christopher Lloyd and Gary Busey. Yes, it seems like nothing more than an excuse to get women naked (and I have to say the nudity got a bit excessive for my liking). But the whole idea here was to have fun, and that is what the writers (and director) did.But, it was also a shining moment in Ving Rhames' career, possibly the funniest character he may ever have. And it was the greatest love letter to David Hasselhoff that will ever be written. The man will never again be taken seriously, and this takes the self-deprecation humor to a whole new level. I loved it.Not a great film, but it achieved exactly what it set out to do.",Piranha 3DD
7,jboothmillard,Piranha 3DD,1,16 May 2012,"The first film is viciously grisly, darkly funny and in moments sexy, when I found out there was going to be a sequel I was naturally excited, and the pun title gave a clue as to what would feature, 3D effects and bigger (double D) breasts. Basically it has been one year since the events at Lake Victoria, which has become a deserted and restricted area, dried up and deserted due to no tourism after the infestation of prehistoric piranha fish. But this threat is to return when in a nearby lake farmer Clayton (Gary Busey) and his friend are in the water to recover a dead cow, and below them are many more of the fish eggs that hatch, and they attack and kill the two men. Not far away, the Big Wet water park is making preparations to open to the public for the summer, and marine biology student Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), who co-owns the park, doesn't approve of her step-father Chet (David Koechner) adding an adult-themed section and hiring strippers. She also reacquaints herself with old friends, like policeman ex-boyfriend Kyle (Chris Zylka), friend Barry (Matt Bush) who has had a secret crush on her for ages, and close friends Ashley Fallon (Meagan Tandy) and Shelby (Katrina Bowden). One night Shelby and her boyfriend Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) go skinny dipping in the lake, and a baby piranha swims up into her vagina, and at the same time Ashley and her boyfriend Travis (Paul James Jordan) are having sex in their van when the handbrake is tripped and they go into the lake to be devoured by the fish. The next day Maddy consoles Shelby on the jetty, and it is there that piranhas attack them, but they get out of it and manage to have one of the fish swim on the shore to kill it. The two of them and Barry go to see Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd) to examine the fish, and he gives them the explanation that the fish are moving via sewage pipes and underground in the unseen lakes below, they conclude that the drains the fish may use go from the lake and lead into the new water park. While something is to be done, Shelby and Josh have sex, and the piranha in her vagina comes out to bite his penis, so he chops it off with a knife, and they both go to hospital. Maddy finds out that Kyle is not all that good as well, he has been accepting bribes that allow Chet to drain water for the water park from the lake, with the vast amount coming from the underground lakes. Big Wet opens to the public, with Baywatch star David Hasselhoff appearing as a celebrity lifeguard, and also arriving is Lake Victoria survivor Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames), who lost his legs, and former cameraman Andrew 'Drew' Cunningham (Paul Scheer) who pushes his wheelchair. Maddy tries to shut the park down, but Chet and Kyle stop her doing anything as they do not believe there will be any piranhas, but of course soon enough the fish come along and attack all the guests and lifeguards. Fallon has a shotgun attached to his legs and shoot many of the blood thirsty monsters, and Hasslehoff feels happy that he rescued a little boy - his first rescue in real life, and in the chaos, Chet makes a run with the money he made, before having his head sliced off by a cable. Barry starts to drain the pool to stop the fish getting in and the water flowing to dry the place out, but in the pool Maddy gets pulled down by suction, Kyle refuses to save her, so Barry, who can't swim, leaps in and saves her. Another employee at the same pours gasoline into the pipe system, and with a lit cigarette put in as well an explosion causes most of the piranhas to be blown up, and Kyle is impaled by a falling trident. As Massy and Barry kiss and feel relieved it is over, Mr. Goodman calls them and informs them that the fish are evolving, as his in the tank has grown legs and run away, and soon enough one piranha crawls out the water to attack the boy Hasselhoff rescued. Panabaker is rather dull, Lloyd is still relatively amusing, and Hasselhoff badly spoofs himself, and director John Gulager badly paces the action when it is supposed to be exciting, there are so many problems with this follow up to a hit movie. The story needed a lot of work, the acting is daft, the gore was less grisly and did not appear often enough, the penis munching and cutting sequence is just disgusting, the special effects are wasted, and no big boobs bouncing and flashing can save it, it is a terrible horror comedy sequel. Poor!",Piranha 3DD
8,Woodyanders,A total trashy tongue-in-cheek treat,8,8 September 2012,"The ferocious flesh-eating prehistoric fish make a bee-line down river so they can snack on the hard-partying tourists at the grand opening of the Big Wet Water Park. Yep, that's about it for the admittedly flimsy plot, but fortunately director John Gulager and screenwriters Patrick Melton, Joel Soisson, and Marcus Dunstan don't take any of this cheery spirited foolishness seriously for a minute; instead they pile on the tasty excessive gratuitous distaff nudity, over-the-top graphic gore, and blithely rude'n'crude humor with a go-for-broke spoofy joy and brio that's both uproarious and entertaining in good measure. The whole gloriously tasteless affair reaches its jaw-dropping sick'n'sidesplitting apex during an outrageous coitus interuptus set piece that's truly something special to behold. The lively cast really sink their teeth into the endearingly crass material: The foxy Danielle Panabaker makes for an appealing and attractive heroine as the spunky Maddy, Matt Bush contributes an engaging turn as the amiable Barry, David Koechner jerks it up nicely as smarmy amusement park owner Chet, Chris Zylka likewise hits it out of the slimy ballpark as hunky, but sleazy and corrupt deputy Kyle, Katrina Bowden brings a cute charm to her part as sweet virgin Shelby, Christopher Lloyd ravenously devours the scenery as flaky fish expert Mr. Goodman, and Ving Rhames has several sidesplitting moments struggling to surmount his hydrophobia as the scared and crippled Deputy Fallon. Best of all, the Almighty Hoffmeister sends up his pumped-up pompous ""Baywatch"" persona something rotten as his own supremely cool and self-deprecating self. Gary Busey and Clu Gulager both get munched early in the action. The outtakes during the end credits are simply priceless. Alexandre Lehmann's slick cinematography provides a pleasing polished look and makes hilariously cheesy use of strenuous slow motion. Elia Cmiral's dynamic score does the rousing dramatic trick. A real schlocky hoot.",Piranha 3DD
9,paul_haakonsen,Surely this was meant as a joke?,3,3 June 2012,"Oh dear, this was bad! The 2010 remake of the old ""Piranha"" movie was bad, but this sequel to that 2010 remake, are you kidding me? Where to begin?Well let's start with piranha trashing a wooden pier to get to the people on top of it? So fish are able to selectively single out prey and take down the barriers they are on? Or what about piranha jumping out of the water and onto the shore in order to get to their prey? Piranha starting to walk on land? Piranha jumping up and in one bite decapitate a grown man, then later on do the same to a boy? Or a piranha swimming up inside a woman through her private parts and living inside her womb?Or what about the total rip off scenes from the 2010 version? A piranha biting off a man's private parts? Or having a formerly well-known actor (Garey Busey) have a cameo role in the beginning of the movie only to die within minutes? Can you say 'this also happened in part one?' Or a sheriff (Ving Rhames) having lost both his legs in the first movie and now back with two steel legs, one of which is also a shotgun. Or how about David Hasselhoff playing himself and making an ass of his previous roles and personality? This movie was so lame, words don't even begin to describe it.So why watch it? Well, simply because it is such a cheesy spoof on itself and the 2010 version. It was hard to take this movie serious at all. The storyline is downright insulting to your intelligence, but still it is worth watching because it is so predictable, so cheesy and so stupid. And it is worth to watch because of the blood and gore, and because you will be laughing at the absurdity of the entire movie.The entire movie seems like to be directed by a horny teenager for an audience of horny teenagers. There is an excessive amount of nudity, sexual situations and women in little or no clothing at all. So you should take that into consideration before watching the movie, if you are easily offended by such material or situations. And why did a decapitated head have to land right between a woman's enormous breasts? That was so stupid on so many levels.Having seen the 2010 remake and not overly impressed with it, then it was with some hesitation that I sat down to watch this 2012 sequel. Why? Well because I had the movie at hand and had the time to spare. Having seen it now, I can say that they managed to make the piranha story worse than it already was.It was hard to find the bright moments in this movie. But I suppose if you are a teenage boy, this might be right up your alley. Senseless entertainment with blood and a lack of coherent storyline.",Piranha 3DD
10,BandSAboutMovies,Blah!,3,19 December 2018,"After the events of the last Piranha film, where Lake Victoria was attacked by prehistoric killer fish that were continuing to evolve, the lake has drained and the town itself has been abandoned. But what if there were a new waterpark that could drum up tourism? That'd be cool, right?
At another lake, two farmers (Gary Busey and Clu Gulager!) find a dead cow that's filled with piranha eggs, which hatch and kill them. Obviously, the piranha are not as eradicated as we've been led to believe. Which I guess is good, as otherwise, we wouldn't have this movie, directed by Feast's John Gulager (who is Clu's son).That's when we meet marine biology student Maddy (Danielle Panabaker, Killer Frost from the DCU shows) who is home for the summer and at the waterpark that she co-owns with her stepfather Chet (David Koechner). That's when she learns that he's about to re-open the park as Big Wet, complete with strippers and a grand opening featuring David Hasselhoff.Of course, all oceanic hell is unleashed all over again. Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames) returns from the last film, missing his legs and being helped by former cameraman and current therapist Andrew Cunningham (Paul Scheer), who is trying to get him back into the water. Luckily, his titanium legs have been outfitted with a shotgun with endless ammo, which will help.There's also a scene where a piranha swims into a woman's nether regions and bites off the member of the man who is attempting to deflower her. Keep in mind that she has had the fish inside her for several hours and that will tell you all you need to know about this film and whether or not you should watch it. There's also a scene where the decapitated head of a man motorboats the bloody breasts of a woman, so just know what you are getting into.Christopher Lloyd returns as Carl Goodman, continually explaining how the fish continue to evolve and the connection between the park and the underground river where the piranha make their home. Interestingly enough, the sound of the piranha was not accomplished in this film in the way that Joe Dante did it - recording a dental drill with an underwater mic. Nope. In this film, they're the sound of a chihuahua barking. Trust me, I have a five pound one of these dogs and it may be the most frightening sound you can be awoken by in the middle of the night.Guess how they kill the fish? Yep. They blow them up real good. Then one of them learns how to walk and kills a small child, with the film ending with people taking selfies of the dead kid.If you're looking for a movie that'll get you through the afternoon and perhaps make you laugh, I guess this will fit the bill if you've already seen all of the other Piranha films.",Piranha 3DD
11,Coventry,"Quote The Hoff: ""Welcome to rock-bottom""",3,21 October 2014,"When I saw the cool, gruesome and refreshing monster-movie ""Feast"" for the first time back in 2005, I immediately thought that this unknown director John Gulager could perhaps be a talented addition to my precious and favorite horror genre that so desperately needed new blood. When I then watched the two inferior sequels my enthusiasm got tempered quite a bit already, and after seeing ""Piranha 3DD"" I'm entirely convinced that he's just another stereotypical dumb and low-keyed director who abuses the genre in order to serve idiotic plots, horrible computerized gore effects and infantile gratuitous nudity ""Piranha 3DD"" features everything that gives horror – as well as sequels in general – a bad reputation. It is clearly put together too hastily, meaning that the production got green-lighted before there even was a plot in order to cash in on the success of Alexandre Aja original/remake, and strictly aimed at audiences who presume that horror is all about big-breasted bikini girls and ridiculously oversized creatures designed with computer programs. My God, I just feel so old and whiny when I'm writing this down Obviously I wasn't expecting this movie to become the next ""Psycho"" or ""Rosemary's Baby"", but I guess I really was hoping for a tad bit more creativity, charm and respect for the source material. The creature-features from the 1970's were also far from perfect (like ""Grizzly, ""Squirm"" or even Joe Dante's original ""Piranha"") but at least they were filmed with a lot of dedication and inventiveness. Yep, here I am sounding old and whiny again What keeps surprising me about these nowadays horror flicks is how the director manages to convince terrific actors to lose their dignity! Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames stepped out of Aja's original with a relatively unharmed reputation, but here they simply ridicule themselves. And Gary Busey apparently needed some extra money as well. The same can't be said for David Hasselhoff, as he somehow succeeds in fitting this dud of a film right into his already downwards spiral career. He actually spoofs himself successfully by appearing as washed up TV hero typecast as the Baywatch lifeguard and mumbling things that are so true; like ""Welcome to rock-bottom"". Anyways, in case you give a damn: one year after the bloodbath in Lake Victoria, the sleazy businessman Chet counts down the days to open his luxurious and flamboyant water theme park with a very peculiar (and not at all sexist) gimmick, namely double-d swims for free! He has even foreseen topless adult pools and installed underwater cameras, much to the frustration of his righteous stepdaughter Maddy (who only has a B- cup). But naturally Chet is a corrupt scumbag and his illegal installations pump up the water from underground Arizonan lakes. Those lakes are infested with prehistoric piranhas, a little detail that Chet and his corrupt buddies actually should know considering the Lake Victoria incident, and a couple of mere hours after the grand opening the hideous razor-teethed fish are munching themselves a way through silicone breasts. The highlights of ""Piranha 3DD"" include a fairly atmospheric opening with images of the forsaken Lake Victoria and an awkwardly uncomfortable moment involving a fish preventing a young couple from losing their virginity in a romantic way. The gore is stupidly over-the-top and the piranhas don't come across as menacing whatsoever. If you ask me this is pathetic nonsense, but hey, I'm old and whiny",Piranha 3DD
12,bevo-13678,This one has David Hasselhoff in it,10,2 April 2020,Yet another killer piranha film. I'm happy to give it a 10 but why do most people give it a much lower rating?,Piranha 3DD
13,hitchcockthelegend,The joke is firmly on us.,1,20 May 2014,"I myself like a lot of cinematic offerings that require the brain to be left at the door. There's something very calming about being able to sit back and drive oneself into a movie with absolutely no worries about themes, agendas, politico posturing and etc. What shouldn't be tolerated is when film makers ask you to not only leave your brain at the door, but to also dribble with it and slam dunk it into the nearest garbage can.Alexandre Aja's 2010 redux of Piranha was a whole bunch of fun, even away from the 3D, in 2D form it had a devilish glint in its eye, but this on the other hand is an embarrassment to all involved. Who doesn't love the female form? Whatever your sexual proclivities et al, you would have to be dead to not appreciate the splendour of Eve's offspring. But when it's your main selling point, when you are only trying to please a very small movie watching demographic, then you got problems.John Gulager (director in the broadest context of the word) wants to craft a Porky's for this latest hairy palmed generation, whilst he even thinks a touch of Grindhouse might curry favour with the mall rats and skaters. Everything about this picture stinks, the acting, the hopeless attempts at suspense, badly timed jokes, poor stereotyping, laughable effects work, and on it goes. Standing up and saying it's meant to be tacky, corny and tongue in cheek just doesn't cut the mustard here, bad film making is just that, especially when it's done purely to make money.Right, I'm off to dive into a tank full of piranha fish, because that will surely be better than having to ever sit through this movie again. 1/10",Piranha 3DD
14,Theo Robertson,Is This A Propaganda Film By The Taliban ?,4,2 December 2012,"I'd nearly written this review before I'd even seen it . Something along the lines of "" I really hate 3-D BLAH BLAH BLAH . The narrative drive is held up by self congratulatory mis-en-scene BLAH BLAH BLAH . The camera angles are of an unnatural nature BLAH BLAH BLAH "" and my fears were confirmed by the opening pre-title sequence as we're shown long lingering shots that merely exist to show the audience this is a film in 3-D but after this I saw something totally unexpected - a film so bad it made me forget I was watching something with a gimmick and made me think I was watching something produced by either Mad Mullah Omar or Fred Phelps From the outset we're watching a film that has an entirely ethnocentric world view of America . People of the United states are very young , impossibly good looking and incredibly stupid . The only people who aren't are very old , very ugly and very stupid and everyone has a sex drive higher than Mount Everest . This is acceptable if you're good looking and female and totally disgusting if you're notWe're introduced to heroine Maddy and villain Chet her stepfather . We know Maddy is the heroine because her breasts can't be bigger than 34B and are natural unlike 99% of the women featured . One wonders how the other women can swim since their obviously enhanced boobs make it aerodynamically impossible . We know instantly Chet is the villain because he own's 51% of the water-park to Maddy's 49%. That and the fact Chet comes across as so creepy you just want to look him up on the Megan's Law website And that's the thing about PIRANHA 3-DD . The humour relies on innuendo but it's not the type of naughty but nice innuendo you see in the likes of THE BENNY HILL SHOW but this lazy near the knuckle humour along the lines of "" Are you still wet "" that wasn't funny to begin with and continues for most of the film , so much so you find yourself very tempted to switch off What saves the film from being a total disaster is that the final third works very well when we're introduced to David Hasselhoff playing ..... David Hssselhoffa sort of hetrosexual Liberace . The set-piece of the piranha attacking the swimmers at the water-park are very entertaining in a tasteless way . One thing I remember about the Joe Dante original is the lack of internal logic where people wade through the water for no other reason than to be eaten . This is referenced by a woman asking for the Hoff to help and his replying that "" They've only got themselves to blame by staying in the water . What'd expect the fish to do ? Follow them home "" which had me laughing out-loud while wondering why this type of post modernist wit wasn't employed earlier ? In short this is a very uneven film . It's trash as so many people have said but some of it is slightly witty , or rather slightly witty in comparison with much of the other humour employed . Being a 3-D movie many scenes merely exist to show the audience that it's a 3-D movie whilst some scenes exist merely to show that America has a monopoly on bikini babes with silicon breasts. Most teenage boys will enjoy it while Jihadists will think it's a gritty documentary about infidels in small town America",Piranha 3DD
15,Hey_Sweden,"I am the fish hunter, you are my prey!",6,6 October 2014,"Well...you get what you expect with this sequel to the remake of ""Piranha"", given that the creative forces behind this also came up with the ""Feast"" series and some of the ""Saw"" sequels. Overall, this film is highly immature, always aiming low and gleefully ignoring anything resembling good taste. But if this kind of thing floats your boat, it *does* generate some hearty chuckles, with its plethora of fishy predators, and in your face visual effects and gore. It establishes a comical, cheesy and sleazy tone almost immediately, with a scene involving Gary Busey (who's seen much too briefly).The story, such as it is, sees the aquatic menaces arriving at a water park in Arizona, thanks to the meddling of cheerfully scuzzy operator Chet (David Koechner). His conscientious stepdaughter Maddy (the adorable Danielle Panabaker) realizes that they have a serious problem, but of course *he's* not going to believe her until it's too late.Led by director John Gulager, the makers of ""Piranha 3DD"" do have fun with their various cameo appearances. In addition to Busey, we have Christopher Lloyd and an uncredited Ving Rhames rehashing their roles from Alexandre Ajas' film, director Gulagers' actor father Clu, and David Hasselhoff, who has fun playing a jerky version of himself. There's lots of very sexy gals and guys, and a rather overbearing soundtrack. Some of the gags are *incredibly* crude, such as those involving the lovely Katrina Bowden, Jean-Luc Bilodeau as Josh, and Adrian Martinez, playing the aptly named Big Dave. The splatter is very much over the top. The movie proper is capped off by some VERY protracted end credits that feature a number of outtakes.Undoubtedly, this will be MUCH too stupid for some tastes, but others will likely be delighted.Six out of 10.",Piranha 3DD
16,poolandrews,"Only for those with an acquired taste, I thought it was great though.",6,10 June 2012,"Piranha 3DD is set a year after the horrible events at lake Victoria where a once believed extinct species of Piranha ate lots of people, money grabbing businessman Chet (David Koechner) runs the Big Wet water-park with his stepdaughter Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) who both have differing opinions on how the park should be run. Meanwhile in an underground lake nearby yet more ferocious Piranha hatch & make their way in the local water system killing & eating anyone that wanders into the water. With the grand summer opening of Big Wet the park is going to be packed full of people looking to have a good time but the killer Piranha manage to feast on them after being sucked into the park through water pipes. The Piranha seem unstoppable as they tear their victims apart...Directed by John Gulager, the son of veteran actor Clu Gulager who has a small role in this, I am sure the average person on the street will probably hate Piranha 3DD with it's stupidity, moronic character's, over the top gore, in jokes, film references & downright silliness but I have to say I really liked it & I am 100% serious when I make that statement. Every one of the 80 odd minutes that Pirahna 3DD lasts for is either gory, funny or downright stupid & there's never a dull moment if nothing else. It takes a special kind of person to appreciate a film like Piranha 3DD, I am that kind of person as I found the constant in jokes & references absolutely hilarious, seriously I just found this so funny & during the moments that were supposed to be funny as well. Any scene with David Hasselhoff is just brilliant, he makes fun of himself & his public image seemingly in good humour from a hotel room encounter with two gorgeous twenty something girls to his droll reaction to the carnage at the water-park as he states the obvious when he says 'once these moron's get out of the water the fish are hardly likely to follow them home' to a really funny send up of the Baywatch opening credits just after the closing credits here as a curious little bonus. In fact the film itself lasts for a mere 70 minutes yet the end credits last for 12 minutes with lots of outtakes including what looks like a couple of deleted scenes (the female life guard being strangled on her own whistle cord) & messing around by the cast & crew. The whole film is just so much fun to watch, from the first moments with the farting cow corpse to the scene in which Josh runs around with a Piranha clamped to the end of his penis before castrating himself to the young kid who gets his head bitten off at the very end. The more I think about Piranha 3DD the more I like it. There's plenty of gore although maybe not quite as much as the first & there's plenty of flesh on show with nude swimming pools & lots of horny teens wanting sex. Call me easily pleased but I laughed at the right places, I got just about all the in jokes & film references & enjoyed the film as a whole too as it has a reasonable if not exactly brilliant story, in fact the story is basically the same as the original Piranha (2010) but set in a water-park rather than a big lake & it's considerably more funny.The special effects are alright, the CGI Piranha look okay but not much else & I can't believe they roar like Lions. Whose decision was that exactly? It's the aspect of Piranha 3DD that I thought ended up really lame. There's some gore here, there's plenty of blood & chewed up bodies, there's another severed penis as in the original & to go with all the blood there's lots of nudity on show. Blood & boobs, what more do you want? There's nothing particularly scary here, there's not much build-up of tension & you can guess what's going to happen but it's still great fun. There are lots of bad taste humour & tastelessness going on, a guy with a flapping Piranha stuck up his bum & the priceless line of dialogue where a woman says 'Josh cut of his penis because something came out of my vagina' which is surely one of the greatest lines ever spoken in a motion picture. Enough said. No-involved in the making of Piranha 3DD is taking it seriously so I suggest that anyone watching it doesn't either & just take it for what it is.The IMDb says that Piranha 3DD had a budget of about $20,000,000 which it total rubbish, try about half that. Since I am blind in one eye I cannot watch films in 3D so I have no idea how effective it is here. Filmed in Wilmington in North Carolina. The cameos from Christopher Lloyd & Ving Rhames reprising their roles from the original are also pretty funny, especially Rhames & his gun legs which he borough by saving money from 'not buying any socks'! Gary Busey also has a small cameo at the start. The rest of the cast are OK, they were obviously chosen for their looks rather than their acting skills.Piranha 3DD is a film that the majority of people will hate & despise, of that I have no doubt but for those of us who it was actually made for will probably love it. Sure, it constantly tries to appeal to the lowest common denominator with it's nudity, gore, nastiness & outright silly send-ups & gags but there's no harm in that. Is there?",Piranha 3DD
17,grantss,Incredibly bad,1,10 May 2020,"Piranha had its moments but was pretty average, as far as creature-horror movies go. Piranha 3DD is worse.

18,Boba_Fett1138,Double the fun? I don't think so!,3,3 June 2012,"At least he creators of the first movie knew what they were doing. The makers of this film absolutely had no idea how to turn this into a good and fun genre movie to watch.It should tell you enough already that main cast and crew members of the first movie are no part of this film. I like to believe that they were smart enough to stay away as far as possible from this obvious inferior sequel.From a sequel to a movie like ""Piranha"", you would expect them to go even more overboard with things, this time around. But instead of more gore, more nudity and more fun, there is less of everything. Especially the fact that there isn't really any good gore present is very disappointing. And the gore that is present in the movie is just far too fake looking for my liking. It prefers to use computer effects over practical effects, which was a really poor pick, in my opinion.But what makes the movie just bad to watch is the fact that the story is all over the place. It doesn't really follow a good a clear main plot line and none of the characters is fun or even likable enough to care for.This movie really has some bad and lazy writing in it. This shouldn't always be a problem for a movie of this sort though. I mean, the first ""Piranha"" movie sure had lots of big plot holes in it as well but the fun of the whole movie compensated a lot. It actually was a part of what made the movie so fun to watch. It made it a spoof of the genre, by making fun of all the clichés and weaknesses, including lots of nonsensical stuff and big plot holes. So really, deliberate bad written can be fun but I feel that in this case it wasn't deliberate at all. It's just incompetence and that's also what makes it bad and annoying to follow all.When the end comes, you suddenly also start to realize that everything that happened before really didn't mattered and totally wasn't being relevant for the movie at all. You could say that the movie only builds up to its last 30 minutes or so, which isn't even being a good movie finale. It was supposed to be one big bloodbath and orgy or gore but let me tell you that compared to the first movie, this one felt like a kids film.Really, it all could had been saved with some good humor but that is also incredibly lacking in this movie as well. They had no idea how to make things fun and even when the movie is going over-the-top, it just isn't being all that funny to watch.It's just incredibly bad all and not in a good or fun way at all.

19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Disappointing, a no-effort sequel to ride the coattails",1,14 June 2012,"A waterpark that lives up to its immensely tacky owner is having its grand opening in a few days, but his fairly virginal step-daughter is worried that piranhas will attack. She goes with the two other members of the love triangle - the guy we definitely want her to not hook up with, and the one who hasn't had her yet - to find Mr. Goodman(Christopher Lloyd, in a slightly expanded role, still delivering exposition), to learn how they got from... wherever it was that the original took place to Arizona. That's the excuse for a plot, and yes, several of its threads, all of the characterization(who needs people in a movie for the audience to care about, even on a base level?), and the half of the conflict that doesn't involve man-eating fish... all revolve around sex. How slutty or sleazy(depending on the gender) is someone, will these two get it on, etc. And yes, this does have plenty of graphic nudity(the full female body is seen, from several angles) and hot chicks, although that is indeed the only area where it delivers. This is absent the violence and gore(largely... and what there is, is forgettable and not worth mentioning, like this as a whole) of the remake, not to mention all the directorial skill, suspense and tension. In place of build-up, we have padding inbetween ill-executed attacks(I have to wonder if they just left the editing up to an intern, one sequence is particularly terribly assembled). Well, there is set-up to eventual half-hearted payoff, even if a couple of these directly contradict one another(either the script was written by several people who had no contact with each other, or one guy with a debilitating case of ADHD). I think it tries to be scary at points, but it fails completely. Instead, it goes for comedy, which it does about as poorly at. In the 75 minute running time(not counting the credits), there are two or three jokes that actually work, all involving either Ving Rhames(inexplicably back) or David Hasselhoff(playing himself, making fun of his fame-loving, fan-adoring has-been status). The rest are too dumb, nonsensical or uninspired. I've been told that this reuses animations from the 2010 one... while I can't say for sure(it wouldn't surprise me though, this whole flick is one ""long"" attempt to cash in on its success), I can verify that the creatures seldom look like they're interacting with the live-action elements... it's a remarkably bad job of integrating the two. They'll swim around their victims and bite at the viewer far more than at them. I recommend this only to those who want more of the T&A that make up the only noteworthy use of 3D in this. 1/10",Piranha 3DD
20,neil-476,Three cheers for the Hoff!,7,18 May 2012,"Piranha 3DD starts with a short recap of the disastrous happenings of Piranha 3D before plunging us into the toothsome little devils' latest escapade - mayhem in a water park. There is some backstory, but it really doesn't matter - all that matters are the sporadic chompings of individuals leading up to the wholesale slaughter which comprises the final section.For those who saw the first movie, there is little to surprise them here - a moderate amount of nudity, a huge amount of gore, a cast of unknowns, and a scattering of cameos (Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames made return visits). There is an attempt to recapture the gleeful sleazy trashiness of its predecessor, although I felt it tried a bit too hard, and lost some of the innocent sense of fun to be had among the severed penis sequences (and, yes, I am quite aware of how ludicrous that sentence sounds).Making up for everything, though, is a wonderfully funny and self-deprecating performance from David Hasselhoff - the Hoff lampoons his own perceived pomposity mercilessly and with pinpoint accuracy. There are some highly entertaining outtakes scattered through the closing credits.",Piranha 3DD
21,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Immensely, utterly enjoyable sequel effort",10,10 August 2015,"Escaping into a nearby drainage lake, the prehistoric fish make their way into a local water park during it's opening weekend forcing the staff of the facility to save the guests and stop the ravenous creatures before it's too late.Overall this was an immensely and utterly enjoyable sequel that has a lot more going for it. Among the biggest positives here is the fact that this one makes for a rather enjoyable time here in detailing the cause away from the location of the first one into a more outrageous setting being quite natural and believable as there's a nice connection here following up the effects of the first one by again using the logical manner of the underground tunnels to explain everything. That of course follows up the even greater fun here of this one's seemingly glorious cheesy nature on display as there's so much fun here during the main attack of the park that it's an immensely enjoyable sequence all on it's own as the action-packed encounters are so fun and bloody that there's a lot to like on that principle alone. The viciousness of the swarm ripping into bodies and generally taking advantage of the different confines around a water-park to make for a rather exciting time throughout here unleashing plenty of action, solid gore and kills here from the savage bites and dismemberments while also giving this the kind of demented atmosphere and fun found in numerous other works here with this one really taking solid advantage of the creatures to pile on some rather goofy, fun scenarios of the creatures appearing where they really shouldn't be. AS well, the fact that this one can certainly play it straight and keep things running along nicely with some suspenseful scenes at times is a great ploy at counteracting the cheesy nature of the rest of the film where it keeps things focused on the seriousness of the creatures by featuring such great early scenes as the attack on the couple in the van as the water rapidly begins filling the van while they try to get out to safety, a later scene where they attack the friends on the wooden dock by launching themselves through the planks knocking them into the water or the fantastic night-time attack in the lake that's really eerie and chilling for the setting and the knowledge of their attacks previously. By combining all this with the fantastically cheesy sexualized attacks on the couple that are quite shocking and disturbing, the rampant well-delivered nudity and feverish gore, there's enough here to make this one wholly enjoyable enough to hold off the minor flaws present. The biggest issue here is the fact that this one tends to go for a lot more of a clichéd feeling overall here by running through the same notions as the original only it tends to feel even less impactful because of simply running along the same lines. There's a lot of similar ground covered here that came from the original, and it tends to be quite noticeable. As well, the fact that this one was filmed for 3D means that a lot of gore gags and shots look absolutely atrocious and noticeable when seen elsewhere and if that's not the format being shown in it looks awkward and clunky quite often throughout here. Otherwise, this one tended to be quite exciting and enjoyable.Rated R: Extreme Graphic and occasional sexualized Violence, Graphic Language, Full Nudity and sexual content.",Piranha 3DD

Now perhaps in hindsight the fact that I could rent it off Amazon the same day as it hit the theaters was enough cause for alarm. Perhaps I was blinded by my love for the first film, but everything about this film reeked badly. Terrible all the way around. Furthermore, most of the writers as well as the director were responsible for the ""Feast"" films, now despite what you may think of those movies (I for one was entertained by them) they never played it safe.

24,Wuchakk,Amusing creature feature,5,9 November 2016,"Released in 2012 and directed by John Gulager, ""Piranha 3DD"" is the sequel to 2010's ""Piranha 3D"" and is pretty much more of the same, although I like it better. This time the action switches to a waterpark co-owned by cutie Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) in which the highly aggressive prehistoric piranhas invade via sewage pipes, attracted by chemicals involved in swimming pool cleansers that match their spawning routes. Christopher Lloyd returns as the marine expert who officials write off while David Hasselhoff appears as himself, a has-been celebrity making an appearance at the waterpark. The original 1978 film was a great semi-serious/parody of Jaws-like flicks, but neither of the two recent Piranha flicks have been able to rise to its level. But at least this one is a little better than the somewhat disappointing 2010 movie. While it goes overboard with crudeness (you'll know what I mean) it is genuinely amusing and I found myself busting out laughing on several occasions, especially the last scene before the credits where little Johnny (or whatever his name is) makes the mistake of getting too close to a supposedly dying piranha. The Hasselhoff subplot is hilarious. The movie's entertaining but, at the end of the day, ""Piranha 3DD"" is what it is: a throwaway horror comedy. The movie runs 83 minutes and was shot in North Carolina with opening shots of Lake Victoria filmed at Salton Sea, California.GRADE: C",Piranha 3DD
25,trashgang,you ginger little moron,7,4 February 2013,"Okay, so many negative words about this Piranha entry. Still not available in a lot of countries did mean also a thing. Bad distribution so a bad film. I have seen it in 3D HD and I must say that I am I guess the only one who enjoyed it. But there are a few reasons why I liked it. First of all this flick doesn't take itself seriously and that's a good start. Secondly the name John Gulager, the director, did ring a bell, famous for his directing of the Feast trilogy. And have a look at Feast you know that that is full of bad jokes and black comedy, let that be exactly what we do have here.For example the way 'The Hoff' is presented. A lot of people hated his acting here but just have a close look, he's laughing with his own acting and his past, the kid don't remember any title The Hoff is saying he played in, back to earth with that, and then as he's running like in baywatch. How funny was that and he said it himself when he stops running. Further this flick is some kind of remake of Piranha 3D (2010). Of course people will compare the two with the use of nudity but face it, the penis being bitten off in the 2010 version was laughable too. Here we do have the same but in stead of naked girls swimming in the water we do see a lot of 3D D-cups in close up running around, covered in bikini or topless. And the nudity is as gratuitous as it can be, girls coming out of the water naked full frontal, ladyshaved. Naturally the penis scene had to be done again but again in Feast-style and if you just can't take it or find it ridiculous then you can't dig black comedy. Look how the virgin asks to be f*cked and how she reacts. It's full of subtile jokes. Sure, the story is written in one sentence, Piranha attack a swimming pool. But I laughed it out a few times and of course searched for the old actors to be seen, Gary Busey, Clu Gulager, Christopher Lloyd...On part of the 3D it do have a few amazing scene's. The key for example in the water really did pop up almost just before my face, just if I could grap it. Some piranhas also are jumping out of your screen. I can understand that geeks hate it, there isn't that much of horror in it or even gore. It's all about naked girls and blood, be honest, this is the only reason why you watch this. Guess if you show this at a party that it will succeed in delivering a few laughs and cheers while the girls will walk out of the room and saying, so childish...and that's exactly what it is.

26,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Piranha 3DD,4,16 June 2012,"Director John Gulager did a great job with Feast, and went on to do two more sequels which had gone direct to video. Roped in to continue where Alejandro Aja had left off with Piranha 3D, we return to Lake Victoria to witness the aftermath of the events from the first film, with suggestion now that the prehistoric man eating fishes have now gone exploring more of its waterways, and finally finding opportunity to chomp on more fresh meat available in The Big Wet, a wet and wild theme park complete with a sectioned off area for adults only. Yes, you saw that coming, didn't you?Written by Joel Soisson to work on what Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan of various Saw and Feast films had already written, I'm pretty sure the signs on how well this sequel will fare in the story department would be telling from the filmography that Soisson had worked on. Don't expect much to come out of Piranha 3DD other than to rehash the same violent mess of the first film, only this time it seemed that Gulager may have opted for this to be a wee bit friendlier from a gore standpoint, reserving much of the bloody mayhem for the final 20 minutes in what would be too little too late, complete with plenty of cheese in the entire buildup.The characters here are mostly new, revolving around Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) who had returned to her hometown for the summer holiday to find that her 49% share of her mother's water based theme park had been turned into a strippers on water joint by stepdad Chet (David Koechner), which of course gives rise to many opportunities for gratuitous nudity to grace the screen, from boob and ass shots, to full frontal if deemed necessary, complete with silicone on display. While the first film also had its fair share of such scenes, the ones here are purely exploitative and done for the sake of, even a sex scene (where nothing much happens) provides for a ludicrous development that threatened to be somewhat like Aliens, only played out much differently for a mix of meek laughs, and for a terribly lame one-liner to be uttered.While the first film had a comical element associated with it, this follow up paled in comparison no thanks to many unbelievable one liners that don't hit their mark, and I wonder how anyone can deliver them with a straight face. That, and plagued with a story that is pretty much non-existent, peppered with more caricatures that are in it to become fodder one way or another, lending to the death count prioritized as dictated by the usual horror film rules. The saving grace came from the supporting cast who returned for yet another outing, such as Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd, but the one who stole everyone's thunder when he first came on for the final half hour, is David Hasselhoff, playing a satirical version of his star status, with that Baywatch body now blessed with man boobs, and hamming it up to be so full of himself, it's painfully funny.It's a pity then for this 3D movie, which being shot in 3D, had plenty of gimmicky designed shots to enhance the in-your-face experience. There's nothing much to the story except to link up scenes for the Piranhas to feed on unsuspecting bodies, usually in different states of undress. Naturally that in itself may be a draw for some sections of the movie going crowd. Stay tuned during the end credits for a lot more extra scenes not seen in the film proper. Strictly for B-movie fans who find delight at man eating fish going on a feeding frenzy, and for fans of David Hasselhoff.",Piranha 3DD
27,StevePulaski,Exhaustingly incompetent and ferociously indulgent,2,1 June 2012,"Piranha 3DD is the first 3D film, or ""3DD"" film in this case, to be released both theatrically and through video on demand. I wouldn't even call this 3D. All you get are creatures, breasts, blood, water, and vomit careening towards the camera amateurishly and in an unnecessary fashion. At least it's in bright colors and not dimmed with a ludicrous surcharge.The film is an affront to the genre of horror-comedy, shielded by the unacceptable and numbing phrase ""leave your brain at the door,"" and atrociously erected off of clichés, idiocy, and nude characters. The original Piranha 3D was a surprising summer success, and to be fair, it wasn't horrifically awful. The actors in it knew they were in a goofy, outrageous B-movie ode, and some sequences were well arranged. The problem? The CGI, which killed many of the death scenes, making them look implausible and unrealistic, virtually killed the mood and the idea that this was a low budget, cheesy horror flick.And now, the marginally passable horror flick has a sequel leaching off of it, that pushes the envelope of parody so far that it becomes dreadfully incompetent. It is so indulgent, always trying to be so witty and cute with its puns, references, and spoof-elements that the stench of desperation quickly fogs the screen.Instead of a beach, this time, we are taken to a water-park, ran by the royally perverted and careless step-dad of our main character (Koecher). He is so pre-occupied with prepubescent fantasies that he ignores everyone around him completely. His daughter Maddy (Panabaker), co-owner of the water-park and aspiring marine biologist, is concerned that with the rumor of piranhas swimming through sewers and drain pipes that they may be a hazard to the park. Her step-dad doesn't listen, and it isn't before long that he gets his comeuppance.The remainder of the picture is a mindless shows for the kiddies, containing more breasts than anything I've seen this whole year, sometimes even two or more pairs per frame. The film is so juvenile, crass, and filthy-minded, and the characters so impotent, one-note, and poor that one can not help either drifting away while watching or just simply not caring.There is a degrading, nasty scene in the film I'd like to discuss. It involves a piranha festering around the part of a woman that goes without saying, before it leapfrogs and jumps out onto that part of a man that goes without saying, before he has to cut the whole thing off with scissors. The scene is nothing short of unnecessary and borderline reprehensible.One thing that Piranha 3D had was the star-power its sequel woefully lacks. It had the appearances of great actors like Elizabeth Shue, Jerry O'Connell, Ving Rhames, and Christopher Lloyd, showing despite their well deserved success, could still pull off a campy exercise relatively well. Lloyd makes a cameo in a scene far too short, Rhames does too and earns the only laughs the picture sees, and David Hasselhoff, portraying himself as a lifeguard, shows us why he has fallen off the face of the mainstream world in the first place.Now, maybe I'm being too brazen and unfair. Piranha 3DD is a fairly harmless piece of work, but not a good one at that. Its structure of scantily clad women, many full-frontally nude, phoned-in characters, too little, too late cameos, third rate special effects, and cheap, nonexistent suspense wears so thin so quickly it becomes appalling. I have no problem with horror, even when it creates a hybrid with the neighboring genre of comedy, but this is a work of hybrid indulgence and overkill.NOTE: The film ends the same way Piranha 3D ended, with an abrupt, unsuspecting scene that provides us with one last quick jump and conveniently leaves the franchise open for another sequel. Though with the very secluded release of this sequel, I wouldn't put all my money on ""3DDD"" so quickly.Starring: Danielle Panabaker, Matt Bush, David Koechner, Chris Zylka, Katrina Bowden, Gary Busey, Christopher Lloyd, and David Hasselhoff.

28,KineticSeoul,Basically a rehash without the effort,4,10 August 2012,"The first ""Piranha 3D"" was a bad movie but it didn't take itself seriously and was bad to the point it was alright. Now this follows the same formula as the previous one with nudity and gore except more of it. Well it has more nudity but that doesn't make it a better movie. The thing is though it just loses shock factor and the death scene aren't crazy as the one that came before. The first one had a crappy story as well and the actors didn't take it seriously but it seemed like it at least had some effort put into it. But this one just seemed like a quick cash in, with nothing that stands out. It just seemed like a rehash of the first one with the same or similar grotesque scenes. That has hardly anything different, except the Piranha is bigger this time around and the setting takes place at a water park with lots of naked girls. The humor in this one is slightly more messed up though that sometimes works. Overall if you feel like killing time it might be alright to see this, won't be seeing it again that is for sure.4/10",Piranha 3DD
29,Hellmant,Doesn't have nearly as much bite as the three films it follows.,5,21 August 2012,"'PIRANHA 3DD': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) John Gulager (director of all three 'FEAST' films) directs this sequel to the hit 2010 remake 'PIRANHA 3D'. The original 1978 film was a horror/comedy (like it's remakes) and was directed by Joe Dante (It's sequel 'PIRANHA II: THE SPAWNING' was directed by none other than James Cameron). Both the original films were clever horror spoofs, the original remake (directed by Alexandre Aja) was as well. This sequel doesn't have nearly as much bite as the three films it follows despite the talent of Gulager. There are some decent gore scenes and a few good laughs but for the most part it falls a little flat.The film takes place a year after the events of the original remake and focuses on a water park re-opening in Lake Victoria under the management of Chet (David Koechner), who's adding an adult themed section to the park featuring strippers. This infuriates Chet's step-daughter Maddy (Dannielle Panabaker), a marine biology student who's returned home for the summer and co-owns the park. While trying to keep the water park legit Maddy runs in to a bunch of her old friends including Barry (Matt Bush), who's had a crush on her since grade school. At the same time two farmers (Gary Busey and Clu Galager) awake the swarm of prehistoric piranha, who have been nesting in a dead cow in a nearby lake. David Hasselhoff also shows up as a celebrity lifeguard at the park's grand re-opening.The film was written by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan (the team that wrote all three 'FEAST' films as well as the last four 'SAW' films) as well as another experienced B horror film writer and producer Joel Soisson. It has all the ingredients of a clever and entertaining slasher spoof (like the others) but doesn't come together quite right. It's not a bad film just not a very good one either. It's not nearly as fun as the 'FEAST' films or the other 'SAW' films but it does have Gulager's style and feel to it. There is plenty of monster movie mayhem and gore and a lot of nudity and sex as well for B movie fans. The laughs are few and far between but at times the film does deliver. Not a bad way to waste your time but it doesn't live up to the other films.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZarl-ByqEc",Piranha 3DD

And in a few unique ways.In addition, they were giving the audience – way in abundance – what they were expecting: a ton of water, a reasonable amount of pretty girls and, of course, countless breasts and more.Well, that was all the way to about the 20th minute of 83. From there, sadly, it went straight down the drain and in a hurry with countless missed opportunities.One MTV-Girl/semi-owner of a water park near the original's movie onslaught of prehistoric piranha attacks discovers that these creatures, for some odd reason, are attracted to chlorine in her swimming pools and all-but whimpers: ""Oh, I guess, shucks, something's gotta be done.""As with most WHEN ANIMALS ATTACK films of decades past, namely Jaws II, a new resort is just opening and they're gambling a tremendous amount of money to open an (in this case) adult theme water park in the shadow of the previous installment's (animal induced) terrorist attack. There's no difference here, in Piranha 3DD. Except, they left all the fun, originality and spark on the beach and not in the water.I know what you're thinking. This movie is ""silly fun."" A ""guilty pleasure"" in the making. A movie NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. Well, let me assure you: This is beyond the definition of Bmovie. This is beyond BAD.It's sad, as well. As stated, it did start off promising, but once someone was aware of the creatures, once a character had stomach pains because, well, she had one more egg in her than what she was born with, it didn't just get silly, it got incohesive. It got random. It became aimless, fell apart, felt rushed and had absolutely no clue where it wanted to land in the end. Hell, after the incredibly low body count compared to the first one, the end credits of space-filler outtakes wasn't even a grand finale of minimal success they were shooting for.Most surprisingly, despite the advertisements, it was actually doubling the negative D's in anything in regards to carnage or gore. Sure, it still had its moments, but probably contained a third or less of the bloody and gruesomeness of the first feature.And speaking of advertisements, I do have to note, and YEAH, I'm GOING TO SPOIL THIS – because I care so little of this feature, I'm glad they did trick me in the previews. The one scene in the trailer I couldn't buy was the girl taking the bath and a miniature piranha filtering out through the faucet. Well, mercifully, that was just a dream of the girl. I originally thought, that was damn silly, but then, so is the movie. Thankfully, as completely implausible as that is – in addition to everything else – they rightfully stated that could NOT happen, no matter the faux-pas rules they laid forth.Look, listen: I wanted to support this movie. I wanted to stand behind it and was ready to. I believe, while the first film was candid with its convictions of honesty of being a genuine Bmovie, this one was confused on where it wanted to stand and the lack of a well-balanced script was its downfall. During the last two-thirds, or the majority of the feature, it was all-over-the-place in absurdity and never remembered what made the original so brilliant. The danger was gone, the humor lost and even contained way too many slo-mo scenes for ""laughs"" which were neither funny or imaginative. Heck, even the girls (or guys) all looked like they were found on the street, not the eye candy these movies generate, as the first one got correct.IF ONLY the first third of this movie was a ""deleted scene"" on Piranha 3D's BluRay, we could have a nice closure and not waste any time during one of the worst final half's of any movie I've seen.Needless to say: SKIP THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE! There was a reason it was barely released in theatres this weekend: if it was a wide release, it would proved the (human) terrorists actually did win.",Piranha 3DD

32,Robert_duder,Huge step down from the original...all shock and forced camp,6,1 September 2012,"I loved the first Piranha! It was campy, schlocky, hilarious, gory, twisted and had an outstanding wild performance by Jerry O'Connell. So I was literally stoked to see a second go around. But they made some extremely bad mistakes going into this second one. First of all, the first film had the incredibly talented Alexander Aja behind the camera. The man is horror brilliance. This time they brought on John Gulager of Project Greenlight fame who only has the horror trilogy Feast under his belt. They cut the budget for this second one and they simply try way too hard to force a classic campy feel. It worked so well in the first one and it falls flat here. Its not a total write off, there are some truly great laughs...even if they are caused by being gratuitously violent or using blatant nudity to catch your attention. They do connect the film back to the first and even feature a couple of the original characters and I love that they did that for the fans. The build up to the actual piranha's wasn't nearly as intense as the first. It was as though they tried to force the humour and the horror together too quickly.Danielle Panabaker plays the lead in the film. I've always liked her a lot and she is the perfect scream queen for horror movies. She's smart and sweet and innocent, a Jamie Lee Curtis type scream queen. She holds her own in a sea of ridiculousness and piranhas. Matt Bush is her best friend and unrequited love interest. He is decent too and fun but he doesn't get enough screen time. David Koechner is okay as the perverted water park owner. He tries hard, maybe too hard, but I can't help but think he tries to re-create the amazingly campy and hilarious performance by Jerry O'Connell in the first and he doesn't hold a candle to that. David Hasselhoff plays himself in a campy self-deprecating performance that feels overdone and forced. It's always fun to watch a celebrity poke fun at himself but the Baywatch jokes were old ten years ago. Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames return from the first film in small cameos. Rhames is barely existent in the film but Lloyd is always fun especially in the expert type cameo role.I know that you can't just force a campy classic. It usually happens, I think, when a creative time is truly making something serious but it ends up being hilariously bad. I think they did manage to create a camp classic with the first one but the studio or producer left the sequel high and dry with a less than stellar budget and director. I did laugh a lot and there was some gapingly shocking moments that were outrageous. And of course there are plenty of the double D's mentioned in the title of the film. It isn't a classic but you can only expect so much given the concept and idea. 6/10",Piranha 3DD
33,bowmanblue,"Dumb, silly and almost quite good fun",6,14 January 2015,"I have to confess at actually really enjoying the first recent Piranha film. It was everything I expected - gratuitous, daft and plenty of blood flowing.Therefore, I was quite happy to sit down and watch the sequel, expecting more of the same. To be fair, I got it, however, it just didn't seem to have worked this time.What I got was a blatant Jaws clone - instead of a man trying to shut the beach because of a great white shark, you have a girl trying to shut a new fun pool because of the piranhas. I don't know whether this was some sort of 'homage' to the superior Jaws movie, or whether it was sloppy writing. Either way, it just didn't sit well with me.Yes, there is gore and plenty of women in bikinis, but it just didn't feel as fresh the second time round.David Hasselhoff is in it, happy to lampoon himself, which goes some way to squeeze in a few extra laughs in the second half.It's short too, just over an hour. You'd have thought they could have fitted better in, but, sadly, it was a bit of a let down.I don't regret watching Piranha DD. It kept me entertained, but, if you're looking for blood, carnage and bikinis - just stick to watching the first one. You won't miss anything by not seeing this.",Piranha 3DD

I have to say that I am a huge fan of cheesy sci-fi type movies. The first ""Piranha"" I thought was great, lot of cheesy over the top scenes and was very fun to watch. I was actually looking forward to this one. I have to say that I was disappointed. Even though the plot was about the same as the original this one didn't have the same feeling and wasn't as much fun to watch. Yes, this does still have all the blood, boobs and some over the top aspects that you would expect it was just missing the humor that the first one had. This just turned out to be a sequel that was made because the first one actually made money and figured they could just do the same thing again. That doesn't always work. Overall, another sequel that can't compare to the original. I give it a C+.",Piranha 3DD
35,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,4 September 2012,"Piranha 3DDThe best way to control the piranha population is to turn the species into a Chinese delicacy.And since this horror/comedy takes place at a water park all there is to do now is bring this piranha fin soup to a simmer.One-year after a school of flesh eating prehistoric piranha's feasted on boatloads of beach goers their offspring attempt to eradicate the bare-skinned bathers of a water-slide strip club.When rumors of the rabid fish resurface Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), the reluctant co-owner of the water park, tries to convince her step-dad (David Koechner) not to pipe in water from an underground source.But with opening day looming, Maddy and her doting employee (Matt Bush) must prevent the imminent bloodbath.The unnecessary sequel to Piranha 3D, 3DD doesn't deliver the laughs or the attacks the way the original did.

There are strokes of genuine genius in PIRANHA 3DD: Gulager takes standard softcore sexploitation scenes that in lesser hands would've been forgettable and turns them into moments to be remembered. Like the FEAST Trilogy, PIRANHA 3DD is tongue-in-cheek(s): we see the piranhas gaining entry into their victims via any and all orifices. One of my favorites gags is the one where the water park owner inadvertently ""clotheslines"" himself while trying to get away (which leads into another favorite scene, which I call the ""juggling jugs"" scene- a scene Kitten Natividad would envy); another would have to be the cowardly deputy sheriff who finally summons up the courage to rescue survivors of the attack and wades around carrying the nearly skeletal remains of a victim, shouting, ""Medic! Medic!"" Part sexploitation, part FXploitation, PIRANHA 3DD delivers the goods.",Piranha 3DD

Like last time, we have more hot babes donning bikini's, and exaggerated gore, some scenes that will have you in unbelief. Yes our little knawing fish with their killer teeth and angry eyes, are causing mayhem once again. A few actors from the first, stay back, which has you pondering why? May'be like Piranha, their need to eat. This time, they crash a new water park opening up, not your usual theme park, with some adult accessories, courtesy of Panielbaker's sleazy uncle, who dresses and sounds like some rockin' guy out of the fifties, bringing tones of Wayne Newton's voice with it. Some bits of this crappy sequel are truly funny as they are pathetic. One really pathetic moment, making you realize just how pathetic this movie really is, has Rhame's return as a cop (he played a lot of cops, in this type of horror fare) where his legs are now steel springs from the heavy blow he took in the first, that has him walking like Robocop. His replaced legs, also have an added accessory, which will have some of you saying, ""This is the final straw"". Seriously this sequel takes the cake, to all the other sequels of remakes, where this movie really reaches pathetic depths, barely running over an hour, and does have some particularly nasty characters. Oh yes, and how can I not mention the Hoff, taking the p..s out of himself, again, and Baywatch too, which includes the show's theme. Just let's these killer fish stay dead this time.",Piranha 3DD

Still I laughed so hard throughout this film and cringed a couple of times. If you want purely mindless filmmaking then this is it. There are so many great moments but if you don't like stupid films you will not like this.

Especially when David Hasselhoff came in, every scene he was in was just so stupid you had to laugh. I will say this, the actors in this movie are so hot, all the men in this movie or just straight up models. Yes it is extremely gory and graphic throughout the entire thing and yes the CGI is freaking terrible. I mean the CGI was so bad, they didn't even try. For all you straight guys and lesbians out there there is A lot of slow motion jiggling boobs and ass shots of women, so there ya go. For all the gay guys and the straight women out there, there are plenty of shirtless very hot guys! So there you go! With this movie that's basically what it comes down to, is eye candy and hot actors and just laugh out loud scenes. There is a good bit of nudity so if that offends you then steer clear and also if a lot of carnage and blood offends you, then steer clear. As far as the acting goes, I'm not even going to comment. The quality of the acting is just straight out of a porno. This is just one of those so bad it's good freaking hilarious films. 4/10 for Pirahna 3DD.",Piranha 3DD
44,TdSmth5,A major disappointment,4,23 December 2012,"Turns out there are piranha eggs elsewhere in some other lake as well, aside form the one in part I.This time around some sleazy entrepreneur is opening a water park with an adult section- for topless and sometimes naked folks.His stepdaughter isn't thrilled with any of this. She's got a deputy Sheriff-her ex-after her, as well as some nerdy guy. When she's out by the lake with her virgin friend, they are attacked by rabid piranhas that also have learned to jump out of the water and destroy solid objects. They, and some other kids, look for the researcher from part I who tells them that the piranhas are learning and developing some skills- not to mention that they are tough critters that can break through steel.The girl tries to warn the stepfather about the danger of piranhas since the water park drains into the lake. But he won't have any of it. And sure enough, the day of the opening of the park, piranhas make it to the pools and eat everything in sight.One would think that there is quite a bit of story in this movie but the way it's handled all of this takes place in 40 minutes or so. And while I'm making it sound like there's some arc to the story, the way it's filmed is like a series of gags, many of them quite disgusting. At 82 minutes or so this movie is incomprehensibly short, and 15 minutes of those are end credits that have a gag reel mixed in. Danielle Panabaker tries to perform and so do a few other folks. She and Katrina Bowden are very attractive but this director can't direct much at all. He can handle teens being sweet and flirtatious, but put these teens in an emergency or horror situation and the director has no clue what to do. There's some nudity as there well should be but not nearly enough. At the beginning the boss promises a ""coochie cam"" but nothing is made of it. When the piranhas attack the water park, suddenly there is no adult section any more.One can't understand why this movie was so botched. Unless there was a lot more gore, violence, and nudity filmed and someone decided not to include it in the final cut. Otherwise why even bother filming a 65 minute movie? However, not a minute more is on the DVD so clearly, this movie was doomed from the get go.My first conclusion after seeing this movie was that the director of this mess, John Gularger, couldn't possibly have directed the brilliant Feast I. I'm not surprised that I'm not the only one to think that. While Piranha 3DD has some resemblance to Feast II, III, none of those share anything with Feast I. Over time any normal director aims to improve and work on something bigger and better. If indeed Feast I was directed by Gulager he's one of the few directors who's getting worse and worse with every movie he directs. Aja's Piranha I wasn't a masterpiece but it was entertaining and well done. This movie is a disaster. And Gulager is the only one to blame here. There is a story, there is a decent cast, a crew that has the technical know-how, but Gulager managed to ruin it all. This guy is becoming the Olivier Megaton of horror movies- everything he touches turns to hell. Perhaps he should stick to acting (?). Or try directing gross teen sex comedies. Just keep this guy from ruining more horror movies. Piranha deserves better and I look forward to part III redeeming this franchise.",Piranha 3DD

After that film, this was bound to seem like a classic, so forgive me if I gush. A year after the events of the last film the Piranhas have found there way into underground waterways. This leads them to gradually descend upon a recently opened adult swimming pool. The film does try too hard at points. It really attempts to make itself a pastiche rather than just a bit silly. Rhames comes back with metal gun legs, just so he can start shooting. Hasselhoff plays himself, and is actually the runaway star, but what should have been an extended cameo becomes a major role. Piranha 3DD also sets up lengthy jokes, that are kind of funny but not entirely worth the effort. For example a Piranha swims up a girls vagina, and later has sex with her boyfriend, and you can imagine the rest. But this joke is spread out over 20 minutes. Still, I was never bored, I laughed at the absurdity, and it was all harmless fun. Especially at 82 minutes.",Piranha 3DD

It's not a typical role for what I'm used to seeing her in, but she's does a great job as she's a quality actress.David Koechner leads the humor (and he's good at it) of the movie with some solid help from the rest of the cast.

48,Sandcooler,"""Welcome to rock bottom!""",4,17 October 2014,"Every once in a while big Hollywood studios try to pretend they like to make cheap B-movies, which usually leads to projects that can't really decide what they want to be. With that in mind the original ""Piranha 3D"" was surprisingly good, but this one bails on entertainment value and just goes for really obvious, easy jokes. David Hasselhoff as a lifeguard? I'm sure that got a chuckle at the board meeting, but dear Lord don't actually film it. Everything about this script is just lazy. Ever since ""Jaws"" creature features are obliged to have that one character that ignores the threat for his own financial gain, but here it makes even less sense than usual. The waterpark owner KNOWS there are piranhas in the nearby lake he's getting his water from, going as far as to bribe cops on a regular basis to keep it secret. The chances of a piranha-related bloodbath are roughly 99.9%, but hey he made investments or something so let's move on. What kind of a setting is a waterpark anyway, how long does it take to get out of a pool? Not very long apparently, so the last 10 minutes consists of a fake-looking blooper reel that's clearly just there to pad out the running time (and it's still only 83 minutes, not that I'm complaining). I've said it before but I just want to emphasise it: this thing is bafflingly lazy. If even the combined talents of Christopher Lloyd, Ving Rhames AND Gary Busey can't give your movie one entertaining scene, you're doing fundamental things wrong. Nearly unwatchable.",Piranha 3DD
49,Matt_Layden,In The Running For Worst Film Of The Year.,3,3 June 2012,"Those pesky piranhas are at it again, this time they've made their way to a water park to chew on a bunch of naked women. Now it's up to Maddy, a young gal who co-owns half the water park, to get the people out of the water.The first Piranha delivered the right amount of blood and camp to make it enjoyable. There were scenes that were over the top hilarious and going in knowing this helped a lot. In this uninspired sequel the setting has been changed to a water park. Huge mistake. I don't really know where to start. Lets start with the 3D. It manages to be worse than the original. Which is bizarre considering the filmed this entry in 3D. This film is a huge disappointment. I went in expecting it to be AT LEAST, half as fun as the original. I knew what I was getting myself into, but I didn't expect it to be utterly unwatchable. Not even the cameo of THE HOFF can save this trash.I don't expect good acting, but I don't expect direct to video fare, especially from people like Panabaker, Bowden and Koechner. The worst aspect of this film is the script. Horrible, utterly horrible. The poor excuse they have for the piranhas getting into the park is ridiculous, the situations the characters find themselves in is laughable. A van going into the water, people stuck inside and on top. The worst offender is when two characters are ""stuck"" on a dock and the piranhas are destroying the wooden planks from underneath. Not only the worse scene in the film, but probably one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in my life. Poorly acted, directed, edited and written. The entire film is lazy. The fun is gone, most of the laughs are from The Hoff, but even that wears thin quickly. Gary Busey has a small role in the beginning, the film seriously needed more of him. He never had the opportunity to get his crazy on. The scene where he bites the head off the fish and spits it out is in the trailer, that's all he does. Ving Rhames has his best part ruined in the trailer a well. The film doesn't take itself seriously, which is obvious from the get go with dead fart jokes, but the comedy is more miss than hit. I laughed twice, one involving child endangerment the other is the Baywatch parody. The naked women were even excessive and unneeded. It all feels forced to capture the exact same formula of the first, but the water park setting doesn't work for that. One thing this film lacked were the Kelly Brook and Riley Steele characters. Here Koechner fires all the lifeguards and hires strippers. The stripper lifeguards do nothing, opportunity wasted. A ridiculous sex scene puts this film over the top. The scene doesn't play it funny enough, or grotesque enough. It's caught in some odd place in the middle. Yet the film seems to keep the tradition of severed penises afloat. Absolutely no plot whatsoever. The original at least tried, the sequel makes no effort. The attack is actually boring. Not as gory or as fun as the original. It seemed to be cut fairly badly too. This film is tamer, lamer and something that rhymes with lamer. It makes no effort at all. Usually with sequels you want to go bigger and better, not the case with Piranha 3DD. The film is incredibly short, so expect to see ten or so minutes of outtakes during the credits. Even going in expecting it to be bad doesn't prepare you for the awfulness you will endure.",Piranha 3DD

Unfortunately, its filmmaker Alexandre Aja doesn't return for its sequel (whose title is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the size of a certain female anatomy the movie boasts countless gratuitous shots of), and along with Aja's departure sadly is the series' savvy sense of self-parody- so much so that 'Piranha 3DD' ends up typifying, rather than defying as its predecessor did, its genre stereotype as a Bad-movie.To be sure, plot and character was far from our consideration when we approached this movie- after all, both would have simply been functional devices for the movie to get from one bloodbath to another. Here, the trio of B-horror screenwriters Patrick Melton, Marcus Dunstan and Joel Soisson move the setting from the waters of Lake Victoria to a water park known as 'The Big Wet', owned by the sleazy but enterprising Chet (David Koechner) who intends to re-open the place with former strippers as lifeguards and an adults-only nudist pool.Confining the action to one location could have meant a more intense experience, but neither the screenwriters nor director John Gulager are adroit enough to do so. Instead, they let more than half the movie pass before the blood-splattering finale; and when it comes, they rush through it in such a haphazard manner with nary a care for build-up or continuity that it becomes little more than a bloody mess (pardon the pun).Of course, you can't say the warning signs were not there from the start. Hewing closely to Aja's template from the original, Gulager's first sequence involves a cameo by B-movie veteran Gary Busey to herald the return of the carnivorous fish- but the perfunctory manner in which it is filmed matches neither the smarts nor the thrills of ""Jaws"" alumnus Richard Dreyfuss' cameo in Aja's. Ditto for the strip-and-tease sequences that follow- one where a couple accidentally slide into the lake while having kinky sex at the back of their van is unexciting to say the least; while another with the requisite skinny-dipping teenage couple barely raises the temperature before ending all too abruptly.To be fair, Gulager preserves the latter for a more schlocky sequence in which said couple's first act of making love with each other ends up with the male's penis getting cut off after getting bitten by a baby piranha within the female's vagina. This is about the only sequence that matches the gleefully subversive sense of humour from the original (remember the one where two busty girls get chomped up sans their silicone enhancements), but even in what is undoubtedly the highlight of the film, there is a distinct self-consciousness to Gulager's attempt to top the shock value of his predecessor.The same goes for the display of nudity in the movie, where every available opportunity within the water park becomes exploited for some cheap shot of ""double DDs"" cavorting around the pool or bouncing down waterslides. Certainly, B-movies like this are built on excess, but there needs to be some restraint before the excess goes into overkill. Gulager unfortunately overkills both the nudity and the gore in the film, and without method to the mayhem, you'll soon become indifferent to what was meant to provoke and/or titillate.As if mirroring our numbness to the chaos on screen, the acting by a rag- tag group of B-teen actors are particularly lifeless. You'll care little about the fates of Chet's marine-biologist stepdaughter Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), or her ex-boyfriend and town sheriff Kyle (Chris Zylka), or her nerdy but nice best friend Barry (Matt Bush)- let alone their obligatory love triangle. Getting David Hasselhoff to play himself in the form of a washed-out celebrity lifeguard post-Baywatch is fun at the start, but Gulager's heavy-handed tendencies means that the wink-wink perf gets stretched to the point of tedium.The ineptness of this sequel is a pity really- for we were so looking forward to more of the B-movie exploitation thrills that 'Piranha 3D' let its audience chew on the last time round. But even with the key elements- babes, boobs and blood- intact, this is a largely toothless attempt at recapturing the sly humour and visceral excitement of the original. It is even more pointless in 3D, deployed in such a thoughtless fashion that its only purpose seems to be to cause an unnecessary strain to the eye.",Piranha 3DD

This one however, never takes itself seriously, and pretty much gets a pass for all its awfulness. Even the actors seem to be in a different movie. With those being over the top and silly and the others, angsty and very serious. When nothing in the movie really calls for it. Maybe it was studio's way of owning the badness of it, but the way it was completely turned into a parody of the first installment, was the right decision. And gives this sequel a very fresh and carefree approach... It's pretty terrible nonetheless, and that Hoff's cameo, is so insane it is like an inside joke half of the viewership won't get...

After the dreadful event in Lake Victoria , the blood-thirsty fishes are back into the game when they make their way into the newly opened water theme park - BIG WET. Now , not sure what the director John Gulager was thinking when he made this terrible film. The film is more of porn-sleazy time pass rather than visual appealing 3D entertainer. From top-less women to penis- attack scene, the movie is a complete shame and gives you an yuckee feeling. Worst is not over yet , there is scene where owner's head bounces of in the air which is ultimately caught by topless female who in panic rubs the head against her breast. All these scenes , coupled by way-to-below performances gives a headache and you will surely be out of the theater as soon as you realize that you made the mistake of your life by buying the tickets for this worthless movie. There is nothing called screenplay in the film , the cinematography has been effectively used to take close and angle shots of the naked women. Background score is horrible. Performances wise , it is Ving Rhames who does justice in small role. Danielle Panabaker does shine in the role of Maddy. The CGI gives a sense of feelings as if you are watching some 1980's low-budget slasher film.

The follow-up to 2010's critically acclaimed box-office success ""Piranha"" did little business in theaters. Hopefully it will gain a little more attention from home audiences.A school of mutated piranhas enter a water park through its piping systems. The step-daughter of its crooked co-owner must find a way to close off the man-eating creatures' access to the amusement facility. The employees of the park attempt to rescue the thrill-seeking swimmers before they're devoured by the aquatic monsters.Roger Corman's name may not be found in the credits of this sequel, but his spirit is felt throughout it. It's the usual over-the-top creature feature we've all become accustomed to seeing from the B-movie king. Imagine ""Jaws"" if it took place in a water park the kids in ""Porky's"" worked at during the summer. That's the level of entertainment you get from watching ""Piranha 3DD.""The CGI and practical effects are a grade above what one would expect from a movie of this nature. There are parts where the piranhas look less than spectacular, but it doesn't distract from the overall fun atmosphere of the film. Most of the special make-up effects are very well-done. The different severed body parts all look impressively realistic.""Piranha 3DD"" delivers B-movie schlock in its finest form. I don't know how it could get any better (or worse?) than this. It's crude, gory, funny, and successfully self-aware.

58,MattyGibbs,Much better and funnier than I thought,7,26 April 2013,This is the sequel to Piranha and although it seems its universally hated I think it's actually a pretty good sequel. It's not as gory as the first and the plot and acting probably aren't as good either but it is definitely funnier. Whilst in no way scary there were a few moments when I jumped. This is a film that doesn't take itself seriously (does any film with David Hasselhoff in it? ) and contains some genuinely ridiculous and funny scenes. I really can't see why if you liked the first one you wouldn't like this one. This is very entertaining and and there are far worse films to waste an hour and a half watching.,Piranha 3DD
59,meydiana-65242,One of the worst films ever made - and not in a good way,1,11 December 2020,"The first Piranha surprised audiences in 2010 with its wit, over the top nudity, and excessive gore. It never took itself seriously and had a solid cast. This follow-up to the 2010 movie is just honestly embarrassing. It had all the elements that the first movie had, but everything goes horribly wrong with incompetent direction, laughably bad acting and dialogue, and some of the cheapest gore effects I've ever seen.Why is this movie so bad? Let's start with the plot - there is none. If you can buy the premise that piranhas are going to go in underground lakes and somehow end up in a water park swimming, well then I have a bridge to sell you as well. The characters are all terrible. The one couple in the van early on exists only to die, no other purpose, no even attempted development. Yet later we see other characters mourning their disappearance, only it's forgotten 5 minutes later. The one scene that people will probably remember involves a girl that had a piranha swim up her lady parts (and somehow survive) only to bite her boyfriend's penis during intercourse. Trying to be inventive there, but really just shows the lack of any restraint with this movie. But even if you think the plot and acting are atrocious, at least there will be good gore, right? Wrong. The gore effects can be described in one word: cheap. The special effects with the piranhas are terrible too - you wonder where they spent $20 million on this movie. Not to mention, the inevitable massacre scene is shot so poorly that it has zero coherence and lacks any punch. It looks like they just poured some red dye in the pool and hired a few extras to flop around. The massacre scene in the first film had some of the best gore effects I'd ever seen. This is a joke of a follow-up.So which actors disgraced themselves for a paycheck? There is a cameo by David Hasselhoff where he's basically mocking himself, but you have to wonder what is going through his head when his character mutters ""Welcome to rock bottom."" I wonder if the irony is lost on this man. David Koechner is just obnoxious and terrible. Jerry O'Connell played this type of character way better in the first film. Every time Koechner was on screen, I was just wanting him to get killed off already.And also surprisingly, we don't even get any good nudity. All the extras they hired for this movie look like washed up strippers. None of the cute female leads goes topless. Maybe they ran out of budget and couldn't pay them enough to do it.I have a feeling that 95% of the people involved in this film will ever have meaningful work in Hollywood again (thankfully).

60,jlthornb51,Horror Film and Black Comedy Strikes Gold,10,10 June 2015,"Gifted director John Culager, a film maker who recently brought the triumphant Feast Trilogy to the screen to wide acclaim, now guides the Piranha franchise with a sure hand. Beautifully filmed in 3D and utilizing that technique to its best advantage, this motion picture is really as much a black comedy as a horror film. From the opening sequence to its shattering climax, it is, however, a sensitively observed study in human nature under catastrophic circumstances while never letting up on the thrills and suspense. Returning cast members from previous Piranha entries give wonderful performances and some fresh faces are equally impressive. They all do well with a borderline brilliant script that pushes the envelope of horror while allowing for strong character development. Culager is unafraid and does not flinch from violence and gore but never uses these elements gratuitously. An intelligent and humorous horror film that does not fall into the notorious sequel trap, the genius of Piranha 3D is undeniable and the artists involved in its production deserve recognition.",Piranha 3DD

62,Chris_Pandolfi,Do You Get the Double-D Reference?,5,3 June 2012,"""Let's take off all our clothes and go swimming."" If this were any other dead teenager movie, that quote would probably be a facetious attempt on my part to demonstrate overused and unconvincing plot conventions. But in the case of ""Piranha 3DD,"" that's an actual line of dialogue. Perhaps it's a good thing that it's not only aware of horror movie clichés but actually wants to rub them in our faces until we pass out from the smell. We know that this is a bad movie, and the filmmakers know that we know and beat us at our own game. Having said that, there does come a point at which self-awareness devolves into a very unflattering form of monomania. And if you're not careful, it will eventually mutate into sickening self indulgence. If you need proof, here's another line, one that's sure to kick start your imaginations: ""He cut off his penis because something came out of my vagina!""The film is, of course, a sequel to 2010's ""Piranha 3D,"" a remake of Joe Dante's 1978 film. That movie merely went over the top. ""Piranha 3DD"" goes over, around, and through, like an alcoholic on a self-destructive bender towards blessed oblivion. Watching it, I honestly didn't know whether to admire its shamelessness or curse the day it was conceived of. Mindless trash is one thing. But when you include a scene in which sex is interrupted because a piranha hatches in the woman's body, swims out her vagina, and clamps its jaws onto the man's genitals, spraying the bed and the walls with blood, well, that might be taking things one step too far. Its status as pure, unadulterated exploitation is underlined by the title, which is not ""3-D-D"" but ""3-Double-D."" If you don't get the reference, then quite frankly, you don't deserve to have it explained to you.It has been a year since the events of the first film, during which a species of prehistoric piranha thought to be extinct broke free from an underwater cave, swam en masse to the shores of Lake Victoria, and savagely dined on the horny teenagers celebrating Spring Break. The once thriving community was thrown into economic ruin and became a ghost town. The voice-over narration of a news reporter wonders if such a thing could ever happen again. And so it comes to pass that, at a lake somewhere in the middle of Arizona, two rednecks played by Gary Busy and Clu Gulager meet their untimely ends when their prize heifer, which floats lifelessly in the water, farts out a series of piranha eggs that immediately hatch. Cut to a television ad for a nearby water park, which will open in two days with promises of hot young women and a lot of double entendres consisting of the word ""wet.""The park is 51% owned by an unscrupulous and perverted showman named Chet (David Koechner). The remaining 49% is owned by his stepdaughter, Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), who has just returned home after studying marine biology in college. Needless to say, they don't see eye to eye on Chet's decision to replace genuine lifeguards with big-breasted strippers and corner off a section of the park for nude swimming. She reunites with her junior high pal, the mousy but decent Barry (Matt Bush), and her ex-boyfriend, a corrupt and arrogant deputy cop named Kyle (Chris Zylka). As they compete for Maddy's affections, we cut to several scenes where one-dimensional teenage typecasts get devoured by the newly spawned piranha. Two of them are in a van about to have sex – although they must pray first, as they are about to commit a sin. One of them releases the parking break, allowing the van to roll into the lake. You can take it from there.These recent deaths catch Maddy's attention, leading her, Barry, and Kyle to seek out the eccentric piranha expert Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd). He informs them, as only he can, that this particular species of piranha probably traveled from Lake Victoria via several underground lakes, that they can bite their way through corrugated steel, and that they could conceivably travel through pipes, as chlorinated water is somehow or another similar to the water they originated from. With horror, Maddy realizes that the water park drains directly into the neighboring lake. She tries to warn Chet, who opens the park anyway. It isn't long before a school of piranhas do in fact swim up a pipe to the water park, bite their way through a pool grate, and do what they do best – including decapitating a boy no older than ten.Did I forget to mention that this movie is in 3D? Director John Gulager (Clu's son) takes no half measures in ensuring that the audience is aware of it; in the course of this film, we will see a bloody stump of an arm, spikes of coral, a trident, and jiggling slow-motion breasts assaulting our field of vision, along with several snapping piranhas. Did I also forget to mention the special guest appearances by Ving Rhames and David Hasselhoff? The former plays the same character he played in the previous film, minus his legs. He is, however, fitted with prosthetics, one doubling as a shotgun. The latter plays a parody of himself, begging the question of whether he accepted this job for fun or out of desperation. ""Piranha 3DD"" is what it is, but unlike its predecessor, that isn't a sign that it succeeded. Having said that, you might have fun during the end credits, at which point we're shown nearly ten minutes worth of outtakes.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Piranha 3DD

Its not like 2010 ""Piranha"" was a masterpiece, but at least it was pretty fun to watch and entertaining and did have some rhyme and reason in the way it was filmed, in the acting etc.""Piranha 3DD"" has none of that.

The production values suck despite the reported 20 million dollar budget and as for the gore and nudity: seen it all before.But as bad as Piranha 3DD is, it does have one redeeming feature that most reviewers overlook: it's not dull. I mean if there was a choice between watching Piranha 3DD again or sit through The English Patient, I know which flick I'd pick in a heartbeat.Like most sequels, Piranha 3DD is really just a remake, or rehash, of the first Piranha, there's lots of T&A, a male genital mutilation (which I could do without), plenty of shredded bodies and fake blood. Plus lots of closeups of ugly and furious CGI flesh eating fish. The action this time takes place at a water park-the kind of ""Girls Gone Wild"" establishment that only exists in bad movies.The script tries to straddle the fence between horror and comedy and fails on both accounts; all the scary and shocking scenes are well telegraphed ahead of time and the humor is of the lazy Scary Movie type, such as when a character is decapitated by a plastic yellow ribbon tape. All of the main characters are clichés: horny early twenty somethings whose uncontrollable sexual urges leads them to doom. Only the chaste girl and the boy who has an unrequited love for her survive unscathed.Christoper Lloyd and Ving Rhames are back from the first movie, basically doing parodies of themselves, while Gary Busey is wasted in a cameo part in the opening scene. But David Hasselhoff proves yet again that he is a good sport, spoofing his Baywatch persona; his appearance is the one truly funny part of the movie that really works.Read the bad reviews and consider yourself warned, but just remember,bad isn't the same as boring, and Piranha 3DD isn't the latter by a long shot.",Piranha 3DD

Now don't get wrong, I wasn't expecting ""Gone With The Wind"" or anything. After all, you'd have to be a complete idiot if you were. However, even B-movies should be better than this. ""Piranha 3DD"" follows the story of a group of teenagers working at a wet and wild water park not far from the lake where the first one took place at. We learn that the main girl is part owner of the park with her sleazy stepfather who, to his stepdaughter's dismay, has tuned the park into an adult playground, even going so far as to hire strippers as lifeguards, (How did he get that past local regulators). The stepfather is also pumping water from a local well that connects to an underground river. I think an intelligent person knows where this is going. The Piranhas attack and its up to the teenagers to save the day. If only they could act, they just might of pulled it off. There are a few cameos from such greats as Gary Busey, Christopher Loyd, and Ving Rhames. Sadly, there are not in the movie very much at all. Then there's the ridiculous cameo of David Hasselhoff (David Hasselhoff??!! Dose he even have a career anymore?) who gives an unfunny performance if one can call it that. So to wrap it all up, the piranhas kill just about everyone, get sucked out by some super powerful suction system, and then everyone celebrates despite the fact that they failed to save anyone.

68,lovecraft231,Feels like it was written by 8th graders,1,1 June 2012,"I really enjoyed 2010's remake of ""Piranha."" It was a rare type that managed to not only work as a stand alone movie, but delivered everything that it promised: boobs, gore, and comedy. It was also well directed, acted, and had a level of wit within the proceedings.Well, the studio decided that it was a movie that warranted a sequel, and decided to hand over the reigns to the guys that brought you ""Feast."" Well, with it's small (about 75 theaters) theatrical release and On-Demand run, it's easy to see why it's not getting a whole lot as far as promotion is concerned: it's a really s#!tty movie.Taking place one year after the events of the first movie, the movie opens with a cameo from Gary Busey and Clu Gulagar becoming food for Piranhas that come out of a dead but still flatulent cow. Yes, that is the level of humor we are dealing with. Brace yourself, because it gets worse.The next day, Maddy (Daniel Panabaker) is in a bit of a disagreement with her stepfather Chet (David Koechner) because he's turned the family water park (called ""The Big Wet"") into a more adult oriented place with strippers as lifeguards. However, the piranha's are back, and headed to the pool via the pipe system. Her friends Barry (Matt Bush) and Kyle (Chris Zykla) must now try to do something to stop the upcoming onslaught-and you can guess how that goes. Meanwhile, Shelby (Katrina Bowden) is ready to lose her virginity, but a baby piranha goes up her...um, lady parts. Also, Ving Rhames, Paul Sheer and Christpher Lloyd return, and David Hasselhoff shows up as himself.The best word I can think of describing ""Piranha 3DD"" (ha ha) would be ""lazy."" The direction by John Gulagar ranges from pedestrian to just plain bad, with murky underwater shots, poor editing and no clue how to direct moments of violence or any of the actors. Here, you have people who have proved themselves to be good to decent actors delivering awful performances, with some (in particular Rhames) seeming to be embarrassed to be there. In their defense, they are working with a script that feels like it was written by 8th graders. This is a movie where people do things that are dumb even by the standards of horror movies, and characters change motivations (Kyle goes from being an alright guy to a total asshole just completely out of the blue) without any attention to consistency.So, does the humor work? Well, as you can tell from the third paragraph, no. There's one moment that's funny, but most of the movie plays out like something you'd get from a really bad comedy (stuff like ""Fired Up!"") with gore and female nudity. This is movie that thinks a piranha going up a fat man's ass is great comedy. How about the gore? It's pretty tame compared to the last movie, with the inevitable water park massacre feeling anemic in comparison to the all out slaughter fest of the last movie. Sure, there's decapitations and blood in the water, but it's nothing you haven't seen a billion times before.Now I know, I know. ""It's supposed to be dumb!"" you might be saying. Hell, I enjoy dumb entertainment as much as the next guy. This however, is the bad kind of dumb entertainment. The kind that makes no effort whatsoever, and expects you to go along with it because hey man, tits and ass and gore! I'm sorry, but it takes more than that to make a good trashy movie. This is the kind of thing that gives trash a bad name. Being dumb is no excuse for being lazy.It's really no surprise as to why this didn't get a wide theatrical release and has gotten next to no promotion-it f#@%ing sucks. Everything about this feels like a really bad direct-to-video sequel, and that the studio had no idea what to do with it. This is a movie that's best left avoided.

1. Many scenes are just crafted to induce the horror element in the scenes.
2. The acting and behavior shown by 3 actors were simply inhumane, and ""David Hasselhoff"" is completely useless character in the film.
3. Many unwanted situations/scenes are present.
4. I have rated Piranha3D (2010) as 10, and this one as ""1"". Can you believe why?
I request people not to give importance to this movie, rather if you are disappointed watching this one, then recommend to watch Pirahna3D (2010), which is quite better, but again do watch uncut version of the same, if you are in India, and you watch on Indian Television channel, it is again useless as they are many cuts. So watch the uncut version to appreciate the originality of the movie.",Piranha 3DD

Therein lies the disconnect between all the 1-2 star reviews and others, like my wife and I, find the film hysterically funny! Because it never takes itself seriously! We totally agree with the 1 star person who notes the 'solid cast.'
I mean David Hasselhoff is off the charts hilarious. Then, there is good ole Christopher Lloyd adding his usual 'charm.' The Prianhas themselves are grotesquely horrific and a hoot to watch on the screen. One legged deputy played by Ving Rhames added another most weird, funny scenes ever as he battles piranha's trying to eat his steel leg.

No wonder the dang movie was Limited. Utter crap. I don't feel sorry for the returning actors from the first one, because they went so low to take it to be in this, its pathetic. Shows how sequels are going to a new level of shame.OK, for the people that think the sex scene was funny is just a stupid as the director. How the hell does a fish get inside someone without touching the person or the person not even knowing it? A piranha at that. Stupid.Only 2 scenes of double d's, that was not worth it. To many knockers that were normal size. David Hasselhoff was dumber than crap. If they make a 3rd movie, they better redeem it with no comedy and straight horror. The comedy killed this movie.I personally put this movie close to the most shame list and almost number 1. I do not recommend watching this in theater.

After the events at Lake Victoria, the pre-historic school of blood-thirsty piranhas make their way into a newly opened waterpark.You know, when you're about to watch this kind of movie that you don't have to expect too much and just enjoy the ride. The first 'Piranha'-remake kinda accomplished that. This one started okay - a scene where Gary Busey is looking for his lost cow in the water, turns into an unexpected funny gag. But after we know in which direction this film is taking us - an 'Adults only'-pool with water certified strippers - and the awful acting of several supporting cast members, I knew this wasn't gonna be the good-kinda-bad. Sadly ""Piranha 3DD"" is more boring than its predecessor and could've been more, if you look at the original 'Piranha' sequel (directed by James Cameron himself). This one just lacks originality. 
The director has no idea how to handle this and you can tell in the second half of this film. It's not a comedy nor a self-parody or horror.""Welcome to rock bottom!""",Piranha 3DD
73,metalrage666,"It's trashy, It's stupid, It's also hilarious.",5,27 March 2015,"I'll start by reiterating that Piranha 3DD is complete trash and not worth the price of admission or a waste of a free ticket, but having said that I must say that if you catch this on TV one night or get a copy from somewhere, this piece of schlock is a hoot.The whole premise of the movie, if you can look past the bad science and implausible plot lines, is that the piranhas have moved from Lake Victoria via subterranean rivers and set their sites on a water theme park. What sets this park aside from any others I've ever been to is the adult area, complete with the total nudity, droves of splash-happy double-D women and underwater cams. As well as the horny pool boy who likes to have sex with the underwater wall jets.Just as Richard Dreyfuss was the throwaway token star in the first Piranha remake, we now have Gary Busey, who really just seems to be playing himself. He and a friend wade out into a lake to retrieve a dead cow and it appears that the body is infested with piranha eggs and newly hatched piranha. After they are dispatched, the ravenous prehistoric fish kill a young couple after their van rolls into the lake. A few more random incidents occur and after a small piranha swims up inside a girl while skinny-dipping and then, ahem, latches itself onto a guy during sex, which results in him cutting the fish off by slicing off part of himself. (I'm not sure why he didn't just stab the fish so it lets go, but as I said earlier, it's complete trash and everyone is meant to be completely stupid). It's now apparent that the piranha are on the move again.A quick visit to Christopher Lloyd, who's now a YouTube sensation, and the gang are on the look out for piranha getting into the pipes. As usual the owner is having none of it and thanks to a crooked cop, any thought of shutting the park down is dismissed, so of course all hell breaks loose and fun slides run red as human is back on the piranha menu.David Hasselhoff is the guest celebrity, playing himself, playing his character from Bay Watch who is there to help open the park. He's basically made for this type of film as he's no actor, and as a comic relief is perfect for the tone of this flick.Ving Rhames also makes a comeback in this, now as a wheelchair bound aquaphobic. However when people start being eaten all around him, a pair of detachable titanium legs, complete with shotgun attachment, helps him overcome his fear in the best way possible.Really this is a junk film that turns out to be a lot of fun, which is pretty much like every other piranha film ever. The only difference in this is that there's a hell of a lot more nudity and more ridiculous, unrealistic death scenes than you can poke a severed penis at. Lots of half naked buxom women covered in fake blood running around mindlessly for the sheer sake of running around and the ending leaves us with the notion that this piranha franchise is going nowhere fast. I gave it a 5 as this did at least give me a few good laughs.",Piranha 3DD
74,Simon_Says_Movies,The Aquatic Penis Munching Continues,4,15 September 2012,"The aquatic penis munching and poor character choices continue in Piranha 3DD, the even goofier follow-up to Alexandre Aja's surprisingly entertaining 2010 remake, the former of which has just been made available on DVD and Blu-ray. Although containing plenty of both intentional and unintentional laughs, ""3DD"" often mistakes simple-minded schlock cinema for parody and balls-out nonsense for organic fun. The Weinstein Company/Dimension Films should strongly consider packing this disc with a six pack of beer combo offer.It's really no surprise that an influx of gratuitous nudity, celebrity cameos (as game and often ironically funny as they often are) and heaps of sheer camp can do little to raise Piranha 3DD to the level of its predecessor. It's even less mysterious as to how populating this film with jerks, ditsy bitches and pure morons (who are seemingly all bipolar judging by their mood, rationalizing and motivations) fail to make for a compelling B-movie. Of course we expect these human-shaped hunks of piranha fodder to make poor decisions for the sake of crimson water, but when it seems like the writers are intentionally trying to craft most of these individuals with the IQ of water-logged bait worms, it comes off more as insulting.A year has passed since the massacre at Lake Victoria, and following an eradication campaign that led to the complete and utter contamination of the water, the town's tourist industry has been likewise extinguished. But to paraphrase Dr. Malcolm from Jurassic Park, ""life finds a way"" and a newly evolved school of prehistoric nasties has managed to elope to another nearby lake, which unlucky for its inhabitants, supplies the local water park called ""The Big Wet."" Oh and in case you were even going to ask, these piranha have mutated to thrive in chlorinated water or something, so the attack may, in fact, commence without delay. Of the things to enjoy in Piranha 3DD, it's bar none the extended cameos from Ving Rhames (complete with a shotgun leg) and a booze-swilling, out-of-shape David Hasselhoff whose self-lampooning is the only effective instance of parody to be found in this sequel. His reluctant ""celebrity appearance"" at the opening of ""The Big Wet"" amounts to nearly all of the films involuntary chuckles and his bond with a young boy (which forms because he is the only one who doesn't recognize him as the star from Baywatch) is close to the stuff of comedy gold. Aside from those fleeting moments of inspiration, Piranha 3DD is missed opportunity after miscalculated set-piece. I mean, if you've managed to devise a scenario where a fish has managed to enter (and live in) a woman's vagina and then manage to overlook the chance to make an ""eating out"" joke, the filmmakers have failed us all. As far as high camp is concerned, you could certainly find more blasé fare, though that doesn't excuse this film from being an unnecessary sequel that seems to think its audience consists of horny preteens who have never seen a proper parody rather than horror buffs looking for a faithful and lovingly crafted follow-up to Piranha 3D.",Piranha 3DD
75,caseymoviemania,Casey's Movie Mania: PIRANHA 3DD (2012) Review,5,2 June 2012,"For the record, Alexandre Aja's extremely gory remake of PIRANHA (2010) wasn't as good as one might suggested. But at least that remake have its fair share of guilty-pleasure entertainment, and you've gotta admit that Aja knows well a lot about how to make a gory movie. Now here comes PIRANHA 3DD (no, that ""3DD"" is not a typo error), a follow-up that I bet a lot of those who've watched the remake, are naturally expecting something ""bigger"" or ""more outrageous"". Heck, even this sequel has been heavily promoted with the self-proclaimed tagline of ""Double the action. Double the terror. Double the D's"". However, PIRANHA 3DD fails to live up its ""double the (insert the pun)"" promise and instead delivers more of the same without the technical expertise that Aja has fashioned rather well in his remake. This time, there's no Aja in sight here as the sequel is replaced by FEAST director John Gulager. And Gulager is no Aja. What you get here instead is a cheap and uninspired follow-up that makes Aja's PIRANHA looks like a genre classic...Read more at http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2012/05/piranha-3dd-2012.html",Piranha 3DD

77,Ky-D,"Great gore-comedy, better than expected.",7,15 June 2012,"Given the deluge of bad reviews I read before hand, not to mention the low IMDb score, I almost skipped this sequel to a remake. I loved the first one (as many detractors proclaim) and they all seem to hate this one. Glad I ignored the bad buzz, P3DD is a wonderfully exploitive gore-comedy that never takes itself seriously.The Plot: After the events of the first film, the infamous lake is sealed off and the titular piranhas are killed off, effectively turning the lake into a wasteland, but seemingly ending the threat. Months later, however, some fish that survived the extermination travel through an underground river and find a new home in the form of an adult-themed water park. Blood, guts, and oodles of nudity quickly ensue.I will admit that even without the bad press, I was reticent about seeing this. When I heard that Alexandra Aja was not returning and was being replaced by John Gulager, my concern skyrocketed. Gulager directed ""Feast"", which was awesome, but he also directed ""Feast 2"" and ""Feast 3"", which are both just barely watchable (and that's being generous). Fortunately, P3DD falls more in line with the former.What's done right? Quite a bit really, if you have a mind for silly gore-comedies that is. From the first scene in the move, there are blood and guts aplenty and it keeps coming at steady intervals all the way up to the limb-lopping climax. At just about equal amounts is nudity and sexual situations; this movie almost gleefully wears its perv-badge on its chest. Not that there is anything wrong with any of that (quite the contrary), just letting you know what you are in for. Compared to most films the movie is extremely gory, though judged against the first one it actually comes up a little short.Most of the cast changes (ie, nearly everyone) work perfectly. The lovely Danielle Panabaker takes the lead role this time around and is immediately enjoyable in the role while David Koechner plays the same kind of slimy (yet oddly likable) jerk he often does in similar films. The rest of the cast are all pleasantly game for the shenanigans going on, but the two main standouts are the cameos by Ving Rhames and David Hasslehoff. Rhames (being only one of three returning actors) get a great scene involving hydrophobia and how he comes to deal with it, while the Hoff gets most of the best jokes in the movie.Not everything is perfect. For one, the movie is really short; it clocks in at only 83 minutes and that's WITH a 13-minute credit sequence (make sure to not skip the blooper filled credits, they are hilarious). With only 70 actual minutes of story time in the film, you really don't every get around to caring about the fate of anyone in the film; good or bad, alive or dead, no one's fate leaves any real impression on you. Another issue connected to the running time is the bare-bones script; plotting happens VERY quickly and often with little explanation or elaboration. Characters are underdeveloped and are introduced and then killed off with nearly frightening frequency.But then again, are those really things to complain about in a film like this? You don't go to see a movie called ""Piranha 3DD"" expecting deep plotting or award winning acting. You (should) go in expecting exactly what you get: blood, guts, and nudity. And in that regard the movie succeeded marvelously.7/10",Piranha 3DD

The characters, some you like and some you hate. The acting, again, some average and some very bad. The CGI is basically the same as the first movie. The boob factor is actually not shown as much as the first because the trailer shows that there is a lot.The moments in this film where Ving Rhames returns (which I though died in the first one, but anyway)and he has shot guns for legs. Also, David Hassalhoff, pretty much insulting himself for Baywatch. These moments were hilarious. I laughed that much I nearly fell off my chair.If you actually take this seriously, it actually makes the first movie look good.

83,tgooderson,"If you liked the original then watch it again, if you didn't then don't watch this.",4,13 May 2012,"A sequel to 2010's surprise hit Piranha 3D stars an ensemble cast of large breasted girls and handsome men plus a few D List comedy actors and well known faces in a battle of fish vs man. The action is transported to a water park in Arizona where sleazy Chet (David Koechner – Anchorman) has made some changes to his late wife's park. These include hiring strippers as lifeguards and the use of a dodgy water supply. His daughter in law Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) is home for the summer and shocked at the changes. With rumour of Piranha on the prowl she tries to close the park but finds that she is already too late.I really enjoyed Piranha 3D. It took me completely by surprise and was funny, rude and ridiculous. Piranha 3DD has all the same ingredients but has added more rude and ridiculous and toned down the funny. The result is pretty much the same film as the original but has lost what made it unique as it's all been seen before. There is nothing new and the 'story' isn't progressed but it has the odd moment which made me smile and plenty which made me cringe.The acting is terrible beyond belief. This may be perhaps because the casting director went for looks over acting ability but in the end it doesn't matter. In a way the bad adding adds to the fun. None of the unknowns stand out in terms of their acting but Christopher Lloyd's cameo was good, although smaller than in the first instalment. David Koechner was as sleazy and creepy as you'd want him to be and David Hasslehoff joins the fun playing The Hoff in a turn that may make him unable to look at himself in the mirror (if he still could).There is one scene which will probably remain in people's minds and involves Katrina Bowden (Tucker & Dale vs Evil, American Reunion), a small piranha, a man and a knife. It's probably the best scene and although unbelievably ridiculous and disgusting it's quite fun. The rest of the film is forgettable and with character names such as Shelby, Chet and Clayton, you'll find yourself willing the piranha on.The piranhas look if anything worse than they did in the first film. The CGI was perhaps cheaper or more rushed but in the water they looked less realistic. On land (oh yes, they are on land now) they look a bit more real but this is still not a strongpoint of the franchise. The 3D was downright dreadful. The first film was one of only two films along with Hugo in which I thought the 3D added something. In this, apart from about 10 shots of piranhas swimming at the screen and bouncing chest puppies the 3D was redundant and a lot of the film looked fuzzy. I've always thought that this is the sort of film in which 3D could be used to great effect but it wasn't here.If you enjoyed Piranha 3D then you might enjoy this but to a lesser extent. If you hated the first film then you will hate this even more. It isn't as fun as the first, manages to be both ruder and less sexy and the final action sequence isn't even as big as the original but it's 83 minutes of silliness that does exactly what it sets out to do.www.attheback.blogspot.com",Piranha 3DD

87,facebook-124-955845,Never taking itself too seriously,7,2 June 2012,"In 2010 Piranha 3D, made on an estimated budget of $24 million, went on to gross over $83 million worldwide. The movie was far from good, but was able to succeed by not taking itself seriously and upping the ""camp"" factor. It shouldn't be a surprise, based on the film's gross, that a sequel would be spawned; the aptly named Piranha 3DD.When last we saw the prehistoric piranha they were wrecking havoc on Lake Victoria's Spring party. As predicted by Carl Goodman, played by Christopher Lloyd, the piranha have begun to evolve and are now able to breakthrough steel, metal, and wood to get to their next meal. That next meal, or appetizer is to be found in a nearby lake, and ends with the ravenous, toothy fish finding their main course in a water park, which includes a newly constructed ""adults only"" section called ""Big Wet"" that employs ""water-certified strippers"" and where ""double Ds get in for free""; and there are plenty of double Ds (here lies the reason for the movie's title).At an estimated budget of $20 million, Piranha 3DD is the most expensive film directed by John Gulager, known mostly for being the Project Greenlight: season 3 winner and director of the Feast trilogy. Based on what Gulager's Piranha 3DD, having never seen any of his Feast films, his style of film making appears to be one in which he favors style over substance. He would seem to be someone who could make a very decent living directing films to be seen on the Syfy network.The only returning cast from the original are Christopher Lloyd's Goodman and Ving Rhames' Deputy Fallon; when we last saw Fallon he appeared to be getting eaten alive from the waste down. We learn that in fact he wasn't killed and was rendered legless; however, he was able to save enough money for replacements. Gary Busy also makes an appearance, albeit a short one.The lead actress is Danielle Panabaker (Shark), starring as Mandy, 49% owner of ""Big Wet"" and marine biology (!?!?) student. Panabaker's Mandy is the least campy of the characters, and unfortunately there's nothing to take seriously in the film and for that she's the least memorable.Matt Bush's (Glory Daze) Barry is the dorky guy and basically the park's glorified trash man.and seemingly useless when it comes to anything else, because he can't swim. Bush has the look of the dork down pat, and provides some very funny moments.David Koechner, who has played in some very funny comedies such as Anchorman, The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard, and Semi-Pro, is the perfect choice to play the park's majority owner and Mandy's step-father Chet. Koechner has a way about him that is perfectly suited for a film and role of this stature.David Hasselhoff plays himself and steals the film with his self mockery; it's not a far cry from the truth when Hasselhoff mutters the line that he's ""hit rock bottom"".I'd be remiss if I didn't give kudos to Katrina Bowden, who plays Shelby, and Jean-Luc Bilodeau, who plays Josh; the duo have one of the best scenes in the film and Bowden easily delivers the film's funniest line.As much as Piranha 3D didn't take itself seriously, it was more than just big chests, gore and comedic moments; it had a storyline to aid in guiding the film along. In Piranha 3DD it's all just big chests, over the top gore, and comedic moments. That's not to say that it's a bad thing, because the film doesn't try to be anything more than what it is; a lot of cheese and double Ds.Grade: BVisit our site at www.twodudereview.com",Piranha 3DD

93,MovieGeekBlog,"not funny, not scary.. just embarrassingly dull",3,22 May 2012,"The only achievement of this film, as far as I am concerned, it that it has managed to get the lowest score so far among my reviews. Of course, I was never expecting to see a masterpiece from a movie with such title... But at least I was hoping for something just as self-consciously trashy, funny and splatter as the deliciously camp B-movie first part (which itself was a remake) directed by Alexandre Aja in 2010.There have been several trashy splatter/exploitive horrors in the past (mainly in the 80s and early 90s) which I still consider classics within their own genre (Re-Animator, Society, possibly even Tremors and to a degree the Evil Dead movies just to mention a few). Why couldn't this have been one of them? All the ingredients seemed to have been there: an R rating (18 here in the UK), tits-galore right from the title, exploitive 3D, horrible little hungry monsters (piranha in this case), and a series of more or less famous stars willing to play along...Unfortunately what I found was the most un-inventive, uninspired, un-funny, un-scary, dull piece of junk I have seen in a very long time... (Well, I guess that by itself is quite an achievement since I do watch quite a lot of movies). Yes, it's boring too, despite being only 83 minutes long.How can somebody like Christopher Lloyd, the man with a resume sporting such masterpieces like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Back to the Future, could have accepted to have his name associated with such an insult to human intelligence is beyond me! Was your rent really so behind, Chris?The film is badly conceived, badly filmed, really badly post-converted into 3D (possibly the worse conversion I've seen since a cheap stereoscopic comic I had when I was 10!). The story (if we can call it such) makes no sense (there's a piranha in the swimming pool... well, get the f**k out it!). The characters (again... characters?!) all merge into one and even the gore is way below anything one would have hoped for such a movie and most of the potentially gruesome stuff is happening off camera (I guess they didn't have enough imagination to figure out how to make it on camera!)For the first 30 minutes or so, you don't really know how to take it. It seems a film aimed at 14 or 15 years old kids who are hoping to get a peek at some boobies for the first time in their lives... except that this film is actually rated 18...which kinda defeats that purpose. So in the beginning it all starts building up as a straight horror (a bad one of course, but still a horror). Only once David Hasselhoff shows up you actually begin to get a hint of the fact that this is all supposed to be taken for a laugh... If only it were remotely funny. The ""jokes"" (please notice the inverted commas) are so puerile and genuinely unfunny that it becomes almost embarrassing. Not only we are not laughing with it, but we are not even laughing at it... in fact we are just not laughing at all.This is one of the few films where not even the endless outtakes during the end credits can make you smile (And when I say 'endless' I do mean really endless.. What an indulgent and embarrassing moment!. There is nothing worse than seeing a whole bunch of actors and grown-up film-makers laughing at things which are not even remotely funny to us outside.To be honest, I think the film doesn't even deserve such a detailed review, so I'll just stop here and urge you to give it a miss, even (and especially) if you love this genre. wp.me/p19wJ2-xt",Piranha 3DD

95,Braindead09,You've seen an elephant fly... here comes evolution,7,12 May 2012,"What can be said about Piranha 3D(D) that others have not already said. I have to admit not much more.This is a sequel made on an obviously smaller budget, which is not actually a bad thingThe film is nice to look at, it has that sunshine bubblegum look that throws back to 1980s comedies. There are less locations and sets used. The support cast/naked women I suspect were deliberately employed because they were ropey looking and were probably past their prime strippers. The story itself is secondary and so it should be, the viewer wants one thing only hungry piranhas, OK two the male viewer also wants female boobs. In the first 30 minutes it is a boob fest, but once David Hasslehoff appears the boobs end, and are replaced by moobs (excellent use of slow motion).In the UK Mr Hasselhoff is a living joke and represents all that is down market about the US. The use of Mr Hasslehoff is one of the films revelations as he plays along with the script and just rips his entire persona to pieces, if he wins a golden raspberry or even gets nominated he should accept it with pride. Gary Busey opening cameo meant nothing to me, I think it was a gag that only Americans will understand. The director gives his father a nice cameo as well. Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames rip their scenes to pieces BUT do come out of the film with their dignity intact. This film probably explains why Rhames was not available for Mission Impossible 4. Who wants Cruise when they can have a scene blasting piranhas out of the water.The lead actors were very bland and nondescript and this helped the viewer root for the annihilation of the cast. Some of the gore is good and inventive.I don't think this film will clean up at the box office, but I think it will have a long after life on home media. The use of 3D does get wearisome after a while and found myself taking the glasses for long stretches of the action. Luckily some of it played OK in this situation",Piranha 3DD
96,gillman11,More of the same but less so,5,3 June 2012,"Piranha 3D (2010) was almost the dictionary definition of a guilty pleasure. Amusing, chock full of gratuitous nudity and gore gags and with solid turns from a bunch of thesps who have maybe moved on from their peak, all held together by the sure hand of not exactly reliable director Alexandre Aja. It did what it set out to do with a little bit more for good measure.So Piranha 3DD must have seemed like a good idea – keep up the funny, keep up the gore, stock up on some more recognisable actors willing to splash around in water and karo syrup for a few weeks – bob is your Aunt's husband. The attempt to bottle the same lightning twice has much less stable results. The basic plot, even from the outset, seemed nervously similar to the terrible Jaws 3D and balances on a ridiculous premise. But we didn't come to a Piranha sequel and not expect our disbelief to be suspended and we haven't come for the plot, it's a sketch to set up the funny, boobs and blood.The thought that we might not get the same level of funny, boobs and blood is suggested by the opening attack, featuring a very odd looking Gary Busey, which struggles to find ground between fart gags and a reasonable reintroduction of the prehistoric, flesh stripping fishies. From then on, the quality is variable. Many of the same elements are there but handled with a lot less control. The sole honourable exception being a sex scene that does handle a video nasty level, body horror moment with some gross out panache. That one aside, all of the gore gags lack the flair that Aja brought to the first one. Danielle Panabaker struggles to manage a role that is both a thumb nail sketch and an attempt to merge the Sheriff Mom and girlfriend roles from the original. Others such as Matt Bush and Chris Zylka are all fine but again their roles are sketched almost to the level of caricature, making it impossible to care what happens to them one way or the other – when we're obviously meant to root for one to save the day and the other to get his comeuppance.David Koechner is good value as the sleazy opportunist park owner but his role seems to have been lifted wholesale from at least a couple of other movies. Katrina Bowden's character comes off as being impossibly exposed but also impossibly difficult to kill, which is very strange. Despite this and her turn in Tucker & Dale, her acting talents are still probably best showcased by her semi recurring role in 30 Rock. Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd both return briefly and in their couple of scenes manage to showcase what the flick is lacking.So, more of the same with diminishing returns. To be expected but it might surprise you how much the returns have been diminished. This is probably not the flick that you'll turn to as a drunken night winds down, I doubt I'll ever say the words ""Fuck it, let's watch Piranha 3DD again.""There's also way more David Hasselhoff than should be allowable under the Human Rights Act.Oh yeah. The running time. The film proper lasts exactly 70 minutes – that's one hour and ten minutes. The remainder of the advertised 82 minutes is 3 different credit sequences padded with bloopers, deleted scenes, more Hasselhoff (!) and weirdly a behind the scenes sequence of the final scene. You may feel cheated, you may feel like applauding the Corman level usage of all the footage you can. I didn't care either way, which is the problem with Piranha 3DD in a nutshell.",Piranha 3DD
97,Mileskolehmainen,"No plot, some problems (SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST ONE ONLY)",5,31 August 2014,"First off, I didn't think the first one was great either (but 3 1/2 stars, sure.) but this one's got nothing on #1's plot. The tension, and I guess a scare or two, but there is no ending set piece complete the film. The first one had the kids stranded and whats-her-name trapped in the boat. This film has none of that. The filmmakers understand the b-style, but when your monsters stay under the water for the most part, your people should be stuck in the water! The climax should have had someone trapped- like maybe on one of those water park lifeguard islands, like the ones in the middle of the pool, when you see the film you'll understand how that would work well! But for some reason: No. Other than that there are some great celeb cameos, humor and action to pass the time, but I guess that's not what people were expecting from this film. It's not bad though. I laughed, and had some fun- so I'm thinking the crazy low rating (3.8?? That's lower than those Syfy channel movies!) is because Piranha 3DD is goofy, not scary, and such a change in mood, story, and humor. People where expecting Piranha 2, they got scary movie 6. And apparently nobody wanted them to go comedy. And in some ways comedy doesn't work for this film, e.i. the first film wanted you to be impressed/entertained by the effects and the scares, and these type of comedy are basically making fun of them selves, so the film doesn't let you admire it's talent. Piranha 3DD is fun, and deserves much better than what it's gotten, but goes to show that spoofs and horror flicks don't mix well.P.S. This film actually did okay over seas, and some of the behind-the-camera crew are interested, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Piranha: Part 3D (The third Piranha movie- hoping it might happen!)",Piranha 3DD

There's plenty of breasts in the film although it's mostly a silicon fest (par for the course in movies these days sadly).

99,darkraven_109,Thank god I waited for the DVD,4,30 June 2012,"PIRANHA 3DD is one of those movies that makes you question your own intelligence after watching it. I bought the DVD knowing I was in for a trash-gore horror/ comedy movie but Christ, I didn't expect it to be this bad.The dialogue is bad, the acting is flat and the ""scares"" suck. For a horror movie, the scares were not only predictable (which is still a bit forgivable) but really bland. It's only now I remember being this bored at the sight of excessive blood. Also the fan-service was more annoying than anything; I may be a guy but I want a HORROR movie, not a cheap horror movie spliced into an episode of ""Girls Gone Wild."" I remember the times when horror movies had more blood and actual horror instead of mentally challenged large-breasted girls running around like idiots.If there's one thing the movie got right, it's the comedy. I wasn't laughing all throughout but the cameos from Ving Rhames and David Hasselhoff were fun while they lasted. A couple of jokes got me but that's it. You know there's a problem with a horror movie when the end-credits montage of gags and jokes is more entertaining than the whole damn movie.I'm really thankful I waited for the DVD release of this movie instead of watching it on the big screen.

Thus I have been spared the experience of seeing projectile vomiting in 3D. This occurs in the Double D episode when the girl doing the hurling discovers she has one of the killer fish in her vagina. This is not good news for the young man trying to have sex with her. All kinds of hilarious high jinks ensue. If this kind of humor appeals to you then by all means rent the DVD. Your chances of finding this movie in an actual theater are nil. I am surprised it ever got made since the first one did not make that much money. Double D made even less. So do not expect a third installment. The first movie is far superior with a good cast headed by Elisabeth Shue & Jerry O'Connell. Mister O'Connell steals the show as a sleazy Hugh Hefner type. The piranhas make sure he gets what he deserves by the end of the movie. Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames return for the sequel but Mr. Rhames is uncredited which usually means he just wants the paycheck but does not want this turkey on his resume.

Sure there was some goofy part and plenty of boobs but Aja never let the film cross that line that would turn it into a horror spoof and it was a real love letter to those type of films. Now they made a sequel without Aja and honestly , they should have just called this ""Scary movie 6"" . This was like a spoof of the original. As gross out as the original was there was a certain class to it with plenty of cheeky winks to movie fans , this one on the other...not so much,there are no redeemable quality to it. It felt like it was made very fast to make a quick buck. Unlike the original , the surprise cameos are embarrassing to watch...Garry Busey ?!! That opening scene was scary for all the wrong reasons. On the plus side there are some funny moments between the Hoff and a red head little boy but those scenes can already be seen on-line.

I said comical but actually the gore scenes and the piranhas are very well done, and the gore is so over the top you can't do much but smirk at the massacre you watch. The people who rated this movie low clearly either walked in the wrong cinema or very different expectations from a movie titled Piranha 3dd.

Well, I was more than pleasantly surprised. First, for those upset with the sex, um, the title pretty much clues you in. This is total camp, with lots of intentional humor, as well as lots of gore, sex, and pretty much everything but the kitchen sink. If you think you've seen everything, you haven't---I can't recall a movie where my jaw was open half the time, not believing what I was seeing---but it was all in fun. David Hasselhoff's performance was a spot-on parody of himself, and he did it with aplomb---laughed out loud several times during his scenes. And actually, I laughed out loud during this movie more than I did during the two ""Hangover"" movies (which I enjoyed)put together--- and the laughs were in the right spots, for all the right reasons. There were also some very well-executed tension and scare scenes that I was very impressed by. The effects to me were very, very good, considering this isn't the new ""Spiderman"" or ""Avatar"", but again, it isn't trying to be. The piranhas were creepy-fun, and the gore, well, they don't hold back. The filming even was very competent, with the night scenes looking eerie, the pool scenes chaotic, and the sex/boob scenes over-the-top. This is such a great companion piece to the first one--I ordered it ""On Demand"", but will definitely be buying the DVD---I was not disappointed. Oh, and not that it matters, but I'm not some horny teen getting off on this film, I'm a 50 year-old gay man---my partner and I have been together for 20 years, and have very different tastes in movies, but we both agreed at the end of this one that is was a FANTASTIC sequel!",Piranha 3DD
107,Schnayblay,"Gore, Nudity, and Hasselhoff... Need I Say More?",7,13 June 2012,"Ever since it was announced, I was looking forward to ""Piranha 3DD"". The first one, I enjoyed because it was campy, had loads of awesome gore and death, and a lot of pointless and beautiful nudity. So any more of that had me signed up. But it seems like the producers lost sight of what made the first movie so great, because it shows in ""Piranha 3DD"".So the plot of ""Piranha 3DD"" is as simple as its predecessor. It's been a year since the first movie, everyone knows now that there are a species of prehistoric piranhas running lose, and now they've invaded a water park. From there, we have our movie. Or at least the last half an hour. Aside from a few great moments, until the piranhas get into the water park, nothing really happens in the movie. It's just a few good one-liners and one or two hilarious deaths.There are only three characters worth mentioning in this entire film. The first of which is Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Goodman. He is just great. In the first movie, I was really disappointed he had such a boring role, but now, he is developed into comic gold. The whole scene he's in, you can't help but be transfixed on him. You're gonna be laughing through all the plot points in this scene, but let's be honest, you didn't watch this movie for the plot.Ving Rhames is also back as Deputy Fallon. I don't care what your movie is about, if you need a badass black actor, just get Ving Rhames to swear and shoot and he immediately makes your movie awesome. Again, his one scene is just great. You will die laughing to see what Fallon has been reduced to in this movie, and then as you saw in the trailer, shogun legs. Enough said.And finally, David Hasselhoff, my favourite aspect of this movie. He plays himself in this movie, and it seems like he meant this to apply to real life, but there's a scene where he goes to the water park's grand opening and he says to himself ""So this is rock bottom"". And right there I was like, ""well at least he can admit it, unlike some people"". Hasselhoff has some of the most priceless lines in this movie. If for nothing else, I say watch this movie just for him. He makes it.The only negative about this movie is that it seems they tried to mainstream the film into a horror, with only a few comedic moments, whereas in the first movie, there were tons of comedic elements sprinkled throughout. It just felt like they were actually going for scares this time instead of mocking the scares.It's not as good as the first one, but ""Piranha 3DD"" is still a really fun time. I personally watched it with three chicks, at their request, and had a great time. Because I'm that awesome. I say get this movie for Hasselhoff alone, but don't buy it for more than $15 max.

This time it's a water park, 'Wet And Wild' run by the sleazy and unscrupulous Chet, played by David Koechner. His step daughter, and 49% owner of the park, Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) is aghast when he reveals the latest attraction – an 'Adult Pool'. Of course, this pool is complete with strippers and model female lifeguards. But that's only the start of Maddy's troubles as soon the prehistoric killer piranha are found in the lake next door, into which the resort drains water. Chet, along with corrupt Sheriff Deputy, and Maddy's ex boyfriend, Kyle (Chris Zylka) suppress the news to prevent Wet And Wild's opening being delayed. Christopher Lloyd revises his character Mr. Goodman (to whom Maddy turns for advice) from the first movie and is as watchable as ever. Ving Rhames also returns as Deputy Fallon, although this character was seen dying in the last instalment. The story is that only his legs got eaten. Yeah, right! He's only included to provide another continuity link between the films which seems unnecessary, even if he has been fitted with Robert Rodriguez-esque prosthetics. Inevitably piranha get into the water park, leading to mass bloodletting. 'Piranha 3D' was so popular due to its black humour, explicit gore and nudity – including a 3D naked Kelly Brook! From the double entendre title 'Piranha 3DD, and the promotion material, viewers would naturally expect this release to be even more extreme. In reality, even though there are graphic mutilations, decapitations, a severed manhood, naked women and large breasts – it's actually tamer than the original! Being an ex gore junkie I can confidently state there's a lot more creatively shed claret in 'Piranha 3D', almost up in the same league as 'Braindead'. Characters in '3DD' are more generic, less thought has gone into their creation. Another factor to consider is the inclusion of David Hasselhoff playing himself, acting as the washed up celebrity opening 'Wet And Wild'. To start with it's amusing watching 'The Hoff' send himself up, but the joke gets flogged to death and gets tired very quickly. I preferred his cameo in 'Spongebob Squarepants The Movie'. Perhaps my biggest gripe is the outtakes and deleted scenes shown over the closing credits. When a film does this I almost always find it an unforgivable breach of the fourth wall, except in Jackie Chan titles. The ending sets up for another sequel, that if made will be a case of even further diminished returns for the audience.",Piranha 3DD
110,DoctorRabbit,Just Pathetic,1,1 June 2012,"Well this was a huge disappointment! I really liked the first Piranha 3D film so I was looking forward to this. This is a lazy, lifeless, and pointless sequel that had no business being made. Instead of being so bad it's good like the first film, this one is just so bad it's terrible. For starters, the first Piranha film actually had likable characters and somewhat of a plot to it. This one has the thinest of a plot you can get and the characters are incredibly lifeless and not even the main character serves any purpose to the film at all. You'd think that with this being a sequel they would amp up the gore and deaths, but the deaths in this one are actually tamer than the first and there's actually less of them. The film tries to be much more of a comedy this time around by adding more humor which all of it falls flat. The humor in this film is so awful and outdated thats it's hard to believe anyone over the age of 13 actually wrote this film. But, what really annoyed me about this film is just how damn stupid it is! The writers couldn't even come up with a decent way to get these characters in a situation to set up a death scene and instead have them do something really stupid or come up with a really stupid reason to get them in a situation that sets up a lame death. The acting here (even though it's suppose to be bad) is bad even for a B-Movie. And just when you think you will finally get a payoff after sitting through 55 minutes of crap, the film presents you with a lazy and totally underwhelming climax that is filmed so poorly that most of the time you can't even tell what is going on (And this really sucks because that was the highlight of the first film). And then, the film presents us with an ending so stupid and forced that even those who can suspend their disbelief the most will be left frustrated with just how incredibly stupid the ending is. The film is a short (althought it feels much longer) 70 minutes followed by 11 minutes of credits that include a ton of lame outtakes. I can now see why The Weinstein Company decided to only release this in barely any theaters and just put in on VOD. I still can't believe how bad this movie was. The director John Gulager shouldn't ever be allowed to be involved with a film ever again because this guy can't direct to save his life. Alexandre Aja who directed the first film actually understood the material he was working with. John Gulager had no idea what the hell he was doing and just decided the wip out a POS to make a quick buck because he obviously didn't care about this film at all and just wanted to get paid. As far as the cameo's in the film go, Gary Busey is only in the films opening scene and is wasted (the only thing we get to see him do is light a cow's farts on fire). Ving Rhames cameo doesn't just feel forced, but also is just really pathetic and sad to watch. The only positive things I can say about this film was that David Hasselfhoff's scenes are actually chuckle worthy and there's a lot of gorgeous nude women on screen many times. Even though i'm only giving the film 1/2 a star, that feels generous. This film could've really been a blast and fun just like the first one was, but it really is just an atrocity of a film that not even the biggest fans of the first one will enjoy. If you are looking for a fun B-Movie, go rent Piranha 3D and just forget that this film even exist. Piranha 3DD tries to so self-award of itself that it just ends up being exactly what it's parodying.",Piranha 3DD

113,ObscureCinema101,A Huge Letdown,5,4 June 2012,"I always thought Alexandre Aja's 2010 remake of Joe Dante's classic PIRANHA was a bit overrated. However, I was still excited for the sequel. I mean, it had David Hasselhoff, Gary Busey, Clu Gulager, Christopher Lloyd, and Ving Rhames in the cast and was set at a water park, so how could they possibly screw this up? Enter PIRANHA 3DD.The prehistoric, carnivorous piranha from the first film have swam out of Lake Victoria and find themselves in a lake just outside of The Big Wet, a sleazy water park. The lecherous owner decides to use water from that lake for his water park to save money, and unwittingly unleashes the piranha on the patrons at the park. Can his step-daughter, her love interest, and even the Hoff himself put a stop to the ensuing carnage?PIRANHA 3DD should have been great. It should have been the best movie of the summer. But it wasn't. It was one of the biggest letdowns I have ever come across. But it wasn't ALL bad. The inclusion of the Hoff and Busey was entertaining in itself, even if Busey isn't really given anything to do. I mean, if you get Gary Busey to be in your film, why not make him, well, crazy, seeing as that's what he's known for? David Hasselhoff was easily the best part of the entire thing because of how hilarious he was. There's even a montage of him running in slow motion to save a ginger kid from the piranhas! Actually, all the events leading up to the big massacre at the water park were really unnecessary. You could have just shown the beginning and the end water park scene, and the whole thing would still make perfect sense.Probably the worst thing about it is how hard it's trying to replicate the original. Much like MEN IN BLACK II, it tries to be like the original by over-exploiting the good things about the first. The first was taken somewhat serious with an underlying humor, but here, there's absolutely no seriousness. There are a lot of dumb jokes that just do not work, and a lot of situations that are just trying way too hard to be funny instead of just being naturally humorous like the first.Even though the water park massacre was the best part of the movie, it was still a letdown! Remember how the first PIRANHA 3D actually had some funny and interesting death scenes? Not here. It's just piranhas nibbling on swimmers. That's it. Oh, and a piranha gets stuck between a guy's crack. That's the kind of humor we're dealing with in this movie. They could have done so much with the water park setting, and they waste it all.PIRANHA 3DD had some fun moments, but as a whole was pretty stale. It tries WAY too hard to replicate the original and be funny, and loses half the entertainment value along the way. This one might get better with future viewings, but right now, it's pretty moldy.I was never that big of a fan of the original, but now, I see that it could have been a whole lot worse",Piranha 3DD
114,Drewboyz,Worst Film of the past decade,1,31 May 2012,"I thought the first film was actually well done. It was slick, well directed, the acting was acceptable but this...this pile of horse sh.t was just pathetic.You can tell John Gulager directed it as it has no fluency and feels totally disjointed. The movie has a distinct feel it was a total rush job to get it out to market before the novelty of the first one wore off. And sorry but how did Gulager get this gig? The first one had some clever rip-offs, clever lines, some over the top performances from Jerry O'Connell and Elizabeth Shue did a top job as the the local police officer. This film has nothing.The performance, probably due to Gulager's lack of skill as a Director, were woeful, there is no clever dialogue, David Hasselhoff is totally wasted (as in they didn't make use of having him, not he was off his face!).Gary Busey is in it for 3mins as is Christopher Lloyd. The most interesting part of the film were the out-takes at the end and by watching those (most of which didn't make the final cut) you can see what a total butchered, slapped together abortion of a film it ended up being.It's a total stinker, probably the worst, sloppiest piece of crap I have seen in 10yrs.",Piranha 3DD
115,DavidTL,Piranha 3CCrap,5,13 May 2012,"Starts off promising, but then slowly turns into a predictable boring sequel. The first film from a few years ago was good because it parodied 80s horror films with over- the-top gore and unnecessary nudity. This one is written by the writers who wrote the worser Saw films. The camera work is terrible and obscures everything. There are too many close ups and unnecessary slow-motion and old classical music that achieves what? Humour to make the situation funny? Shock similar to what Reservoir Dogs did? I have no idea. The plot is barely there in the latter half with characters with no personalities. There are three returning actors from the first one, one is Christopher Lloyd playing a Doc Brown marine biologist and the other is Ving Rhames playing the Sheriff from the first film who is scared of water and the other is the second-assistant camera operator who was part of the porno-making crew from the first film. In the end, there is a cliffhanger that obviously will lead into a third film, which I will be surely missing. Piranha 3DD is tamer on gore, nudity, language and horror and doesn't even live up to the trailer or it's title. Funnily enough, the trailer for this film looked better than the original film. But the films in reality are the other way around. I would rather watch Jaws 3, one of the worst films in the world that Piranha 3DD in some ways steals plot from, than watch this sequel again. James Cameron, I'm sure your sequel from the 80s Piranha 2: The Spawning is a better sequel to the original than this sequel is to the 2009 remake. 5/10",Piranha 3DD
116,malaysian1789,Piranha's are back!!!!,4,11 May 2012,"Winning the award of ''unnecessary sequel to average film'' comes Piranha 3DD (yes, double D's), a horror/black comedy about a group of teenagers working in a Water Park, who have to battle pre-historic Piranhas. Basically the same plot as the first film. Without Kelly Brook. One by one our heroic teens are subjected to brutal attacks by these violent Piranhas, and its up to Maddy, conveniently a marine biologist who's step-father owns the water park, to save the day somehow. Whereas the first film worked as a spoof of 1970's B-Movie horror films, this film just feels lazy, the jokes are half-hearted and there's nothing original in terms of the gore, it plays out like a standard horror film (although there is one crazy castration scene which will both terrify and amuse you). What manages to slightly redeem the film are the celebrity cameos that come during the later stages of the film, we have Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future man) return as a nutty scientist, and David Hasselhoff playing a parody of himself (is he bankrupt or something?).The film begins with a 2 minute montage of 3d breasts and ends with a 20 minute gore-fest involving numerous naked women, so its clear this is a film for males aged 18-25 (probably), but i wouldn't rush to the cinema to see this, or buy the DVD, just wait for it on TV. 4/10",Piranha 3DD
117,slasherstudios,"""Piranha 3DD"" Serves Up Gory Fun B-Movie Style",7,1 June 2012,"After 2010's hit horror remake ""Piranha"" made a killing at the box office ($83 million worldwide on a $25 million budget), Weinstein Company quickly gave the go ahead to make an even campier sequel with the affectionate title ""Piranha 3DD."" Tentatively scheduled for August 2011, the release date came and went without any word about the film. Weinstein soon announced that they would be releasing the horror sequel in November 2011. Once again, the release date whizzed by with no word from the studio as to when or if the film would be released. Now, on June 1st, the film has finally been released to horror hell. Opening in 83 theaters this weekend, the film is also showing on demand (where I caught it as no theaters within a 100 mile radius of me is playing the flick). With little press and even littler buzz, the film has little to no hope of making waves at the box office. Did Weinstein Company lose faith in the film? Is the film so awful that it simply doesn't deserve a theatrical release and the studios is simply fulfilling contract obligations? Let's take a step into these piranha filled waters and find out.""Piranha 3DD"" begins one year after the famous attack on Lake Victoria by prehistoric piranhas. Extremely bad press from the incident has left the lake devoid of any life whatsoever. The town itself has been largely abandoned as a result of the drying-up of their main revenue source, tourism by horny spring breakers. At a nearby lake, two middle aged rednecks named Clayton (Gary Busey) and Mo (Clu Gulager) wade into the water to recover the body of a dead cow. Eggs laid inside the cow carcass, and before you can say ""piranha meal"" the farmers are killed by a hungry and very angry swarm of baby piranha.Enter Maddy (the lovely ""Friday the 13th"" remake star Danielle Panabaker) a marine biology student. She returns home for the summer to the waterpark she co-owns. She finds to her horror, and our amusement, that the other co-owner, her step-father Chet (David Koechner), plans to add an adult-themed section to the waterpark with 'water-certified strippers', and re-open it as ""Big Wet"" where the ""double DD's get in for free."" At a party at the waterpark that night, Maddy encounters several old friends, including her policeman ex-boyfriend Kyle (the enjoyable slimy Chris Zylka), and Barry (Matt Bush) who has secretly had a crush on her since grade-school. She also runs into two of her close friends, Ashley (Meagan Tandy), and Shelby (Katrina Bowden). It doesn't take long to guess who will and won't become piranha bait.Shelby and her boyfriend Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) go skinny-dipping in the lake, where a piranha makes its way inside her you-know-what(yes, you read that right). Meanwhile, Ashley and her boyfriend Travis (Paul James Jordan) go to have sex in their van. They accidentally trip the handbrake, causing the van to roll into the lake, where they are both devoured by the angry piranhas.The next day, Maddy is consoling Shelby about their missing friends. While sitting on a jetty, they are both attacked by the swarm of piranhas. They manage to kill one, and Maddy, Kyle and Barry bring it to Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd even stranger and more over-the-top than he was in the original) to examine. He informs them that the piranhas may be moving via sewage pipes and underground rivers between lakes. The trio return to the lake, where they establish that the piranhas cannot make their way into the outflow pipes connecting the lake and the waterpark.Back at the waterpark, we find celebrity lifeguard David Hasselhoff (played by himself in a hilarious, mocking tone similar to Jennifer Tilly's role in ""Seed of Chucky"") has been hired on as an ""A list"" lifeguard from the waterpark. It doesn't take long before the piranhas find their way to the park to devour and feast on the lovely young teens and the families enjoying their stay at ""Big Wet.""Sound silly, over-the-top, and preposterous? Of course it is! The film is ""Piranha 3DD"" not ""Schindler's List."" You want big breasted girls being torn apart by piranhas? You want David Hasselholff running in slow motion to the Baywatch theme to save a drowning ginger boy? You want the death of not one but TWO annoying kids played up for two of the biggest laughs in the movie? Well, you get all of this and a hell of a lot more. Rating a movie like ""Piranha 3DD"" is a different proposition. The film itself is not nearly as good as the original remake (how's that for an oxymoron?) but I would argue that this sequel is a hell of a lot more fun. Take out the 13 minute credits (stay for them, there are some funny bloopers and behind the scenes video) and you are left with a 70 minute nonstop roller-coaster ride that is over before you can even begin to think of the bad acting and nonsensical plot developments. ""Piranha 3DD"" left me craving another sequel and isn't that the best thing you can say about a cheesy horror flick?",Piranha 3DD
118,john_sprocket,Barely even a movie,2,21 October 2020,"The first Piranha movie was just been a stupid monster movie where Spring Breakers get eaten by giant piranhas. I mean, perhaps you're not into that sort of thing. Fine. But if you are, the first Piranha movie was made with a lot of care and attention and it was fun.This sequel was just awful though. None of the original main cast came back for this movie and you can't help but think that's because they read the script. Where the first movie had a tense, claustrophobic scene of cave spelunkers stuck underwater trying to deal with their oxygen tanks in tight spaces, this movie has poop jokes.The plot makes no sense. No one involved in creating this movie cared at all about the script or even, it seems, liked the first movie.This movie fails hard to level up to the original. And, let's be clear, the original was a movie where some guy's junk gets eaten by a fish and the camera holds on that scene for an entire minute. It's not like... high brow or great cinema.",Piranha 3DD
119,pcselect,Less of everything as a sequel,3,27 May 2014,"Promising more of what Piranha brought you, this delivers less. A lot less. Less humor, less gore, less tension, less nudity, less edginess. Overall, it's just like one of those rip-off movies that comes out for rental right before a major movie comes out on disc. Maybe not a good example, but when Tom Cruise's War of the Worlds was due to be released, you saw knockoffs like ""War Between Worlds"". Those movies are drudgery to get through. It's cheap to have actors recite lines for 85 of the 90 minutes of a movie, and build a plot based upon that; but that's a different genre. When it's done and marketed as a comedy or horror, then that's a cheap rip-off. Dialog is cheap. Good, funny dialog (good writers and actors), and SFX are not cheap.Just like a knockoff, this movie tries to be funny and fails. It tries to make you care (big mistake for comedy-horror), and really falls flat on it's face with bits of drama that are tedious to get through. Special FX are blown away by Sci-fi channel direct to disc releases. The original's SFX were not state-of-the-art all the time (most scenes were though, especially where there's gore), this one the SFX are not even TV-show decent. This would have been forgivable if the movie wasn't so boring in between those few shots. Overall, this is a boring, PG-13 movie that fails in every genre. It's not even so bad that it's funny (I watch some very low-grade B-Movies too). It's better than Thankskilling, but at least TK hit it's intended low mark of humor and quality. I'd put this movie in the same league as Black Swarm or Blood Monkey.The only reason someone would see this is because of the titular link to the fantastically better movie, or because there's bodacious boobies on the box. Renting this and expecting either of these components to be there even in high dilution will surely disappoint you. If you can catch it for free via streaming when you need a nap, well then it would be good for that.",Piranha 3DD

It's not even possible for the piranha to just crawl up between her legs and she didn't notice. Also, the piranha would just eat her, not live in her genitalia. This is just some really stupid film. I lost all faith in humanity when people not only makes films like this, but actually like it.All i can say is that i don't want to live on this planet anymore. I don't want to live with middle-aged men with the mentality of a 13 year old perverted kid who gets off peeping at women and drawing boobs. If i want to see gratuitous sex, i'll watch porn.

Heck, most people in all honesty are below average dullards that will review a totally gratuitous schlock fest like this in the same way they would review a serious horror movie like JAWS. If you ever write ""none of the actors will receive any Oscars for their performance in this"", do the world a favor and don't write any more reviews. Why anybody would expect a movie with a title like PIRANHA 3DD to be nominated for any Oscars is beyond me. It's a movie about giant prehistoric killer fish attacking people at a water park and the title is a play on breast size for Pete's sake! Oscars... man! Gimme a break. However, if you like gory horror exploitation flicks filled with T&A, blood and guts, and characters that make you bust a rib in disbelief at their stupidity in tight situations then this is an absolute gem, even better than the first in terms of sheer exploitation and low brow humor. If you don't want any spoilers, stop reading here and enjoy the film. If you want to know some highlights to help determine if you think you'd have a ball watching stuff like this, then read on (and congratulations for not being a humorless waste of space). Highlights: the casting of Gary Busey and David Hasselhoff, both of whom have a blast with their deserved cult status/personas (fans of ""Baywatch"" will especially have a riot watching the Hoff poke fun at his alter ego, Mitch the lifeguard); gratuitous boobies (and lots of them!); a decapitated head flying through the air and landing on a pair of giant fun bags in post-mortem motorboat fashion; reeling in ""oh no"" fashion as a piranha spawns inside a bikini babe's stomach and exits via her nether region during coitus interruptus, clamping onto her lover's reproductive unit which gives him the bright idea to pull a Bobbit on himself right then and there; very cool (and nasty) looking fish and over the top but still honest to goodness gag inducing special effects; Ving Rhames getting over his fear of water and lack of legs which were chewed off in the first film; a completely out of the blue shot of a Piranha in a fat pervert's plummer's crack; a fast pace and perfect running time of under 90 minutes as all movies like this should be (there's no padding here... which is very good considering the DDs in the title). I watched this movie with 2 other people who were horrified and disgusted by the goings on AND who laughed their butts off the entire time. That's exactly what this movie was supposed to do and it succeeded in all departments. Definitely not for everybody, but a GREAT time for those who have a twisted sense of humor. 8.5 stars for what it is (fast paced jump and shout scares, gross-out gore, consciously clever sleazy perverted fun).

That movie sucked. It was boring, not gory, the 3D sucked, and I felt totally ripped off. Hell, I enjoyed Piranha 2 by James Cameron more and in that film, Roger Corman made him use stock footage of angel fish to be the supposed flesh eating fish. So this time I avoided the theater, the 3D prices (which I can tell from watching would still be a rip-off as there are only a handful of real 3D shots in the film and the rest is converted crapola), and just watched it on VOD. And I gotta say, this is what the first one should have been. It's shlocky. There is tons of gore. It does mimic the first film with a few things - a surprise ending; a guest star death at the first scene. But this has gorgeous women with big boobs. Some truly hilarious kills. It's one of those so bad it's good movies. And the director, who did FEAST, delivers another great B-movie. I like Alexander Aja just fine (save Mirrors and I think Haute Tension, while nicely gory, made zero sense with its surprise ending), but he and his cast were lame in the first 3D movie. This one never takes itself even remotely seriously for a moment. And the Hoff is great in his self- deprecating cameos. My only complaint would be Christopher Lloyd, who was once a great comic actor. In both films he just goes way too over the top. Is he now a real alcoholic like he used to play on Taxi or has he simply forgotten how to act?Otherwise, if you like hot chicks, nice tits and minge, and lots of blood, see it on video.

There is a time when the piranha shows cannibalistic act but this is nonsense. If they are cannibalistic, they wouldn't be around since they'll keep eating their own mate. The ending was ridiculous. I couldn't understand how that fat ass makes the pipe blown. He didn't use any explosive but instead he just pour some petrol inside the piping system and he use his cigarette to start the fire which somehow creates explosion.

131,CreaturewiththeatombrainUK,Piranha 3DD,4,22 May 2012,"These sort of films are supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, over acted, and trashy, the story plot full of stereo typed characters and bad decision making, along with good measures of tasteless gore and dark humour. Yet having all the right ingredients doesn't mean you can make a good cake. It takes a brilliance to balance these elements together and make something special, something marvelous. Director, Alexandre Aja, achieved this when he delivered Piranha 3D in 2010. Piranha 3DD does not. It feels like they've bought together a collection of not-so-funny one liners and cameo's and written a story around them, filling in any gaps with recycled material from the first film and Jaws 3D. (Certainly an interesting decision, given that Jaws 3-D was a horribly disappointing sequel itself).The production quality wasn't bad, and the sound was okay. The CGI and effects were a bit dodgy in places, but on the whole, passable. The real downfall for this film is the script. The dialogue starts a little wooden, but becomes increasingly worse as the film progresses and towards the end it's cringe worthy. The jokes are shockingly terrible, and I don't mean offensive, as in edgy or dark, they're just bad. The characters are two dimensional and dull with virtually no relationship building; it's difficult to care whether they live or die. Piranha 3DD is just sloppy (or lazy) writing. It's just a bunch of unexciting ideas that have been forced together to fill up 90 minutes. I never thought I'd say this, but by halfway through I was desperately hoping the piranha would sprout wings.The humour might appeal to some, and there's generous nudity throughout. Christopher Lloyd has some brief screen time and he is superb.

Makes such nonsense. It's more funny than scary. The whole cast is weird. It's just crazy to rescue people from being chewed on in a pool. This movie would just be a waste of anybody's time. This would be a movie for fishers lol. This should be a nomination for the worst movie of this year. What a disappointment for horror movies!",Piranha 3DD
134,ggarmatr,They couldn't have pilfered any more...,3,3 November 2019,"I haven't seen Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981) just yet, but it's highly likely that this took some scenes from that as well (i'll keep my fingers crossed).
Apart from upping the gratuitous nudity and gore, there's practically nothing that would have added value to the film series, not even the small jabs of comedy.
Seeing as how they still have not explored the ending shown in Piranha 3D (2010) (probably the implied super-sizing hasn't done well in those years), this one implies a different possible storyline, if another even gets made. Who's to say, maybe they'll combine the two endings, along with supersizing its two selling points.",Piranha 3DD
135,thetotheads,Better than the first one,9,7 June 2012,"I give this a full eight out of nine leaves, as this is one of the most herbal friendly movies released this year. I am a big fan of the French director of the first Piranha 3D, but I found myself enjoying the second one much more. The 3D photography is excellent, even better than John Carter. Lots of layering plus more attempts to have things jump out at the audience than we usually see in today's 3D. Especially good is the multiple close ups of fish trying to bite the viewers' faces off. The fish get more screen time in this version than any previous version of Piranha, much welcome to those of us who hate waiting until the end to see the monster. I don't understand why this is being given such a limited release; we had to drive 15 miles out of town into the desert to see it. This follows movies like Road Warrior and Superman 2, where the sequel makes big improvements on the original. The Hoff is hilarious too. Try to see this 3D tonight before it disappears and make sure you see it properly smogged.",Piranha 3DD
136,FireWave,"Unfortunately, Piranha 3DD hit the rock bottom...",3,28 June 2012,"Well, first of all I have to say that this movie was real joke and a bad one. Why? You don't see anything here about the characters. They are all blank and actors wasted. It is dull movie, where actresses were running and screaming naked and, of course were talking about sex and doing the porn. The story is too much predictable. They actually tried to add too many boobs and gore in the movie, following the pattern of the first Piranha. In this one, you don't have tension. First scene about two men searching cow is ridiculous. Story was so rushed, that they thought it would excite us, audience. THey even added David Hasselhoff for comic tune. I was bored with his performance. It wasn't funny at all. Piranha 3D has more tension, action, darkness and piranha. In this one, everything is just a cheap parody. Yes, it doesn't take itself too seriously, but it isn't reason to make excuses why is this that bad and pretty much short.4/10",Piranha 3DD
137,xMartyMcFlyx,Bad attempt at a horror/comedy,3,5 June 2012,"While I thoroughly enjoyed the 2010 remake of Piranha directed by Alex Aja, this 2012 sequel was just plain awful. It tried too hard to be comical while still trying to be a horror movie. The acting is awful, the story is a rehash of the first movie except now it's in a waterpark, and we only get a water park attack during the last ten minutes or so of the movie. Oh yeah, did I mention that this movie is only an hour and ten minutes long with an extra ten minutes of credits/bloopers?? Do not waste your time with this movie. The only positive thing about this movie is that the fish themselves look a lot more realistic than the first movie and they don't rely heavily on CGI this time around. Other than that, this movie is pretty awful. There's barely any gore in it, and with a movie called Piranha there should be gratuitous amounts of blood (which is what made the first one so entertaining) I mean come on, I'm not watching this movie for the ground breaking acting or anything here, I just want gore. Stick to the 2010 movie.",Piranha 3DD
138,Ddduuudddeee,You little ginger moron,8,17 November 2019,"This movie is short, but so hilarious. David Hasselhoff is reason enough to watch. The way he plays to his celebrity status is perfect and kudos to him for seeing the comedy in that.
Not a movie to take itself seriously at any point, it has the needed parts for mindless, fun, and suspenseful gore. And a love story for the ladies And plenty of T&A for the boys.
Turn your brain off for a little over an hour and enjoy . Don't listen to the haters. Life's too short.

Why do people, stupid people, insist on joining the hate bandwagon? What is it about these idiots that make them unjustly urinate over decent films? Why do they think they have to defend the originals? 3DD had better humour, as it was supposed to be over the top humour, it had just as good gore and the 3D effects were far superior to Piranha 3D. Don't listen to the haters, they're IDIOTS pure and simple.

I knew what I was getting with the DD thing (and, hey, they did NOT disappoint!). This wasn't gonna be Jaws, for sure.So, are you killing time on a quarantine day stuck at home? Does this pop up on one of your 37 different streaming services? Are you day drinking? Put it on your phone. It'll take just over an hour. You get some gore, T&A and The Hoff doing his Hoff thing. You'll get David Koechner doing his Champ Kind. You'll get Doc Brown. You get to see Gary Busey get what's coming to him. You get to see Cerie from 30 Rock puke twice.

RightAll these other reviewers slating the movie because its no masterpiece etc etc What did you expect? Storyline? Forget it, Character studies? forget it, Tension? forget it, script detail? Forget it, Oscars? Forget it!!! Piranhas' eating people? Hell yeah! In 3D? Hell yeah! Don't listen to reviewers, even me if you will, Just disengage your brain and enjoy as it truly is a good laugh! I really enjoyed it and I'm sure many will take it for what it is you wont go wrong if you have no expectations.PS the Hoff was brilliant in the film playing the stereotypical Hoff, I must also add will someone please give Christopher Lloyd more work, a truly wasted genius. Peace!",Piranha 3DD
142,kamal23,One of the worst sequels ever,2,7 July 2012,"Sorry, but this movie is really one of the worst I have seen in a long, long time. Everything I appreciated about the first part seems to be gone in the sequel. Don't get me wrong, I really do appreciate trash, but this movie is not even that, it's just a ridiculous waste of time. Of course I didn't expect anything deep in this movie but plain and simple even more over the top gore as could be seen in the first part. Unfortunately, Piranha 3DD did not deliver as expected. Instead, you get lots and lots of completely stupid scenes, that don't even ad up in any way (and I don't mean in really making sense, cause a movie like this doesn't really make sense at all, but they should at least ""work"") but that are plain and simply not thought through at all. As an example: Why does the fish in the water tank doesn't just jump out? They can jump out of lakes as well, can't they? Or how does the bus land somehow in the midst of the lake, why cant that guy rip the tiny chain from the toy-handcuffs open and so on). All in all, it feels like I just wasted 1 1/2 hours that I could have spent watching the rain outside. Even the outtakes in the end are not funny at all. I can only speak for myself but I must say after enjoying the first part this sequel is a sheer disappointment.",Piranha 3DD
143,bougheyrm,A let down,3,13 May 2012,It's not that I had any high hopes for this movie but the first one was funny and tightly executed (admittedly some of the actors were very poor - I'm looking at you Jerry O'Connell). This one is very predictable and showed a remarkable lack of any sense of human biology or basic plumbing. The main shock to make sure that this was an 18 rated movie was sign posted so far in advance that it was simply dull when it arrived. The 3d was remarkable low key this time and in all honesty this will play better at home on the telly simply because you can have a laugh with your mates and talk about something else whilst the dull bits are on.,Piranha 3DD

146,bs7162,I Just Loved It,10,3 June 2012,"OK lets get this straight we know that it's not as good as piranha 3d but that does not mean mean it's bad. I loved this movie because it was funny (most of it), the CGI was crappy But I still think that makes no difference because I like low budget movies, the acting was great Especially Danielle Panabaker and David Hasslehof, and the story was ridiculously funny I don't know people are making a fuss over it. This movie had such a lot of jumps as well as thrills. my favourite scene was when the van rolled down into the water and the couple were massacred by baby piranha. verdict: Piranha 3dd is still a whole lot of fun and still delivers the goods, the movie was a bit tame but made up for that with the amazing acting. so sit back and enjoy the awesome movie. 10/10",Piranha 3DD
147,migz0621,cheesily brilliant,5,30 June 2012,"This movie did not live up to the original, it wasn't that gory and terrifying at all, let's go to the negatives first, the problem is, the cheesy song when there's action, like Fallon's shotgun-legs scene, It made me feel like Drew's in love with him, and the water park explosion scene, the background music was good, but not as good as the first one's climax had. Me and my friends had watch this movie and they felt like the death scenes felt like Final destination (exagerated deaths). now for the positives, Danielle Panabaker was great as the lead, Melton and Dunstan had a great idea of a water park being attacked by the school of bad ass piranhas, speaking of piranhas, they looked pretty good in this movie, i had to say, better than the first. The ""dentata"" scene made us laugh out loud, but wait, why didn't Shelby feel the fish inside her uterus? lastly, The Hoff was brilliant at playing a Parody of himself being an ass and all. Overall, Piranha 3DD was enjoyable, but don't expect much of it to be like the first, I hope they make a Piranha 3DDD without John Gulager, i think he messed it up, bring Aja back!",Piranha 3DD

To me I like Piranha 3D for what it did. But this movie is so dumb, The acting is really really awful. The people in this movie is so dumb, it was ridiculous. Silent Hill: Revelation was worse, but I feel this movie is the same way. Again, what did we do Hollywood? Nothing but it feels like we have to sit and watch this, oh wow.... I guess there is one good thing about the movie and it's the effects on the piranha's, other than that nothing else, I feel like we will have to see stupid sequels like this. People I have talk too and none of them like this crap, and now I know why. Overall, a ridiculous dumb stupid awful movie, that's all I have to say.",Piranha 3DD
149,Dramakingdt,Thought it'd be more fun..,4,13 May 2012,"Now I was very excited to see this movie as I thought the first one was an extremely guilty pleasure with the hilarious antics, extreme nudity and sickening gore. I thought 'Water park' 'plumbing systems' a riot is going down with this one! Sadly I was let down, the nudity is the same but to be honest the waste of deaths was stupid. They could've done so much more! Don't get me wrong, the bedroom scene/piranha in ass bits were the best but the bedroom scene was in the trailer! In the first we had; the speedboat death, the wire death, kelly brooks death, the opening death etc All NOT in the trailer.It seemed that all the good bits (other than the nudity of course) were in the trailer, you knew all the great bits before you saw it.I guess I had way too many expectations for this movie but it is a laugh, nothing on the first one though at all.Positives were the 2 major deaths (bedroom/asshole), the ending, Katrina's one liner and when the owner runs over a girl. Hilarious.Fan of the first? Go and see it but if not? Wouldn't waste your time.P.S The 3D is mediocre, bit cheaply done. Plus the Piranhas look a little different.",Piranha 3DD

As with the first one there is lots of nudity and lots of gore! Which I like. Danielle Panabaker is great as the lead and done well with this film. Ving Rhames was back and that was just delightful. David Hasselfhoff - well, what can you say about David? Just too awesome for words. Katrina Bowden gives us the best line in the film ""Josh cut off his penis because something came out of my vagina"" then of course Ving with his ""Bring me my legs"". The other cast members were hilarious! It was great seeing some not so familiar faces. The effects (again) were not amazing but enjoyable non the less. The deaths were inventive and funny (wait for the last one)! And of course - Christopher Lloyd, amazingly crazy once again. I gave the Piranha 3D 9/10, this one I give 8/10. It's awesome but the first one is, well... AMAZING! Just don't take the film so seriously, just enjoy it, have a laugh and smile! When this comes on DVD I will have my beer and pizza ready! Great lads film but i'm sure the ladies will love it too! Please go and watch it so we can get a third - God knows what it'll be called...",Piranha 3DD
151,jazzy-gander,Exactly what you expect from a film about mutated piranha fish!!,6,5 June 2012,"A lot of people will just watch this film for the boobs and the blood and thats fine because there's a lot of both, but it also has a good storyline. The characters were a bit flimsy and the ""Hoff"" played a good role and set up a lot of funny lines, also the music was brilliant - and a little ironic at the end.There was more piranha action and gore in the first one - and yes i think that one is slightly better - but the sequel is still good and has a good storyline and also leaves the door open for another film.Definitely worth a watch, although if you haven't seen the first one you probably should before seeing this one, as otherwise some parts wont make sense.",Piranha 3DD

To me this sequel was so pointless the characters hardly get introduced before they start getting picked off one by one the story was lifeless all they done was stick as much boobies and nudity in as possible to try and make it a little better but I sat there watching it waiting for it to start getting a little bit watchable it didn't before I knew it it was the end of the movie I did not enjoy it at all, I have to say the only good thing about this film was The Hoff and he must have been in desperate need of a paycheck no idea what he thought when he seen this script as for the other actors they were good but were made to act cheesy and stupid it was DULL I just don't think the writers even thought about this film definitely a one time watch ( And I don't know how I got through it once) I am giving it a 2 and i think that's generous stop at piranha 3dd please I couldn't sit through that shocking film again!!!!

153,JeffAHayes,Lotsa Fun (if you don't take it -- or yourself too seriously)...,7,30 March 2013,"This is a JOHN GULAGER film written by his attached-at-the-hip writing team of Marcus Dunstan and Partick Melton. These three have been together since the two writers' script was first approved by Matt Damon and his buddies for the third (and final) season of ""Project Greenlight"" (the TV show where Miramax gave a supposedly amateur writer/director $1,000,000 to make his/her movie), followed by them picking mostly aspiring director John Gulager to direct the film (""Feast,"" which has since had two sequels by the same team). I say ""supposedly amateur"" because I think all three were working in the business at the time, although none of them had made a full feature film. (Trivia: In season two, they cast Shia LeBouf as the star of a movie that never made it to theatrical release ""The Battle of Shaker Heights,"" but was his first starring role.)""Feast"" was the ONLY of the three films the Weinsteins/Damon partnership ponied up the $1,000,000 for which actually made it into theatrical release, and I own at least one of the follow-ups on Blu-Ray, although I've yet to watch it (missed the one week ""Feast"" was in my local theater, but caught it via Netflix rental, and enjoyed it). For those who don't know, John Gulager's dad, Clu Gulager, is a character-acting icon going back to the early 60's, from mostly TV Westerns and some movies, who I'd seen so many times I knew him well, but didn't make the connection until I saw him on ""Project Greenlight."" At any rate, I actually enjoyed this film more once I realized the writing/directing team behind it, since I was totally aware how tongue-in-cheek it was intended to be, then. Clu Gulager has a small role in the beginning, as in all his son's films, to date, along with Busey. The fact that they had Hasselhoff play an arrogant version of himself was another easy clue.I think it's easy to see Gulager and his buddies are nowhere close to winning any awards. But they make ""fun"" horror movies. That's their genre. These films are NOT to be taken seriously. If you cry at anyone's injury or death in one of these movies, or get seriously offended, well, you've got issues for either watching the film to begin with, or expecting something different.Instant classic lines...Katrina Bowden character, Shelby: ""Josh cut off his penis after something came out of my vagina!""Ving Rhames character, Victoria Lake Sheriff: ""Bring me my legs!"" A movie of this low caliber with Christopher Lloyd, Gary Busey, Ving Rhames, David Hasselhoff and Danielle Pannabaker??? That's a lot of stars (even if most of them don't get much work these days). One bad review said this was a $20 million budget film, but IMDb says it was a $5 million budget, which seems more likely.I wouldn't buy it (unless it's less than $5 and you LOVE this kind of film), but it's worth a rental, which is how I'm currently watching it for the second time, while I listen to the director/writer/producer commentary.So don't expect more (or something different) than it delivers, and ""it's all good,"" as the stoners like to say.Jeff Hayes",Piranha 3DD
154,Princess-D,Disappointing,5,3 June 2012,"We would expect much more exciting and terrifying experience from this sequel. However, after I left from the auditorium I felt that it was not I expected at all. Excitement from the first installment was much more entertaining. The name of the movie ""Piranha 3DD"" might relay the audience to think this film will give you more bloody and disturbing scenes than the first film but is not somewhat related to the story in this sequel at all. If you just wanna see all lady goodies, running around shirtless showing their tits and a few scene of stupid hunger fish Piranhas attacking people then you may consider to see it. One more instruction, if you truly love the first Piranha movie then just don't expect much from this one so you will not disappointed like I am now. Just prepare to see Prometheus would make much more exciting!",Piranha 3DD
155,joe-collins91,Proof that one good bite doesn't necessarily deserve another,5,13 May 2012,"It has to be said- Piranha 3DD is probably the most overrated sequel ever put to film. In fact it is suggestible that Piranha 3DD steals crown from 2010's remake as most overrated summer blockbuster of the 21st century. Maybe its the fact that the studio kept yo-yoing around with release dates or the ratings board making a dogs dinner out of getting it out there, but 3DD definitely held peoples attention in the LOOOONG time it took to get it off the ground and into theaters. This time around instead of artsy French director Alexandra Aja we have gore maestro John Gulager (Feast) in the directors chair and a team of Saw sequel writers drafted in to write the script. Scream queen Danielle Panabaker takes over from Shue as the protagonist and Rhames returns along with Christopher Lloyd and David Hasselhoff (?) for blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameos. The storyline is dumb. Even more dumb than that of the first which told us that fresh water fish have been living in secret underwater caves for millions. This time we are told that the said fish have worked out how to travel through underground sewage systems and into drains and that is exactly what happens. Instead of the lake we have a water park setting called ""Big Wet"" This has to be the most unrealistic water park in the world because the life guards are pole dancers (hence the 3DD joke in the title) Panabaker plays Maddy a marine biologist (oh what a surprise) who has returned to her home town for the summer. Apparently she owns the water park along with her Stepfather who is trying to restore tourism in the town (we are told that the events of Piranha 3D had an adverse effect on the popularity of the lake- are you surprised? no me neither.) Anyways after a few people go missing Maddy suspects that something is wrong and does some nose-poking. Cue piranha-in-your-face scene and soon Maddy comes to the realization that...wait for it...THE PIRANHA ARE BACK! If that isn't bad enough, a creepy Christopher Lloyd calls to inform Maddy that this time the Piranha can travel underground through sewage pipes and will soon work their way into the water park (I'm seriously not making this up) Anyways we soon learn than people have been illegally tampering with the pipes that connect the water park to the lake (how ironic I hear you ask...well blame the writers they came up with this genius idea) and that by the time Maddy gets to the water park the fish carnage has already begun. Here The Hoff makes an appearance and delivers some good satire and he soon gets involved in the chaos though and sort of becomes an anti-hero. Rhames, scarred from his last encounter with the piranha goes all Samuel L Jackson-kick ass but you've already seen the famous hyped up leg rifle scene countless times in the trailers ""bring me my legs!"" so it doesn't really come as a surprise. Rhames is underused here and the scene is pretty mediocre. The funniest scenes takes place no where near the water. Katrina Bowden and Jean-Luc Bilodeau are having sex and a piranha jumps out of her vagina and bites his manhood off (no I'm not making it up this really happens.) Later on in the film Bowden is reminiscent of the event ""Something came out of my vagina and bit Josh's penis off."" This is probably the funniest scene in the whole film but again most of it was featured in the trailer so you already know what is going to happen which is disappointing. Still that one liner had me in stitches.Anyways there are a few gross out gags thrown in and more nudity than you can shake a stick at. The action scenes are great and the piranha look slightly less ropey however the gore is trimmed and diluted (which is disappointing) Panabaker is a decent actress but she is hard to take seriously as a marine biologist/business woman AND heroine. She is expected to carry a film when in reality she is just a moderately good B movie actress. Shue managed to carry Piranha due to her experience as a well respected actress. Panabaker seems uncomfortable and edgy trying to fill those shoes. Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd reprise their roles but between them they probably clock around 60 seconds screen time. More time is given to the Hoff who steals the show entirely but the gimmick is short lived. The rest of the cast scream, splash, get naked and get eaten and there are no stand out performances. It is the writers however who should be hanging their heads with this one. The reason Piranha was so fun was because it didn't take itself seriously. Aja even got Richard Dreyfus to laugh at himself and the seriousness surrounding his Jaws fame, however Piranha 3DD is so aware of the success of the first film that it tries too hard to look good. It's an arrogant film that tries to be better than the original but ultimately falls flat due to too much time spent on trying to make an impossible storyline possible. The acting is pretty atrocious and Gulager seems to have lost his touch. The special effects are still a bit ""meh"" The ending is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen in the theater. A couple of people shook their head and said ""yeah right."" You'll see what I mean. The ending also opens up the door for a second sequel (if they follow the storyline with what happens right at the very end of this then the third Piranha film will be a complete disaster.)By all means go and see it. I know your curiosity will lead you there. Just don't expect anything other than mediocre.",Piranha 3DD

Like honestly how serious can you take a movie with lines like: ""Josh cut off his penis because something came out of my vagina!!"" My one complaint would have to be the running time.

I bought this movie for a dollar from Family Video so I could get the full benefits of a 10 for $10 deal, and soon realized I wanted my dollar back. This movie is very short, which is really the only good thing about it. The plot (if you could call it that), involves piranha that eat pretty much anything and find their way into a adult theme park run by Champ Kind from Anchorman, who manages to play the same character in every film he is in. Almost every girl in this movie has her boobs out, and I began to get the feeling it was written by a couple of 12 year old boys. And then at the end, the fish somehow start learning how to walk and jump high enough to bite an entire little boys head off. Not sure how it managed to get it's mouth big enough to do that, but whatever. Also, they had to throw the Hoff in there. Please just save your money. That's all I can say.",Piranha 3DD

The only saving grace was the presence of a few recognisable faces: Christopher Lloyd, Clu Gulager, Ving Rhames, and yes, The Hoff. He single-handedly dragged the movie from a three or four star rating to a five, and is clearly not afraid to poke a little fun at himself. Also, its always nice to see Katrina Bowden in a bikini. In summary, not a complete waste of time, but save your money, wait for the DVD, and even then you may want to wait until it comes down in price a little.",Piranha 3DD
161,w-patrick-bingham,Horrible excuse for a movie,2,12 May 2012,"Piranha 3DD had all the potential of a sophisticated satire, but fell immensely short. Either the cast, direction, or the script (most likely all three) created a lag in the film. It did not work like the original; the jokes were unfunny, the characters unlikable and the story only so-so. Throughout the film, there were specific scenes that held up to the original Piranha 3D, but those moments were ephemeral at best. As someone who highly anticipated the release of this film, I feel robbed of the joy I expected as this movie showed promise to ensure higher levels of hilarity than the original. The most comparable quality film one can compare this to is Shark Night 3D.",Piranha 3DD

The lame plot line, the stupid scenes that are so impossible and insane to ever believe. This was just a gory skin flick with blood and boobs....so gross and worthless....don't waste your life on this...please...don't!!!! The writers were so intent on creating as much gore as they could that the reality and creativity was at the back door knocking and no one was listening to common sense. If you are looking for gratuitous, ignorant, pointless gore and naked women..this is for you. I can see why David Hasselhoff was in this..it's right up his ally of B rated stupid movies.

164,csariv3080,Oh brother....,2,6 June 2012,"Not a movie that anyone was asking for...Why do they always screw up a decent idea - John Gulgar should be barred from making anymore movies. He really knows how to mess up a horror movie and could they not find any young stars who can act?? Also how can you make a horror movie without any horror - almost the entire final scene was filmed without much Piranha interaction with water park guests. The worst thing had to be Hasselhoff - can you beat a dead horse anymore with the invoke they were trying to make with him. Beyond Stupid! And finally the bloopers at end may have been longer than the actual movie - did they run out of cash? Instead of wasting $ on CGI effects, try doing it old school with an effects artist, as a movie like this could have really benefited from it. Also, check out this awesome video review I found for Piranha 3DD by Sarchons Invade The Movies.....http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTS8EiUpH64This review pretty much hits the nail on this head with this movie.""Sarchons say NO!"" .....Awesome!",Piranha 3DD
165,panosdial,I Expected a horror movie!!,1,23 August 2012,"Well, when I first saw Piranha 3D (the one with my beloved Kelly Brook) I thought 3DD would be equally good (or better). I was wrong. This movie starts as a horror movie (on the first half of it) and then turns into a lousy, gory and bad comedy. They should make a different film. A film that could scare the hell out of you and let you in agony as the Piranha 3D did. There is not much to say about this one. In my opinion, just avoid to lose your 1.5 hours. Do something else instead. I wonder how actors like David Hasselhoff accepted to participate in such a...thing. 1 Out of 10 (since there is not a grading system out of 100, to give it 1/100) ;)",Piranha 3DD

I understand that this movie was supposed to be some sort of parody, but everything was wrong, the acting, the plot and everything else that makes a movie a good movie. I enjoyed the post credit humor, which is the only reason why I gave this movie a rating greater than 1.

A remake you've seen Hollywood poop out several times... A monster comedy about Piranha fish eating up beach spring breakers. I could give you a movie summary and some spoilers but you wont care because I sure as hell didn't. I was so drunk that I honestly don't remember what I was looking at. Me and Rob bought the bud light platinum 12 pack and we had fun, unfortunately the fun stopped once the movie started.It actually was not that bad. Haunting of the innocent holds onto that crown of dust. A bunch of somewhat famous actors accompanied the fish and double D's, ""Christopher Lloyd, David David Hasselhoff, That chick that looked like Emma Watson, and the cowboy from Anchorman."" But they couldn't all save Piranha DD. The laughs we're few, corny jokes, and when you see a horror at the store with Piranha fish on it you know you will have just as much fun watching it like dumping your money into a toilet and watching the money go down the tubes...Mr. Christopher Floyd, you should have more respect for yourself and all the back to the future fans.

170,PimpHandStrong,One of the worst films ever made - and not in a good way,1,12 June 2012,"The first Piranha surprised audiences in 2010 with its wit, over the top nudity, and excessive gore. It never took itself seriously and had a solid cast. This follow-up to the 2010 movie is just honestly embarrassing. It had all the elements that the first movie had, but everything goes horribly wrong with incompetent direction, laughably bad acting and dialogue, and some of the cheapest gore effects I've ever seen.Why is this movie so bad? Let's start with the plot - there is none. If you can buy the premise that piranhas are going to go in underground lakes and somehow end up in a water park swimming, well then I have a bridge to sell you as well. The characters are all terrible. The one couple in the van early on exists only to die, no other purpose, no even attempted development. Yet later we see other characters mourning their disappearance, only it's forgotten 5 minutes later. The one scene that people will probably remember involves a girl that had a piranha swim up her lady parts (and somehow survive) only to bite her boyfriend's penis during intercourse. Trying to be inventive there, but really just shows the lack of any restraint with this movie. But even if you think the plot and acting are atrocious, at least there will be good gore, right? Wrong. The gore effects can be described in one word: cheap. The special effects with the piranhas are terrible too - you wonder where they spent $20 million on this movie. Not to mention, the inevitable massacre scene is shot so poorly that it has zero coherence and lacks any punch. It looks like they just poured some red dye in the pool and hired a few extras to flop around. The massacre scene in the first film had some of the best gore effects I'd ever seen. This is a joke of a follow-up.So which actors disgraced themselves for a paycheck? There is a cameo by David Hasselhoff where he's basically mocking himself, but you have to wonder what is going through his head when his character mutters ""Welcome to rock bottom."" I wonder if the irony is lost on this man. David Koechner is just obnoxious and terrible. Jerry O'Connell played this type of character way better in the first film. Every time Koechner was on screen, I was just wanting him to get killed off already.And also surprisingly, we don't even get any good nudity. All the extras they hired for this movie look like washed up strippers. None of the cute female leads goes topless. Maybe they ran out of budget and couldn't pay them enough to do it.I have a feeling that 95% of the people involved in this film will ever have meaningful work in Hollywood again (thankfully). Don't waste your time.",Piranha 3DD
171,jamesmacleod2010,Piranha 3DD: Good or Bad?,6,9 June 2012,"Let me start by letting you know that i'm a big fan of horror movies and usually I will either love one or hate it. But Piranha 3DD has made me very confused. I loved Piranha. It was funny, scary, and had some nudity but no sex. Piranha 2 is not as funny, not scary, and has tons of nudity and has sex. There is a scene where a couple is having sex in a bed and the girl has a piranha inside her that jumps out of her vagina onto the mans penis causing the man to cut off the organ. There is also tons of breasts and girls crotches. So you know that there is lots of nudity. Moving on, there is a lot of lame jokes but some that will make you laugh. David Hasselhoff is supposed to be the ""comedic character"" but he is just to corny. The stars of the film are Danielle Panabaker, Ving Rhames, Katrina Bowden, Matt Bush, Jean-Luc Bilodeau and Chris Zylka. They all do a pretty good job but Karina Bowden's character just seems to stupid to care if she lives or dies. I noticed though, Jacqueline Maclennes Wood, Elise Neal, Shanica Knowles, and Michael Algieri were not in the movie although their IMDb pages say they were. The gore and blood is decent and the story is good, even though i had hoped it would be about the characters in the first one. As the movie goes on, it gets better in my opinion. Except for the ending. It seems kind of dumb.so I overall give Piranha 3DD a 6/10.",Piranha 3DD
172,Broadbean,"Good for a laugh, familiar faces",7,10 June 2012,"This was more enjoyable than I thought. The acting was not as bad as some of the reviewers say, and for a film that doesn't take itself seriously, neither should you. I actually didn't mind the movie being short, after all it was always hard to stretch the storyline more than an hour.The whole movie was more like a spoof, and somehow I felt Christopher Lloyd, Ving Rhames and of course The Hoff all added to the fun. The Hoff in particular was great. His role really suited him. He also had a bit more screen time than I would've thought.I didn't see this in 3D, and I'm not sure if that would've changed my rating. There was a fair bit of gratuitous nudity, but I suppose the gratuitous gore balances that out.So if you find gratuitous blood, body parts and boobs (and screaming) hilarious, this movie is worth a look over a beer and popcorn. And if you don't like it, it will be over before you know it.",Piranha 3DD

Even though its not a long film, everything moves fast giving plenty of action along the way.Danielle Panabaker is great in the lead role, David Hasslehoff has fun with his cameo and Christopher Llyod laps up his brief screen time.There's a decent amount of blood and gore but definitely nowhere near as much as the first. Also the scale of the film feels so much smaller then the previous entry you start to think that they released the films in the wrong order!!But having said that, the film is such fun, just like the first and there is never a dull moment thrown in with some great laughs :)",Piranha 3DD
174,rmcatalina,Let's Swim With All of Our Clothes On!,1,1 June 2012,"I don't know about you, but I have never seen 20-somethings at any real beach or pool swimming dressed like they were going to a college class. But just as in the original ""Piranha 3D,"" our hero men are fully dressed whenever they're in the water. It's a startling contrast to the treatment of women, who are usually naked or, at most, wearing a skimpy bathing suit. I know the target audience is 19-year-old guys, but I can't believe they'd be squeamish about men being shown in a realistic way. Look at the Hollister Co. website! Even in a bedroom sex scene, the guy's upper body is mostly covered up by a sheet. There is a very brief nude scene with him, but it's more of a flash cut compared to the women's scenes. With ""Piranha 3D"" I speculated the male lead of that film wore a shirt during the big rescue scene because he has a large tattoo on his arm in real life. Maybe that's the case with all of the young male stars today? Now, there is one exception: David Hasselhoff, in a role as a lifeguard, is shown with his shirt off -- but he probably should have left it on. Aside from this strange double standard swimming attire, ""Piranha 3DD"" tells essentially the same story as its predecessor, except with a new cast and more confined location. Aside from a sympathetic performance by Matt Bush, we don't get to know any of these characters well enough to care about them. The script is mostly series of vignettes of characters who just appear, get killed, and we move on to the next random couple. I laughed a few times at some unintentionally funny situations, but there really is no plot, other than the formula that repeats scene after scene. The biggest flaw is opening the show with a summary from the first film. This preempts any kind of mystery element in the first act. I saw this is a major theater on a Friday night...I was the only one in the house. I guess that sums it up best.",Piranha 3DD

The Hoff plays his roll well well he plays himself and Garry Busey played his part well and you get too meet some of the old cast of piranha 3D and they don't disappoint. I do agree that there is some pointless points to the movie i.e. fanny cam etc but in a way it adds to the dark humour of DD lets face it guys the guy that owns the park wanted fish and fish is what he got.

These Piranha films have no pretense about what they are, self-conscious horror-comedy-satire, and they do it very very well in my opinion. Just because a film considers itself satire doesn't mean it works - too often their defense is 'oh you just didn't get it'. Or, maybe, your movie isn't clever or funny. Piranha 3dd was funny - Hasselhoff could've been dull and cringeworthy but they handled him well - I particularly liked his emulation of his own Mitch Buchanan slow-mo scene. Also awesome - Ving Rhames' redemption; the excellent line from the blonde regarding her first extremely violent sexual experience, in fact, that whole scene; hilariously gratuitous breasts; the piranhas themselves; and the brilliant final scene.

183,KiNg_MistAh,Double the D's!,7,2 June 2012,"Piranha 3DD. If that title doesn't even make you smirk, now might be a good time to turn around and head back in the direction you came from. If you go in to this movie expecting an Oscar worthy film of the year with an intricate plot, complex characters and gorgeous cinematography then well...you've clearly made a wrong turn in the movie selection road. This movie isn't some artsy fartsy masterpiece and it doesn't try to be. It knows exactly what it is, so you either roll the punches or get punched in your rolls. This is the kind of movie where you invite over a few drinking buddies, roll up some green stuff, order a pizza and enjoy the show.The movie starts off with an interesting cameo from Gary Busey as a fisherman who finds a dead animal carcass in a lake with one of his fishing pals. It farts out some piranha eggs and the terror begins all over again. Before you even ask, yes, I do know how ridiculous that sounds. It's a setup that is simple enough and no one really cares about the actual reasoning for the Piranha's return, we just want to see the chaos that they cause. Shortly after the eggs are released, Busey and company get gobbled up and Busey does some gobbling of his own. Yeah, that sounds about right, Busey, you rascal you.We are then introduced to the playground for our fishy friends; a newly renovated adult Waterpark owned by the hilarious Chet (David Koechner) and his step-daughter Maddy played by the star of the show Danielle Panabaker. The grand opening for this theme park is just a couple of days away, so the Piranha invitations were perfectly timed. Some other characters invited to the show include a hopelessly geek romantic (Matt Bush), a crooked joint smoking cop (Chris Zylka) and the Hoff himself (David Hasselhoff).Thankfully, we also get a few returning characters from Alexandre Aja's 2010 Piranha film. These characters include Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd) and Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames). Mr.Goodman provides his Piranha expertise and explanations once again to those seeking information on the water predators. Ving Rhames' return is quite the memorable one after his first encounter with the fishies, he now has shotgun stumps and his request for them when needed is incredibly epic ""Bring me my legs"". It's so perfectly timed, I couldn't have said it better myself.Also featured is the beautiful Katrina Bowden, who completely steals the show as the virgin Shelby. From the moment she first goes skinny dipping and a baby piranha enters her body from a southern entrance, you just know it's setting itself up for something great. If you haven't turned your brain off and completely prepared yourself for suspension of belief by now, then you're about to swim in the deep end of trouble for what comes next. The highlight of the movie comes from Katrina's character having sex for the first time while the baby piranha is still in her and let's just say it latches on to the first thing that pokes it's head through her rabbit hole. She then manages to drop one of the greatest lines ever while explaining the entire ordeal to her friends ""Josh cut off his penis because something came out of my vagina!"" It's a sticky (and Bloody) situation but hey, you always remember your first time! If at this point in time you're left scratching your head, thinking who films this stuff? You may not have heard of Piranha 3DD's Director John Gulager, whose previous films include Feast, Feast II: Sloppy Seconds and Feast III: The Happy Finish. Think this stuff is raunchy? Well, that's a series that features mouth banging monsters, naked biker strippers and high flying edible babies. Believe me, I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried.Now it may seem like Piranha 3DD is just going for gross out gags sprinkled with vulgar humour and it is, but there are more layers to the film's flesh. It also features some intense moments of good old fashioned horror. Such is the case in a scene featuring Danielle and Katrina on a dock at the lake. Piranha start jumping out of the water and snapping at them in mid air. Very entertaining with a great amount of suspense, especially when they fall in to the water. As a viewer, you're left screaming at the screen ""Swim dammit, Swim!"" If only there were more scenes like this one to balance everything out.Just like the remake, Piranha 3DD builds up to a final climax of terror. Even though it may not be as satisfying as the previous film's, the Waterpark massacre is highly entertaining. The water turns red, people lose their heads and chunks of flesh are chewed off. All great stuff but it still seems to miss the mark in the gore department. This may have been because of budget restrictions, which is understandable, but it still leaves more to be desired. Also the final bits of piranha chaos seem to finish fairly quickly, just like the entire movie. As it's actually shorter then most movies with a running time of about 70 minutes.The main difference between Piranha 3DD and it's predecessor is the fact that it is a comedy with horror elements, while Piranha 3D was a horror movie with comedy elements. And much like any fish dish, it may not be for everyone. This is not a movie you show your grandparents and if you're a grandparent, this is not a movie you show your grandchildren. Unless of course, gratuitous nudity, vulgar humour and killer fish are their type of thing. At the end of the day though, Piranha 3DD is just a fun movie that with an open mind (and an open bar), it's hard not to enjoy (from land that is...for now).http://str33tjustus.blogspot.ca/",Piranha 3DD

Just watching the film trailer had me interested in the film, Hasslehoffs moobs flying about, added with a ""bring me ma legs"" from Ving Rhames, gave it a spoof like feel to it, mixed in with an adequate half original narrative structure made a good film to pass the time and laugh at with company. Overall, I'd say this film was worth a watch, aslong as you're not expecting a high quality blockbuster, or an interesting in depth film, it's worth a watch just for a laugh, aslong as you don't look too deep into it or pay too much attention to the way too obvious flaws.",Piranha 3DD

190,lucasebaker,CRAP to an EXTREME,2,27 June 2012,"Wow. Just wow. Let me note that I enjoyed the first Piranha, and went into this movie with an open mind (despite horrible reviews). What a absolutely HORRIBLE sequel. The time around, the directors have obviously run out of ideas. It was a sequel to a movie that didn't need a sequel. You can only get about 1 good movie from a concept as simple as piranhas, and that's all but clear, seeing as this movie sucked. First of all, this movie is disgusting. You see a fat mans bloody ass, the tip of a severed penis, gore galore (and not the good kind...the bad overly bloody fake looking kind), and a piranha that swam up a girls v- a-g. At points you could tell the piranha's were puppets, and the puns were cheesy one liners at best. The whole film made me nauseous, and the deaths of several people were fake as fake can be. A guy gets decapitated from a yellow flag ribbon...yah...that's right...a guy's head gets severed (though the neck bone and all), by a piece of plastic that is soft, stretchy, only about 1 nano-meter thick, and not even sharp. There is also a guy who gets skewered through the eye, because of an explosion that caused a trident to have impeccable aim falling from the sky. Also, one of the main characters has enough aim to skewer a bag of chips and a piranha perfectly from a good 20 feet away, which begs the question of how he is a lifeguard. The whole film makes no sense, with a girl who has a seizure while having sex (due to a piranha inside her)only to come back to life once a guy severs his pen!s, and the kick- butt black man from the first movie has a shot gun leg. And finally, the ending sucked to an extreme. The piranhas have now begun to walk (or really hop), at the end, only to cut off the entire head of a really nice innocent kid, just for a cheesy one liner that wasn't even funny. In short, this movie is complete an utter crap. Avoid watching (unless you like stupid, gross, and fake movies).",Piranha 3DD
191,luke_deadspace,Hopefully good,10,11 May 2012,"Honestly I think this Prianha movie will be as good as the first, if you love your blood guts and gore that is. It has all the right features for just a feel good movie, I for one will be booking my ticket! Enjoy the movie! I give this movie a 10-10 because there is no other movie like it, and we need a crazy gore-fest, and now we have just that! If you do not like bloody films with helpless victims and a crazy story line, also lets not forget the hot girls!! I doubt anyone forgets the lesbien scene underwater in the first one, can they top a scene like that in this one? And also from the looks of the trailer they aim to blow the first one out of the water (no pun intended) GO WATCH IT NOW!",Piranha 3DD
192,helen_donaldson1,piranha 3dd,7,11 May 2012,so i was in the pictures going to see piranha 3dd and i wasn't expecting much but it was better then i thought it would be the Hoff is amazing in this film. the humour in this film is much better then the first one but less gore but the 3d effects are great one of the best I've seen. the acting is good but its nothing Oscar type but it shouldn't be if they make another sequel i would be more then happy to see it after the first one and this one.overall a fun movie with lots of humour and great cameos i think you should watch it and just sit back and watch boobs and piranhas in 3d cant wish for more really ;),Piranha 3DD
193,otis-simon92,A masterpiece,10,17 May 2012,"I must admit, that it is very hard to write a review for something this amazing, but I will try my best to express it here.The sequel to the ever so popular ""Piranha 3D"" is back, and my Lord it came back with a vengeance. Returning to the big screen with everything we loved about the first film, but with even more substance thrown in to entice new fans of the series as well as keeping us existing ones impressed.The movie is set 12 months after the tragic events that transpired at Lake Victoria, where at a nearby lake, the first sign of the piranha's return is beckoned upon two unexpected townsfolk, with a disastrous end. Now, by the lake, a new water park called 'Big Wet' is opening up, to uplift the general public who have had a morbid and disconsolate year, and what better way to attract customers than with scantily dressed women? But our main character Maddy, has caught wind of the recent piranha attack, and is in a desperate race against time to stop the piranhas from feasting on the unexpected public. This leads to some edge of your seat moments that leaves you totally immersed.This is the perfect example of how you don't need a complicated plot to make something great. The casting was perfection. It has all of the recognisable faces such as Danielle Panabaker, Matt Bush and Katrina Bowden. And if these names are not making your jaw hit the floor then the two amazing cameos by Christopher Lloyd and David Hasselhoff certainly will. And let us not forget about the various porn stars scattered around in this movie. You would think that porn actresses can't act to save their lives and they are there for fan service, but this movie has removed this ridiculous stereotype. From the beginning you can sense the raw emotion that these girls are portraying in their characters; from the ecstasy of them enjoying the carefree lifestyle working at the water park, to the anguish they must feel when they see on of their own friends attacked by a ruthless and unforgiving piranha.And you may be thinking that this adrenaline rush of a movie won't have any character development, but that's where you're wrong. There is a love triangle in this movie that can give 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' a run for its money. (Google it) The conflicts between Kyle (Chris Zylk) an old flame of Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), and Barry (Matt Bush) a childhood friend who was secretly in love with our protagonist Maddy is electrifying; it is very rare to see this much passion in modern cinema these days and provides an enjoyable side story to go with the already fantastic plot.The visuals in this movie was very simplistic to the point where compared to some other blockbusters out there, it looks like some kid shot it from his blackberry. But this wasn't a bad thing. It shows that the visuals do not need to be excessive, and it proves that you don't need a ridiculous budget to fund flashy FXs to stick in people's mind (Looking at you Avatar). It also doesn't use cheap 3D tricks like a guy sticking his hand towards the screen, but utilises the 3D to truly emerge you into the movie itself. When a piranha jumps out of the water, you can sense the raw ferocity of it as it homes in on its unexpected targets, which could only be provided with the inclusion of 3D.Walking into the cinema screen, I had very low expectations, but this film has done more than just exceeded them, but made me re-evaluate cinema as a medium. While writing this review I was hard pressed as to what score to give this, as a perfect 10 may not give it justice, to what may be one of the most influential movies of our generation.So I'd like to advise all movies goers to grab their jackets, match down to the cinema and watch this masterpiece of a movie known as Piranha 3DD.",Piranha 3DD
194,jhezekia,Sigh what did you expect,1,3 June 2012,"I mean if you expected a fantastic show after seeing the preview. You have got to be kidding me.... Piranha 3DD... could be the title of a soft core porno movie. The first one was OK but this one ...wow... Budget 20,000,000 I wonder what they spent the money on.... I mean the Hoff as a lifeguard in the movie...Really ..!! Come On..!!! And the lack of a story, good acting, poor script, i felt sorry for the actors. I guess one plus is that there were some attractive women..um mm..not really.. I hope this ends the Piranha revival come on Hollywood...!!! You can do better ! I can't even string this review out anymore...what else can i talk about. There's nothing more...... Straight to DVD",Piranha 3DD
195,s_oul_assassin,I used to be a troll like you but then i got a Piranha 3DD to the knee...,10,24 June 2012,"People get trolled everyday over the internet,they get trolled in Facebook,they get trolled in Youtube comments,they get trolled in blogs,some even get trolled from their friends on a skype call..But watching this movie offers you the privilege of being one of the first people that got brutally trolled from the movie industry.Its a start of a new era and i'm proud i was a part of it! (Content in here serve only extra line purposes in order for this review to be submitted,I don't understand why my review has to be consisted of at least 10 lines since there are movies that can be fully described and reviewed in less lines,doesn't make sense but whatever..damn i need a few lines yet well lets see..if trolls lived in the water they would be piranhas and i would be all the victims of piranha 1 and 2 together thats the feeling this movie left me with.i think i'm done with lines)",Piranha 3DD
196,dobr_panev,Waste of time and money,1,3 July 2012,"I cannot believe they could make such a stupid movie! It pretends to have some humor, in fact it is so cynical and ugly! I am wondering who was so stupid to give them the money to make this so called movie? I wasted my time and my girlfriend's time watching it. The characters in the moves were so common and typical for these kind of movies that they look like clichés - the students, the almost mad scientist, the bald owner of the park - they are all taken from the shelves of the movie character store. Stock jokes, nothing unique or smart. Dumb, dumb, dumb and pointless. The grotesque bay watch is also a cliché. In fact everything in this movie. And the idea that we should use only water form the utilities and never use underground water, which is very very dangerous according to the movie is the top of the stupidity. Hope less people will waste their time watching this movie. Walk into nature and have fun instead!",Piranha 3DD
197,james-turner37,FAKE BOOBS=Complete boredom!,1,18 August 2012,"I just watched this piece of crap, I find it terrible. There is no story here, a guy chops his own penis off, with a bunch of fake huge breasts bouncing around, oh wait I mean not bouncing since there all fake.Not that I have a problem with watching beautiful women with nice boobs, but there is a time and place for that.(when I do watch beautiful women I prefer normal natural boobs, not fake garbage)Back in the day when they use to make real and intelligent horror films this boob thing was never a factor. This is my point, why try to sell a film just from a male heterosexual attribute, I find this sexist, and just plain dumb film making. This is not a film, this is just stupid cocky rich kids trying to make a ""movie"" with the backing of a rich arrogant society. Let us not forget the first film was produced by goof ball ""Eli Roth"". Let's also not forget that he came from a rich family from Newton, Massachusetts, born from a Doctor(his father) and lived the high life.Must be nice to have everything given to you on a ""silver platter"", I wish I was that little rich kid.The directors and producers once again just wanted to make money off of a film that is a horror rated version of girls gone wild.In this garbage version, sequel whatever you want to call it has great actors like Christopher Lloyd, Gary Busey, David Hasslhoff, which are all talented actors. Even with the Hoff's recent burger incident he is still a great actor. This film just makes them all look like they are trying to make a buck and not be who they can really be. I feel they are all better than this instead of selling themselves to a horrible accident of a film. This is the only thing horrifying in this film is the fact they tried to plug past great actors to sell the film.Pathetic.The original films were suppose to be taken seriously and not made into a half porno/horror film. This makes me angry, I love the original films, Piranha I&II. I didn't enjoy watching the out takes at the end with the whole idea of making it into some funny joke of a film from the past.(like American Pie)I challenge the real directors and producers out there to make a serious remake, telling the story of Piranha in an intelligent manner, not seeing it from an idiot version giving us a PG Titty rating, with no substance, no storyline.I want to see true science, true palaeontologists facts like the beginning of the first remake. With the prehistoric idea when Christopher Lloyd tells the story of the Piranha. I want to watch this film how it was when it first came out. I wish there was a remake with intelligence out there.Maybe somebody has a brain and uses it to actually make a remake, without turning it into a total Girls Gone Wild horrorfest.Well, in turn this second edition was more pathetic than the first remake. Cashing in on washed up actors. But I sincerely think they are not really washed up, I think that Hollycrap, Sorry I meant Hollywood has no way of producing actual intelligent films. Taking old school popular actors and making them act for this kind of garbage is the true pornographic material that this film represents.I say a -10 out of 10 for me.",Piranha 3DD
198,entropicchaos,Not really disappointing.,1,5 August 2012,"It was not really disappointing. Because I did see the last one. I knew that it wouldn't be serious. But still, I reward it with to lowest score possible!The good: -Hot ladies. -I almost laughed two times.The bad: -The story. -The dialog. -Jokes being not funny, so I just almost laugh two times. -The STUPID STUPID STUPID reasoning of the main characters. The same kind of reasoning that, in other movies, makes people go alone in to the dark scary woods where they do KNOW that death and dangers lurks. -Overall completely devoid of all kind of sense and logic. Many times I have seen bad movies with friends. More often then not, I'd be the one saying, after the movie is finished, that it wasn't THAT bad, that it's actually okay, being that it didn't aim for the academy awards anyways. But THIS is without doubt the worst movie I've seen. Ever. Still, I wouldn't say I was disappointed, I knew it would be bad, and I was mostly annoyed. Annoyed in a way that made me want to run at super speed, jump to the rooftop of the tallest building in the vicinity and cry out in booming voice loud enough to make the surrounding ground and people around tremble as I uttered the words: ""Oh MY FU**ING GOD!!""But of course that's not possible, no more than it's possible that I will ever see this movie again.",Piranha 3DD
199,edwood6795,geezus,1,21 October 2014,at the top you will see a caption that says goofs. and there is like only 2 or 3 captions this whole movie was a goof. and whoever made this movie was a goof and owes me my rental money back....and if you say this movie is great you are a goof.......I mean the first one in the series was bad enough...even Hasslehoff kept making references throughout the whole film like' if this film gets out i'm ruined thats pretty bad even when he thinks its a goof ;dont be a goof and like this film because it looks like it costed 75 cents to make it....this wont even make a cult classic in years to come .it is films like this that ruin actors such as Ving Rhames he must have been hard up for money ..if i were these actors I would try and buy up every copy to save myself the embarrassment,Piranha 3DD
200,pcgneurotic,A Tonal 180 from the 2010 Remake,3,4 July 2017,"In comparison to the 2010 remake starring Elizabeth Shue, this is a very different beast. That film was an earnest effort. For better or for worse, the 2010 Piranha, for all its flaws and moments of greatness, was a reasonably taut, thrilling story. You could play it with Lake Placid and Anaconda, and have a trio of aquatic monster flicks that took themselves reasonably seriously, and were all the better for it.But Piranha 3DD makes a seriously jarring tonal change into frat-boy, gross-out farce. I won't spoil any of the gags here for the sake of making my point, but man, are they ever base. No class at all. This is a YouTube 'funny' pranks video-with-horror that veers from moment to moment between trying to carry on the story of the 2010 remake, and being a 'Haw-haw! Ya spilled yer popcorn ya big dummy!' face-palmer. The surprise-star cameo opener that apes the clever Richard Dreyfus turn in the previous film here becomes a fart joke (literally), and what would have also been a cool David Hasselhoff cameo in the 2010 film is here a long, drawn-out squeezing of many old, old jokes. (The Hoff is still brilliant though). Happily, Christopher Lloyd returns to push the plot forwards a wee bit, and is just as brilliant as he is in everything he does.But perhaps nowhere is the confusing clash of directions in Piranha 3DD more evident than in the casting of Danielle Panabaker -- she's so good in all of her scenes that her very presence gives the lie to the film's real intentions. It's like watching an actor's performance in one film being CGI'd into something else entirely, and one can easily imagine that she was pitched this role as being something totally different to what was actually made around her. Ving Rhames, reprising his part from the previous film, also heavily gives the lie to the whole film, with his character being firmly shoved into the realm of comedy nonsense. And again, for those of you who enjoyed the 2010 Piranha, his characterisation here makes no sense.In short, although Piranha 3DD is billed as a ""horror comedy"", and although one really shouldn't be surprised by a film that uses a comedy bra size joke in its title, I personally found it to be a huge disappointment as a follow-up to the previous entry in the series, and a film that even in its own right is a confused, rambling mess.",Piranha 3DD
201,sexgoose,OK but what the hell,7,22 September 2017,"this is quite possibly the weirdest movie in history. boobs, crazy evil fish things that walk, the guy from back to the future? intensely woven through with strange characters and abysmally-written dialogue, this movie is a right hoot if i ever did see one. bring in the hasslehoff story line, the underground bootlegging business and the variety of love stories, as well as however people are reacting in this weird death pool, i rate this movie highly only because it is possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen.",Piranha 3DD
202,gregfindlay2004,Not a great film but stupid fun,4,2 March 2013,"Do you like Boobs ? (That should really be BOOBS ! ) Do you like bad GCI ? Do you have the sense of humour of a 12 year old ? Then this is the film for you ! As a comedy , there are some very amusing bits and I found my self laughing more than I thought I would, There is also some humour that missed the mark for me as well and that's fine cause I am not the target audience..as a horror , Fake looking rubber fish and ropey CGI add to the campy nature and feel of the film. Christopher Loyd is a Intense as a Mad Doctor Ving Rahmes who was in the first Piranha remake has a great bit part in this where he goes all planet terror with metal shot gun legs ( having had his legs eaten by the pesky fish the first time out). The Hoff is awesome too ! An hour and a half of mindless pap with so many plot holes that you wonder why the bothered with the pretence of a story I watched this in 2D and it suffered because a lot of the jumps were obviously made for 3D.which makes for a great film to watch with a hang over as there is zero thinking to do",Piranha 3DD
