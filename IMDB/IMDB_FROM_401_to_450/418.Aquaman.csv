0,bkoganbing,"Lying there Under, under the sea",7,21 April 2019,"Aquaman of DC comics finally gets his top billing in a film as the nicely put together Jason Momoa plays the title role in this science fiction epic. Already a
sequel is in the works, in fact this film ends on an uncertain note setting up the
story line for the sequel.Lighthouse keeper Temura Morrison finds a woman with a trident on his beach
and takes her in. Nicole Kidman is the woman and she's the queen of the under
sea kingdom of Atlantis and she's running away from all that. The two fall in
love and have a kid who grows up to be Jason Momoa.But before that some Atlantian warriors show up and try to kidnap Kidman.
They're all killed, but Kidman decides to go back lest more come and harm her
son.One would have to be blind not to miss the parallels between the story of the
Sword And The Stone and Aquaman. Momoa's earth name is Arthur Curry for
that matter. Now all grown up and quite fit and cut he's summoned to Atlantis to claim the crown. But first he has to find a magical trident stuck in a rock
somewhere in the sea. Can it get plainer than that.Aquaman also has a surface enemy in the son of a pirate whose father he killed
when they were capturing a submarine.I did like the computer graphic special effects.used and loved the fantasy sea
world that was created.I can hardly wait for the sequel.",Aquaman
1,Leofwine_draca,Indifferent,5,12 January 2020,"AQUAMAN is the latest superhero blockbuster from DC Comics and a surprisingly lacklustre affair. It's not particularly awful, it's just that I felt indifferent towards it, particularly with a hackneyed storyline that goes through all of the motions without ever offering much in the way of originality or innovation. Jason Momoa is a likeable presence as the big bear-like hero of the piece, but the undersea kingdom material feels more than a little silly and it doesn't help that established stars like Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson and Dolph Lundgren all look ridiculous in their costumes. An inflated running time and juvenile script had me feeling like this was a NEMO sequel at times, and it all ends in a climax that just goes for CGI effect after CGI effect, ad nauseum. Try harder, guys...",Aquaman
2,SnoopyStyle,CGI extravaganza,7,8 March 2019,"In 1985, lighthouse keeper Tom Curry rescues a woman from the stormy sea. She's Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), The Queen of Atlantis. They have a son together named Arthur. In order to keep him safe, she leaves them for Atlantis where she is forced to marry another. Her advisor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) is tasked to train Arthur. In the present, Arthur is Aquaman (Jason Momoa), a Justice League hero. In rescuing a Russian sub, he leaves a pirate to his death giving his son David Kane reason to seek revenge as Black Manta. Mera (Amber Heard) informs Arthur about an impending invasion by Atlantian forces led by Orm (Patrick Wilson). Orm is Arthur's younger half-brother. Atlanna has been executed to the creatures of the Trench. As the eldest son of Atlanna, Arthur has more claim to the throne.Director James Wan delivers a CGI extravaganza. The level of difficulty is high and he mostly clears it. I would have liked more space for some of the scenes to breathe. The movie is like a freight train without brakes. I need more moments in first gear to admire the sceneries and enjoy the humor. The pee joke is funny. The movie needs some calmer scenes to build good chemistry and do character work. I love the crazy war-crabs but it's sensory overload. The first speed bump occurs when Aquaman challenges Orm to a fight in the Thunderdome. It would have been more reasonable for Mera to bring Arthur to her father only to be ambushed by a double-crossing Orm. It would serve the same purpose without doing a big coliseum gladiator fight. It would also make Orm more underhanded evil. As for the creatures from The Trench, I would have preferred diplomacy instead of another fight. I expected a smarter twist where the monsters turn out to be intelligent. This is a good rebound from the lows of the DCEU although I hope the franchise can do more character work and less CGI fights. There is too much of a good thing.",Aquaman
3,boblipton,My Father Was The Keeper Of The Eddystone Light,5,28 November 2020,"More than half a century ago, I was a Marvel comics fan during the Silver Age. One of the reasons I enjoyed them was the fact that amidst the planet-eating villains, there were superheroes with some human problems. Stan Lee may not have been the great writer he had once hoped to be, but he infused his characters with issues that at least symbolically attacked reality. Thus, the Fantastic Four dealt with family issues, the Hulk with anger management, and Peter Parker had all the problems of a teenager except acne.The DC extended universe, to give it its formal name, under the influence of Zack Snyder, seems to have concentrated on angst. While this has its uses, anger in its various forms does not lead to good solutions; for an audience of teenagers, this might work, but these comic-book movies appeal to alte kokkes like me, too. Thus the recent success of SHAZAM: some jokes, some nice symbolism, some reference to things that showed up in the comics when I was a kid.I did not see AQUAMAN in a theater. I had grown tired of the standard DC movie, but waited until it showed up on my TV. I regret this mildly. It is visually opulent, with the underseas segments beautifully decorated, lit and shot. clearly they would have shown well on a big screen. However, for much of it it consisted of men and women in costumes that would baffle a Halloween parade, slamming each other against hard surfaces and reacting less than I would stubbing a toe. If you cut me, do I not bleed? Yes I do. Not these fellows. Others may cheer these events, but for me, risk and reward must be balanced.Well, I've seen it now, and it's certainly watchable, if you like to watch these things, with the sort of cast that only sackloads of money can buy. But I won't be looking at it again.",Aquaman
4,Prismark10,King Arthur,6,25 January 2019,"DC have learned to make their films bold, brash and colourful. Audiences do not want dark, moody superheroes. It might work on the Dark Knight but we want Superman to be well super.Aquaman is enjoyable enough nonsense. It has similarities with Black Panther as well as elements of Thor and King Arthur. It injects fun as long as you do not take it all seriously.The movie begins with a lighthouse keeper, Tom Curry rescuing Princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) from the underwater realm of Atlantis.Two worlds collide, they fall in love and have a baby boy. Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) lives with his father in a small fishing coast. His mother was snatched back to Atlantis when he was a child.Vulko (Willem Dafoe) came from the watery world to mentor and teach Arthur about his heritage and combat skills. Aquaman uses his powers to save people in the land world.Mera (Amber Heard) tells that Arthur that he must fulfil his right to be the heir to one of the underwater kingdoms of Atlantis, even though he is a half breed. His half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is dangerous and plans to destroy the land world.Orm is in cahoots with Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who launches a submarine attack on Atlantis, giving Orm an excuse to go to war. Black Manta also has his own reasons to kill Aquaman.However Aquaman in order to be the rightful king, must find a legendary trident once forged by Poseidon. His sword in the stone.Jason Momoa is a limited actor. He is here for his muscles and some light hearted quips. Amber Heard is suitably sexy, Dolph Lundgren has a lot of screen time. Patrick Wilson is not a delicious villain in the mould of Loki.There are a lot of action scenes, some of it is well realised. James Wan has done a good job in pulling off this film. It is overlong but at least it did not end up in a watery grave.",Aquaman
5,claudio_carvalho,A Great Adventure,8,31 March 2019,"""Aquaman"" is a great adventure of Marvel, with Jason Momoa in the lead role and directed by James Wan. The film works and is supported by great cast and special effects. James Wan shifts from horror genre and makes a good adventure film. Names such as Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren support this great production with the gorgeous Amber Heard. Looking forward for the sequel. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Aquaman""",Aquaman
6,nogodnomasters,Does not play well with others.,8,29 December 2018,"May have plot spoilers.The film gives us the origins of Aquaman, who talks to fish, sort of like a parseltongue, except for fish and sea mammals which are different, but not in this story. Arthur/Aquaman's (Jason Momoa) first foe is Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II ) and then his half-brother King and then everyone except Amber Heard.Now Arthur cannot become King until he either pulls the sword from the stone or the lost Trident from King Atlan. This isn't any Trident. It is made will Posiden steel and has a genuine Corinthian leather grip. The script raised some questions. Why is Aquaman desperately hanging on to the edge of a roof when he can jump out of a perfectly good airplane without a parachute? And why would he take a slow-moving fishing boat anywhere? They attempted to make Amber Heard's first time on the surface cute but not clever. Are Atlantians the only sea mammals that never have to breathe air?I couldn't help but think of Avatar...this needs a 3D IMAX. Superman does not die in the end.Guide: language was a little salty.",Aquaman
7,kosmasp,Fluid,7,7 May 2019,"Is DC getting their mojo back? Did they lose it? Or was it just the overall power of Marvel that just seemed to squash DC? With James Wan at the helm who got famous with being one of the minds behind the Saw franchise (one of the most important ones that is), there is experience at the helm. And he really brings a lot of humor into it - like the bar scene which goes against what people would expect from that.But for every scene like that, you also have a scene with one of the movies villains who is so over the top, you would suspect him to be comical (no pun intended), but he is dead serious. Shame for missing out on something that could have been really great. Jason Momoa on the other hand is having a lot of fun. And all the cast is having a lot of fun (maybe even the crazy villain in between takes, definitely not on camera). A lof women (and some men) will love this regardless of story, just being visually ""attracted"" to it and that is ok. For everyone else, you can have fun with this if you don't overthink it",Aquaman
8,classicsoncall,"""Legend has it that one day... a new king will come.""",8,29 December 2018,"The movie is visually impressive, I'll give it that. The underwater battle scene with opposing sides on sea horses and sharks was exceptionally well done. Story wise, though, it was fairly formulaic, and quite honestly, after about the first hour or so, I started getting bored with it. The dialog in particular was rather mundane for such a high profile movie coming out of the DC Comics universe. When Aquaman's (Jason Momoa) response to one of his beleaguered foes, (can't even remember who that was now), was 'Screw you!"", I could only groan in embarrassment. This is not what I expected to be coming from the mouth of the future King of Atlantis.I thought Jason Momoa was a very good choice for the Aquaman role. He has a regal bearing even before his destiny is revealed and I think he's a credit to the DC universe. Maybe it was Amber Heard's brilliantly rendered red hair, but I couldn't warm up to her character as Mera, Aquaman's future queen. The rest of the A-list cast was generally OK, although personally, I don't think Nicole Kidman should come anywhere near super-hero movies based on comic books.Though my rating of the movie is favorably high, it's all due to the cinematography and capable CGI utilized by the film makers. The after credits sequence sets up the sequel with Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who didn't impress me this time around as the second tier villain behind King Orm (Patrick Wilson). His look was kind of cheesy and too cartoony for my tastes, perhaps a bad harbinger for the follow up Aquaman flick.As an aside, I couldn't get over the huge amount of one line reviews this picture has here on IMDb since it came out. They really offer nothing in the way of an individual writer's support or distaste for the movie other than to say they like it or hated it. Could do that in a tweet. I guess that says I'm in favor of going back to the ten line requirement that IMDb used to have.",Aquaman
9,jboothmillard,Aquaman,6,20 December 2018,"We first saw the popular DC Comics character when he joined the team in Justice League, this was the first full-length centred around him, and the sixth entry in the DC Extended Universe, which has been a mixed bag, I hoped for some improvement, directed by James Wan (Saw, Insidious, The Conjuring). Basically in Maine, lighthouse keeper Thomas ""Tom"" Curry (Temuera Morrison) rescues princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) from the underwater nation of Atlantis during a storm. She stays on land, they fall in love and have a son, Arthur (Kaan Guldur and Otis Dhanji), who is born with the power to communicate with marine lifeforms. Atlanna is forced to abandon her family and return to Atlantis, she gives her loyal advisor Nuidis Vulko (Willem Dafoe) the mission to train Arthur. With his guidance, Arthur becomes a skilled warrior but is rejected by the Atlanteans for being a half-breed and ultimately leaves Atlantis behind. One year after Steppenwolf's invasion, Arthur (Jason Momoa) confronts a group of pirates attempting to hijack a nuclear submarine. Their leader, Jesse Kane (Michael Beach), is trapped under rubble during the confrontation, he forces his son David (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) to leave him behind to drown, David vows revenge against Arthur. David later targets Atlantis at the behest of King Orm (Patrick Wilson), Arthur's younger half-brother and ruler of Atlantis who plans to declare war on the surface. King Nereus of Xebel (Dolph Lundgren) swears allegiance to Orm's cause, but his daughter Mera (Amber Heard), who is betrothed to Orm, refuses to aide them and journeys to the surface to ask Arthur for help, she earns his trust by saving Thomas from a tidal wave sent by Orm. Arthur reluctantly accompanies Mera to a rendezvous with Vulko, he says if he can find the Trident of Atlan, a magic artifact that once belonged to Atlantis' first ruler, he will reclaim his rightful place as king. They are ambushed by Orm's men and Mera and Vulko escape, while Arthur is captured, Orm visits Arthur in captivity and tells him Atlanna was executed for the crime of having a half-breed son, he blames Arthur and the surface for her death. Orm offers Arthur an opportunity to leave forever, but Arthur instead challenges him to a duel in a ring of underwater lava, Orm has the upper hand, but Arthur is rescued by Mera. Together, Arthur and Mera journey to the Sahara Desert to find information about the trident, a holographic message found in a chamber beneath the desert leads them to Sicily, where they retrieve the trident's coordinates. Meanwhile, Orm provides David with Atlantean armour and weaponry and sends him to stop them, he imprisons Vulko after learning of his betrayal, and coerces the remaining kingdoms of Atlantis to pledge allegiance to him and his campaign against the surface. In Sicily, David, now calling himself Black Manta, ambushes Arthur and Mera and injures Arthur before falling off a cliff to his apparent death. Mera nurses Arthur's wounds as they journey to find the trident, she encourages him to embrace his destiny as a hero. Arriving at their destination, Arthur and Mera are attacked by amphibious monsters known as The Trench, they manage to fend them off and enter a wormhole that transports them to an uncharted sea located at the centre of the Earth. They Arthur is shocked to be reunited with Atlanna, she was sacrificed to the Trench for her crimes, but she escaped them and reached the uncharted sea, where she has been stranded ever since. Arthur must face mythical leviathan Karathen (Dame Julie Andrews), who guards the trident, he voices his determination to protect both Atlantis and the surface, proves his worth and is able to reclaim the trident, which grants him control over the seven seas. Arthur, Mera, and Atlanna lead an army of marine creatures in battle against Orm and his followers, it is after learning that Arthur wields the trident and is the true king that the followers renounce their obedience to Orm. Arthur defeats Orm in combat but chooses to spare his half-brother's life, Orm accepts his fate after seeing that Arthur has found and rescued their mother. Atlanna returns to the surface to reunite with Thomas while Arthur ascends to the throne with Mera by his side. During the credits, Black Manta is rescued by Dr. Stephen Shin (Randall Park), he agrees to take the scientist obsessed with finding Atlantis to the underwater kingdom in exchange for his help in his revenge on Arthur. Also starring Ludi Lin as Captain Murk, Graham McTavish as King Atlan, Leigh Whannell as Cargo Pilot, John Rhys-Davies as the voice of the Brine King and Djimon Hounsou as the voice of King Ricou. Momoa does a great job as the charismatic Atlantean prince who has a destiny, Heard is compelling as his sexy red-head sidekick, Wilson is rather stiff as the villain, Kidman is really likeable, and Lundgren does alright as well. I will admit most of the dialogue is cheesy, it is ridiculous at times, and it is perhaps a little too long, but the special effects going underwater and on land are brilliant, and the fast-paced fight and explosive sequences are engaging, it is fun to watch, a worthwhile superhero action adventure. Good!",Aquaman
10,BA_Harrison,Water load of fun.,8,7 April 2019,"Okay, I definitely could have done without the octopus playing the drums, but Aquaman isn't the dud that many claim it to be. It's certainly better than many of DC's dark and dreary superhero movies, a visually impressive treat for the eyes (and I'm not just talking about Amber Heard in her green skintight costume!) and, ignoring a few contrived plot details, a hugely entertaining romp.Director James Wan has created a DC movie that, for once, looks and feels like a comic-book come to life, with jaw-dropping production design and dazzling neon coloured imagery that is breathtakingly beautiful. The story is clichéd baddies versus goodies nonsense, but I think that's the point: this is intended to be brainless fun without all the emotional intensity and gloominess that made Nolan's Batman films such a bore. It's got Willem Dafoe riding a shark, for Christ's sake - it's not meant to be taken seriously.Jason Momoa plays Arthur, son of a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison) and the Queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman). When he grows up, Arthur is convinced by stunning redhead Atlantean Mera (Heard) to claim his rightful place as king of Atlantis in order to prevent a battle between the sea folk and the land dwellers. Unfortunately, his half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is intent on war...At almost two and a half hours long, this could have easily run out of steam, but Wan keeps things moving at a lick, introducing more and more bonkers action, building to a climactic war between an army of talking crustaceans and the shark-riding Atlanteans, with Momoa joining in the fun atop a massive monster from the depths. Oh, and Nicole Kidman spends twenty years in Jurassic Park at the centre of the Earth! It's all so gloriously daft, and so stunningly rendered that I couldn't help but enjoy myself.The film does overstep the mark occasionally, with some the humour falling flat, and I struggle to believe that a) Aquaman and Mera would bring a seemingly insignificant bottle with them to Sicily, and b) the statue designed to hold the bottle is conveniently still standing intact in the same place after thousands of years, but these are minor niggles in a movie that hits more than it misses.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for scorching redhead Heard.",Aquaman
11,paul_haakonsen,This was rather impressive...,8,28 January 2019,"Alright, well for starters I must state that I am not one overly keen on watching superhero movies, because they all just seem to follow the same doctrine and blueprint. But I was forced into watching the 2018 DC ""Aquaman"" movie together with my family.And it turns out that it was actually a good thing that I was forced to watch it. Because it turned out that ""Aquaman"" was actually one of the better superhero movies that have been made. Not that I am in anyway familiar with the backstory of the character and haven't read the comic books or anything.Initially I was a little bit hesitant about the movie, but it turns out that director James Wan actually managed to turn the written material of David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, Will Beall and Geoff Johns into something truly entertaining and enjoyable. The movie was driven by a good story, where one quickly and easily got submerged, no pun intended, into the setting and into the ongoings on the screen. Plus it was also a plus that it had some rather interesting characters in it to help it along as well. Needless to say that the CGI and special effects also had a major role in making it a visually astounding and enjoyable movie.Now, normally I am not much fan of Jason Momoa, but I must admit that he really carried himself formidably in this movie and he really owned up to the responsibility of playing Aquaman - although I have no idea how much pressure would be on him to play that character. But he did it phenomenally in my opinion, regardless. It was of course a treat to see Willem Dafoe in the movie, despite it being somewhat disturbing and unsettling to see him made young and vigorous. Patrick Wilson actually was so well-cast for the role he had in the movie, and he brought so much grace, charm and wits to that dark character. I had initially not thought he would be up to the task, but he proved me so wrong. Then you have the likes of Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren whom also actually were fun to watch in the movie, despite them not having an abundance of screen time.The pacing to the movie was fast and upbeat, and the movie kicked off into a high octane speed right from the very beginning and it never really slowed down. Which was a very impressive accomplishment in my opinion, and it really made the movie all the more intense and enjoyable to sit through.As for the special effects and CGI. Well, there is just really just a single word necessary to summarize the entire movie. And that word is: wow! Are you kidding me, this movie takes you in for a tour de force and really showcases some rather impressive feats and accomplishments in the visual department and also in the audio department. Prepare to be blown away.With that being said, the movie is not at all flawless. Personally I found it a bitter pill to swallow the whole thing about the Secret Sea and what was going on there. It was just too far out there for my liking. And also the fact that all the marvelous, magnificent, malignant and spectacular aquatic creatures, vehicles and settlements have remained from the humans living on the surface is just beyond me. It makes absolutely no sense at all.Now, I was praising the CGI and visual effects just before. There were some scenes when we have the characters floating around and supposed to be appearing as if they are submerged and underwater, it just came off as being ridiculously fake to look at. That was a shame, because the rest of the 95% of special effects and CGI in the movie was just spot on.If you enjoy superhero movies. Wait, let me rephrase that. Even if you have no particular interest in superhero movies, then you should actually take the time to sit down and watch the 2018 ""Aquaman"" movie. It is definitely well worth the time, effort and money.",Aquaman
12,tavm,Aquaman was quite a thrilling DC superhero movie!,8,17 January 2019,"I first knew of Aquaman as a kid of the '70s when watching him in the animated series ""Superfriends"" when he was teamed with his more-established mates of Superman, Wonder Woman, and the team of Batman & Robin. There, he was clean shaven and had blond hair. He was also bland as were the other heroes considering they were on Saturday morning which were mostly kid shows at the time. Here, he has a beard and has much darker hair. He also has something of an attitude which is refreshing to see! But he's very much the good guy and he has many great adventures here. Jason Momoa is aces in the role and it's also nice seeing that guy who was Green Goblin in the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man film (Willem Dafoe) play someone more sympathetic here. In summary, Aquaman has such a fine story and great action set pieces, that I heartily recommend it!",Aquaman

After losing a duel to the ambitious king he, and ""Princess Mera"" (Amber Heard) must track down an all-powerful trident that might manage to unite all Atlantians and avert this terrible war. I have to say it's a terrifically good looking film - the computer imagery folks have worked wonders with the colours, light and visual effects - including an incredibly powerful steam iron gizmo that can zap an entire mountain - but otherwise it's all a pretty derivative fantasy action adventure with precious little to recommend or distinguish it. Momoa has all the charisma of a wet lettuce, Heard and Wilson spend far too long on some seriously long, overly theatrical combat scenes that are clearly meant to imply they are floating (rather than swinging from a wire in front of a green screen) and Willem Dafoe looks like, well, a fish out of water.

For many decades Warner's prophetic prognosticators have warned Earthlings about their upcoming Calamities, Catastrophes, Cataclysms, and Apocalypti. AQUAMAN is one of Warner's most urgent such warnings in the History of Time, as it deals with ""the Wrath of the Seven Seas"" being unleashed upon you land lubbers.

18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Dives in head first but doesn't go off the deep end,8,16 December 2018,"While Arthur(Momoa, charming) has known since childhood that he is Prince of Atlantis, he's been reluctant to claim the title and has instead stayed on land. However, when his half-brother Orm(Wilson, really committing to the role) threatens war on the surface world, which could kill millions of people, he has to embrace his nature. The only way for him to succeed is to work with Mera(Heard, her cynicism a cover for a sweetness and willingness to sacrifice herself), despite not getting along with each other, and neither of them having faith in him.This is entirely unashamed of itself. It is proudly and decisively going all out. I'm not going to claim that everyone who criticised it either ""don't get it"" or don't at all have a point that its tone vacillates awkwardly between different ones, such as Lord of the Rings epic and cartoony comic book. Your mileage may vary. For me, it grabbed me from frame one and I was with it all the way through. It's so infectiously in love with its world, which really is unlike anything seen recently in movies from Marvel or DC. I'm not sure of when there last was a picture like this that didn't get a lot wrong. There is a lot of mythology at play here. Thought this was about a single nation of the Sea? Wrong. There are seven. Those clips of a massive battle in the trailers? It's freaking amazing. And I would have to strongly disagree with those who say it goes on for too long. This has the best action scenes I've seen since Infinity War(no, course it doesn't top that, how could it possibly?). They are easy to follow, the camera moves to take in the scope and keep the energy up, they are varied and distinct from each other, and they take advantage of the cool concepts at play here: dozens, maybe a hundred, underwater creatures utilised for transport and attack, as well as plasma guns and other futuristic tech. Although this film doesn't top Wonder Woman in every way, it's definitely in the top two. Warner Brothers: put as much of this franchise in the hands of Patty Jenkins and James Wan, and the DCEU will thrive.There is a lot of sci-fi violence, some disturbing content, and a little strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone who likes superheroes. 8/10",Aquaman
19,AlsExGal,The whole movie felt loud and relentless and so long,5,5 January 2019,"There was embarrassing writing, embarrassing acting, and listening to Amber Heard trying to deliver this terrible dialogue with zero inflection was exhausting. Why does half of the population of Atlantis sound like they're from California? The dialogue was never more than cliche with a predictable plot. The ""advanced ancient civilization hidden away from the world"" trope is already old. There was so much CGI that none of the action ever felt impressive or tense or real. Any time someone said ""Ocean Master"" with a straight face I wanted to laugh.This would've been the perfect movie to not take itself too seriously, go for a more lighthearted and irreverent tone like Thor Ragnarok, but they just try so hard. It has none of the superhero charm that Marvel manages to carry over from the comics and thus you have one very long boring slog.How many scenes did we need where a quiet moment was interrupted by an exploding wall that didn't hurt anybody? I counted three or four. Also, that paint-by-numbers forced romance - ""Wow there was a surprise and now we're accidentally holding hands"", ""Wow there was an explosion or something and I grabbed you "" - give me a break. And whoever put together the soundtrack for this film should be summarily executed.",Aquaman
20,ferguson-6,a swim through comic book mythology,7,14 December 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. Were the TV series ""Entourage"" still on the air, they would now need a new recurring punchline. The AQUAMAN movie is real! At the helm, we are surprised to find the master of horror, James Wan, in the director's seat. Mr. Wan is known for such genre flicks as SAW, INSIDIOUS, and THE CONJURING, and his talent for visuals transfers well to the comic book style. In fact, with a run time of almost 2 ½ hours, the visual effects are both exhilarating and exhausting.Sure, we've seen short bursts of Jason Momoa as Aquaman in a couple of previous DC movies, but this time he owns the pool. Momoa plays Arthur Curry as a hunky beer-chugging rock and roll party dude who just happens to talk to fish and breathe underwater. Since it's the first Aquaman movie, writers David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (ORPHAN) and Will Beall (GANGSTER SQUAD) provide us the backstory.On the coast of Maine in 1985, a lighthouse attendant named Tom Curry (played by Temuera Morrison) discovers Princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) washed ashore. What follows is a whirlwind romance, the birth of their son Arthur, Nicole snacking on a goldfish, as well as her first kick-ass action fight scene. To protect her son, she agrees to head back to Atlantis where she faces the consequences of birthing a half-breed with a landlubber.When we first see a grown Arthur - with a classic hair flip - he is thwarting the hijacking of a Russian submarine by Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and his father (Michael Beach, IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK). Manta is one of the two main villains - the other being Orm (Patrick Wilson), Arthur's war-mongering, power-thirsty half-brother. Sharing a common enemy, Orm enlists Manta and provides a highly-advanced weapon that, for some unfathomable reason, Manta begins (via montage) to 'Iron-Man' it to another level - one much less stable. It's Orm who gets much more screen time as he plots a massive attack on surface dwellers (humans) who have been destroying the sea for years. You didn't think Hollywood would miss a chance to tell us how despicable we are, did you?The basic story is that Orm must defeat Aquaman to claim the throne and become Master of the Sea. Of course, Arthur is reluctant to get involved and only does so at the urging of his old mentor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and Mera (Amber Heard), both of whom wish to avoid a war with humans. The first battle of the would-be kings takes place in The Ring of Fire, a royal battleground missing only the accompaniment of Johnny Cash. The duel ends prematurely, so that an epic battle can later serve as the film's epic climax.Although director Wan may throw a bit too much 'plot' and action at the proverbial wall, it is interesting to note the history/mythology associated with Atlantis, the ruling class, and the missing trident. The legends are fascinating and the journey takes us to all ends (and depths) of the globe ... from the deepest seas to the middle of the Sahara Desert (itself once a sea) to the incredible core of the Earth. We see the ancient ruins, as well as the high-tech futurama Atlantis ... and it's all stunning to watch.Don't tell Marvel, but the film is somewhat a blend of BLACK PANTHER and THOR, and Momoa is every bit the Aquaman that Chris Hemsworth is Thor (quite a compliment). Yes, we find out that Atlantis, like our dry land world, is burdened with politics and power-hungry types, but the underwater world and the visual effects keep us mesmerized. We see terrific dragon-like sea horses, a drumming octopus, and a Kraken-like creature supposedly voiced by Julie Andrews (fact or fiction?). There is an early sequence that takes swimming with dolphins to a level you didn't experience on your vacation, and the lighting effects at times recall TRON and can be a bit disorienting.This is probably the largest scale DC movie to date, and director Wan chooses to make a splash with every element - character, mythology, setting, and effects. We also get appearances from Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as a TV talking head/oceanographer making the case that Atlantis is real and a threat. We even get Roy Orbison singing ""She's a Mystery to Me"", and the IMAX aspect ratio makes the first ever over-the-top underwater spectacle. And what a spectacle it is.",Aquaman
21,phd_travel,"Simply the best, better than all the rest",10,7 January 2019,A more perfect cast couldn't have been put together for this movie. Amber Heard is the most beautiful creature on land or in the sea. Even with orange hair or wet hair she is so stunning that she eclipses all the action going on around her. Her character Mera is no damsel in distress either. So happy she finally has a worldwide audience for her legendary beauty. Jason Momoa is has the build and the hybrid looking eyes that comic book creators could only have dreamt of. Who else could be more suited to the role of Aquaman? There something a little tongue in cheek in his personality that helps too. The multi talented Patrick Wilson as evil brother shows how versatile he is jumping from other Wan movies like Conjuring to this superhero movie effortlessly. Nicole Kidman's towering height has finally been put to good use as queen of Atlantis.The visuals are also beautiful beyond expectations. When there is too much in the sea there is some interesting surface action too. The satisfying and epic story has remains easy to follow from start to finish - Marvel movies could learn from DC here.A standard bearer for the future of action hero movies.,Aquaman
22,Aaron1375,Never thought I'd enjoy an Aquaman film adaptation,9,24 January 2019,"I am in the minority when it comes to the DC films in that I have enjoyed them all. I thought Man of Steel was an awesome Superman film, Batman versus Superman wasn't great, but the last portion of the film was good, Suicide Squad was pretty cool and Wonder Woman, well people liked that one. I even thought Justice League was good and was baffled that it had a disappointing box office take as it was so much better than Batman versus Superman. This one I was not sure of, because I just thought it would be difficult to make an interesting movie using only Aquaman. I was wrong and was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film.The story has Aquaman coming out into the forefront as he takes out some pirates after we are introduced to Arthur's mother and his dad and how they met. He leaves a pirate father/son duo to die as they had been killing indiscriminately; however, this would later turn out to be a mistake as son wants revenge on Aquaman. Aquaman, meanwhile, must go back to his kingdom of Atlantis as his brother tries to start a war with those of us who reside on land. Arthur/Aquaman must try and reclaim his throne and prevent this war his brother so desperately wants and also deal with a new enemy, the Black Manta!One of the reasons I enjoyed this one was the cast who did a very good job. It was nice seeing Dolph Lundgren in a big movie for a change rather than the direct to DVD stuff he usually does these days. Jason Momoa is really good as Aquaman and is one of the main reasons I think this one worked as he is very charismatic as the hero in this one. My favorite though was the Black Manta as they had the costume down pat! He looked completely awesome and the fight between him and Aquaman was the highlight of this movie for me!So, overall, a very fun action movie and surprisingly so for me. I think the DC films are rather good, though I still favor the Marvel film universe more. I have always enjoyed Marvel more in the comics too as I find their heroes more relatable and less overpowered than those of DC, but I like the DC characters too. I am looking forward to Shazaam as well as that one looks fun too. Sorry, but comic book films should be fun and not all dark and serious...unless we are talking Spawn of course.",Aquaman

With the mentorship of Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and the revelations of Mera (Amber Heard) he discovers that he is the half-breed heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. As the rightful successor to the throne, he must tangle with his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to save the surface world from destruction. Meanwhile Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) seeks vengeance on Arthur for the death of his father.""Aquaman"" (2018) is a colorful superhero flick featuring a flashy action scene for every 5 minute lull. It's reminiscent of ""Thor"" (2011) and ""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013), but with spectacular undersea realms instead of Asgard & realms nearby. Yet the drama was better in those movies whereas here it feels like the creators were in a rush to jump to the next action sequence, which might make ""Aquaman"" 'thrilling,' but less compelling story-wise.Still, it's very eventful with loads of energy (maybe TOO eventful for its own good). And I liked the balance of underwater scenes to surface scenes with spectacular locations, including the Sahara Desert and Sicily. Meanwhile Amber is stunning as redheaded Mera. Even Nicole Kidman shows up as Arthur's mother, Atlanna. Speaking of Arthur, Momoa is magnificent as the protagonist and will forever change the public's generally weak perception of Aquaman.The film is a bit overlong at 2 hour, 23 minutes; and was shot in Australia (Hastings Point, Amity Point, Southport, Main Beach & Currumbin Beach); Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada; and Morocco (Erfoud & Merzouga).GRADE: B/B-",Aquaman

One moment I thought, OMG, not that famous kiss and don't let it be a love story, luckily it isn't there's a bit of liove but destroyed with action.About the story itself I can't say a thing because it's easy to catch and I would spoil a lot.

It looks like they're going to make a movie of every possible comic character and I have no problem with that as long as I'm entertained. Aquaman, based on a DC Comic this time, is for the major part just CGI's like most of those movies. There are some terrific action scenes but sometimes the CGI's looked also a bit fake, that would be the only minor point to me. As for the rest the story is easy to watch and has a high entertainment level. Jason Momoa is candy for the eye for women (if I have to believe my wife) like Amber Heard is candy for the eye for men. And Nicole Kidman looks like she never ages (the Botox did help in her case). It's obvious there will be more Aquaman movies in the future and I'm fine with that.",Aquaman
26,siderite,"I thought Disney bought Marvel, not DC",5,6 March 2019,"There is no reason that I know for why Aquaman turned into the modern CGI version of The Little Mermaid, liberally mixed with Aladdin and The Lion King. I mean, yeah, Black Panther was mostly Lion King, but it was interesting and fun and the world building was not bad. Aquaman feels cartoonish from the start to the very end. The pointless CGI, Heard's horrible wig, all the fairy tale characters that seek to show us how they are superior to people on the surface who have grown up reading about single dimensional characters like them, the predictability that one can find in children stories only. To be honest, the feeling I have most about this film is outrage. It is condescending and dumb. It's the Hollywood version of Homer telling Bart he's stupid.And then there is the cast. Jason Momoa, who I liked in Atlantis, the Stargate one, because he was supposed to have only one dimension. Amber Heard, who hasn't had a good role in ages and sporting that eye soar of a bad wig, Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe getting their paychecks. And Dolph Ludgren? WTF? The main character of this story was Patrick Wilson's, he had the most relevant scenes, he was the only one who actually looked like he gave a damn about his performance. He is the true king of the film!Bottom line, it was so dumb it was offensive.",Aquaman
27,namashi_1,"A Visually Dazzling, Yet Overstuffed Spectacle!",6,14 December 2018,"Based on the DC Comics character of the same name, 'Aquaman' is the big DC Blockbuster that finally opened in cinemas today in India. Directed by James Wan, best known for helming the spooky Conjuring Series, now delves into the Superhero mold and delivers a visual spectacle. Wan, however, suffers partially on the account of an Overstuffed Screenplay, that is patchy and overlong.'Aquaman' Synopsis: Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa in a winning performance) the heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, must step forward to lead his people against his half-brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson), who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world.'Aquaman', who appeared in last year's disappointing Justice League, gets his solo origin story here and the Superhero is an instantly likable one. And Momoa gets into the skin of the superhero and delivers a fun turn, that leads 'Aquaman' to much success. Momoa not only looks the part, but brings a fabulous heroism to the part, which was essential here.Another ace of 'Aquaman' are its visuals. This biggie looks like a dream! The world created underwater is dreamy and will leave your eyes mesmerized. The Graphics are of top-grade, and 'Aquaman' is easily the BEST looking DC film, yet! And the action-sequences, though way too many, are proficiently picturised and executed. Some of the stunts are wow! I'd like to point the one sequence that takes place in Italy in the film's latter half. Its stupendous!However, despite magnificent visuals and Momoa nailing the titular role, 'Aquaman' suffers due to an overstuffed Screenplay. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick & Will Beall's Screenplay brings much action and a fast-moving narrative, but has no soul. Sure, 'Aquaman' wasn't going to be an experience full of pathos and soul, but here, there is none of it, not even a slight bit of it. The film keeps moving forward, not giving enough time to its characters to make them connect with the viewers, and there is just too much action here! I mean the action does leave a big impact, but there is an overdose of it here, quite frankly. It appears as if the Writers ran of out ideas in the middle, and kept writing action set-pieces until they found another aspect to continue upon. And there is barely any humor here, which is surprising, since Momoa seems to be good at being funny! The Writing could've been better, for sure!James Wan's Direction is top-notch. As mentioned earlier, 'Aquaman' is a visual delight and the Director gives the film the look it deserves. This is a grand film and looks every bit of it. Don Burgess's Cinematography is fantastic. The lensman has captured the film beautifully. Kirk Morri's Editing is decent, but could've been crisper. 'Aquaman' feels a little too long at a 143-minutes, some trimming, of at least 20-minutes, was required. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Rupert Gregson-Williams's Score is super.Barring Momoa, 'Aquaman' boasts an impressive host of actors, but the ones who stand out are Patrick Wilson (impressive as the villain) & Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko (efficient in a strong supporting role). Amber Heard as Mera, Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Dolph Lundgren as Nereus & Temuera Morrison as Thomas Curry, are adequate.On the whole, 'Aquaman' is definitely fun, but it doesn't utilize its potential to the fullest. A Decent Watch!",Aquaman

Finally a big screen film of ""Aquaman"", and much different from my memory of fish man as with Jason Momoa's take this superhero looks more like a heavy metal weight lifting super star! And the film is filled with plenty of action scenes and the ""CGI"" and special effects are plenty. Still aside from all of the big stuff it's a good origin story of how his parents meet and how ""Aquaman"" comes about. And it's a journey of sibling conflict and war under sea as the kingdom and water country of Atlantis is at risk and along the way Mera(Amber Heard) gives support as King Orm is a big threat to underwater peace. Thru it all Aqua's mom Atlanna(Nicole Kidman) is an underwater spirit that's still present for things to stay afloat.

29,DKosty123,Nicely Done -Straight Forward & Effective,8,28 December 2018,"James Wan, Director extrodinare of the Saw movies goes beyond cutting up here in an adaption of AquaMan which would make it's creators proud if they can see it (RIP). A lot of people worked on this film done in 12 filming locations and that shows very much in the finished product. It sticks with Aquamans original themes and characters and manages to get some humor into the film. This is the best Warner/DC effort in a while.It works well because the script is better than a lot of DC films have been recently. It is predictable, all the way to the sequel sequence during the credits, but it is going to take some extra effort to make a better film than this one. It does have the one drawback many cgi movies have, no matter how much dirt there is in a sequence, the stars always come out squeaky clean with even a hair out of place.Nicole Kidman (age 51, are you kidding?) is very good as the Queen of Atlantis. Amber Heard is the Red Haired Princess who helps the light house keepers son become the hero Aquaman we are all in need of. The thing good about this film is that there are no wrinkles or curves thrown at the viewer. The flashbacks make sense (for once), and all the script makes sense too.Major Spoiler-
We all expect the Queen to still be alive even after we are told she is not. Aquaman finally finds his mom and it is a satisfying moment in this one. After all, moms treat their hero sons the best.",Aquaman
30,thesar-2,Thor Underwater,4,20 January 2019,"I know I'm probably causing waves here, but I clearly see why this made so much across the seas. It's just so basic.Awww, James Wan. How you've been bought out. I mean, good for you, as a director and creator, you've come so far...to earn so much. But, you've also left your soul behind in that dirty SAW basement to enter the depths of the oceans and sell out to DC.But, anyways, I didn't hate this movie. It was so much like Black Panther - just OK. So mediocre, so bland, so formulaic. There was nothing new here...aside from so many swear words that were just added in for ""depth."" The edge! Now, I'm no prude. I swear up and down, but here it felt forced.Anyways, we have reluctant Aquaman who's hell-bent on not being the King he's supposed to be that he journeys the entire movie to become said King. Oh, and insert sets, conflicts and villains A-B-C on his journey. And lest, I forget, his relationship with Not-Scarlett Johansson plays a part.So this Fish-Outta-Water-Film is the classic tale of self-discovery with a 1000% CGI. Though I am NOOOO CGI fan, I guess there's really little alternative here. We have The Little Mermaid made into a live-action battle, à la The Phantom Menace.And now, back to knocking the lands across the ocean. They see 1 movie for every 100 I see, so yeah, I have a right to say this was bad overall, though still watchable. It's just not great as: let's earn a billion and become the greatest DCEU film. It's certainly not the best, but I can see where people connected with it.Just wish they would've explored the whole pollution thing a tad farther. Yeah, us humans suck and it's only briefly mentioned here.

31,cherold,"Terrible script, looks like it might be fun to watch in 3D",5,26 March 2019,"I was in the minority of IMDB reviewers who liked the underrated Justice League, and now, with the latest movie featuring Jason Momoa as Aquaman, I am in the minority again, this time having a far more negative reaction than most people.While the CGI action is *sometimes* fun, the dialogue is excruciatingly bad. Embarrassingly bad. This is particularly evident with Amber Heard, who hasn't developed the skill of more experienced actors like Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe to find a way to speak drivel with conviction. Amber seems terrible in this, but I don't know how much of that is her and how much is the wretched verbiage she is forced to spew.People are going crazy for the muscly Momoa. I was underwhelmed by him in Justice League, and while he certainly has some amount of charm, he fails to make Aquaman particularly memorable.The story is predictable. Some of the action works, some doesn't. Everything that's not action is painful to sit through.I did notice that the movie is very much filmed for 3D. Perhaps that's why I was underwhelmed by a lot of the action; it was more designed for effects than fun. I do suspect I would have enjoyed this more in 3D. I also probably would have enjoyed it more if dolphins dubbed in all the dialogue.",Aquaman
32,FeastMode,my notes,5,27 July 2019,"Eh. there was a lot of good in this. but there was also a lot of bad, and as an overall movie it didn't hit me the way it should have. the visuals were awesome. aquaman is likable and badass. the musical score was great. but the story was forgettable, the villains were underwhelming, there were so many cheesy and corny parts, there were a bunch of smh moments and a lame high-school-drama-level romance. i was close to giving it a 6/10 but the overall tone of this movie turned me off a bit (1 viewing)",Aquaman
33,Robert_duder,Success for a very hard to pull off hero,7,24 December 2018,"My expectations for Aquaman were kept pretty low. To me, as a DC fan, he's barely considered second string hero and the idea of bringing him to the big screen seemed like an insurmountable task. There are a few things they did very right with this film. It's pure science fiction-fantasy so they use that to their advantage. They did similarly with this what they did with the second and third Thor movies where there is very little realism here so they can take liberties with nearly anything. The CGI is extravagant and well done. The film is a visual sight to behold which helps a lot. James Wan as director is a talented, solid director with great vision and this is a bit different for him but he knows how to tell a story and the fantasy visuals needs a story and it works. There were scenes throughout this that I kept thinking should have been nearly completely laughable, it was so cheesy but it worked within the confines of the fantasy of the film.
Jason Momoa is a great choice for Arthur (Aquaman) because he's a far cry from the comic book version. Momoa has great charisma on screen and I'm really starting to enjoy him as an actor. He's massive and larger than life and yet there is something very down to earth about it. Amber Heard is the eye candy in the movie and the romantic interest though that is mostly played down. Heard does decently, she's not an amazing actress by any means but she serves her purpose and her and Momoa are okay together. Patrick Wilson is a nice addition to the cast although I found his character very cheesy at times. Even his line delivery is not exactly ""serious"" enough to take seriously. But he is a decent villain to the story. Nicole Kidman is also a nice addition to the cast as Aquaman's mother. She looks amazing and she definitely adds a certain gravitas to the film. Dolph Lundgren, Willem Dafoe, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Graham McTavish and Temuera Morrison all have strong supporting roles. You can tell by the big names they signed to this that on screen charisma helped carry the film a lot.
James Wan created a fantasy epic and that's an important distinction to your typical ""superhero"" flick. It's very watchable, it's light and fluffy and it's non-stop action. The action scenes will literally have you on the edge of your seat and that helps you ignore the silliness or the one-liners or the cheesy moments and dialog. It ends up working quite well. I don't think this is the best DC Universe film by any means and I don't think it comes even close to Wonder Woman but I think it does well given that it's Aquaman. I'd be surprised to see them pull this off again but if they follow the same recipe and have the same amount of experience behind the camera and in front then maybe. It is clear now that being without Zack Snyder is still the best for the DC Universe. 7.5/10",Aquaman
34,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Visually striking, but little else to hold your attention",4,27 January 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningArthur Curry (Jason Momoa) is a half man, half aquarian warrior, who has been raised on Earth, and uses his special abilities to fight for justice. His latest escapades have seen him rescue an underwater boat from a group of vicious hijackers, one of whom is now eager for revenge. Meanwhile, in his underwater second home, tensions are brewing between rival kings Orm (Patrick Wilson) and Nereus (Dolph Lundgren), plunging him into a desperate inter-world battle, alongside the beautiful Mera (Amber Heard), to discover his true self.Suspension of disbelief is sometimes something you must be willing to engage with any regular movie, but with superhero movies, it's always something of a foregone conclusion, naturally with the inevitable fantasy element that is attached to the story. But, even by these standards, Aquaman, one of the most recent additions to the staple, rather pushes the boundaries. Opening in 1985, Nicole Kidman, as a mermaid, leaps out of the water by some guys house and comes into his life, living as a couple and raising a son (without, it seems, raising any eyebrows or contravening any marriage laws.) But this brief spark of incredulity serves as a sweetener for the lengthy vapidness that is to follow.Jason Momoa was a guy I'd never heard of before this film, and who on the back of it, it would seem, suddenly garnered the star power to charge £95 for his autograph at Comic Con. He certainly has the physical frame to fit the title role, and within the constraints of it, pulls off the grunting, edgy, wise-cracking tough guy in a perfectly serviceable manner, but nothing more than is required. The support cast is littered with big names, from Dafoe, Heard, Wilson, Kidman, and Lundgren making a pleasing big screen return in a none fighting role, all of whom are pretty much equally perfunctory.The film's big saving grace is it's magnificent visual spectacle, with some amazing CGI capturing a wonderous underwater kingdom, along with some snazzy costume design and amazing action. But it's at least twenty minutes too long and over indulgent, with a threadbare, unengaging story and empty, soulless performances. And that renders all that pretty meaningless. **",Aquaman
35,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Aquaman with a Kodak.,5,22 December 2018,"Essentially, 'Aquaman (2018)' is an adaptation of the animated 'Justice League: Throne Of Atlantis (2015)', except it's twice as long and, frankly, twice as sloppy, almost doing less in its one-hundred and forty-three minutes than that film does in its brisk seventy-two. Much of it feels like a conventional and old-fashioned feeling 'superhero' story that, even at its best (which is an enjoyable Sicily-based action-scene), floats along providing nothing more than a shallow level of engagement. That's its main issue, really; it isn't all that compelling. Yet, it's generally just about entertaining enough to see you through to its conclusion. It isn't gripping, but it isn't boring either. Despite its issues (including a very wonky tone), it's actually not bad. It's not especially good, but it isn't bad. It's somehow better the second time around. I appreciate what it's trying to do, even if it isn't always successful; for instance, the fact that it brings to screen such blatantly silly things as Oceanmaster's comic-accurate costume or a drum-playing octopus proves that it's at least somewhat self-aware. When it's at its most bombastic, it's at its most successful. The underwater visuals are absolutely splendid, full of colour and life. It really is like stepping into another world. So, ultimately, the movie emerges as a decent escapist experience, despite its problems. It isn't particularly good, but it isn't bad either. 5/10.",Aquaman
36,ThomasDrufke,Flawed but Undeniably Fun,7,27 December 2018,"Is Aquaman the savior for the DCEU like people want it to be? Well, I would lean towards saying no, but it's far from the disaster some may have expected. James Wan not only brings a new flavor to the universe, but makes a separate entry into a series that desperately needed it.There are two mindsets at play here, one being that Wan ""clearly"" meant to make a overly dramatic and bombastic adventure with cheesy dialogue, the other that the film is a tonal mess that at times takes itself far too serious, and at other times, almost having too much fun. I fall somewhere in the middle. I can acknowledge that a film that has a massive octopus playing the drums under water has a certain sense of self awareness, but there's no doubt in my mind that the mixture of tones just doesn't work in some moments.Jason Momoa is the perfect Aquaman/Arthur Curry and I'm mad that I had any doubt over his casting all those years ago. Despite not having the best chemistry romantically, his love interest Mera (Amber Heard) plays well off of him. When they aren't making out in the midst of an all out under water war, they share some of the best action scenes of the film, including a rooftop chase that displays the true genius behind Wan's framing/camera work.I could have completely done without Black Manta as it felt very much like the unnecessary presence of Baron Mordo in Doctor Strange. Also, his costume is absolutely absurd, and I don't care how close it is to the comic book iteration of Manta. The other villain, Patrick Wilson's 'Oceanmaster', is an overcooked & cliched power hungry super villain that did next to nothing for me. There's a good antagonist in there somewhere for Aquaman, but it sure wasn't in this origin story.I'd be remiss not to mention Nicole Kidman, considering how great of a year she is having, and her turn as Atlanna is no different. Owning her action sequences and elevating all of her dialogue, Kidman is likely the most memorable thing from the film, and I hope to see more of her character at some point or another.Extravagant, colorful, bombastic, a tonal mess, and cheesy, Aquaman is right around where I expected it would be. And hopefully the beginning of a new era of DC movies. Here's hoping.7.5/10",Aquaman

I admit that I can tell that the director saw the ""Thor"" movies. Even Aquaman's bulk is like Thor's. Probably this film's biggest strengths is how beautiful and colorful it is. The Earth is mostly covered in water, so it only makes sense we should have movies that take place underwater!I do wish that Black Manta was in this more. It does get kind of too silly at times, especially with how they suddenly have monsters and dinosaurs randomly appear! There's still no doubt that this is a very creative film. While not as good as ""Black Panther"" or ""Avengers: Infinity War"" it's still a film people should watch if only because of how popular it is. Trust me when I say there's tons of great action and creativity everywhere! Yes, we get a nice romance story in too...but not as good as Thor's. ***",Aquaman
40,cricketbat,"DC went ""full Marvel""",6,31 December 2018,"I feel like DC went ""full Marvel"" with Aquaman. This movie is a light-hearted action/comedy that feels like a dramatic shift from the dark and brooding films that came before it in the DCEU.

But before he can do that, Arthur and warrior woman Mera (Amber Heard) must first retrieve the Trident of Neptune.More action-adventure than superhero saga, this adaptation of the DC Comics character is all style over substance, thanks to its rudimentary plot, childish dialogue and corny villains.

44,westsideschl,More Dumbing Down Science,4,7 April 2019,"Dumbing down fantasy:
Aquaman created 70+ years ago when science (crude compared to today) for young adults was poor at best. A time when ancient myths such as Atlantis held sway in people's imaginations. Atlantis a city w/humans? Living at the bottom of the ocean. Never mind pressures & its effects at different depths, and even how cities could be constructed;. How human Atlanteans could breathe w/out gills or any other mode of O2 absorption; how they could talk at any depth & in perfect English (try talking under water and see how H2O density makes speech unintelligible). How there could be a paradise of trees & waterfalls at the Earth's core (forget pressure; thousands of degrees heat; molten iron).Usual script hooks of bullying of young Aquaman; lots of lasers & martial arts kicks (also found in recently released Bumblebee); lots of strength displays like lifting a submarine out of the water, but oddly it takes more effort to just toss a human about. Lots of stereotyping of characters - formula good 'n' bad. Our underwater humans say they have the greatest military on the planet yet they're riding around on giant seahorses & sharks. The one positive to the movie was the justification for war against the surface because our plastic pollution (millions of tons per year) is destroying their habitat. Appropriately we get a real scene with hills of plastic garbage being thrown back at us.",Aquaman
45,ironhorse_iv,Aquaman indeed made a splash with some viewers. Me not so much. It was just fine.,7,23 March 2019,"Packed to the gills with over the top cartoony action, clever nods to other pop works and hilarious comedy. This Warner Bros motion picture directed by James Wan, was the first DC live action movie in a long time to go with a lighter tone. Set in their extended universe, this fish out of water hero's journey story of a humanoid merman, Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) being reintroduce to his culture's origins in order to reclaim his birthright before his half-brother Ocean Master (Patrick Wilson) takes the throne & seek revenge on the surface world, was entertaining. Without spoiling the movie too much. Brooding, over serious, and somber doesn't fit Aquaman at all. They made the right decision of tone, even if the actor's edgy badass presence doesn't fit well with the wholesome colorful silver age look. Nevertheless, I did like Momoa's surf bro style of acting. I just wish, the movie didn't make Arthur seem so much of airhead. After all, he's supposed to be a wise king that care for his kingdom. In this movie, he rarely thinks, or try to embrace with his people. All he wants to gain the people's trust is to find a silly lost McGuffin. While, the treasure hunting subplot is fun. It's still a bit odd, that his people who barely knows anything about him, would make Curry, their king, after he kill hundreds of them, just because he now holds a legendary trident. As for the other leader, the one they knew. He got off the hook, a little too easy as well. He done far worse. Regardless, who is the true leader, this senseless war resulted in large number of deaths & casualties; which this movie, sadly highly glazed over. None of the royals felt bad, about how many Atlanteans were murdered. A little comeuppance or selfless sacrifice would had been justified for both rulers. Maybe, Arthur losing an arm to save them or Ocean Master accidently drowning by his own hands would made the film, a little more satisfied. Plus, it would add more stakes, surprised twist, or innovative concept in a movie's plot that didn't take that much risk. As of right now, the main plot is kinda thin, bland, and generic. It's not adding much of anything new. In truth, I thought the film would had been a little bit better if they stay away from the surface world, as much as possible. Why? Very little of the history of the surface world make sense within the story, they trying to tell. Logically, it's really hard to believe that the Justice League wouldn't had interfered after the tsunamis, even if they were busy. The film did the right decision, by not hanging up too much from the previous movie. The film is already confusing enough, with people not believing Atlantis exist, despite that there has two alien invasions, an goddess running around, and a enchantress attack. Nevertheless, there were a lot of loose ends. The hero's superpowers & physical imperfections are kinda inconsistent & poorly define. This lend to a lot of confusement on what things could harms Curry. A good example of this, is the desert scene. Isn't the lack to expose water, one of Curry's weaknesses? To add onto that, how does he even have tattoos, if he has strong healing ability? Better yet, does his powers, give him a new orange-and-green suit? Things like that don't add up. Even the bizarre reunion with family members recognize each other instantly, despite one of them being a kid the last time was a bit offed. Regardless of the story. The visuals were beautiful even if they look fake and highly disproportionate. Nothing seem like it was physically or scientifically there. They really did overused the computer effects. Need more practical effects sets. CGI was overwhelming. Regardless, I did like how the movie look. It was bright & colorful, rather than the desaturated color palette and pitch black darkness. As for the dialogue. It was a mixed bag. I kinda dig the villain's eco terrorism reasons to fight. I wish the flick explore more of that. Sadly, a lot of the corny exposition given throughout the movie is highly repetitive. The film is full of people reminding each other of things, they should at the very least know already, like the rules of within their society. Then, there are things that are never explained, like what happen to the previous king. In spite of that, I really don't mind most of the casting. Some of the performers playing older parental figures despite being nearly the same age with their costars, whom are acting as their adult children, was fine with me. I found Nicole Kidman & Temuera Morrison working great as the movie's emotional heart piece. As for Amber Heard. I found Mera to enjoyable to watch, despite the controversies surrounding the actress's personal life. I also didn't mind Wilson being here, even if it's a bit jarring to see him in yet another DC movie after 2008s 'Watchmen' & 2015s 'Batman V Superman'. He was fine. As for Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. He was good as Black Manta. Hopefully, he has a bigger role next time. Rounding out the cast are Julie Andrews, Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren. They were scene stealers. Trying not to rock the boat, the only acting that I didn't like, were the thespians playing the younger version of Arthur. They had really wooden delivery. Overall: While, this movie did swam up from the depths of the DC Universe and into theaters ending with a mediocrity end credit stinger. Nevertheless, I'm willing to dip into uncharted waters and say, this movie is whale of a time worth watching, even if its story is just a small drop in the ocean that didn't sail smoothly. In the end, it's still worth diving into, my man! At least, once or twice.",Aquaman
46,Platypuschow,"Aquaman: Basically what I expected, and that's not a good thing",3,30 January 2019,"Where could I even start?Let it be known immediately I'm unimpressed with the DC cinematic universe thus far, though not bad I've considered the movies very underwhelming for the most part. I think they dropped the ball thoroughly and rushed to make Justice League (2017) without debuting most of the characters first like Marvel did.Now Aquaman is a delicate one, because let's be honest he's hard to take seriously. He was silly in Smallville (2001), he was silly in his own cartoon, all the animated outings and the live action television series never even got past the pilot. It's a dude who talks to fish and once taken away from water doesn't really have a gimmick. For this reason (And many more) I was skeptical of the DCU version and with good reason, sure he was fairly neat in Justice League but here? Really?You see straight off the bat I'll say I like Momoa I'd consider myself a fan, he's a competent actor with a unique look. But he's not Arthur Curry! Aquaman is the blonde haired jock looking character, not long black haired bearded Samoan looking fella! So as much as I like the actor, I struggle to see him as this character who has been around since 1941 and has always had the same look which they've not embraced.So getting over that what do we have? Over 2hrs of CGI laden silliness featuring our beloved fishman, Atlantis, tridents, oceanic life fighting for him and goofy looking villains. In fact it's so CGI-laden and so colorful it may as well have been animated because it practically is anyway.The story is very Hollywood, very by the numbers stuff so no surprise there. The cast is decent enough but people like Dafoe just look so out of place because they're too good for this.I'd like to say this is take your brain out fun but it's not, Suicide Squad (2016) was take your brain out fun this right here is get yourself a full frontal lobotomy mediocrity.It's cheesy, it's tacky, it's over the top, it lacks the laughs that could have saved it (To an extent) and it's done nothing to redeem the DC universe in my eyes especially considering I'd count this as their worst movie yet.Aquaman is one of those critically acclaimed movies that I'll never understand why and can only assume it's fans are (Mostly) made up of children and ladies lusting after Momoa.The Good:Momoa is the personification of ""Cool""A few funny momentsSome very impressive visualsThe Bad:That simply isn't Arthur CurryHard to take any of it seriouslyTacky Hollywood nonsense",Aquaman
47,The-Sarkologist,More to Aquaman than a Guy in a Wet Suit,7,30 December 2018,"Well, after watching some rather disappointing movies of late, this one turned out to be quite enjoyable. Okay, it is basically another superhero movie, and one based on a character that none of the main characters on The Big Bang Theory ever want to go dressed as to a fancy dress party. It sort of made me wonder whether Aquaman is one of those characters that nobody really likes all that much, so I was scratching my head as to why it turned out that they decided to do his origin story as the next in the DC Franchise.Look, if you are expecting anything on the scale of the MCU films, then you are probably going to be a little disappointed. Like all of the other DCEU films, this is basically a standalone film in the shared universe. In fact, I've noticed that the other characters don't even seem to make an appearance, but then again that probably has something to do with them wanting to maintain the focus on Aquaman and not divert the audience's attention to some of the more popular heroes, such as Batman.I'd probably say that this is your typical origin film, and as far as the story goes it is hardly original. The film is set about a year after the events in Justice League, and Aquaman is being approached to sort out a problem with Atlantis. The thing is that the people of Atlantis have become so annoyed with the surface people treating the ocean as if it were some huge garbage dump that they decide that they want to do something about it. Honestly, I really don't blame them, but then again we happen to be the surface people, and despite all of our crimes against nature, for some reason we always deserve a second chance.This is where Aquaman comes in. He is to challenge the king for the throne, particularly since he is first born. The problem is that he is the illegitimate child of the queen, so technically he doesn't count. Well, because of that he decides to go on a quest for a legendary trident, that he doesn't actually believe in, but because the princess of one of the kingdoms is encouraging him to do so, namely because she doesn't want to marry the king of Atlantis, he does so anyway. So, you can probably guess what happens from there, and it does include a huge undersea battle, as well as another enemy who wants to kill Aquaman because his father died when they were attempting to capture a Russian sub.Another thing about this film is that it is also technically a coming of age film, though of course the coming of age happens to be Aquaman, or at least Arthur Curry, becoming king of Atlantis and actually taking his birthright. However, the other thing is that it was a little odd that it came after the Justice League movie, but then again this might have had something to do with them being a little apprehensive when it comes to a character like Aquaman, who tends to be considered somewhat ineffectual. However, I certainly hope this film does dispel that rather unfair association.",Aquaman

It simply wouldn't have been the same without him. He is very natural and does the character justice. I enjoyed the fact that the protagonist was also weak at times and vulnerable, and not a super god.'Aquaman' is visually stunning! Atlantis is portrayed as a bright, colorful, breathtakingly beautiful place. The costumes are incredible, and cleverly incorporates marine elements. The photography is also amazing, and I absolutely loved the score. I enjoyed the inclusion of the Roy Orbison song 'Mystery Girl' in such a modern film.The film is unpredictable and sometimes action abruptly ends tranquil moments. Unlike most Marvel films, the humor was at the right moments, appropriate and actually funny. For some reason I honestly believed I wouldn't enjoy 'Aquaman', believing it to be just another superhero 'been there done that' movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. I absolutely LOVED it.

So meh and predictable.Aquaman is no Thor because he lacks the charisma and dominance like Thor has. The ""bad boy"" Aquaman of The justice League movie is absent. In this movie he is a almost a beta but acts a tough guy because he like beer.I could barley hear some of the under water dialogue. The scene with Atlantis on land I didn't get why it was destroyed. Most of the lines and dialogue were just lame and generic.The Costumes were good. CGI and green screen were so obvious.Between Justice League movie and Aquaman movie I believe there were contradictions. But who knows or has time to list them since both movies were boring.The brotherly rivalry sucks. It's no where near Thor and Loki.Only positives are Black Manta and the giant lobster at the end. I wasn't sure why there was a big fight at the end probably because the dialogue throughout the movie was greatly bad.Aquaman tries to be Thor (at the end) and fun yet fails. Ocean Master is more fit to be king despite his actions.DC is 1 and 5 within the dceu. It's best to skip Shazam because it will likely repeat its predecessors formula.2 out of 10.

53,tomgillespie2002,"A wheezing, sickly bore",3,12 March 2019,"After a cameo in Zack Snyder's 2016 car crash Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and a team-up appearance in 2017's equally disastrous Justice League, the time feels right for one of comic-book lore's goofiest superheroes, Aquaman, to receive his own standalone origin story. After all, Jason Momoa's hulking, tattooed fish-whisperer was one of the surprising standouts of DC's flop team-up event, and with the campy orange-and-green costume replaced by a long-hared and shirtless Kiwi Adonis, the character can now be played straight-faced. Wonder Woman proved that DC could produce quality with the right director pulling the strings, and they pulled off a coup with James Wan, a filmmaker whose talents I have long admired despite many of his films missing the mark for me. So it pains me to say that Aquaman is yet another tonally uneven and bloated effort from Warner Bros. that never quite knows if it wants to make you laugh or feel, with a marathon running time which, by the time is gets round to its umpteenth climax, is about as welcome as a fart in a wetsuit.In 1985, lighthouse keeper Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison) comes across a beautiful woman washed up on the shores of Maine. The woman is Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), a princess from the underwater nation of Atlantis who has escaped an arranged marriage and a gang of Atalantian stormtroopers. Tom takes her in and the two naturally fall in love, resulting in the birth of the half-Atlantian, half-human Arthur. When her enemies come calling, Atlanna must return to the ocean, leaving Tom to bring up young Arthur on his own. The baby grows up to be the beer-swilling gym-devotee we saw in Justice League, but there is trouble a-brewin' down in the depths. Arthur's half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) wants to unite the kingdoms of Atlantis and wage war on the surface, who have been polluting their home for decades. But Orm knows that he will never be accepted as the true leader while Arthur, who has no desire to take the throne, is still alive. Mera (Amber Heard), the daughter of King Nereus (Dolph Lundgren), comes to warn Arthur, but they don't stand a chance against the might of Atlantis without the Trident of Atlan, a magical weapon buried somewhere in the Sahara desert.Aquaman certainly isn't short of ideas; the problem is that Wan doesn't quite know how to cram them all in. We are taken across continents on land and to multiple kingdoms under the water. With a desire to capture the adventurous magic of Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones, the film actually trips over its own ambition, squeezing in side characters such as Atlantean Mr. Miyagi Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and the fearsome pirate Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), as well as a variety of underwater races we are expected to remember and littering the story with clunky CGI smackdowns. Wan crafts a colourful, vivid world, full of giant sea-horses and advanced technology, but it shares more in common with the weightless. computer-generated locations of The Phantom Menace than the tangible flamboyance of Black Panther's Wakanda. Yet all of this could be considered a mere niggle had the leads been up to the task, but Momoa and Heard have all the chemistry of two strangers making awkward small-talk in a lift. Momoa is an impressive specimen and possesses the charisma to bring this character to life (see Justice League), but here he is denied a moment to have that quiet moment of reflection or to reveal the flaws to his character that would help make him interesting.

55,cruise01,"Amazing film that delivered an epic adventure story, stunning visual effects, and action.",10,23 December 2018,"Aquaman (5 out of 5 stars).Aquaman is an awesome bada** superhero film that delivers on an epic adventure scale with action sequences, visual effects, and a great story. I will consider this to be the best DC movie beating out Wonder Woman. The character Aquaman seems like a cheesy character to even be adapted onto the big screen. With Jason Momoa performance as the character. He makes the character bada** and even when he achieves his golden outfit.The plot is a great adventure story. It was not rushed nor overstuffed with sub plots. It follows Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) the queen of Atlantis being rescued by a lighthouse keeper Thomas (Temuera Morrison). They both fall in love with each other and have a son named Arthur (Jason Momoa) who will soon become Aquaman. As decades fly by, Aquaman is found by Mera (Amber Heard) who informs him that his step brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is trying to wage war against the surface people. And he is trying to unite the seven kingdoms underwater to create havoc to the surface people. With Mera and Nuidis (Willem Dafoe) help and needing to find the true trident of Atlantis in order for Aquaman to claim his rightful place in the throne. He will fight against Orm's army and hired pirates led by Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II).The plot delivered an epic scale adventure. Aquaman travelling to Atlantis that looked like a beautiful colorful city underwater. Was more astonishing than the Avatar film. The action sequences are big and well directed. There is a lot of action throughout. Aquaman fighting against pirates in a submarine. From the epic lifting the sub out of the water. The fight scene with Atlanna fighting against Atlantis soldiers in the opening scene with one long camera take was well choreographed. James Wan direction of having the camera rotate around the action sequences worked so well. He is known for his small budget horror movies like Saw and Insidious. His action style from Furious Seven and this film was just awesome. He delivered a great underwater chase scene that almost felt like Tron Legacy with the beautiful lighting vehicles and Atlantis lighting. And the chase scene in Italy when Aquaman and Mera are facing against Black Manta and his soldiers was thrilling. The climax battle sequence is breathtaking. With Aquaman and Orm/ Ocean Master fighting each other was the best choreographed fight scene with the cinematography work.The visual effects are breathtaking when the action is underwater or on land. It was great on an epic scale. The cinematography work was well done that captured the action and choreography. The music score Rupert Gregon-Williams was great. And had a good score that made the movie feel like an adventure. Also, the soundtrack with a few songs in it was great and fun. Jason Momoa was great. Amber Heard is beautiful and great as Mera. Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and Nicole Kidman were all great with their characters. James Wan's direction was brilliant with making an adventure story and epic action.Overall, Aquaman is a great film. I say it is the best DC movie out there. I definitely recommend seeing this in the big screen in theatres. If you are looking for an adventure story and exciting epic action sequences with beautiful stunning visual effects. This is the film worth seeing.",Aquaman

57,eddie_baggins,A fun and visually inventive blockbuster,7,20 January 2019,"While it has a frequently cringe-worthy script (a staple of the mostly disappointing DC movie universe) and a plot line that leaves much to be desired, the playfulness and cinematic zest displayed in Aquaman means its a popcorn munching joy to behold on the big screen.Now a world conquering box office heavyweight, this James Wan directed and Jason Momoa starring blockbuster had a lot riding on it after many a DC film had left a sour taste in the mouths of eager cinema-goers, making it great to see that Aquaman forgoes much of the solemn and tiresome film-making on display in the likes of Suicide Squad, Justice League and Batman v Superman.Much of the success of this visual spectacle is down to the talents of Wan who has become one of the industry's most reliable and consistent directors, with this film yet another example of his ability to be able to craft the type of cinematic experience that audiences will lap up en-masse.Utilizing the fantastical underwater world at his disposal, Wan goes pedal to the floor in regards to letting his imagination run wild and its safe to say that Aquaman is one of the most visually dazzling and eye pleasingly colorful films to appear in some time, allowing it to overcome many of its narrative and dialogue shortcomings.Proving once more that they can't match it with Marvel in regards to providing the storytelling and screenwriting smarts to go along with the spectacle side of the equation, there are numerous and quite glaring problems with the way in which Aquaman deals with its tale of Momoa's Arthur Curry on a quest to stop Patrick Wilson's underwater King Orm from waging war against the dry land dwelling humans but it's not enough to derail the fun times to be had with this watery adventure.Led by it's energetic and easy to like leading man, Aquaman has a blast going on an 80's like quest across the various ocean kingdoms all over the globe and in these simplistic yet creatively designed aspects Wan's film shines, with it easily becoming the most proficiently made DC film outside of Nolan's holy Batman trilogy, even if some de-aging CGI at the start of the film and some downright icky training flashbacks make you wish you had closed your eyes and ears for a short time.Also found within the film are some fun supporting turns with the likes of Wilson, Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren, all having a good time with their respective roles, while Wan and his team take a leaf out of the Guardians of the Galaxy rule-book and embrace their bonkers universe and instill it with a hearty dose of zany humor; selfies with bikies anyone?Final Say -A visual feast and a fun offering for those of any age, Aquaman may not be high-brow stuff but this is crowd-pleasing film-making of a high level thanks to Wan's creative direction and a strong sense if playfulness that outweighs the frequent daftness found within.3 1/2 Octopus drummer's out of 5",Aquaman
58,leonblackwood,Visually great but bad storyline! 5/10,5,12 May 2019,"Review:
I was surprised to see that this movie is in 21st place in all-time box office takings because I really didn't think that it was that amazing. Jason Momoa is the perfect Aquaman, but the script was awful, and the music throughout the film REALLY got on my nerves. Some of the scenes looked great, especially on the big screen, and the few witty moments were delivered well from Momoa but I found the core of the plot to be predictable and a bit annoying in places. The whole ""step-brother wanting to gain the power to control the seas"" theme was weak, and Aquaman's sidekick, Mera (Amber Heard), seemed to take centre stage during the important parts of the concept, more than Momoa. Dolph Lundgren put in a decent performance as King Nereus, alongside Patrick Wilson (King Orm), but that Fly looking ""Baddie"", Manta (Yahya Adbul-Mateen II) was completely useless, and the acting was terrible. I liked the relationship between Aquaman and his father Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison), but Nicole Kidman seemed a bit out of place, as Atlanna. Visually, it was a great achievement because it must have been hard to make the characters look like they were actually underwater, and some of the action scenes were put together well, but it's really Momoa's fresh acting style, that saved the day. He would have been great in a Marvel movie, but now he's stuck with DC's Aquaman, it really could do with Ragnorak's director, Taiki Waititi, touch. With all that aside, it is a decent watch, and it's much better than some of the movies that have come out of DC's camp, but it wasn't memorable and I'm glad that I didn't pay top dollar to watch it in the cinema. With a sequel due to come out in 2022, it's a shame that the same director is making the movie because I can't see it being dramatically different from this one. Now that Aquaman is king, there are many different avenues that they can take the character, but I don't think that the director is willing to take many risks, in terms of wit and really letting Momoa loose. Judging by the scenes after the credits, it's obvious that Manta is returning to revenge his dad, and the fact that King Orm is in a room with a view, I'm sure that he will be returning to gain the throne but it really needs a charismatic character to make this movie something to remember. Anyway, it's worth a watch, especially if you're a comic book fan, but I preferred Wonderwoman. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by James Wan, who brought you Saw in 2004, Dead Silence, Death Sentence starring Kevin Bacon, Doggie Heaven, Insidious 1 & 2, The Conjuring 1 & 2 and Fast & Furious 7. He has quite a versatile filmography, which was originally based on horror mysteries, so he was a questionable choice to bring this epic movie to the big screen. He also produced all of the Saw movies, Annabelle, Demonic, Lights Out, Jigsaw, Annabelle: Creation, The Nun and the Curse of La Llorona, so he has a passion for the supernatural genre. As this is the highest grossing movie from DC, including all of the Batman movies, it certainly passed all expectations, especially after the disappointing Justice League movie. I just hope they cut down on the visuals, and concentrate on a decent plot for the sequel.Budget: $160-$200million
Worldwide Gross: $1.15billionGenre: Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-Fi

59,TheMovieDiorama,Aquaman splashes onscreen with a spectacular torrent and a waterfall of barnacle action.,6,13 December 2018,"It's safe to say that Aquaman is no longer not cool. The running joke is finally put to rest. Not only has accomplished director Wan created a decent superhero film in an extended universe that feels tonally convoluted, but possibly its strongest entry. That's not to say it's perfect, there is dampness in the far corners of Atlantis. But ""my man"", what a ride! Set after the events of 'Justice League', Arthur must step forward to be king of Atlantis and stop his half-brother from creating a war with the surface world. There's a phrase that has been circulating within the inner workings of the Internet. ""In Wan we trust"". A director who singlehandedly modernised the horror genre, entered the 'Fast & Furious' to create its best entry and conceptualised 'Saw', one of the most renowned horror franchises of all time. He is what makes Aquaman work. He is what gives life to the seven seas. He is why he is often the secret weapon in franchises. He understands any genre that is given to him. This solo endeavour, that rarely references other DCEU films, conforms to the cheesiness and blockbusting entertainment of earlier successes. From cringe-inducing one liners (""Permission to come aboard?"") to humour that often falls flat (""I could've just peed on it""), it often seems like it sets itself up for failure. However, because of this it surprisingly gives charm to the film and personality to its characters. It's so light in tone, purposefully juxtaposing the darker narratives of other entries, that it feels fresher than freshwater. Wan's eye for visual spectacle and intrinsically immersive action proves that it's not trying to be the next 'The Dark Knight'. Grand in scope, yet a personal tale of leadership for Arthur that enables his character to develop from a careless brute to a genuine role of idolisation. Considering the 143 minute runtime, it was paced methodically. Never did I feel the need to look at my watch, a rare achievement for any lengthy blockbuster.As the trailers suggest, the primary insight into Wan's ambitious creation is the use of visual effects. There were one or two scenes that physically gave me goosebumps. The design and architecture of Atlantis was awe-inspiring. Each building upholding a sense of modern personality, and each inhabitant spreading ancient history. Vivid neon colours invade your sight, as you sit back holding your breathe whilst being submerged into this otherworldly fantasy. With the help of Gregson-Williams' euphoric score, the world of Atlantis truly came to life. These visuals are then utilised during action sequences in order to stylise them. Wan tends to experiment with his camerawork (switching from POV to 360 rotational panning to ambitious one take shots) which invites you into the combat. Simple choreographed fights involving tridents soon escalate into kingdoms battling each other on giant crustaceans and hammerhead sharks. The range is splendid and maintains the entertainment. Momoa, Heard, Wilson and Kidman all getting involved within these sequences. The performances, for the most part, were good. Momoa is in his element and embracing every opportunity as the leading actor. Both his physicality and demeanour suit the role of Arthur Curry. Heard was also decent as Mera, the two interacting with each other often to create comedic moments. Although the end relationship is somewhat predictable, it was still pleasant to watch. Wilson also held his own (as always) as the primary antagonist. Kidman and Lundgren though were slightly dry and probably needed more time in the water.There are however faults that makes this a wet affair occasionally. The screenplay needed more work and is the weakest aspect to the film. Often relying on exposition, it never truly embraces its characters and instead settles for scope rather than nuance. For example, the secondary antagonist Black Manta was horrifically underdeveloped and unfortunately felt like an afterthought. Only showing up during action sequences and nothing more. Even the Ocean Master himself wasn't particularly developed enough to make you understand his viewpoint (aside from humanity destroying its waters). Wan has so many ideas, so many locations that he wants to showcase, that the narrative occasionally feels like shallow set pieces rather than a deep story. The ""Ring of Fire"" challenge fight sequence does accentuate the often poor human CGI, turning a pivotal moment into more of a distraction. I also found the conclusion underwhelming and rushed, in a bid to open itself up to a sequel. Still, in Wan we trust and fortunately his trust was justified. Aquaman is a nautical adventure that is sure to reinvigorate the extended universe that crumbled before it.",Aquaman
60,Ed-Shullivan,"Is it a good movie? Yes it is...... Is it a great movie? No, far from it.",7,2 April 2019,"Mrs. Shullivan and I spent our Sunday afternoon waiting to relax in front of our TV while watching Aquaman and when I plopped the disc in and started to get involved with the characters we were both quite impressed. Nicole Kidman's performance as Queen Atlanna who falls in love with the lighthouse keeper Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison) was a great start. The birth of their son Arthur and his eventual maturity into our land and sea hero Aquaman (Jason Momoa) was very entertaining as well.Willem Dafoe who plays Vulko, as both the principle advisor and conscience of the self-annointed King Orm (PatrickWilson) as well as the battle weary instructor to King Orm's half brother Aquaman is also a key role in the storyline.My interest started waning when we were introduced to the cartoonish raven haired sea queen Mera (Amber Heard) who although she was promised to wed King Orm, is obviously smitten by Aquaman and his constant grunting. It is about at this juncture when Mera and Aquaman are teamed up with Vulko in an effort to stop King Orm from proceeding with his diabolical plan to join all the sea kings under his leadership against the earth's surface humans to wipe us off the face of the world when we realize a battle is brewing. Up until this juncture the use of CGI was utilized sparingly and with good taste. As the two half brothers King Orm (Patrick Wilson) and Aquaman (Jason Momoa) are pitted against each other both feeling the presence of their missing mother Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) the film takes a sharp turn to the left and the writer/producer/director's take the cheap way out and rely mainly on CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) to complete their epic story line. So much of the same crash and burn CGI as in many other prior Marvel films it is quite frankly a bore.As the last ten (10) minutes of the film ending kind of redeems the preceding 45 minutes of far too much CGI, if a sequel is to be made Jasom Momoa as Aquaman, Patrick Wilson as King Orm and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna are worthy of a repeat, but I strongly urge the producers to forget about Mera (Amber Heard) and replace her with a more energized and realistic female lead that can act (boy was she baaaaad).I have assessed the overall film with a decent 7 out of 10 rating. The first half is exciting - the second half is mostly CGI and a bit of a let down, not like in the ocean but similar to a stinky toilet flushing.",Aquaman
61,damianphelps,Aquaman or Power Rangers,6,14 November 2020,"Overall I felt this was an adequate addition to the DC universe without being particularly stellar.The visuals are amazing.Momoa was actually good. He has some ground to make up for me, he destroyed Conan, so he did good things with the Aquaman character.My problem with the film are the occasional jarring occurrences. Temuera Morrison de-aging look as Aquaman Senior is horrible, I kept looking at him as though he had been in a terrible accident! Nicole Kidman was miss-cast, not her fault but I felt she just didn't fit, you see her rather than her character.The most jarring...Manta OMG simply awful. When they fight in Sicily the whole tone of the movie shifts to Power Rangers. Its terrible.Aside from those moments (and in a 2 and half hour movie they don't amount to too much screen time) its not a bad effort.Lets see where it leads!",Aquaman
62,digitalbeachbum,Everything shiny but no substance,1,7 April 2019,"People who write screen plays know one thing, how to make a boring movie. They use one formula to create a movie which people will go to watch but then never want to see it again because the replay value is ZERO.Movies with substance have replay value. A movie such as Citizen Cane, Glory, Lincoln, Clockwork Orange, Gone with the Wind, Grapes of Wrath, Dr. Strangelove or To Kill a Mockingbird. All great movies which you can watch again to see a lesson in life about real people with real problems, played by great actors and great directors and great screen writers.Yes, Aquaman is fantasy, but it lacks a connection to being a person. There is no desire to know the main character or cheer for them. You already know they are going to win. You already know they will succeed. The writing is so bad, that they show you the ""finishing move"" for the final battle which is never used at any other time in the movie. It's a copy cat script of several dozen other movies in the last fifty years where the hero is predicted to win while in the same breath told he can't win.Gee, I wonder what is going to happen at the end?YAWN!Sure the action is good, there are some good fight scenes, but most of it was just a bunch of CGI thrown in for the big summer block buster formula. It lacked any fight scenes which I would want to see more than once.Another thing which bothered me is the choice of casting. Aquaman is supposed to be from Atlantis. He isn't a half breed. He isn't from the South Pacific. The story of the people from Atlantis is from the Mediterranean. Why do you think the Atlantic Ocean is called that? Its because of Atlantis!!So in closing. BARF. The movie sucks. Just another crappy movie pumped out by crappy Hollywood.",Aquaman
63,matthewssilverhammer,one of DC's best in years,7,4 February 2020,"Resplendent visuals. Like...super great. Not only is the superhero action wonderful, but the design of the worlds and costumes is full of unique color. Much like Asgard in the first Thor movie (another underrated man-in-tights flick), you'll either buy into the ridiculousness of the Atlantis or you won't; I found it refreshingly bold. On the other hand...atrocious dialogue. Like...super bad (""In Atlantis, our tears are washed away."" ""Here, we have to feel them."").",Aquaman
64,arfdawg-1,This is Not an Even Marginally Good Movie,2,10 February 2019,"Wow. The only thing good in this film is Nicole Kidman who is an extraordinary actress. Other than that, the movie is a mess of crappy redundant fight scenes, unbelievably BAD CGI garbage that should go down in history as the most horrible CGI ever, poor writing and just a plain BAD production.The story is predictable and dumb. Oh, AND poorly told.I was bored out of my mind. If you actually liked this movie, there is something slow about you.",Aquaman
65,southdavid,Dampen your enthusiasm,5,18 December 2018,"I'm at a bit of a quandary about how to review ""Aquaman"" here. It's not good, that's fair to say but I've a strange feeling it's about as good as its ridiculous source material would allow it to be.Jason Momoa is Arthur Curry. Hilariously he's supposed to be 29 years old. He's also the son of Atlanna, fleeing queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman) and Tom, a lighthouse keeper, played (in unconvincing de-aging CGI by Temurea Morrison). His half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) threatens to unite the undersea kingdoms and wage war on the land dwellers, so Arthur returns home to challenge his brother for control of the undersea realms.So, whilst it's not really acting as such, Jason Momoa is always watchable and his charisma will carry you through quite a distance. The film also has a few decent action sequences along the way, particularly the underwater battle that concludes it and the opening fight scene on board a submarine. That's about it for the positives though.On dozens of occasions, ""Aquaman"" is laugh out loud hilariously awful. The plot is terrible, a cliché ridden McGuffin hunt, a painfully obvious twist towards the end and some awful foreshadowing plot points. It has, noticeably, terrible music choices throughout - a horrible score of pretend wonder. The rest of the performances apart from Momoa are dreadful, particularly Willem Defoe and Dolph Lundgren but nobody else comes off particularly well. It's the script though, that should have been drowned. From ""This was your grandfathers knife, he was a frogman in World War 2, then they turned their back on him"" onwards it's a terrible collection of recycled everything you've heard before in action movies for the last thirty years. It's painfully unaware how unfunny it is too.The CGI is patchy, happier with real creatures and vehicles than it is with fictional characters. It often ignores its own internal logic too, at one point Curry hangs onto to a building to avoid a ten foot drop - but before and after that he happily falls hundreds of feet and shrugs it off. Conventional weapons can't damage Curry, until towards the end, where one can. Nobody runs away when a shark starts to crack an aquarium wall.Sadly, I'm not convinced there is a better ""Aquaman"" movie possible than this one but I'm not sure that's any reason to pretend this one is any good.",Aquaman
66,Vartiainen,Colourful extravaganza,8,28 January 2019,"In my mind Aquaman has the honour of being the second honestly good DC film after Wonder Woman. And once again it's due to it straying away from the usual DC/Zack Snyder/Christopher Nolan clichés. This is a colourful action blast full of good humour, interesting locations, bright lights, majestic set pieces and enough eye candy to paint a house with. True, the story is still bit of a mess, it's trying to do perhaps a thing or two too many at once, but it's more than entertaining enough to rise above such petty concerns.Two great things to single out. First is the direction of James Wan. Mainly a horror director before this, he brings with him this great energy and passion. This feels like an epic. Like a great superhero film should. He also has a really good style when it comes to action scenes. Like in Wonder Woman, all the action scenes in this film are easy to follow, mostly shot at wide view, with very little shaky cam employed. And surprise of surprises, it makes it really entertaining to watch when you can actually see what's going on and can appreciate all the effort that went into making it.The second great thing is Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry, the eponymous Aquaman. Amazing physical presence, very good with action scenes and practically made for the role, despite his looks being rather far from the original character. And he has some serious comedic chops, which this character sorely needs. Because, let's face it, a superhero who talks to fish is not the easiest sell in the world, but Momoa makes it work.Granted, the villain side of things is still a bit lacking, the story is messy, some of the side characters are rather weak, and there are more than a few hiccups scattered throughout.But, the film still delivers. I walked out of the theater with a big smile on my face and I'd more than gladly see the film again. And that's the most important thing.",Aquaman

He travels to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis where his half-brother, King Orm (Wilson) rules and tries to stop him from destroying our world, but must prove to be worthy of the throne. Dafoe (Spider-Man) plays Vulko, Arthur's mentor and Heard (The Ward) plays Mera, a princess who helps and finds romance with Arthur. Dolph Lundgren (Rocky IV), Nicole Kidman (Dead Calm) and Temuera Morrison (The Island of Dr. Moreau) are also featured.

Will Aquaman find his birth mother and choose which world to stay?Overall I thought it was a good flick,with alot of action sequences and the acting was good too.Julie Andrews makes a surprise cameo too (just her voice can be heard).

69,jamesrupert2014,More of the same from DC,7,27 December 2018,"The origin story of the 'Aquatic Ace' (Jason Momoa) folds into a somewhat incoherent tale of the titular submarine superhero saving us surface dwellers from extirpation by his villainous half-brother and self-proclaimed 'Ocean Master' Orm (Patrick Wilson) while simultaneously dealing with super-villain ""Black Manta"" (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II; who looks more like a fruitfly than his namesake batoid fish). Accompanying him is bottle-ginger Mera (Amber Heard), a warrior-princess with the ability to manipulate water in whatever way the plot requires. Needless to say, the two Atlanteans 'meet cute' and then follow the standard relationship trajectory from swapping insults to swapping spit. While agreeable eye-candy in her fishy catsuit, I found the 'Mera' character to be the worst part of the film and the quippy, trite relationship with Aquaman to be more irritating than endearing. Momoa is fine in a not particularly challenging role (the standard-issue, wisecracking, gruff, heroic demigod) as is the rest of the cast (William Dafoe as trusted mentor Nuidis Vulko is given a little more to work with than the rest of the 2D tropes). After a reasonably good first act, the film begins to stretch even the most generous suspension of disbelief when Aquaman and Mera jump out of a plane and hit the ground with no more than a grunt and a couple of quips. There are lots of heroic poses, three point power landings, overly choreographed and unconvincing fight scenes, all set to a pretentious soundtrack and cumulating in the expected climatic showdown between a bunch of characters that we haven't been given enough time (or reason) to care about. The film is spectacular to look at and the 3D cinematography in the version I watched was reasonably effective. I probably would have rated the film a point higher if I had watched it without sound but a point lower if I thought about it more. I am surprised at the scarcity of points in the 'goofs' section, considering the extreme cartoon physics of most of the 'underwater' scenes.",Aquaman

It was just too much there.However for most of the film it felt like an adventure, that is an improvement over Wonder Women which felt too much like it was trying to be the Dark Knight.Unfortunately, Aquaman goes into Dark Knight territory enough to irritate the audience. That was my complaint about MOST DCEU films, they aren't made to fit the character, they are all just Batman clones.It should have stuck with the adventure feel and been a great film.Instead it went in the same direction that ruined Wonder Women and every other DC film of late, it tried to emulate Batman",Aquaman

My bottom line is that it was a fine movie, one that doesn't hinder DC's continuing effort to make movies. It does feature some strong performances (Momoa, Heard, Kidman, Wilson), but there's way too many myths and legends crammed in. In fact, there were times when I felt like I was watching an Indiana Jones movie than a superhero movie. There were more Maguffins in this movie than there were human actors. Also, while one certainly must suspend one's disbelief for these movies, it's counterintuitive to proclaim certain rules for a new (to the audience) setting and then either ignore those rules or break them outright. It's also not a good idea for a hero or heroine to forget they have certain abilities until the plot says it's time to wrap up the scene And let's try to ignore the cliches, while we're at it.

""Aquaman"" tells a story that's actually quite similar to ""The Legend of King Arthur,"" and revolves around half-human/half-Atlantean Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) becoming Aquaman in order to prevent war between the underwater kingdom of Atlantis and the human world. ""Aquaman"" is much different from James Wan's previous films - of course, ""Saw."" The film (especially in its underwater sequences) looks fantastic and is beautiful to look at, but that's really all I got out of it.

It's really no different from many other big-budget superhero films of late, especially those produced by rival Marvel.

This movie is based on a comic book character that was created in 1941. Thank goodness their inspiration is based specifically on a more updated story line from 2011, and not the 40's, 50's and 60's incarnation. Aquaman was not a real popular hero back in those days. In fact, lots of people would often make fun of his powers-he talked to fish. Although their are several nods to those more silly years-remember Topo the octopus? Well, he makes a cameo. The movie is directed by James Wan, who is more known for his horror films-such as the Conjuring , Insidious & Saw. Jason plays Arthur Curry-aka Aquaman-the half breed created by a human father and an Atlantean mother, who learns he is an heir to the throne of the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. However, he has no interest in the title and just wants to stay on the surface world. Nicole plays his mother. Jason's half brother Patrick, believes that he should rule-since he is a full blooded Atlantean. For the comic book crowd, Patrick's name is Orm, aka the Ocean Master. Amber-aka Mera-shows up to the surface world to try and change Jason's mind and come rule as the king. Otherwise, Patrick will declare war on the surface dwellers. Battles insue and it's an action packed CGI extravaganza, especially after another villain named Black Manta shows up. There are a few cameo actors that pop up-I liked the Dolph Lundgren one-and there is a scene just as the end credits start that hints at the next movie, but nothing at the very end.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci_fi violence, action and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 23 minutes.

77,XweAponX,Ronon Dex harpoons Aquaman,10,5 July 2019,"I've been a fan of Aquaman since the 60's, so I'll take my own counsel about this film over anyone who was not even born at the time I was originally reading Aquaman comics. If you never read these comics as a child? If you never collected them, if you never watched the Superman-Aquaman ""Hour of Adventure"" cartoon show from the late 60's every Saturday morning with your brother, then you ain't qualified to review it, really. If you have, if you have taken the time do you find reprints and trade paperbacks of the old stories, well then that's good. A person should try to be at least a little bit familiar with the character before watching this. And if you don't have the money to buy a bunch of used comic books, then there is Wikipedia and other online sources that are pretty good that can fill you in with the uniqueness of this character, because once you understand the character, you will see why I highly appreciate this film.Even though I stopped actively collecting in the 70's, I still kept up with the history of the character. Aquaman was originally a Blonde haired Blue eyed Seawater Breathing, Seahorse Riding gent who could talk to fish and swim around in the deep but not much else. He was the King of Atlantis, and so his comic books always dealt with his administration of the underwater Kingdom while his adventures with the Justice League of America sometimes took him to other planets. He's saved Superman more than once, and at one time, he grew his hair out long and lost one of his hands, replacing it with a Hook. He became a much darker, more unkempt and disheveled figure, much like Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight"" version of Batman, which in my opinion Ben Affleck was the greatest depiction of.Aquaman, this Aquaman, is the undersea, super powered version of The Dark Knight. And Jason Momoa, who became famous playing Ronon Dex in Stargate Atlantis (another fable which included Atlantis), has been the first and best version of Aquaman. I don't think anyone can take it from here.I really don't know the state of the DC Cinematic Universe at this time, Zack Snyder started it with his Man of Steel, which lead up to the creation of The Justice League, and it is sad, very sad, that this story is not continuing. Or is it? I think I see plans for Aquaman II and Justice League II. But other New films are planned which are basically reboots of what Zack Snyder created. I don't want that, I want to see a second Justice League movie which includes the characters as they are now.Aquaman is one of the latest films to be told in the DCCU, and it caps off the tale with a threat that grows from the deep, Arthur Curry has a half-brother (Played by Patrick Wilson, Nite Owl from Watchmen, and I admit he is very handsome as an Atlantean) who wants to be crowned ""Ocean Master"" which will empower him to make war upon the surface. Arthur has to prevent this somehow, and his adventures take him to Atlantis, The Sahara, my Homeland Sicily, and finally The Marianas Trench/Challenger Deep - To meet a unique creature that has killed everyone who has ever come face to ""face"" with it. Can Arthur survive this?Now, the one thing about this film is that there appears to be a huge knock down drag out fight every 5 minutes. But, they are well choreographed. I thought The Atlanteans had too many Gizmos. Those are my only complaints.I thought it was cool that Nicole Kidman is his mom while Bobba Fett's Clone-Pop is his Dad. And his GF ""Mera"" (Amber Heard, hm, she was married to Capn Jack Sparrow?), so it's an all in the family affair.Mainly I loved that a character that I loved as a child has finally been given their own film, and a guy I like played him. That's all anyone can ask.Notice - Since this review is pretty much the same as the other review that somehow got posted before this one, I'm removing ""spoilers"", because I did not really put any spoilers in here.

78,alindsay-al,A Great Unique comic book film,8,19 December 2018,"I have been anticipating this film for a long time and now Aquaman has come and I thought this was a great film that hopefully gets the DC Universe back on its feet. The premise of the film sees Arthur Curry having to travel to Atlantis to stop his half brother from waging a war on the surface world. Jason Mamoa plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman and I think he is really great in this film, he is very charismatic in this film and has a real presence about him. His character has alot of development and depth added to him in this film that improve from his previous appearance in Justice League. The supporting cast all do a great job aswell, Amber Heard plays Mera and she is a much betetr character here then she was in her scene in Justice League. She was more bright and interesting in this film with a unique personality that really worked with her and Mamoa's chemistry that was great to watch on screen. Patrick Wilson plays Orm/ Ocean Master and he was a great villain for this film, he has got similarities to Loki and Killmonger but I thought he did a good job in this film to give the audience a possibly layered villain that makes there confrontation more intersting. I also thought, Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lundgren & Willem Dafoe did a really good job with their roles as the more experienced actors on show. Another shoutout is the character of Black Manta who looks amazing on screen and was an interesting character, however, he wasn't in the film enough to leave me fully satisfied by his character. The story is interesting seeing this guy having to step up for a society he isn't really accepted in, plus I do find a sibling rivalry to be very interesting. But this films plot is very bloated, they try to fit so much story into this film that certain elements such as Black Manta get lost in the shuffle and end up not getting the attention that they needed. The script is great, the drama is well done and provides some pretty emotional moments, also the humour in the film came across well and felt pretty natural to me. The style of the film is a huge talking point in this film and i must say that mostly it looks amazing. Seeing these beautiful underwater fight scenes and cities is great and it felt like were beingintroduced to a new community. Though especially at the beginning of the film the CGI isn't completely up to par and takes you out of the film but it improves as the film progresses. Overall Aquaman is another hit for DC after Wonder Woman and is definitley worth a watch maybe even in 3D.",Aquaman
79,CubsandCulture,"An improvement for DC. It is still a garish, ugly mess.",4,4 June 2019,"My biggest problem with the film is the overall design is, to be blunt, a psychedelic blur with no proper sense of scope. Each section of the film has its own fundamentally incompatible aesthetic. On their own each of the Kingdoms can be quite beautiful but there was no thought of how they fit together. More problematic, the various sections are all, by narrative, descended from a single source but don't actually look they do. (I just don't see the connection between say the Fishmen and the Kingdom of the Brine). This gives the film a very episodic feel and the tone never quite settles into a coherent film. The film is very ugly as a result.It doesn't help that the storyline is overly complicated. A bit like Black Panther the film is rooted in Hamlet and when it sticks to its royal drama structure it is compelling. Yet the film feels the need to inject the MacGruffin questline and an (rushed) origin story for Manta to pad its run time. The characters are too often going from point A to point B with no time to breath. I still am not sure what the extent of Aquaman's, and others', abilities are. No one seemed to suffer from any flaws. The story is a jumble of ideas. And when such concepts as ""ocean master!"" is part of the story it becomes laughable quite quickly.Unlike most DC films this one doesn't suffer from the brooding, humorless tone. Aquaman, the character, is at least engaging and charming. He isn't saddled with just tragic backstory to be oh so dark. Now the film is still quite bad but at least DC seems to be aware of the problems. Hopefully they will one day make a good film.But we are still waiting that day.",Aquaman
80,iquine,Gallons of CGI,8,14 September 2019,"(Flash Review)This is a visual smorgasbord of fantastic underwater places, people, creatures and action. What else would you expect? The story overview is Arthur Curry, who is born on land, discovers he is half human and half Atlanteean descent, which actually makes him heir to the throne of the kingdom of Atlantis. Neato! Bummer his mean half-brother Orm is currently ruling. So you guessed it, Arthur must discover his true purpose and ability while securing the throne. This was fun Hollywood action fluff with a decent story and oodles of 'mammouthly' majestic and spectacularly cliché shots that came with such frequency it was a little bit corny and silly while mixing in intended dashes of humor. The water effects and accurate water physics were very well-done and spectacular yet a bit too glossy looking. Whatever, this is a popcorn movie so sit back and relax.",Aquaman
81,mattkratz,good superhero film,8,5 May 2019,"As far as superhero movies go, this wasn't too bad. The cinematography was the main highlight, especially the underwater and battle scenes. I like the way they told Arthur Curry/Aquaman's background story. The scenes with his father, brother, and mentor were all first rate. The lead actor was a tad bit wooden in his part and it was cliche ridden, but other than that it was a good movie. I loved the scene in the bar and the aquarium scene!** 1/2 out of ****",Aquaman

84,kirbylee70-599-526179,OCEAN MASTER,10,4 April 2019,"Director James Wan and actor Jason Mamoa have done what many considered impossible. They've taken the comic book character of Aquaman, long considered to be the lamest of comic book heroes, and turned him into one of the coolest action stars on film. Not an easy task and yet together they make it appear easy.The film opens in the past when a wounded Queen Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) washes ashore near a lighthouse in Maine in 1985. Thomas Curry (Temuera Morrison), the lighthouse keeper, finds her and takes her to his home, nursing her back to health. The pair fall in love and soon have a child together they name Arthur. But the forces of Atlantis, searching for Atlanna, have found her and come to take her back failing to do so when she battles them off. Realizing the only way to keep Arthur safe is to return she does so.Years later a group of tech pirates led by Jesse Kane (Michael Beach) along with his son David (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) attempt to steal a Russian sub killing those on board they encounter. But their plans are foiled when the now grown Arthur (Mamoa) lifts the sub to the surface, boards it and takes out the pirates. When a hand to hand battle finds David fall Arthur is shot by Jesse only to rise again. As he attempts to leave, Jesse shoots at him dislodging a missile that pins him. Unable to lift the missile David pleads for help and Arthur refuses leaving them behind. David is forced to leave his father behind to die and swears revenge.Once more time passes and now we move on to the undersea world of Atlantis where King Orm (Patrick Wilson) is trying to unite the undersea kingdoms to attack the surface world in retaliation for the constant damage they do to the seas. By his side is advisor Nuidis Vulko (Willem Defoe) who has secretly been training Arthur at the request of the now dead queen. Before Orm can unite the various underwater tribes Mera (Amber Heard), the daughter of King Nereus (Dolph Lundgren) king of one of these tribes, seeks Arthur for his help in stopping Orm.Arthur refuses saying he wants nothing to do with the undersea kingdom. Mera warns him that this won't stop Orm from attacking the surface world. As Arthur drives his father home a tidal wave hits the shore and only the assistance of Mera can help him save him. This is the first launch of Orm's attack and causes Arthur to reconsider.Traveling to Atlantis he learns about a long lost trident that only someone worthy is supposed to be able to wield. He just needs to find it. Before he and Mera can set about their quest they are found by Orm's men and a face-off between the two step-brothers must take place. All of this and we're not even half way through the movie! But it sets in motion the search for the trident, Arthur's change from super-powered mortal to potential ruler of the sea and the possible salvation of Atlantis and the world. Not bad for a first solo outing for the character.So what makes it exceptional? I'm slowly becoming a movie goer who is tired of the overuse of special effects in films. But at the same time I'm aware that movies about superheroes lend themselves to special effects just to present them properly. And this film does exactly that, using them to surround the action and not take over. The undersea world of Atlantis is a view to behold, a combination of light and texture fueled by color that delights the eyes. Wan's experience with effects in previous films lends itself well on that count. The entire team behind the film has done an amazing job.But if the character comes off too corny or too serious the film would fall flat as well. Mamoa does a fantastic job here combining the right amount of humor with the muscle bound super heroics needed to bring the character to life. He does so with ease making the character not only believable but actually cool in the process. He even makes the much mocked orange and green outfit associated with Aquaman look great.DC films haven't fared as well as the Marvel films in the past and the main reason I've always felt was their compulsion to portray their comic universe as dark and gritty. Even the bright colored costume of Superman somehow turned dark. With WONDER WOMAN and now this film they're taking a new direction and the box office has shown it's working. Hopefully they'll continue down this path. AQUAMAN is an adventure, a love story, a comic book hero tale and a movie that doesn't overdo the message about pollution so much that it damages the rest of the film. Kids will love the character, moms will drool over Mamoa and dads will enjoy the action. It's a movie that the entire family can and should enjoy more than once. I know it will take a place on my shelf.",Aquaman
85,juneebuggy,Boba Fett is Aquaman's dad. A non superhero fan review,5,1 November 2019,"Worth watching just for Jason Mamo's opening shot; shirtless, from behind, he stands, flips his hair back and gives a cheeky grin. Yup there's your price of admission. Ha, truthfully I only watched this for Jason Mamoa, I'm not a fan of all the comic book movies, so have no idea what the Justice League is or where this fits into the deluge of superhero movies.So this is a origin story and on that note Boba Fett is Aquaman's dad. Cool. He (Temuera Morrison) gets it on with Nicole Kidman and somehow they produce Mamoa?! Boy grows up, gets some teachings and then he returns to his mothers home to challenge his half brother king Orm to preserve the balance between the surface world and the ancient civilization of Atlantis.There is a ton of CGI in this, most of the movie is CGI, there is a quest to find a triton in the desert, there is a girl Aquaman hangs with, Dolph Lungren and Willem Dafoe both float about underwater with weird hair and shiny outfits, there is a big battle, giant seahorses, strange soldier/roboty type guys with big guns. Jason Mamoa looks good throughout. Justice prevails.",Aquaman
86,kluseba,Predictable fun,7,10 January 2019,"Aquaman is another exchangeable superhero movie but it's so dynamic and visually stunning that you won't care about the insultingly predictable plot and the repetitive superhero tropes.The movie has a short and appropriate introduction before the epic adventure unfolds and ends on a concise positive note going back to its opening sequence. The underwater world looks fantastic and especially the animals like sharks are lovely. The quest that leads the main character and his female sidekick across the planet includes stunning locations like Sicily and Morocco that offer a welcome change from the seas. The settings are carefully chosen and cleverly mixed with computer animations. Director James Wan filmed everything calmly, extravagantly and precisely. Even the dramatic action scenes like the breathtaking escape sequence in Sicily avoid shaky cameras and exaggerated special effects which makes the film enjoyable to watch from start to finish. The final duel between the courageous half-breed protagonist and his sinister half-brother is visually spectacular and emotionally engaging.You will get exactly what you expect from this movie: shallow but gripping entertainment for the whole family with a big budget. It's pleasant while it lasts but also quickly forgotten because of predictable tropes, an overall tiresome story and mostly average acting performances. Up next, let's create another exchangeable superhero movie called Airwoman, Earthtransgender or Firetiger.",Aquaman
87,Pairic,Great Effects & Action But a Bit Overlong.,7,3 January 2019,"Aquaman: The Aquaman I knew and loved when I was a comic reading kid had short hair, was clean shaven and wore spandex. Now we have a hydro-hippie who looks like a young, well fed, Willie nelson. This is a good film but is overlong and contains some terrible dialogue. The general acting and effects make up for this though.The wonderful undersea city of Atlantis could be a submerged L.A. from Blade Runner as mini-subs ape the actions of flying-cars. There are Merpeople, Lobster lads and lassies, even creatures from the Trench who resemble Giger's Alien. These are regressed tribes of Atlantis who exist alongside the Human tribes. We see the fall of Atlantis in thew distant past when man's hubris brought about it's destruction. Striking back at te surface-dwellers the Atlanteans send tsunamis crashing ashore, wrecking naval ships and returning decades of pollution to the land.Aquaman wants to prevent war between the occupants of the land and the denizens of the depth, but to do this the half-blood prince will have to claim the throne of Atlantis. Meanwhile he's managed to annoy a pirate who pursues a blood vendetta against him. All good fun if a tad drawn out. 7/10.",Aquaman

They put Pitbull's remix of Toto!!! Are they crazy???",Aquaman
89,Enchorde,A lot of fighting but little else,5,12 January 2019,"Aquaman is special effects extra vaganza, but seriously lacks in plot, character development and some serious directorial decisions.So, in just about the first scene we learn that Arthur, or Aquaman as he is known as, is pretty much invincible. He takes a grenade in the chest and doesn't get a scratch. So, physically, you can't get to him. For a movie that is just about 150 minutes of fighting, that is kind of a problem. Yes, I know, the hero will win in all movies, but it is easier to get engaged into a movie if there actually is a theoretical chance the hero might get hurt. Kind of a basic rule with heroes; they should have a a weakness. Something that his enemies might exploit. Superman's kryptonite is a fine example. Aquaman seems to have no weakness. Sure, atlantean technology can cut his skin, but even when he is stabbed or shot with plasma (strong enough to make stone explode) he isn't much worse for wear. Not to stop fighting anyway, or deliver some oneliner.Not even when Aquaman acquires the superweapon Atlan's trident, guarded by the ancient powerful monster Karathen, are there any suspense. There actually is no fight at all. So, the movie seriously lacks suspense. What's worse is, Arthur himself doesn't seem to think there is any either. He mostly cracks som weak jokes and seem to take very little seriously (so why should we?). Another side effect of all the weak jokes and fighting is that Arthur and Mera never really develops any chemistry.And why, aside from setting up a sequel, was Black Mantha in the movie at all? It didn't need more fights, and that was about all you got out of that character (you might have used it to explore and develop Arthur's relationship with his father - a possible weakness). And when the movie is full of action, and running over 150 minutes, you might want to consider sutting a subplot out.Visually, the movie is stunning. The settings in Atlantis is wondrous, and I really liked the use of electronic music and the neon lights (got some flashbacks of Tron there). However, it is not enough to carry a movie. Still, the action is good, so it is not like inte isn't an entertaining movie. But, it doesn't really live up to the competition.",Aquaman
90,aidanratesmovies,"Messy, but certainly a otherworldly experience",6,23 March 2019,"Aquaman has many faults. Between its messy script, bloated stature, and the fact that it is just too freaking long, you think it would be a total miss. However, what Aquaman lacks in all of these categories, it makes up for with trying actors, and jaw dropping action scenes. The film is predictable at time, and has quite a few cliches, but even with a hard to follow setup (or hard to watch, depending on how you look at it) Aquaman leaves you cheering at the end by a pure sense of an underdog story line. The film has flaws, as does its protagonist, but by the end it'll win your heart, even after the struggles it has made you deal with along the way. The first half of the film can seem like a drag at times, but the second half makes up enough for it. It isn't perfect, but it's a decent try for DC studios, and one that will definitely not be forgotten.My Rating: 6.3/10.",Aquaman

Visually, it's what I imagine a drug trip to look like. So many bright, swirling colors, vivid and vibrant.The biggest problem this movie has isn't actually its problem. It's the DCEU that it's forced to be a part of. The kaleidoscope of colors in Aquaman are stunning, but are a complete departure from the rest of the universe it's set in. Jason Mamoa is a fun guy to watch and has real potential as an action star but, Bro-seidon of Justice League still lingers in memory.Were this a stand alone film, it might rank higher for me.

Quiet moments are rare, and in any case poignant. The water graphics are amazing, and often tasteful. I really don't understand critics who deride this work as too over the top. Over the top is the job of movies and the wonder of our age. If too much cgi bothers you, you should pay for a theatre ticket instead. What a relief this movie is, I can't thank it enough for being all in. A wondrous experience. This is the sort of movie that easily sustains itself for over two jaw-dropping hours.

95,davidmvining,"Expensive Looking, for sure",3,7 July 2020,"I'll have to write through the DCEU at some point, but I guess I'm starting here. I'm one of those weird people that really likes Zack Snyder's take on the Superman and Batman stories. There's real cinematic ambition at work there, and while its reach may exceed its grasp, it tries to be mythic in scope. James Wan's Aquaman is a very different animal. It's certainly big and obviously very expensive, but the film feels smaller, and its not the stakes at play. Also, it seems obvious that Wan's time making mediocre popcorn horror films have not taught him the ins and outs of how to build a story.Looking through some positive reviews of the film I see some common themes. There's a lot of praise for the visuals, the special effects, the action, and the humor. Well, the movie certainly very often looks quite expensive and it sometimes does look pretty good (especially the Trench attack late in the film), but this is mostly praise for a film's ability to hire hundreds of visual effects artists more than anything else. A lot of this is to do with the movie's poor world building.The story first, though. Arthur Curry is the son of the queen of Atlantis and some guy who lives in a house by the sea in New England. Being the son of the queen of Atlantis, he has special water powers like breathing underwater and swimming really fast and, apparently, being just this side of invincible. After his mother gets torn from him at a very young age, Nuidis, the vizier from Atlantis, comes and trains him for years in short little scenes that don't even amount to a training montage. After the events of Justice League, Arthur is somewhat responsible for the death of a pirate, leaving the pirate's son itching for murder. In the middle of the ocean, Orm, Arthur's half-brother from their mother and another Atlantian, is consolidating power to become the Ocean Master and wage war on the surface. This doesn't sit well with Nuidis or Mera, Orm's betrothed and daughter to another of the sea kings. They go off to recruit Arthur to challenge Orm and become King of Atlantis.So, when this movie isn't giving us really expensive special effects shots of submarines, giant seahorses, and vibrantly colored underwater cities, it's giving us really boring scenes where people with names we cannot remember explain things to other people with names we cannot remember. In most movies, these would be done in bland environments, but in Aquaman, they're done in, well, bland environments with some thin layers of water effects around them. Seriously, most of the world building in this film is Orm flatly explaining to people his plan to consolidate power without giving us a clear view of who in Earth he's talking about.Then, for really inexplicable reasons, the movie decides to become an Indiana Jones knockoff for about forty minutes where Arthur and Mera have to take a thing to a place where they get another thing which they have to take to another place which directs them to another place and finally directs them to the Trench, one of the seven kingdoms under the sea. This is where the funny is supposed to come in, but like pretty much every scene in the film, nothing here feels fleshed out enough to carry any amount of character beyond some quick quips (which, of course, means that Arthur and Mera are going to totally fall in love by the end). I would say it's an excuse to get them out of the way of Orm so that Orm can consolidate more power while they're away, but they end up trapped in the Trench with no escape at one point. Instead of having a forty minute and unsatisfying Indiana Jones knockoff, they could have given us twenty minutes of the pair trying to find a way out, getting to know each other, and then finding the surprise guest near the end.For a movie that's a hundred and sixty minutes long, it does feel shockingly short in some ways, and that's because it doesn't spend any time with any single scene beyond those that demand lots of special effects, like fights. It's paced very quickly, and that ends up being a bad thing because it makes the film very thin where character interactions feel perfunctory rather than meaningful.And, the special effects. Again, this movie very often looks expensive, but it only occasionally looks good. The approach to the Trench, when Arthur and Mera have to jump from their rinky dink boat and into the water (why two creatures that can swim much faster than a small boat can putter along actually take the boat, I do not know) actually looks really striking as Arthur holds out a series of flares that lights them and the swarm of creatures trying to get to them that surrounds them. However, the flight through Atlantis offers a good counterpoint. It's full of colors and it looks like a team of digital artists spent hundreds of hours each on every little detail to bring it out, but it ends up feeling flat because we don't get any sense of what anything we're seeing is. This is where some actual world building would have benefited the film, allowing us time to explore Atlantis a bit with Arthur as our eye and ears into this new world, learning about what's going on in this fantastic city. Instead, they quickly move to a sunken ship where they hide away from the special effects and then have a fight.I really did not like this movie. It's thin with little focus and an almost complete inability to tell a story. I imagine it's not going to age particularly well for those who were blown away by it on their first viewing.",Aquaman

99,rgkarim,"Aquamantastic! Swimming In With Lots of Visuals, Story, and Action. The Right Direction For DCEU",8,16 December 2018,"In the realm of comic book and superhero movies, DC once sat atop the throne as the champion of the real life, action films about our favorite paper bound heroes. As Marvel studios fell into stride though and secured it's regime, DC has struggled to find the same quality in its work for one reason or another. Despite whatever source of struggles, DC has been limping along from film to film, only shining once with Wonder Woman last year that renewed life. Yet, coming to shore this holiday season, is another beacon of hope in the form of Jason Momoa as the champion of Atlantis Aquaman. With the coming tide of movies, can this film restore faith in the franchise , or does it fall short once more of the glory of superhero films. Robbie K here with a week advanced screening of Aquaman to give his thoughts. Let's get started:Movie: Aquaman 2018Director:
James Wan
Writers:
David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (screenplay by), Will Beall (screenplay by)
Stars:
Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Willem DafoeLIKES:Acting: Momoa's talents as the gruff warrior continue to shine through, only this time much more in your face. It works well, brings the heart of the film in all it's wonder and glory, and really makes for an entertaining hero to watch. As the character develops, Momoa is able to go with it and it works quite well to entertain the masses, plus his abs didn't hurt as the women in my showing were swooning. His sassy partner in crime, Heard did a wonderful job stepping up into the major role, bringing sass, class, and looks that felt in tone with the movie and a great opposite to Momoa's rantings, and again the looks didn't hurt either. The rest of the cast did extraordinary as well, Dafoe's prowess as the vizier and mentor was like something out of a Shakespearean play. Nichole Kidman's performance held regality and love for the time she was in. Patrick Wilson did his job as the grandiose king, extreme in direction, but having enough salt to back up his madness.The Visuals: Leave it to Wan to come up with his own version of Atlantis and bring with it the same flair that he leaves with his other works. The studio's design of the underwater kingdom is solid, a blend of technology, magic, and biology that may seem a bit stereotypical, but captures the prowess of the mighty ancient realm. Past the city itself, the characters have a unique and fantastic design to themselves as each kingdom gets its own look to show a common origin, but still give their evolution different. Other costumes for the warriors had their own edge to it, and I personally liked Mera's costume feeling it was on point compared to her current modern-day image. And when it came to battle scenes, the effects worked quite well given Wan's flashy approach to his films. It feels like a comic book world brought to life and accomplishes the immersion into the nerd culture we love so much.
The Story: It's the classic Aquaman story that we've come to know, a greedy kingdom filled with headstrong rulers whose focus on the one approach drives their goals, while the other tries to find a way to his own identity. For the most part it works, and this Aquaman has enough features of his comic realm to appease most fans with the introduction of Black Manta, the family dynamics that are almost as warped as Game of Thrones, and the developing relationships Arthur has itself. What I liked the most was that even though it is part of a bigger universe, this film was able to tell its own story and stand alone, without relying too much on the other films that came before it. Again it's predictable and cliché, but the tale should be enough to rope people in regardless of what arc you enjoy the most.The Action: You saw it in the films and you know this is meant to be one for the big screen before I even wrote these words. Aquaman is all about the fights and trying to imbue it with some diversity to break away from the other films. It accomplished the goal of bringing a variety of styles to the mix that feels part Fast and Furious, Part Game Of Thrones, and Part DC meeting kung Fu. Special effects lit up the theater in a thunderous display of sound editing that had the theater rumbling like an earthquake. I was drawn into most of the battles, and felt that on some of them they hit the target in the center to really have people jumping in their seats. As such, despite the nearly 2.5 hour run time, there is so much action keeping it moving you won't feel to bogged down by the time constraint.
DISLIKES:The Episodic presentation: Wan jammed a lot of things into this film, and while I appreciated the completeness, I felt the movie was a little too episodic for me at points. Transitions between clues were a little too fast for me, relationships progressing a little conveniently and quickly for my tasted to get the realistic factor. While complete overall, it lacks the polish of story that Wonder Woman held and I think it was because of the action focus of this movie (which I do like, but still do appreciate good storytelling).Action Scenes needing more depth: Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the action component as mentioned above, however, I also appreciate action scenes that are longer, more developed than what we got. Much of Wan's vision was very cut and dry 5-minute sequences that were impressive, but short lived, or sometimes more running than actual combat. While I loved a few of the battles that really captured the spirit of the combat, others felt too short lived. I agree with some fellow colleagues that there was more choreography needed, but perhaps giving a little more integration could have made these scenes shine for me.CGI Overuse: We know these movies are all about CGI making imagination come to life, but what we also know is the importance of balance and not diving too far into the realm of artificial imagery. Aquaman's visuals were a little heavier than most, like George Lucas in the prequels, the reliance on CGI made for some cheesier moments than I think intended, where some writing lapses helped amplify the artificial feeling to it. Like the end fight of Wonder Woman, the effects didn't quite add up to the picture I had in mind, and when you get to how fast they skimmed over some of the battles, it left me feeling I wanted a little more though to the battles at hand.The VERDICT:I could go on for hours about this, but let's wrap this up. Aquaman is definitely one of the better installments for this reviewer, finally getting out of the convoluted, too focused on darker themes that the DC universe went to and instead getting back to the basics of the superhero film. It is a visually packed joy ride made for the theaters, as this action-packed journey is all about showing off the technological, imagination driven ride Wan is famous for. I had fun in this movie and enjoyed the complete tale, despite how episodic the presentation felt. In addition, the action was very fun, but I wanted a little more coordination and investment to the sequences, so quality vs. quantity. Aquaman has bounced back to the superhero movie quite well, and with a little more balance, it may finally reach the intended levels they set out for long ago. Definitely worth a trip to the theater my friends, and potentially the biggest holiday bash of the bunch.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.0-8.5
Movie Overall: 7.0",Aquaman
100,rannynm,Powerful Message About Being the Best You Can Be,10,12 January 2019,"I really like this film because the message is so powerful. It's about training to be the best you can be. Then, when you are ready, your task is to beat anything that's in your way, with a humble heart because good always wins. Another reason why I like it is because of the action between Arthur and King Orm. These two teach that, no matter what the situation is, violence is never the answer. I also really like the background music because the suspense really moved me and made me want to jump out of my seat with excitement and joy.This amazing action/adventure film is about the city of Atlantis, which is now an underwater kingdom ruled by the power-hungry king Orm. With his army by his side, King Orm plans to take over the remaining oceanic people to become the King of all oceans better known as the Oceanic Master, then to rule the surface world. Standing in Orm's way is his half-Human, half-Atlantean brother, Aquaman, known as half-breed. With help from Vulko, who is the royal counselor of the throne, Aquaman must retrieve the powerful trident of Atlan to proclaim the title as the protector of the deep blue sea.The cast includes Arthur/Aquaman (Jason Momoa, Game Of Thrones), Atlanna (Nicole Kidman, Dead Calm), King Atlan (Graham McTavish, Outlander), Mera (Amber Heard, Never Back Down), King Orm (Patrick Wilson, Insidious), Vulko (Willem Dafoe, Spider-Man), Manta (Yahya Abdul-Manteen II, The Greatest Showman).My favorite part of this film is when Arthur finds out that he has the power to talk to the creatures in the water, in other words echolocation. Following that, Arthur doesn't know how to control the power that he has, which is why King Atlan puts Arthur in the hands of the royal counselor, Vulko, to learn to control his powers. From the training that Artur does with Vulko, Arthur shall use it in the future.Aside from that, King Orm plans to take things into his own hands and decides to conquer the seven seas to become King Of The Deep Blue Sea, also known as the Oceanic Master. After that, King Orm plans to take apart the surface world to become his treasure for good.I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18, as well as adults. Truly the whole family will love this film as it has so many funny and good reaction moments. This film also requires very good anthropomorphic qualities in various scenes. Don't miss this amazing action/adventure film directed by James Wan, which is playing in theaters now, to find out what happens at the end.Reviewed by Siaki S., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

101,justin-fencsak,DC does what Marvel doesn't,10,23 December 2018,"After seeing Aquaman today with a near full crowd in imax 2d, i have to say that this movie has to be the best super hero movie of the year, even better than the two out of three marvel movies i've seen this year (Ant Man and the Wasp i have yet to see) that take place in their universe not to mention the animated spider-man movie which i might see soon as well as deadpool 2 (not interested in the pg-13 cut). The movie, like most DC origin movies, takes place at a lighthouse on the east coast in 1985, where Aquaman is born to an American husband and an Atlantian queen and is raised by his underwater friends. Along the way, he will face many foes, the most important being Black Manta (if you don't know who that it, read the comics as well as watch the Super Friends cartoon), who will play a major role in the upcoming sequel after you see the mid credits scene. Go see it in IMAX as that release has an IMAX exclusive trailer for Avengers End Game which fills up the screen nicely!!!",Aquaman
102,Easygoer10,Not Bad,6,11 August 2019,"Its funny seeing the characters played Patrick Wilson & others who are the nemesis of Arthur/Aquaman, played by Jason Momo. I have been a fan of Jason Momoa ever since the 2nd season of Stargate Atlantis. Unlime Wilson & the other actors, Jason has real muscles, & tgey are not from lifting weights. He is also a very bright individual, who has oroduced & directed seceral shorts & a couple of feature length independent films aswell. He doesnt beed a ouffed up muscle bound suit, which is why you see him shirtless. Trust me, he is more like actirs similar to Gerard Butler & Chris Hemsworth. They all posess that rare combination of talent and beauty; nit just oretty hunks with no brains (who are a dime a dozen). One coincidence is Michael Beach plays the father of ""Black Manta"" (pirates), who Aquaman allows to drown, whuch Nanta seejs revenge for; which in itself is actually quite stupid. He & his father were murderers & pirates: they chose the life. Regardless, my point is Jason Momia & Michael Beach both were on Stargate Atlantis (as allies). Momoa was cast in over 75 epusodes; Beach was on about 6 episides. Even though Momia was on Game of Thrones & seceral other series, Stargate Atlantis is the one which made him a star with a huge fanbase. He deserves it, & I am happy for him. This film is all about CGI special effects, which (for me) are quite boring. Lastly, it is a comuc book film, whose fanbase is mostly preteens: they are all about the mighty dollar. At least Jason gets to make much more money plus move him up into the ""A-List"" of action film stars. This will allow him to make many more films of his own; which is much better than pablum like this.",Aquaman
103,Kingslaay,Not as good as I hoped sadly,6,21 January 2019,"Besides Wonder woman I have not been too impressed with DC movies recently. But growing up and loving those superheroes I always give those films a go. There were things that worked and didn't work for Aquaman. Sadly more things didn't work. The CGI and fight scenes were often over the top. The biggest issue for me was 'buying into' this universe. If you look at Guardians of the Galaxy we easily bought into into that crazy space journey with funny looking creatures. Aquaman in that respect is more believable but sadly it comes across as far fetched and you're not really immersed or taken on a journey.One positive is the somewhat decent plot. On one side there is a human rivalry and the other is an oceanic empire wanting to strike back at humans. Jason Momoa does what he can with the script but its not enough to carry the film. It tries to pull off too much of the unbelievable and passable. This is not a terrible film but its not memorable. Let's just say if viewers saw it showing on TV years from now they would probably keep flicking channels compared to tuning in for a few minutes. It's passable and not the win that DC so desperately needs to respond to the huge success and formula used by Marvel.
6.5/10",Aquaman
104,pc95,Clunky Start but Gets it Together,7,30 March 2019,"(spoilers) The editing and sequencing and sometimes the dialog need help. Director Wan forgets any introductions, and goes for non-sequential development.. What follows is a mess for the first 30 min or so. The story gets some traction about the time Atlantis is wonderfully introduced; the visuals help us forget the shortfalls and problems with dialog, direction, and acting. Music soundtrack as pop-synths work well, but some of the contemporary soundtracks fall-flat. Jason Momoa's hang-loose mentality seems at first out-of-place and too loose, but we acclimate to it. Amber Heard is passable, and probably could've been done better by someone else. The movie is certainly like a live-action cartoon, and though sinks initially holds on to its grandiose bravado enough to become entertaining with the help of an underwater mishmash of medieval and scifi that works . 7/10 -- better than expected.",Aquaman

Hopefully DC won't always think about filming the Nth Dark Knight in the future. It's a dead end. Although the idea imitates space science fiction, it must be said that special effects, especially large battle scenes, are very beautiful. It's just that the story is told in a hurry, including two villains, but the level is not clear.",Aquaman

107,WeAreLive,A dive in the oceans of atlantis,10,6 January 2019,"I finally got round to seeing this movie today and it was absolutely amazing especially in 4D. Even though I defended Justice League last year looking back it was not as good as this masterpiece.Heck, this is possibly even better then anything (except for Infinity wars of course) that came out of the MCU the past year or so. I admit I was not a massive fan of Black Panther nor I enjoyed Ant-Man and the wasp that much.After the success of wonder woman 2017 and somewhat Man of Steel I am glad they are looking back at their products on how to make their movies better. Even if a small number of comic book nerds or marvel/mcu troll would not agree.On to the actual movie it self. It did a good job focusing the story more on Aquaman despite small changes but it still did a good job portraying it even if you are not familiar with aquaman.The script and the dialogues were pretty good. Acting wise it was good without having any over acting or getting too pretend as their roles. The casing of Jason Mamoa, Patrick Wilson, William Defoe, Temura Morrison and Nicole Kiddman was a very well done aswell.The CGI was really good for each scene both in and out of the water as well as the special effects.Overall this was an amazing movie and possibly my favourite I have seen this year.P.S.If Amber heard is in the sequel don't support it. She is evil",Aquaman

109,nancyldraper,Unremarkable,7,1 January 2019,"The origin story was interesting if predictable. The acting was uneven: Jason Momoa was the rough and tumble guy we expect from him. Amber Heard's acting was really poor, even her line delivery was very amateurish. Nicole Kidman was perfect in her role. The one remarkable feature of the movie is the beautiful underwater CGI, which was magical (if overly fond of jellyfish). I give this film a 7 (good but unremarkable) out of 10. {SciFi Action Adventure}",Aquaman

111,Abdulxoxo,All over the place,6,27 February 2021,"In all honesty using the word 'plot' in relation to this movie is perhaps stretching things considering how bonkers it was. It's more like a series of bright and colourful individual scenes loosely tied together by a handful of characters. The thing is though that's both a positive and a negative. It's very easy to criticise this movie. Structurally it's all over the place. There are far too many storylines going on and at times it does feel like we're watching our hero work his way though levels of a computer game, going from place to place in order to get what he needs to move on to the next level.The dialogue was beyond cheesy. it was nonsense that was coming out of their mouths most of the time. This wasn't helped by some of the most hammy performances from the likes of Patrick Wilson, Dolph Lundgren and Willem Dafoe.The Black Manta character was also disappointing. The character seems as though he could have been good, had he been fleshed out more. The problem was that he was really only a side character when in truth he could have been the main baddie. They probably should have saved Black Manta for a potential sequel; or had him be the main villain of this film, then saved the Orm storyline for the sequel. Unfortunately Black Manta got lost in the madness of everything that was going on in this movie.In terms of the visuals, on the one hand it is a humongous CGI extravaganza, which at times feels like it's covering up the weaknesses of the screenplay. On the other hand however, it was fun to watch. Additionally, the experience of being in thw world, being thrown about and covered in water, was entertaining.There were a few positive things about Aquaman. First of all, the fight sequences. The choreography for those was fantastic; as was the direction. The way some of the fights were filmed looked like they were from a proper action movie. That's another thing. The action in this film was non-stop entertaining. It was completely over-the-top, but that was to be expected from James Wan - The man, known mostly for his horror movies, didn't produce anywhere near his best work on this movie, but I did love his action sequences. Two of the best scenes involved Kidman fighting near the beginning, and a rooftop chase sequence somewhere in the middle. In terms of performances Amber Heard and Nicole were badasses. Jason Momoa's Aquaman, who was charming but there's little interesting thing going on with his character. The rest provide good support.Overall, one can't deny being entertained after watching this movie. There are some positives that can be taken from the film.",Aquaman
112,martimusross,"Great, Really Great",10,19 December 2018,"This movie threw us in at the deep end and we swam with the fishes. It was a great ride that kept our attention from start to finish.It was long, it was a monumental saga it was CGI gone mad, but this was a really great movie and delivered exactly what was on the tin.Jason Momoa gets special mention, he gave a solid endearing performance that trod the line of humour, self-deprecation and super-heroI loved it",Aquaman
113,MR_Heraclius,Aquaman,8,12 February 2020,"Sure, this is no smart or particularly clever film. But you gotta admire how it embraces its comic origins, tacky costumes with colorful oversized helmets, octopuses playing drums, Dolph Lundgren with pink hair, armored sea horses and all. Thankfully it doesn't take itself too seriously and has a pretty charismatic leading man who takes the film through a few silly scenes too. But you can't say you've seen most of this ever before, there are just so many locations, creatures, designs, concepts. It's no short movie by any means, but it's fun from beginning to end.

114,michaeltrivedi,What A Horrible Movie,3,31 January 2019,"Aquaman sucked. So much I couldn't get passed half the movie.Aquaman himself is a cool character. At time, I felt the movie did not do justice to the actor, like it set itself up to fail. It also did not give him much airtime, and set him up with silly little one liners. Some of the action was very good, and I enjoyed watching Nicole Kidman kicking a**.I would recommend watching it. It had potential to be one of my favorite superhero movies. I am excited to see the main actor in future movies, as he definitely has potential to be something.3 stars",Aquaman
115,Troy_Campbell,One of 2018's most entertaining blockbusters.,8,22 December 2018,"There's a lot working against the first solo Aquaman movie. The DC cinematic universe has a poor track record, underwater CGI can be extremely difficult to get right, and the concept of Aquaman as a hero is ridiculous even by comic-book standards. Yet somehow director James Wan has dished up one of 2018's most entertaining blockbusters, well and truly matching its Marvel counterparts on the fun-scale. It may be silly, but it's the perfect type of silly. After helping the Justice League defend Earth against Steppenwolf, Arthur Curry (Jason Mamoa) finds himself at the centre of another looming invasion on his home planet - this time from the deep sea Atlantians, led by his half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson). With action sequences both on land and under water, Wan doesn't miss his opportunity to thrill with inventive and exhilarating set pieces, starting with a pre-credits fight that sees Nicole Kidman's Atlantian Queen kick some serious butt in one, long unbroken shot. The film engages in a game of one-upmanship with itself, the action getting bigger, wilder and more ambitious. Not every single sequence tops the last, but there's a healthy upwards trend leading to the climactic oceanic battle. Like all big budget flicks the computer effects are abundant and lavish, but particular credit goes to the VFX team for making the underwater sequences look amazing and, to a certain extent, feel realistic. It's not just the impressive visuals and exciting action that makes this movie a blast though, the tongue-in-cheek tone and carefree humour signals loud and clear that this movie is in on the joke, and that DC characters can have fun whilst also being a bit moody. It also helps that Mamoa is just so damn likable too; his reluctant superhero is the kind of guy you would want to share a few beers with. Where Mamoa ends and Arthur Curry begins is a blur, his real-life laidback persona forming a large part of the role. Not everything works (Yahya Abdul-Mateen's pirate sub-villain is a misfire, the second act sags a little), yet the film is firing on so many cylinders that these are mere blips quickly forgiven. Throw in an epic Thor: Ragnarok-esque soundtrack and Aquaman is popcorn cinema done right.",Aquaman
116,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"A visual tour-de-force that has a pretty standard sibling-rivalry story, back-boned by Jason Momoa's loveable take on Aquaman.",7,22 January 2019,"Aquaman feels like one of those movies that's long overdue in its being released to the world. It's a wonder why this fella never got one theatrical release pre-2018, because so many iconic characters out there are just busting to be featured in these kinds of movies. Aquaman feels like it could have been released in 2004 and still would have had a similar response at the box office. It's got water, action, photogenic people populating the world it's set in and pop-music ranging from the 80s to now. It's got all the hallmarks of a blockbuster that's trying to cater to EVERYONE it possibly can. I guess this is something of a course correction for DC Comics Films.Aquaman is a step in the right direction in that it's more confident in its direction than Justice League or Suicide Squad were, but it's not the near-perfect movie-comic-mythology synthesis Wonder Woman had going for it. However a step in the right direction is better than a gigantic step backwards. I'm eager to see where the rest of Arthur Curry's story goes from here.Here's hoping that the rest of DC's upcoming movies can have the same self-confidence Aquaman does in its story and bombastic action.",Aquaman
117,Sergiodave,As a movie it's too childish.,5,14 August 2021,"My only reading of comics was 40 years ago and that was 2000 AD, so for this review I am looking at the DC films only. A lot of actors in this movie, most of which I don't think much of. The only good/great actor in this movie is Willem Defoe, Nicole Kidman's only good acting job was 'To Die For'. The plot seemed convoluted and ridiculous, even for a comic, and worst of all, I couldn't care less which character died! After reading this quick review you might wonder why I gave it 5 stars not 2, the reason is because it's impossible not to compare it to the Marvel movies. As a movie it is watchable, just. But why do the DC movies in general seem so childish compared to the Marvel movies. One of the best movie trilogies of the last 30 years was Nolan's Batman, what's gone so very wrong. I think the main problem is the lack of darkness. These are superhero movies, you can show evil and still attain a PG certificate. Watch The Empire Strikes back for proof.",Aquaman
118,lambiepie-2,Fantastic Job by everyone,8,23 December 2018,"This was enjoyable entertainment, and a fantastic job done by everyone involved with this film. I can't speak too much on the DC vs. Marvel thing, I always liked Aquaman and saw him on par with Superman and Batman. I found him interesting BECAUSE he was part of the Sea. For years I heard rumors of a feature length film and was happy to finally see this one. It works!What made the film first was the visuals. It's great to see, and I saw it in 3D. I will eat my hat if this team doesn't garner an Oscar nod, they deserve it. Then, there's Jason Momoa as Aquaman, and he fits the bill so much that you can't stop watching him. Aquaman has the difficult feat of being on land and sea, and Jason's portrayal gives you that struggle. And ""that thing"" about Aquaman that he can talk to the fish. He can. It was nice to see the beginnings of that.Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman, Amber Herd, Wilem DaFoe and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II rounds it out great as an ensemble cast. And then there's James Wan, the director who made all this work - the actors, the special effects - what a wonderful triumph, once it got going, I could have watched more.Aquaman is entertaining, it's family oriented and visually brings the undersea world to life.",Aquaman
119,Prashast_Singh,A visual wonder!,10,31 December 2018,"AQUAMAN released in India one week before its US release and yet I watched it just a few days ago. The IMAX 3D experience was just outstanding! I won't be lying if I say I enjoyed the film to the core. It's a complete visual spectacle with lots of action and adventure. Great performances and direction made it stronger. If you like superhero movies, this is a must watch.One of the best things about this film is that while most superhero movies do justice to the action aspects and the adventure aspect often gets overshadowed, AQUAMAN is a complete action adventure. You don't just get breathtaking action set pieces but also a lot of enchanting locales. The entire CGI work is impressive and that's another reason to watch it in IMAX 3D.Jason Momoa is very impressive, as is Amber Heard. Their combo makes the story more fun as they go places. Willem Dafoe is back with another solid act. Nicole Kidman is quite good, as are rest of the cast members. James Wan has done a great job with the direction by sticking to the plot and not resorting to unwanted subplots. The background score is also very impressive.I had seen and liked BATMAN V SUPERMAN, JUSTICE LEAGUE and MAN OF STEEL but not on the big screen. There was no way in which I could afford missing AQUAMAN. It's a treat to the eyes and a perfect entertainer for the big screen.

This is hands down the most fun DC movie I've watched to date, and the only one with amazing special effects consistent throughout the whole movie. It's fun action entertainment with very well done ""superhero"" type fight scenes (again, the best DC has offered so far). Yes, this Aquaman has very little in common with the comics but let's be real, that can only be an improvement (also everybody speaks English under the sea?).

This is from DC house and seems to be popular like Marvel Studio's characters. It is a good movie for adventure lovers. Jason Momoa is perfect casting for Aquaman. His towering height (6.4) and muscled body gave a real look to this new under water super hero. Other casting like of Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe, Amber Heard and Dolph Lundgren is okay. Amber Heard looks slim and a little dull than previous and having dimmer charm. Dolph Lundren is lost in his makeup. I actually did not recognize him for a while. Story is as required by an adventurous plot for comics. However photography is super. Various kingdoms like desert kingdom, Atlantis kingdom and other are amazing. Their sets are fantastic and filling real good. You will definitely enjoy from watching brilliantly portrayed those kingdoms. Though this is comical story for children, it is also watchable for parents also with their kids.I impressed to see a scene where an octopus is drumming with his all hands! How a unique idea! it surely will take you to notice this highlighted part of the move.My recommendation is just go and watch, no read any review further. It is full of enjoyment.",Aquaman

124,jeremycrimsonfox,Great DCEU Film,8,27 May 2019,"While the DCEU does have its fair share of stinkers, Aquaman is not one of them. It has an interesting story set after Justice League where Arthur Curry, who is now known to the people as The Aquaman, goes on a journey to Atlantis to stop a deadly war between the oceans and the surface by his half-brother Orm, while discovering his true destiny. The characters are good as well. Aquaman is basically a fish out of water who is clueless about his true role while Mera is a great heroine who aids him in his search. Orm is a good main antagonist while Black Manta is brought in as a secondary villain, and has a good fight with Aquaman. And while the movie does have so much special effects, they are put to good use, especially for the underwater segments. This is a good movie and is worth watching.",Aquaman

The characters, the visual imagery,, all outstanding.Momoa is the Aquaman we deserve!! Never did I imagine a world like we see in this movie. (Atlantis!!!) I read some review that talked about Momoa acting like a tattooed, bullish thug as the character in this movie. Not sure what that viewer was expecting to see,, but the last thing I saw was a thug. Momoa plays the character of Arthur Curry perfectly,, and yes, he's a bit rough around the edges,, but he's a hero of the land and sea!! The rest of the cast was great as well,, including Heard. Wilson, Lundgren, and Kidman (also Pops Curry, and the guy who played Black Manta).So, the main movie starts after the events of Justice League. Arthur Curry is doing what he has been for awhile, protecting the sea. Otb, the redheaded Atlantian Mera shows up and tells Arthur that his half-brother Orn is bringing a war to the surface/land,, and he must challenge Orn for the throne of Atlantis! From there,, action ensues!!The one complaint,, or more of an observation/question, I have is what the heck is up with the music being played in that scene where Black Manta was putting his suit together? The scene was fine,, but where'd that music come from?!? Just didn't fit imo.Anyways,, If you want to to see a fun movie, then this'll fit the bill.So go watch it!!!",Aquaman

128,educallejero,Just wow. The spectacle!,8,14 December 2018,"This is probably the best action and the most visually gorgeous super hero movie ever made (or my favorite at least). Maybe Infinity War can compete. Probably. But that's it. James Wan is an artist, at least visually.There are problems, of course:
The humor is hit and miss.
The way the story is told is a bit too repetitive.
Some songs are jaw droppingly bad.
The villains too basic.But the good is great:
The emotion works (barely, but it works).
The arcs of the characters feel totally earned.
Parts of the score are actually pretty awesome.
The villains while basic, help to force our protagonist to become the hero and define him.
Did I mention that the action is insanely good?I often don't care that much about the action.... but there are exceptions and this movie just blew me away without being complemented by an awful story (like Valerian, for example)",Aquaman
129,rockman182,Aquaman (2018),6,25 December 2018,"After the release of Justice League I wasn't optimistic about anything in the DC Extended Universe, not named Wonder Woman. I thought Aquaman was just going to be terrible and unnecessary in a universe that seemed to be in disarray. I was kind of warming up to it with the new trailers released and the fact that a competent filmmaker in James Wan. I think this is an fairly entertaining entry in the DC Universe and definitely the second best film after Wonder Woman.The film follows the story of Arthur Curry, who is an heir to an underwater kingdom that his half brother is trying to take control of. The film goes into the details of Curry's past and shows how Aquaman eventually became the hero he is today. In this film Aquaman must find a powerful trident and stop a war that threatens his people and all of Earth. The film stars Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman, and Patrick Wilson.Wan reunites with a reliable name in Wilson who plays Ocean Master. Both him and Black Manta feel like generic villains as is the case with a lot of superhero films, its also tough to establish a villain with the general unfamiliarity with the Aquaman comics for the general masses. You can tell the film has a big budget as it is exquisite in its underworld fantastical elements and all the action and effects that go along with it.The film isn't anything groundbreaking when it comes to superhero films and its quite cheesy in dialogue and comedic nature. It still works for the most part and is a refreshing change in light, tone, and color in this universe. Its not exactly a huge endorsement as to why the DCEU should continue to exist, but it shows that under the right guidance it can work better than most previously anticipated.7/10",Aquaman
130,MuviFan73,A visual extravaganza with an above average story.,6,9 February 2019,"Tone, Script & Story: The story is about how ruler of water world 'Aquaman' comes into existence. A fate, a war (with land dwellers) is in his hands when he comes to power. The movie portrays an above average story.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The biggest strength of the movie is its visuals. The ones at the end are spectacular. The ones on land too are very good. For me the ones in ocean were crowdie and blurry. The same appeared when I saw finding Nemo. I guess that happened to portray a reality (in the sea) more precisely. I wished if they were clear even after being in Ocean. Despite that they were nice. This movie was first of its kind given to us by director James Wan. It was a nice job. Most of his earlier work circulated around horror genre.Music: Above average. Acting: Justified.Final Verdict: It is a visual extravaganza. If you can watch it, opt for a big screen.",Aquaman
131,phanthinga,I'm sorry Wonder Woman but you no longer the best DCEU movie for me,10,23 December 2018,"Aquaman as a movie is the best and the most surprise I've got from the DCEU till now when it managed to turn a quite bland character in the Justice League movie and a joke character that never meant to be taken seriously according to many DC comic fan that I read online into this one large tatted up man with a larger than life personality who embodiment all the things that kids love when they watch a superhero movie. The movie is part traditional superhero movie, part horror movie, part kaiju movie all wrapped up neatly into one thank to director James Wan risking his career out there when he decided to direct a movie about a not many people know superhero that unlike the already established Superman or Batman just like James Gunn with his Guardians of the Galaxy series and director Zack Snyder for choosing Jason Momoa to be the live action version Aquaman for the DCEU",Aquaman
132,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A Jason Momoa vehicle crammed full of plot and aesthetics from other films.,7,23 March 2019,"Now that Marvel's 10-year behemoth of its cinematic universe is starting to pay off, it's becoming more and more obvious that DC is trying desperately to catch up. There's no doubt that DC has interesting characters, considering how often Superman has been rebooted and how successful Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy was. Even Wonder Woman (2017) had its great moments, despite also feeling derivative influences from movies like Thor (2011) and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). Aquaman (2018) seems to continue this trend, despite again having a strong leading character (both physically and in backstory/lore).I will give DC credit for their casting decisions here. For decades, Aquaman has been the butt of the joke amongst many superhero aficionados. The fact that Jason Momoa is a badass, snarky, and overall entertaining actor to watch in the role speaks to their awareness of ""image management."" Perhaps featuring him in previous films like Justice League (2017) also helped to get audiences interested in seeing this superhero in a standalone movie. Needless to say, my interest was piqued, and I finally went to see this film. Knowing little to nothing about Aquaman, I was in for an experience.While the movie overall wasn't bad, it felt a little too long. I think the Black Manta storyline was a bit distracting, especially as a setup for a future sequel. After all, when there's this huge Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars conflict going on, there shouldn't be time for these other plotlines. I'll also say that the plot felt a little derivative of Black Panther (2018), which only had the advantage of being released earlier in the year. There was also a bit of a Tron: Legacy (2010) aesthetic in this movie that I liked. I did feel the Little Mermaid (1989) nod was perhaps a little too obvious, though.A Jason Momoa vehicle crammed full of plot and aesthetics from other films, I give Aquaman 3.5 stars out of 5.",Aquaman
133,RforFilm,Aquaman does not blow the man down. It's a visual spectacle and an entertaining superhero story.,8,30 December 2018,"I've said before that the difference between Marvel and D.C. is that Marvel is humans becoming gods and D.C. is gods becoming humans. If there was a character from D.C. that embodies this type (at least on Earth), that would be Aquaman. Not only is he the king of Atlantis, but like a lot of people within the D.C. universe, he already has god-like powers. His story seems more classical then Superman or Batman; one in which he may have grown up amongst humans only to find that his connection to the sea makes him a king. Tell me this doesn't sound like something that fits along with Homer's Odyssey.Aquaman had already been featured in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League, but he had never gotten his own movie. Come to think of it, he's a character that hasn't been seen within a live action. Given how expansive the comic books have shown Atlantis and the majority of his powers, I can't imagine how this guy would have been portrayed without computer effects. It almost seemed that the D.C. universe was doomed after the negative reception to Justice League. Let's see how things have improved in the standalone movie Aquaman.As shown through a flashback, a lighthouse keeper Thomas finds the queen of Atlantis, Atlanna (played by Nicole Kidman) washed up on shore. The two fall in love and have a child, Arthur. When Atlantis comes looking for them, Atlanna returns to the sea, leaving Thomos to care for his son. Cut to years later when Arthur (played by Jason Mamoa) has gained reputation as an ""Aquaman"" who stops pirates on the high seas. After coming home one day, he's approached by Mera (played by Amber Heard) who asks that he return to Atlantis to dethrone his stepbrother Orm (played by Patrick Wilson) who is ruthless and wants to become Ocean Master of all kingdoms. Arthur declines, but agrees to accompany her to find his mother's trident.From here, Arthur and Mera return to Atlantis, meeting with his old teacher and a confidant of Orm, Nuidis (played by William Dafoe). While getting information, their ambushed and Orm attempts to fight him, but they escape. Traveling to the Sahara and Sicily, they figure out where the trident is, but the battle rages on as Orm wants to declare war on the surface world and Arthur has to fulfill his destiny as the Aquaman to stop his brother from becoming Ocean Master.For the most part, Aquaman is the movie that Warner Brothers had needed to make in order to compete with Disney's Marvel brand. Is it a perfect comic book movie? No, but it was a lot more entertaining then I expected it to be. Director James Wan (The Conjuring, Fast 7) seems to have thrown out the brooding darkness from the previous movies and embraced the more fantasy elements of the DC universe. Aquaman is not a bad movie to do that with, given that the majority of the story is set underwater and the kingdom of Atlantis.Environment is one thing, but it's all for nothing if the characters aren't interesting. The good news is that Jason Mamoa is not only charismatic, but he's also a welcome change to the typical, all American or strong women we see. He's more like the former jock from high school whose at least nice and willing to make a friend. Mamoa not only fits in well with his position as the son of a lighthouse keeper, but has a noble pose, giving him more of a royalty ambiance then I felt with Chadwick Boseman from Black Panther.His journey is also interesting, as the goal is not only simple, but is genuinely fun. When we see him in Sicaly fighting high-tech pirates, im invested. When he's in Atlantis talking to his brother, I want to see where things so. When Arthur has to fight, I'm curious to see how the movie will incorporate the various elements of the ocean. Most of it is played out well, though if I had a problem, its that the movie is a tad too long. Without giving anything away, there's a second villain they could have cut, as the story is mainly setting him up for a sequel. Not to mention there are exposition bits of dialogue that could have been shortened.I'll give this eight Aquaman comics out of ten. It's crazy to think that while Superman and Batman were not done well, its Wonder Woman and this that are the better movies within Warner Brothers. This is likely to help those who've been dissatisfied with the previous DC movies. All I can say is that Aquaman does not blow the man down. Go check it out.",Aquaman
134,Holt344,"One of the decade's best Superhero movies, Aquaman's a visual masterpiece",10,14 December 2018,"This movie is truly a masterpiece in the superhero genre, the cinematography and visuals are breathtaking, simply beautiful to look at. James Wan probably did one of the best directing job in 2018 as everything was just perfect, nailed everything perfectly, catching the heart of the characters and story and also the whole atmosphere and tone of the movie, making everything believable. Its actually really close to the New 52 comic book run that was written by Geoff Johns, it made me as a fan really happy, seeing the villains and all the culture and people done right. Making the costumes for especially Orm, Mera and Aquaman's final suit absolute true to their comic book counterpart. It was also great cast, having a well known ensemble with names like Amber Heard, Willem Defoe, Dolph Lundgren, Patrick Wilson and Nicole Kidman that all portray their characters in a accurate and great way. Jason Momoa blew me away, he's actually a believable Arthur Curry except for the long brown hair and beard. My favorite characters have to be Aquaman and Mera like they were in the graphic novel, great duo and amazing characters!Something that kept me interested at all times were the action sequences and plot, making it flow together nicely. The Sicily sequence and the final battle being my favorites, making this movie rewatchable more than the great characters and actors they have in store!

136,bankofmarquis,Momoa saves it from being a total disaster.,5,10 January 2019,"I have been a defender of the darker DC Universe films. While not as popular (nor, generally, as good) as their Marvel counterparts, they all do have their good points - until now.AQUAMAN is not a very good film and I could really only come up with 1 good point - Jason Momoa as Aquaman. Some are calling him ""the next Rock"" and he certainly has the physique, the screen presence and the charm to pull this off. This movie ALMOST worked because of Momoa's presence on the screen.Almost.Director James Wan (Furious 7, The Conjuring) certainly had the ""chops"" to Direct a film like this, unfortunately, I found his Direction to be choppy. What I mean by that is that this film never really settled into a good flow. It cut back and forth - both in content and in tone - to such an extent that I, the movie-goer, could never settle back into my seat and enjoy the ride. I'm sure Mr. Wan would call this movie a ""roller-coaster ride"", but if it is, it is an old, wooden, rickety roller coaster, jarring the riders as they go.As for the cast, they are ""fine"". From Patrick Wilson to Amber Heard to Willem DaFoe to Dolph Lundgren(!) to good ol' Nicole Kidman. They all do decent, professional jobs with what they are given, but what they are given is weak and disjointed.I would like to point out Yahya Abdul-Mateen as the sub-villain of this piece, Black Manta. This is the most incompetent Super-Villain in any Super Hero movie to date. His Black Manta was there, obviously, to give Aquaman someone to beat. And he beats him...again...and again...and again.All I wanted to do was ""beat feet"" out of the theater.Letter Grade: C+ (for Momoa's efforts)5 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Aquaman
137,spookyrat1,Plunges In at the Shallow End!,6,2 February 2019,"Aquaman looks a million dollars without ever looking real. We can see the film has a mega-budget, but at the same time, unlike many of the Marvel Universe films, it just doesn't look real, even during the rare times in the film where the action is on land and not in the sea. You always have the very real sense that what you are watching, was primarily played out against a green screen.The cast do their very best, whilst being saddled with some uninspiring dialogue, especially many of the Atlantean characters who just sound unintentionally (I'm sure) pompous. Jason Momoa is fine as the title character and Amber Heard is appealing as Princess Mera, his developing undersea love interest. But I would have dearly loved to have seen their characters, as well as those of Nicole Kidman and Temuera Morrison for instance play out a few more scenes on dry land.The best I can say about the production is that it is imaginative and very creatively put together in a cross-generic fashion. But herein lies one of the major problems with the movie ... its weirded out storyline. Much of this so called origin tale, seems to be an excuse to create a hybrid of styles, which I personally had great difficulty in subscribing too. The whole idea of 7 civilisations living under the sea, with advanced technology and amongst mutant species of fish and the like, which land-based society has no idea about is just bizarre (to be kind).Imagine a mix of Star Wars, with The Abyss and Clash of the Titans. Yes, Star Wars; at the bottom of the sea. If you think that'll rock your boat, you'll probably love Aquaman. Me? Much as I like a good super hero film, Aquaman just doesn't fit the bill. I'll take The Avengers before this sort of cartoonish stuff any day. The action is better choreographed, the villains more serious, the dialogue is far more consistently funny and things do seemingly appear to be occurring in the real world.",Aquaman
138,fernandoschiavi,James Wan has the courage to laugh at his own ridicule... The film is not ashamed to come out in this way and manages to take this fantasy to a heroic level,7,3 May 2020,"For many years, Aquaman was considered a minor hero in the DC portfolio and thinking about a film adaptation would have been seen as a reverie a few years ago. The character has always been treated with disdain and has even been the target of jokes in several TV series and even films over the last few decades, always in a pejorative way. The character debuted in More Fun Comics # 73 (November 1941, despite appearing on the cover ""November"", More Fun Comics # 73 hit the US newsstands on September 25, 1941.). Initially a secondary hero in DC anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes as the main hero.
With the expansion of the DC universe in theaters and the advancement of technology, it was possible to bring to the screen through the hands of one of the most daring and talented directors that have emerged in recent years, James Wan. The Malaysian / Australian director emerged in the mid-2000s when he impressed the world with the iconic horror Mortal Games (2004). Responsible for producing the following chapters of the franchise and for being ahead of other contemporary horror classics, such as the 'Invocation of Evil', 'Supernatural' and 'Annabelle' franchises, the director had already proved himself capable of venturing into other genres typical of blockbuster cinema in the acclaimed 'Fast and Furious 7 (2015)' and now arrives with all the merits to adapt Aquaman's comics for Warner / DC Comics. And in the hands of the director, the final product achieves an unexpected and surprising result.Being the sixth film in the Extended Universe DC and with a screenplay by Will Beall and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, the plot features Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa), half-human and half-Atlantean, will have to stop his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who with a vast army at his disposal, plans to conquer both the other kingdoms of the ocean and the world on the surface, becoming the Master of the Oceans to attack the surface. Along with Mera (Amber Heard) he will have to recover Atlan's lost trident and accept his destiny as protector of the depths.
One of the great successes of this film was in the construction of the characters. After having previously appeared in 'Justice League (2017)', Aquaman has its story told in greater detail, since when his parents met, and why Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) had to abandon her young son and husband and return to Atlantis. Soon after, we saw Arthur grow up as a great partner of his father who raised him and being trained by Vulko (Willem Dafoe) both at sea and on the surface, until one day he could take over the kingdom of Atlantis. At the same time in which he presents the character's past and present, he already inserts the hero into the action, in an excellent sequence in a submarine, which even nurtures a feeling of an enemy's rematch for Aquaman.
One of the great successes of the film and that could have a totally opposite effect is the visual and visual effects. Just as James Gunn can create and dare with the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' look on a risky endeavor, so does this DC adventure. One of James Wan's great merits was taking on the fanciful tone and fantastic elements that are inherent in the character's story. The mission is not only to present Aquaman, but the entire mythology of the Seven Seas, including the history of their largest kingdom: Atlantis.
Building an entire universe in the underwater world was not one of the easiest tasks and the transposition of Atlantis from the comic books to the cinema is impeccable, showing all the financial power of the time when the city sank in the sea. They are a symbol of their time with voluptuous monuments and, at the same time, rich and highly technological of a society that was destroyed by their greed, but that also gave them the skills to breathe underwater and to evolve. The city, practically all built in computer graphics, is a delight in the eyes of those who watch. In addition to the city's architecture, the human costumes and the representation of dozens of marine lives are also perfectly done. The fact that the poetic license regarding the ability of the people of Atlantis to breathe and speak under the water at the same time that we see hair and clothes reacting to contact with water does not bother us at all. In addition to visual excellence, Aquaman's greatest asset is being bold enough to bet on a tacky yet mesmerizing aesthetic. Below the water, we see a parade of colors in the costumes and lighting. Feeling in Atlantis is a duty more than fulfilled, as well as the credibility achieved in the diversity of species in that world. The film is not ashamed to come out in this way and manages to take this fantasy to a heroic level thanks to the urgent and exciting direction of James Wan.
Jason Momoa has a natural charisma and clearly has fun playing Aquaman. If, during the casting, your choice was even criticized for not physically looking like the hero of the comics, when we see Momoa in 'Justice League' and now starring in your film, we can no longer disengage from the character's actor. Momoa forms a good pair with Amber Heard, sharing good romantic moments, which is not repeated so much in the most comical part. The actress is bestowed with the best and most relevant female character within the superhero films, with the obvious exception of Wonder Woman within her own film. Mera is the conductor of Arthur's journey to the throne, and although he is his romantic partner, he escapes the common helpless maiden clichés. Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman, even in minor roles, prove to be extremely efficient, including a super action sequence from the character of Kidman right at the beginning of the film.
The villains are other good hits of the feature. Patrick Wilson denotes the exaggerated tone of the film with his great Orm. The Master of the Seas next to the Arraia Negra lived by Yayha Abdul Mateen II. The first incorporates the megalomania of a son who was denied the throne, while the other is the embodiment of simple and pure revenge. Both work well and represent major threats to Aquaman, from the waters and land. Both are so well constructed, so that one is shown to be responsible for the hero's inability to refuse the call for his journey. Aided by the impeccable look, built from the comics of Ivan Reis and Geoff Johns - a good part of the people, in fact, are inspired by the duo's arc.
Some themes are discussed throughout the plot, citing the interference of man in the environment, in an inspired observation that the first act of the sea war against the land was to return decades of garbage thrown into the ocean. Xenophobia is also addressed in this same tone, with the superior underwater races seeing humans as minors.James Wan shows all his ability by merging scenes shot on a green background, combining all his ability to direct actors and create ingenious action scenes, which was already evident in the seventh adventure in the cinemas of the franchise 'Fast and Furious'. There are several scenes with interesting elements of transition, continuity, flat action sequences (highlighting one involving the character Atlanna, the duel to the candidates for the throne of Atlantis, the incredible sequences in Sicily, Italy and the entire final stretch after Aquaman took over the post of the true heir of Atlantis capable of wielding the trident of the former King Atlan).
'Aquaman' has an excellent look, action with scale, impact and tension, but it sins when it comes to creating true relationships between the characters. One observation is that the film makes it clear that Warner has freed itself from the shadowy bonds in which its extended universe was established from Man of Steel. The created world is well structured and has such a particular identity that such defects are superimposed. The work is full of references, the passage of Arthur and Mera on the surface includes a sequence that refers to the games, not only by the scenery, but also by the color table, by the conduct of the action and the temple, which resembles 'Indiana Jones', while the hero's first foray into Atlantis refers to 'Star Wars', when Jar Jar Binks takes Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan to Gunga in 'The Phantom Menace'. James Wan has the courage to laugh at his own ridicule, putting the hero to talk to fish or riding a seahorse and, aware of the fantasy he proposes, the film of the King of the Seas has fun like no other DC hero has had in years.",Aquaman

Featuring a complex story with many twists, more or less predictable, it manages to keep interest throughout its entire length. It's full of action, drama and even romance to make everyone happy. Its characters, well described and put into play, are credible and enjoyable, thus being easy for the viewers to empathize with them. The actors who play them are also very well picked, fitting perfectly within the required characteristics. My only complaint regarding the story and the main fact which made me lower its rating was that it follows some stereotypes which are quite hard to ignore. Take for example an event which happens in the beginning of the movie (the one at the end of the scene with the sinking submarine) which afterwards brings a new big threat to the protagonist just because of his ""decision"". I'm trying to avoid any spoilers here so I assume you've seen this movie in order to understand my complaint.In terms of visuals, the movie looks astonishing. From the underwater landscapes to the intense action parts, you can clearly see that a lot of work has been put into this department, thus the end result is simply impressive. Its great soundtrack also contributes to the unique atmosphere, being there when needed while providing a big plus with every ""appearance"". I find it very hard to criticize these two aspects regarding the film.It's a movie which I personally like very much. This type of a ""one man army"" simply leaves me breathless only when thinking about it, let alone seeing it in such amazing details. I liked the story, I enjoyed the characters and I definitely liked the actors. I was also impressed by the visuals and the music it had.

148,kjproulx,A Likeable Leading Man on a Wild Ride,8,18 January 2019,"It's always a pleasure to see a studio recognize their flaws and do their best to correct the mistakes that caused them so much heartache in the past. With a very enjoyable Man of Steel setting a tone that would be completely overdone by the time Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice hit theatres, it was only a matter of time before they decided to change it up. Suicide Squad was financially successful, but admittedly a step in the wrong direction. Justice League was a mess of a movie, but the saving grace of the franchise will always be known as Wonder Woman. Loved by critics and fans across the globe, DC and Warner Brothers decided to steer the ship in a new direction, taking a step into the past and creating origin stories for the characters we've only briefly seen. It worked with Wonder Woman, and I'm happy to say that I believe it's also working with Aquaman.Being very, very loosely tied to the previous films (almost not at all), Aquaman sees Arthur Curry go from an infant to a full-grown man. Being a half-breed from both land in our world and the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, he comes to the realization that he's the rightful heir to the throne. Challenged by his only brother who despises his existence, this creates tension amongst the people. With some very likable side characters and others who will more than likely have repercussions in future installments, there's a lot to like about this film in terms of character and story, which is what I was expecting to find lacking.Jason Momoa once again demands the audience's attention as he completely invests himself in this wacky character. His charisma is easily one of the highlights of this film and his many journeys with Amber Heard's Mera are a blast to watch. This is a film filled with tons of adventure and I was on the edge of my seat throughout a lot of it. It's visually stunning (for the most part) and I found that made it the biggest looking film of the franchise in terms of scope. Although it does borrow from pretty much every movie you've ever seen, it mixes in enough new content to differentiate itself from others.As it seems from my review, I had a blast watching Aquaman, but it's by no means a perfect movie, even by the standards set by this franchise. Patrick Wilson plays King Orm, Arthur's younger brother and although his motivations are clear, his portrayal is quite over-the-top. I personally took issue with this, as he's in quite a bit of the film. The disposable villains of this film actually have quite a bit of depth and backstory but are highly under-utilized. I felt like they were part of a set-up for something bigger in the future. Without ruining it, the scenes where these characters are used are very well-done, so it's a very minor flaw in my opinion. There are many small issues I have with the movie as a whole, but in retrospect, they're all nitpicks.In the end, Aquaman embraces the fact that the premise of an underwater city is ridiculous and runs with that from beginning to end. From giant sea battles to genuine heart-to-heart moments between characters that stood out to me, this is a film that has every I like about good blockbusters. While it's not one of the best superhero films I've ever seen, it's a joy to watch and easily in the discussion for as one of the best movies of this franchise. If you're a fan of comic-based films, I'd definitely suggest giving this one a shot.",Aquaman
149,AhmedSpielberg99,"All hail the true King, James Wan!",8,16 March 2019,"Callmeyourkingsobeit: The Movie.It's admittedly overlong because it's overstuffed with too many story-lines, and a long introductory opening sequence that could, and should, have easily been omitted; as there are many better-executed flashbacks which are more than enough. Add to this the fact that the aforementioned opening sequence is filled with cringe-inducing moments, including those which concern the romantic aspect, which is, in my opinion, the only silly thing that didn't work in the movie.That said, the movie is packed with thrilling, kinetic, and meticulously designed and choreographed action set-pieces, in which you really can follow the action and the liberated fight sequences buoyed by raucous deluge of dazzling array of visual effects. Replicating underwater movement, and offering exotic creatures and characters' outfits that contrast the deep blue sea with splashes of bright colors, James Wan did a tremendous job creating an underwater world that's a visual feast that's consistently boasting a visual feast for the eyes. I enjoyed the out-of-water action sequences more, they are better and more masterfully designed than those that take place underwater; but nothing can compete with the stunning free-flowing underwater action scenes from the visual standpoint.Aside from Furious 7, Wan's filmography is strictly horror related, having launched franchises in his own right with Saw and The Conjuring. Here we can see that he still uses his background in horror to deliver some moments that have shocking and surprising value, and they are quite effective.It's not hard to tell that the entire cast and crew went all out. Their dedication does not go unnoticed. All the cast did their best to give a strong comeback, considering that most of them once had a quite promising and auspicious career. As for Jason Momoa, he really shines as the titular superhero. His physical appearance suits the badass character that the DCEU wanted to make from the get-go. He looks and fights as if he is a WWE superstar! Amber Heard is great, and the chemistry between her Indiana Jonesian character, Mera and Momoa's Aquaman is electric and gripping. They make an awesome dynamic duo, and their sugary cheerful relationship made up for the nauseating, saccharine romance of Tom Curry and Queen Atlanna.The two villains have quite compelling background and convincing motives. And each one's sub-plot never overshadows the other's. Also, Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II are pretty good.Aquaman is An Extremely Cool and Bad-ass Epic Fantasy Adventure of Cheesiness! It's decidedly a step in the right direction for DC. I still think Wonder Woman is the best movie in their extended universe, so far; but Aquaman is now my personal favorite.(8/10)",Aquaman
150,kuarinofu,Meh,7,27 January 2019,"Didn't expect much and wasn't really disappointed.
The story was 100% predictable. Everything was obvious from the start and there was really nothing the movie could've impressed me with.
Around 70% of the dialogue was expository, 20% was people saying really stupid things and 10% of really awkward humor. I did laugh at some of the lines though, but those were unintentionally funny. They did sometimes make fun of some things showing that they are aware of some of the stupidities they have there only to stay true to the source material. They did, however, spend a lot of effort to make sure you understand everything that is going on. Everything that happens or even gets mentioned is explained in a flashback scene or by characters in full. Even before the giant sea beast attacks it makes sure to give you some exposition at first.
Most of the visuals were ok but not very creative or interesting. They did have some good ones though, like 2 or 3. From the top of my head, the starting lighthouse fight scene was cool, the trench dive and the wine magic scenes were also pleasant to the eye.
Most of the acting was good (would've been strange if it was otherwise with such cast). Except for our two leads, Mera and Arthur. I didn't like both Aquaman as a character and Momoa's performance. First they set him up as a guy with super powers and an enormous ego. I though this was made intentionally to show his path and his growth as a character in the end. But this wasn't the case, he just was lucky to get a better weapon and randomly rescue his mom in the process (side quests, right?). He's still the same egocentric guy with super powers. And this is pretty much what he was, the movie even emphasizes on that since the ending is extremely dull, they even go for the basic ""become the king and get the girl"" thing. Super one-dimensional. I'm not familiar with the source material so maybe this was just them staying loyal (just as having a laughable costume for the Black Manta).
Mera's motivation as a character was unclear yet she seems to care so much (not sure about what particularly) throughout the movie. She was ruined mostly by Amber Heard's performance. She was horrible, she didn't care for a second about her acting and it was obvious. They did gave her nothing to work with though, she's just a plot device, a girl the main guy gets in the end. At least I did enjoy her costume :)
There was also some sort of an environmental message but it was so bleak I almost forgot about this when I finished the movie.
The main problem of this movie is that it's around 7 years late. This would've worked so much better if made around 2012. The hero is not impressive, the story is not particularly interesting, the lore is stupid and unintentionally funny.
They did know what they were doing and there clues in the movie to substantiate that. I don't think that there was a better way to make an Aquaman movie, but this is still instantly forgettable.",Aquaman

Let's start off with a bit of truth: I like Aquaman. I' DC Comics fan. I'm not saying it's a great movie or that it's the savior of the DC cinematic universe, but it is a lot of fun. ""It's a bizarre but weirdly effective movie."" I can't put it any better than that. Arthur Curry, the human-born heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, goes on a quest to prevent a war between the worlds of ocean and land.with William defoe playing vulko who show aquman how to learn his role with tridentand using his skills he need the back story is good with king orm talking over the king of atlantis when he over throws the and attacks a meeting aquaman is forced to fight him in an underwater arena this is epic and mera helps but but as we see Nicole kidman character is good givers good advice and was rescued so when aquman has to find the real ruler he must become the hero and go epic and clues to atlantis and its power before its destroyed he has to light the way
I can, however, give you a few more details. We begin with a new version of Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) who feels more like an aquatic vigilante than the deep sea prince we're used to. Arthur's rogue hero lifestyle leads him into a faceoff with a group of high-tech pirates. The pirates are lead by David Hyde (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and his father Jesse (Michael Beach), who just so happen to be in the middle of stealing a submarine. You know, because why not. This leads to one of the most emotional scenes of the movie and after it's all done Arthur and has his first enemy in Hyde AKA Manta.
The enemies don't stop there. Arthur also has an Atlantean brother by the name of Orm (Patrick Wilson) although he'd probably prefer King Orm-because he's pretentious that way. I mean, this guy is the quintessential bad-news-sibling who might want you dead or imprisoned or just somewhere bleeding 'cause you're lost to the world. The battle under water is like lord of the rings its amazing
To counter the forces rising against him, Arthur has a great dad (Temuera Morrison), and a mom (Nicole Kidman) who loved them both deeply before she had to leave because, you know, Queen business ain't nothing but work. He also has a potential crime-fighting partner and a love interest in Mera (Amber Heard) the princess of another underwater kingdom.
So Arthur's life is fun...because he loves danger...and he's a total bad boy...but he has a lot to learn about compassion and what being a hero means. Which is what this movie is about.
So, shall we go with the good & the ugly? Let's do it.Jason Momoa is glorious. He's funny, charming, and tough. That's what you want in an Aquaman and it's what's been missing from DC movies-other than Wonder Woman. As his foil, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is the perfect counterbalance. His Manta (formerly Black Manta) is ruthless, charming, and relentless. I've got nothing but applause for these two and I've got big hopes for their rivalry to continue in future films.
Secondly, DC has found a formula I believe will work well for them as they redevelop and revamp their live action movies.10/10
The computer generated imagery is brill at times like the tsunami and not in a campy way that feels intentional. The characters and their hair [see: tresses] move more like they're flying through air rather than gliding through water.
Still...It's a fun movie. Jason Momoa makes everything better. And this represents a first step in DC finally giving their characters and their fans the movies we want and deserve. So, I say cheers to Aquaman-his pilsner glass may be far too flashy but at least it's filled to the brim with good stuff.",Aquaman

161,MrDHWong,Gives the DC Extended Universe the much needed push it has needed for some time,8,26 December 2018,"Aquaman is the sixth installment in the DC Extended Universe. Starring Jason Momoa in the title role, it proves that DC films are experiencing a resurgence and will likely prove to be healthy competition with Marvel.One year after the events of Justice League, Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa) learns he is heir to the throne of Atlantis, an underwater kingdom populated by sea life and humanoid lifeforms known as the Atlanteans. However, Arthur's place as king is challenged by his half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who intends to invade the surface world and reclaim it back for the ocean. Being half-human and half-Atlantean, Arthur must try to stop Orm from succeeding in his genocidal plan and give Atlantis the ruler it deserves.High spirited and likeable, Aquaman thankfully gives the DC Extended Universe the much needed push it has needed for some time, similar to how Wonder Woman did in 2017. There is a comfortable balance between comic relief and serious drama, but never so much that it feels like it is ripping off or downright plagiarising its style from Marvel. In terms of plot, the film feels like a hybrid of Thor and Black Panther, and its only major issue is that the story occasionally becomes muddled in its exposition scenes which does affect the pacing at times. Jason Momoa is without a doubt the perfect actor to play the titular hero, as he effectively elevates the character beyond being the laughing stock he has been among comic book fans for many decades. His scenes with Mera (Amber Heard) were great fun to watch and were the source of some of the film's more lighthearted moments. Willem Dafoe was also used well and wasn't merely reduced to being a cameo, and in addition to this, it was quite unusual to see him play a good guy in a comic book film. Be sure to stay back for an important mid-credits bonus scene.I rate it 7.5/10",Aquaman
162,Alexander_Blanchett,Another DC Disappointment,6,30 December 2018,"Well it is not a castrophy or anything but it is the one DC film I had the highest expectations for because I really like the titular character. The result was a corny, and even for fantasy standards unrealistic (yes.. I am talking fantasy realism here) CGI overdose.
Okay, what I liked: Jason Momoa who has a great sense for self irony and comedic timing. Casting him in this role is one of the most creative and inspired decisions and it pays off. He is truly great and part of the reason why Aquman is one of my absolute favorites of the DC cinematic universe. But not even he could save the often awful dialogue this terrible screenplay offers. Another thing I really liked were many of the actions scenes were very well put in scene (save for all the slow motion moments). Also the first half of the film really promised a great fantasy tale with its own mythology. I gave up on that thought in the middle part when many things, motivations and actions just became ridiculous ( and yes.. again for fantasy standards). The ending was an overblown CGI fest (with some really nice visuals ... not the effects, those were mediocre, but the imagary was nice). I really liked the score and loved the soundtrack decisions which were top notch.
About the other actors. Amber Heard was better than I expected but I could imagine many other actresses who probably had given her role the bite it deserves and was intended for. Nicole Kidman was fine but she obviously did it for the fun (yes she gets to kick some asses which was delightful) and of course the paycheck. But having her here gave the film something majestic. Willem Dafoe was very boring - or bored. I always felt he was not really feeling good about being into that CGI mess. His facial expressions made you believe that he is constantly thinking of doing awful things to his agent. Dolph Lundgren was fun and Patrick Wilson servable as a villain. Oh and that gets me to another thing: Black Manta is probably the most useless villain in any comic adaptation ( except maybe Paul Giamatti in the second Spider Man of the first Spider Man reboot).
It was fun (yet overlong) as long as it lasted but caused many head shakes from me.. and not in a good way.",Aquaman
163,TheTruthofItIs,You want to love it but it disappoints,8,5 May 2021,"No doubt a story like this should be a big screen hit but the screenplay/plot is so reliably predictable that if you're over 30 you've seen this play out a dozen times - jealous/envious brothers fighting over a throne one covets and the other wants a little but mostly because others push him to want it. So the story is written for teens but the largely-underwater VFX are pretty striking, that's where the attention and money went. And to fully enjoy it, you'll need a 3D TV if you hung onto yours from 2012. That extra dimension is essential, especially when it's filmed for it. It's the only thing that makes watching it worthwhile if you're over 30.",Aquaman

There are definitely some cheesy moments and lines, but James Wan seemed to be going for that goofy fun vibe with the film.

166,CANpatbuck3664,DC Takes a Step Back in AquaMEH,5,25 December 2018,"When I talk about movies I didn't like, I like to start with the positives before I start complaining nonstop. I'll talk more about Jason's portrayal of Aquaman but the biggest thing Aquaman has going for it is his casting in the central role. He wills this movie past some of its worst moments. I liked the design of some of the creatures of the deep, the CGI is all over the place but there were moments in the movie that the look of Atlantis and the underwater kingdoms were pretty cool. The action set pieces also had their moments, there were some fleeting bits in the final fight that caught my attention. I also thought there were minor character turns that made the characters easier to relate to (the one that comes to mind was when Arthur and Orm were about to do battle in the Ring of Fire and Arthur mentions that all he wanted as a kid was to meet his half brother and tell him that he wasn't alone and that they could get through it together).There aren't going to be many positives for the rest of this review. The first thing that I didn't like from Aquaman was how the movie expected you to be emotionally invested in things without any setup. So much of the dialogue (much of it coming from Mera played by Amber Heard) is just an exposition dump, the movie shows you very little but insists on describing everything. Orm wants a war with the surface people because of the damage they are doing to the ocean, maybe showing us some of the problems the surface people are causing would bring the audience around to seeing things from his point of view instead of some CGI flashes? Orm's goal is to bring most of the oceanic kingdoms together but they have deep seeded grudges against the Atlanteans, could we see some of the problematic backstory that caused the clans to break apart? Why should we be invested in these things when we were just introduced to them and have no context? Seeing some of that would have been better than the whole desert sequence which had nothing interesting except more terrible one-liners. Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is just a hired gun for the enemy when you boil it down, why do we need to spend so much time with him when you could cut him out of the movie completely? Lastly, why should we care about the budding romantic relationship between Arthur (Jason Momoa) and Mera when the characters have no emotional connection when she shows up and they haven't spent more than a couple of days together? I could keep going but the movie acts like we already have a deep connection to Arthur Currie and Atlantis but minus a few moments in Justice League, this is their introduction.About halfway through Aquaman, I realized if the cast didn't include so many actors and actresses I liked, I really would have turned hard on this movie. Jason Momoa has a bunch of charisma, he's easy to like and that carries over into this movie. There are times where his enthusiasm is so infectious that I started to get distracted from how cringe-worthy his dialogue was. He can't save the movie with the terrible jokes and lines he has but he did what he could. I felt sorry for Amber Heard when I watched Aquaman. She seemed like she was one big break from hitting the big time for a while there (to reach the Jennifer Lawrence, Brie Larson or even Anne Hathaway level) and this still isn't the right vehicle. Just like Jason, she's saddled with bad dialogue and an uninteresting romantic subplot, but she gives it her all. I thought Patrick Wilson gave the most committed performance, he's a regular collaborator with James Wan and while he's far from a memorable villain, he really delivers his lines like he was reciting Shakespeare. He's the type of actor I like even when he's not in great stuff and that continues in Aquaman. Temuera Morrison was my next favourite character, the best parts of the movie are when he and Momoa are hanging out in the beginning and they really feel like they could be father and son or at minimum friends. Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lundgren and Willem Dafoe showed up for work but just went a little over the bare minimum when it comes to the energy in their performances. The most over-the-top acting comes from Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Manta, I almost was laughing when he had his big dramatic moment early in the film. Manta is a hugely unnecessary character in this however, so I'll give him credit for doing the best job he could even if he was chewing the scenery.I'm not a DC hater I really enjoyed Wonder Woman and I enjoyed Suicide Squad despite its peaks and vallies in quality. I also like BvS, it got better with the ultimate cut but its a mixed bag of a movie. I went into Aquaman with low expectations, but the decent Rotten Tomatoes score gave me hope. I don't think this movie was as all over the place as Suicide Squad or Batman v Superman. It stayed at one level consistently, but it was consistently mediocre or bad. The likeable cast couldn't save this and while I didn't outright hate it, between the terrible dialogue, the embarrassing score (covering Africa with Pitbull? Really?) and the script elements that feel way too familiar or were covered better by better movies (think about the similarities between the arcs of Atlanna and Janet Van Dyne in Ant-Man and the Wasp), this is a disappointment and when I left the theatre with my friend and we were laughing at the movie. This is a 5/10 and I feel like I'm being generous.",Aquaman
167,Beejerman,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),9,18 March 2019,"The stage curtains open ...Well, that was impressive! There is no shortage of stunning visuals or graphics here. ""Aquaman"" is as epic as they come - the quest for a king becomes the story of a hero. This one delivers the goods.Every hero has to come from somewhere ... Aquaman's story begins with his parents. A lighthouse keeper and a Queen from the ocean. A love that should've never happened, but was destined to be. When soldiers are sent from Atlantis to bring home the Queen, she goes back to save and protect her husband and son. Years pass by, and Aquaman is doing his part to watch over the waters and the crimes committed within - but when a beautiful stranger appears to him one night asking him to come back and claim the throne that is rightfully his, he balks at the idea. Him? A half-breed? And his mother dead? However, when a display of power comes from the depths of the ocean, he knows what he must do.At first, I was skeptical heading into this one. It was nothing like what I expected. Then I realized, that I really didn't know what to expect. So, I guess it would be more accurate to say that it was better than what I expected. Usually when you have such striking visuals and CG work, it detracts from the overall story. Not so here. It actually adds to it. Jason Momoa really handles himself well in this role. He is completely believable and does a fine job of acting - not just a brute force, but showed appropriate emotion as well.I highly recommend this film for action and superhero enthusiasts.

170,elicopperman,Hysterical Popcorn Entertainment for All,6,31 May 2019,"One of the most infamous films to come out of the DC Extended Universe in definitely Justice League due to its messy structure and clear behind the scenes meddling. That being said, what followed up could very well be their most creative endeavor yet, and that is the cinematic stand alone flick centered around Aquaman. It also happens to be the only addition to this franchise that grossed over a billion dollars worldwide. After finally having watched it, I must say that it is arguably their most epic and rad flick they have made thus far.The main storyline revolves around Aquaman, a.k.a. Arthur Curry, who is the heir to the underwater kingdom called Atlantis. However, he is destined to step forward to lead his people against his half-brother, Orm, who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world. From that premise alone, the film has a very predictable narrative, and its not hard to figure out what happens throughout the runtime. In addition, the film has a rather pointless subplot centering on Black Manta seeking revenge towards Aquaman, and it barely has much connection to the progression of the film as a whole. Also, many of the other characters are two-dimensional at best, Arthur's relationship with Meta lacks the proper chemistry needed for a romantic arch, and the film may really didn't need to be nearly 2.5 hours.However, where the film may lack in originality, it more than ever makes up with a huge epic scale and some amazing action. It really feels as if director James Wan was having a field day with all the different set pieces the film displays. From the underwater regions, to the vast Sahara desert, to the coastal villages of Italy and more, the overall scope of the film really creates the feeling that were are viewing an epic globetrotting adventure. Not to mention, the CGI is highly imaginative and the vast amount of creature designs are enough to inspire plenty of animators and visual effects artists. All these different areas and monsters the film plays around with make me feel like I'm experiencing something out of this world, something that even some of the best superhero movies don't offer.Now admittedly, the film does feature unnecessary slow mo angles like the former DC films, but at least they don't rely on it. Also, most of the acting is relatively good, even down to Jason Mamoa seemingly having fun with his character. Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Temeura Morrison and Nicole Kidman are serviceable enough, whereas the likes of Amber Heard and Dolph Lundgren seem like they're underacting, and even the younger actors playing past forms of Aquaman come off as laughably bad. More often than not, trying to act bold and stoic doesn't really lead to an appropriately convincing performance, but then again, this movie isn't even about Oscar worthy performances. If anything, that Oscar goes to the catchy and upbeat rendition of Africa by Pitbull.Never in my life would I think I'd be enjoying a movie from this franchise solely out of its production values and creativity than the actual story. Despite its cliched storyline and hit or miss characters, Aquaman might be the most entertaining DCEU venture next to Shazam, although this one is more entertaining from how nutty it all is. Where Shazam was amusing and fun intentionally, this film creates such a crazy world of its own that it might as well be in the history books of biggest blockbuster superhero hits. Even if you're not a DC fan, I would actually recommend this movie due to the epic scope and highly imaginative visual aesthetic. It may be more brawn than brains, but as pure campy popcorn delight, you won't be disappointed at all.",Aquaman

I know Venom and Aquaman are different universes, but just comparing it to a similar superhero-based movie from around the same time.

It has a very good plot, excellent visual effects, brilliany star cast etc. Overall it is a decent movie. It is not like any movie in MCU in my opinion as some said it is similar to Thor. Aquaman has it's own style of narrative and place comparing to any other super hero movie. Jason Mamoa did a very good job but it is Amber Heard who stole the show. She's a real bad ass as Mera. Watch Aquaman in the best theatre in your town. It is worth watching and you will have a very good time.",Aquaman

The Atlantis guards are Power Rangers, the underwater fighter jets are from Star Wars, the battle with other underwater kingdoms looks like a battle from the Lord of the Rings, some personages are a version of the Street Sharks, even Godzila had a resurrection moment!. Do you remember the Disney's the Sword in the Stone? even the guy name is Arthur! Did you spotted the dinosaurs at Jurasic Park? I only missed a Smeagol-like scene with the trident... my prrrrecioussss.Ah, and a very funny scene is watching Aquaman trying not to fall (and looking very scared) from the roof of one house in Sicily (two stories high) , when he'd just jumped from a plane thousand meters high with no parachute in the desert.But Nicole Kidman was beautiful as always.",Aquaman

177,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Surpasses Marvel's Bloated Pretentiousness,10,22 December 2018,"Judged upon the comic books and, for this pop culture fanatic, the Ted Knight narrated cartoon of the 1960's, the original Aquaman resembled this movie's blond-haired, war-mongering villain...Half-brother to the ""new"" JUSTICE LEAGUE established, dark-haired, Hawaiian-looking Jason Momoa, whose power-hungry, utterly Caucasian little brother wants complete control of Atlantis to, of course, destroy the world...Having been born down there, the white boy's not a ""half breed,"" and it's very similar to the sibling rivalry between Marvel's perfect THOR verses the inferior, frustrated runt, Loki: But AQUAMAN is more precise and straightforward than Marvel's more episodic movies, also borrowing from - and taking the first name of - King Arthur's Sword in the Stone legend, and is arguably the best comic book outing since the first IRON MAN and X-MEN...Although, with all the CGI needed to make an underwater kingdom exist, it's funny that a movie mostly taking place in the ocean probably didn't get a single drop of water on the cast and crew. But all the hidden green screen in the world can't stop this energetic AQUAMAN from hitting the right marks since it takes the viewer from one location to another (a bit like MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL), and with each step there's a new literal clue to get to the next strategic level...All the while catching sporadic glimpses of, without being tethered to or having to tell half the story with, the Origin involving ""Aquaboy"" being trained by a wise mentor (Willem Defoe) that coincides while moving right alongside the present-time obstacles...And the ocean isn't all we dive into. From beneath the Sahara desert all the way to the middle of the Earth, director James Wan keeps the viewer's gravity in check as the camera establishes where our reality begins and this movie's fantastical regions begin, remaining simple yet involving as Momoa's Aquaman, with his own pretty Scarlet Johanson type in Amber Heard's Mera, go on what's basically a scavenger hunt to find King Neptune's all-powerful Trident-pitchfork that will allow Arthur aka Aquaman to... you know... do what he was born to do.The Spy Who Loved Me underwater Lotus... where they see the sea
The second coolest action scene occurs when our initially reluctant hero learns the importance of the mission's goal by failing without it - while the best fight plays out on an island's edge between Aquaman and Manta, who will be the sequel's lead villain, more or less a henchman here...And in the fun and frolicking Roger Moore James Bond flicks, which is another likely inspiration... especially the underwater vehicle that zips around ""down town"" in this unapologetic, non-stop rollercoaster ride... the worker bees make the best villains, and tend not to... drone on like the primary ones...Not that it's a perfect movie. Momoa and Heard's banter has a predictable ""He Said/She Said"" cadence, usually leading to She outwitting the physically superior He, or He surprising She with having an actual brain along with the brawn, and you might scream out ""Just kiss already"" after a few forced-heated moments...Meanwhile, Atlantis resembles a bright, shiny, neon arcade cartoon (albeit nicely scored with a fitting old-school techno score) and the puffy-buff sharks look right out of SHARK TALE...But there's always a good enough reason for our heroes to be wherever the hell they're at, and, unlike the last decade of Marvel, this is a tight action/adventure yarn for people sick of overlong, overly complicated and painfully melodramatic comic book epics. And yes, there will be a sequel. Sequels, actually. But this AQUAMAN proudly stands, and swims, by itself.",Aquaman

Aquaman on a boat? Aquaman on a boat?!!!!!? And why not Superman on a push scooter? What a pathetic non-sense!Synthetically: a middling pop corn movie.",Aquaman
180,PyroSikTh,"Pretty to Look At, but Rushed, Badly-Written, and Weightless",4,18 December 2018,"Aquaman's New52 run was a fantastic moment for the character, so it was definitely the best choice of story to adapt. Now here's the thing, the entire run covered four graphic novels - 25 issues - which is roughly two years of storytelling, including a crossover with Justice League (which added another five or six issues). That's huge. It's an epic story involving multiple smaller stories that all come together. For the movie, they came up with a story that was a combination of that entire 25-issue run. That's like trying to squeeze all three Lord of the Rings books into one movie.Okay, I get it, it was a loose adaptation for this very reason; cliffnote the important parts and tie together into a cohesive narrative, and I fully understand that things had to be moved about or cut out entirely in order to keep it manageable. Problem is, that's an antagonist per graphic novel, and we all know how the overabundance of villains affected Spider-Man 3. The Aquaman movie wants to squeeze in his origin and the fate of his mother, the Trench, Black Manta with his revenge for the death of his father, and Orm and his war on the surface world as antagonists (thank goodness they gave up on the idea of squeezing in the Dead King as well, and never even bothered with Vulko's betrayal), explore all seven kingdoms, and establish a romance between Arthur and Mera. It's too much to put into one movie, especially one as crazy and outlandish as this. It devolves the plot into a series of checkpoints that are all rushed through to get to the conclusion, meaning no moment is given time to breathe. None of the villains feel particularly well developed, Arthur and Mera's romance comes off as forced, the effects of everything on the outside world are completely forgotten about early on. Aquaman is just ferried from point A to point B to point C.Compounding this lack of space and atmosphere in the storytelling is the overdone formula of interruption. By which I mean if you took a shot everytime a serious moment was undercut by a cheesy one-liner, or a section of dialogue gets interrupted by an explosion, you'd be paralytic by the time the credits rolled. It was cool and unexpected the first time it happens, but by the third time it just got boring. I know! A movie featuring armoured sharks and a drumming octopus felt boring! How do you even manage that?!To continue the criticisms, what little immersion I had in this movie was completely broken by the nonsensical choice of licensed music. The use of Sigur Ros early on was a masterstroke I was completely behind, really suiting the scene it was put over. But then they lost their way and put in upbeat Depeche Mode over Black Manta building his suit after the death of his father, or getting Pitbull to sample/cover Africa by Toto (what?), and Skylar Grey's Everything I Need made the film feel like a Rom-Com once the credits rolled. For one, these songs were awful, but secondly they were just completely wrong for their scenes. The music's not all bad though. Rupert Gregson-Williams' score is actually pretty good. Not Hans Zimmer, Johann Johannsson or even Michael Giacchino levels of good, but by the halfway point it was his score that was keeping my sole interest going. Yeah, in a way it does sound like they saw Thor: Ragnarok and frantically tried to squeeze in as much 80s synth as they could, but I'll be honest, I think Gregson-Williams melded the 80s synth into the typical orchestral score much better than Mark Mothersbaugh did.And that's not my only praise either. The opening ten minutes or so sold me instantly that this could exceed my admittedly low expectations. The scenes between Nicole Kidman's Queen Atlanna and Temuera Morrison's Tom Curry were so charming and brimming with chemistry that you couldn't help but root for their romance. When Atlantis eventually came calling, we got a kick-ass fight scene with Atlanna acrobatically bouncing all over the house in a composite longshot, fending off the attackers and saving her family all at once. Unfortunately this was just about the highest point for me. Arthur beating on Manta senior and junior, and their crew, was pretty badass too, but after that all the action scenes lost their gravity. Literally. Underwater battles should be super cool, right? But I actually got kind of bored of them because there was no weight to any of the choreography. They just ""fly"" all over the place. None of the punches felt like they landed, and the breaking of Atlanna's trident was only impactful because of its emotional implication for Arthur.Another mote of praise I have, this time without any kind of criticism attached, was the visuals. Rushed story, awful music choices, and weightless action scenes aside, Aquaman is a devastatingly pretty movie to look at. The use of bright neon colours really gave it its own visual identity. Each of the seven kingdoms are designed so uniquely from one another that you can tell where you are at a glance. Arthur and Mera diving deep while being swarmed by the Trench is wall-mountingly gorgeous imagery. Of course there's the inherent concept of Aquaman's world as well, with armoured sharks, a drumming octopus, and soldiers riding giant seahorses. Atlantis looks truly mythological. And the CGI underwater hair is flawless, far better than other attempts in the likes of Inhumans or even the otherwise fantastic Arrival.I can't say I was disappointed in Aquaman, as I already had pretty rock-bottom expectations. It starts out incredibly strong, but it quickly goes downhill as they try to squeeze way too much into the story, forcing it to rush from plot point to plot point. It's formulaic and badly written, with some truly cringeworthy dialogue, a forced romance, and lofty action sequences that were frankly boring to watch. It's a really pretty-looking movie though, with some fantastic CGI and set designs, and every character is brought to life visually. I give Aquaman a bad 4/10. It's not the worst you'll see, but goddamn I wish I had gone to see Into the Spider-Verse instead.",Aquaman
181,Darth_Osmosis,A near perfect Aquaman film!,9,19 December 2018,"Aquaman is not the easiest character to adapt to the big screen, but this movie does almost everything right! It's comic accurate enough and not afraid to look weird or silly.. and it does also bring it's own updated concepts and ideas in the right places. The hero is likeable(a fleshed out version of ""Aquabro"" from Justice League is actually a damn cool guy) and has a definite arc during the movie where he grows and changes, in fact most of the characters do! The villains are believable(one is maybe a bit cliche but it's that kind of story) and have reasons for their actions besides just having cool powers/designs! Speaking of design.. the visual styles and design choices for characters, creatures and places are amazing. It's a joy to journey from one awesome looking place to another in this movie, and while it's a 2hr 23 min movie it never drags or feels long, it's a fast paced, action packed ride from start to finish. It does everything a comic book movie should with style. Definitely recommended!",Aquaman
182,roxmewild,Jason Mamoa saves DC without him this movie would join all the other DC flops,4,3 January 2019,I continue to watch DC films with the hope that some day they will develop movies of the standard of Marvel sadly I fear that day will never arrive. Not only do DC continuously have bad scripts but the story is weak! Aquaman is better than most mainly due to the lead actor Mamoa however the script and story base is still poor from an adult perspective although youngsters may love it?,Aquaman
183,ebeckstr-1,Abysmal,2,2 May 2019,"Wow. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Aquaman clearly demonstrates what Marvel has over DC in the cinematic universe. Aquaman suffers from weak storytelling, a poor script and terrible dialogue, incompetent directing, and some very poor casting choices. I have not seen Jason Momoa in Game of Thrones. Maybe he is excellent in that, but he is unwatchable in Aquaman, delivering his lines in a contrived, shallow manner. Maybe this is not entirely his fault. Given how bad the dialogue is, even Nicole Kidman could not deliver hers with any enthusiasm or sincerity. Momoa speaks almost every line of dialogue with two dimensional, cocky bravado, and his character is basically developed as a rather dim surfer dude, all of which I gather is supposed to be humorous. Whereas Marvel, despite occasional flaws, manages excellent storytelling in which the viewer feels invested, develops characters with genuine personalities, and conveys both genuine humor and pathos through those characters and that storytelling, Aquaman Falls flat on every level.I understand the overall fun people have with superhero movies, but that generalized enthusiasm should not extend to giving a movie this poorly made an average of 7.1 on IMDb. I don't know where people are getting this. The one thing this movie has going for it is beautiful animation. The fact that it looks like a video game, and more literally resembles a cartoon, is another factor which detracts from the overall effect, but it sure is pretty to look at.",Aquaman
184,funtasticfour,An impressive feat for a movie that seemed impossible to make!,7,3 January 2019,"Who ever thought Aquaman would get a movie? Or Guardians of the Galaxy or most of the other super hero movies we've gotten. Jason Mamoa is a big presence, but not the best actor, so DC surrounded him with great actors. This is a super cast, and a pretty good story, though it's pretty much what I expected, and a lot more stuffed in, just in case they don't get another chance. I think they will get to do another, but it's going to be hard because we've seen so much in this movie. This movie is fun, and well done, and also clearly a James Wan movie-for those Fast and the Furious watchers, there is a scene ripped right out of Fast Five. The main flaw, and it's hard to fault an underwater movie, is the overuse of CG effects. This is a problem with all DC movies, especially in the third act, and this one overly so. Marvel does CG too, but don't rely on it as much. But it's hard to help it, as I said, with so much under the sea. A lot of it looked great (hair flowing around, some of the huge explosions) Now that I've seen this movie competently done, I can't imagine what can't be done in movies, in the right hands.",Aquaman
185,JakeBrinkman,Bad for a superhero movie,5,6 April 2019,"I love superhero movies and shows, and this is the lowest I've ever rated one since the Iron Fist series. Don't get me wrong, 5 stars still means it was worth the watch, but I probably won't be rewatching this movie. There were two positives about the film. The first is the action, which is unquestionably amazing. It's very well-coordinated that I couldn't help but feel awed by some of the scenes, even while I wasn't emotionally invested in the scene.The second good aspect was Momoa. His devil-may-care attitude and raw prowess translate well to the big screen. This new take on Aquaman is a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre... except that it was already fresh in Justice League and he isn't ever given anything better than we've already seen, even in his own movie. Momoa does well in spite of it, but the character was not written as well as he should have been. In fact, even the emotional scenes where Momoa could have flexed his acting talents were given to a different actor by only occurring in flashbacks with a younger actor. It's difficult to get emotionally invested in a movie when it seems like the main character doesn't feel strongly about anything.As for the other characters, Wilson and Mateen both perform decently. Not outstanding since their one-dimensional characters had no depth, but also having enough potential to keep the viewer engaged if not satisfied. The story occasionally tries to touch on the villain's emotions, but the limited screen time never allows them to dive in. I truly believe the movie should have toned down the epic war scenes and focused on establishing Aquaman as a character along with introducing an intimidating low-threat villain with a little depth, like was done in Spider-Man: Homecoming. They could have easily done this by keeping Black Manta as the sole villain. Then they could saving the jaw-dropping spectacles for Aquaman 2, where Oceanmaster would be the main villain and they could have more screen time to explore Oceanmaster's ruthlessness and dynamic with Aquaman. Combining them into one film made for a movie so rushed that neither villain's story had any emotional weight.As for other actors, this is where we start getting from bad to worse. Not that any performances were outright bad, but they were certainly given horrible dialogue. Nearly all of the dialogue for Mera and occasional lines for everyone else were so cliched and/or cringe-worthy that it honestly makes you think the movie would have been better if the character didn't say anything at all at that moment. The worst moment was the Pinocchio joke; the joke itself was great, but the minute-long explanation of the joke actually had me squirming out of my seat with embarrassment for the entire superhero genre. Some of the other jokes were fine, but all of the subversive humor was awful. Subversive humor has already been overused in the Marvel series, so even though it was new for the DC series, it still felt contrived and unoriginal. In a movie with an entire franchise riding on it, screenwriting is not where you should start making budget cuts.On the subject of budget cuts, the budget could have been significantly smaller if a less-known actor was cast in the place of Defoe. Defoe is a great actor whose talents were absolutely wasted in this one-dimensional emotionless character (though he would have been good spread out with more screen time in my 2 movie idea). Again, no fault of the actor, but definitely a fault of the screenwriter.If it seems like my review is overly harsh, its because the superhero genre has given us a high standard to expect. This movie fell short in every single aspect, and it is definitely the fault of the poor screenwriting. Warner Brothers shouldn't have hired two relatively inexperienced low-budget writers for such a high-budget film.",Aquaman

It's a nice fun for popcorn eaters, but not more than that. Jason Momoa, while somewhat likable, got the role only because of his looks and not because of the acting (I can never forgive, never forget, how he raped the character of Conan... Whose idea was to give a Samoan chance to play a barbarian clearly inspired by the people of the north?! And don't even get me started on Khal Drogo...), so he can be eye candy. And I'm OK with that, but let's just please not commend him for acting, at least not yet, until he hasn't acted in something demanding. Movie was fun to watch, but it fails to be anything more than a fun blockbuster you watch and then forget about it, until you see it on TV 10 years later. It's a shame, after memorable Suicide Squad, that we had to come to this. Do I recommend the movie? Yes, for fun, it can serve it's purpose.

194,stevenrotherforth,With Aquaman DC are now a genuine rival for Marvel,9,11 April 2019,"AquamanHiring James Wan to direct Aquaman has thankfully injected some spirit into the DC universe.
With the dark and depressing first instalments coming from Zack Snyder and then a more upbeat effort in the form of Wonder-woman, Wans film has elevated DC to be a genuine rival for Marvel in terms of a cinematic offering.
If you have the opportunity to watch Aquaman on a 4K display with HDR then this is a must see movie. More on that later!Aquaman tells the story of Arthur Curry played with relish by the charismatic Jason Momoa. A film that my better half wasn't interested in seeing until she clapped eyes on a shirtless Momoa.
He may not be the greatest actor in the world but he surely owns every scene he's in.
His character is half human, half from Atlantis and his quest is to prevent his brother King Orm from waging war on the surface dwellers.
It's all a bit silly but still immensely entertaining and rather inventive.
Made so by some impressive visuals and direction by James Wan.
Set design and cinematography are reminiscent of James Cameron's Avatar.
From underwater cities to breathtaking landscapes this is one spectacular looking movie.
Every scene is a visual feast and as I mentioned this is a must see movie in 4K HDR.
The higher resolution will allow colours to burst
from your TV and the added layer of detail help bring underwater kingdoms and creatures to life.
High Dynamic Range is utilised here to reference quality. A must have purchase on Ultra High Definition Blu-ray if like I you are into Home Cinema.
Colours are so superb that this will be your new go to disc to impress friends with your set up.
Particular scenes such as the end battle show HDR to its full potential.
Depth is pretty decent too which helps the underwater environments have a sense of realism.
Subtle details are finely rendered.
Take Princess Mera's long flowing red hair for example.
HDR allows her hair to be very vibrant whilst a grain free digital image shows every strand of hair on the princesses head.
Costumes are also superbly presented.
Every scale on Aquaman's gold suit is distinctive and King Orms purple chest armour is so bright it almost looks three dimensional.
There are some soft shots particularly when CGI is at its heaviest but you'd be hard pushed to notice. I found the scene on the cargo plane to be flawless. A true 4K crispy image.If the picture quality is excellent then the Dolby Atmos sound mix is equally impressive.
On Ultra High Def Blu-ray this is reference quality too.
The LFE channel gets deep down and dirty with some floor shaking bass.
The scene in the Trench will have your subwoofer working overtime.
The Atmos mix utilises height channels superbly allowing atmospherics to blend in seamlessly.
Sound stage is wide and energetic making for a truly exciting surround sound experience.
A good sound mix is one that envelops the listener without them being aware and this one achieves this impressively.With a stellar supporting cast this film has a further ingredient to be a success.
At 2hrs 23mins James Wan has sculpted a movie that flows just like water.
Enough time is devoted in fleshing out the characters.
Sure more could have been done with the two lead villains. Patrick Wilson's King Orm and Yaha Abdul-Mateen II as Manta are possibly the most underdeveloped of all the cast but this barely hinders the sheer enjoyment of the movie.
Jason Momoa and Amber Heard as Mera have a believable chemistry and Hollywood superstars Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe bring the gravitas.
Dolph Lundgren puts in a second great performance of 2018 after his welcome return in Creed II.
The script and delivery of dialogue is punchy and jokes land with precision.
Aquaman is well made in all aspects and takes the DC universe out of the gloom.
I have no problem with the darkness of Batman Vs Superman. I just believe that Aquaman will appeal to a larger audience because it's more colourful and fun.
If it's spectacle you're after then Aquaman delivers big time.
It may not be as deep as say 'Logan' or 'The Dark Knight'
It may not have the years of backstory that was dedicated to 'The Avengers' but Aquaman is a vibrant treat that so far the DC universe has been missing.
Long live King Arthur!",Aquaman
195,Just-A-Girl-14,"Cheesy, terrible and fun!",7,16 October 2019,"I don't know if it's the movie or maybe it's the mood I'm in but sometimes I watch a really bad movie and I still have a lot of fun. This is one of those times.I'll start with the cons:
The CGI/special effects/costumes are REALLY bad! Some reviewers mentioned that they look like the Power Rangers and I agree, they really do. I also think there should be some physical differences between underwater people and regular people. They didn't have any fins or scales or anything like that. The only thing that was different was their wardrobe which, as mentioned, was really bad!The script also needed a lot more work in my honest opinion. I wish they'd put more emphasis on the way the two brothers were raised and their claim to the throne instead of on all those stupid wars and fights.On the plus side, the actors did a great job! I really like Jason Momoa! Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard and Willem Dafoe also did a great job. There's a lot of action and fun moments in the movie so if you're in a mood to see a fun cheesy superhero action movie, go for it.

I really enjoyed this amazing movie, visually its out of this world, I was so impressed as soon as it finished I headed straight here to share my experience.I've not seen a Jason Morgan movie before, I gotta say he's very entertaining, I think he's got some good movies to get through if he's as good as he was in this, remarkable peformance, I put off watching it for a while but im glad I finally decided to check it out, such an epic adventure.Again the effects were just so spectacular, I was very impressed and entertained throughout, the story is very intriguing, the cast were great and the intense scenes left me on the edge of my seat.Highly recommend, its so good!",Aquaman
197,maxglen,"Visually Gripping, Narratively Shallow.",7,9 March 2021,"I must say I didn't expect much from Aquaman. I'd heard a lot about how it was a complete betrayal of the character it was based upon as well as other criticisms on just about everything actually; but I went into it with an open mind and was pleasantly surprised. I'll start with what I didn't like so I can end on a high note. Narratively? This is about as surface level as it gets (all sea puns intended) it's literally the same 'chosen one unites the kingdom's after discovering the great power within them' story you've seen a thousand times. It's been done better but it's also been done way worse. That being said if I were to judge the film on story basis, I'd give it about a 5, real middle of the road, corner store storytelling. The acting? Is fine. Amber Heard is about as bad an actor as she is a person but everyone else is just okay with the exceptions of the two main villains, Black Manta and Orm aka The Ocean Master; they are both standouts in this movie and you can honestly sympathise with them. Of course Manta's on a warpath, Arthur left his dad to decide wether to drown or blow himself up, and in front of his son no less! Orm has been twisted over the years into believing the surface dwellers were evil and with a little help from pollution and him believing his mother died because of his Earth bound half brother, you can't blame him for not being their biggest fan.
Now, onto what I liked... the visuals in this film are top notch. There's a few scenes where some bits look a tad off but considering how CGI heavy this film is, it's amazingly consistent and framed beautifully. Most shots could be your desktop screensaver.
The action is also stellar and very easy to follow which makes for a nice change of pace. The whole scene in Sicily has to be my favourite though, it's where all the best elements of the film come together for a good old fashioned brawl between a fish man and a technologically enhanced pirate among the people of little Sicily. As for the character of Aquaman? Yes, he's nothing like the comics. I can see this upsetting a lot of people... that being said, I don't like the Aquaman comics all that much, so I'm indifferent. It was nice though to see everyone's costumes brought over faithfully though, how they made Black Manta, Aquaman and the Ocean Master's costumes look cool without changing much is astonishing. Overall, like I said, if I were rating just the story I would give it a 5 but the visuals tied together with the gorgeous set pieces push it up a few points. 7/10",Aquaman
198,DLochner,Interesting hero in a stupid world,6,31 March 2020,"What an interesting hero in a stupid world. In my eyes, Aquaman was a huge opportunity to create something really big - but the film was incredible and exaggerated by a thunderstorm of animations and colorful underwater world. The best thing about the whole film is the hero himself and the first 30 minutes of the film.",Aquaman
199,jetkot,Too much CGI,5,13 May 2019,The movie looks like an animation film. There is too much CGI and everything looks like Computer graphics. No scene looks believable or real. A flying superman or a batman with superhuman strength looked believable. But these underwater fights are a caricature of special effects and this kind of cinema.,Aquaman
200,Magow-Intermean,Aquaman review,9,14 December 2018,"Arthur Curry's (Jason Momoa) parents are a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison) and Atlantean queen (Nicole Kidman). When a war between the subsurface world of Atlantis and its ruler Orm (Patrick Wilson) threatens the human world, Curry must confront his past to save the day.
Imagine if someone cut together all the biggest action sequences from the last few decades of Hollywood, resulting in a mash of Tron, Avatar, Clash Of The Titans, Superman, Jurassic Park, and Gladiator. Imagine a film where an octopus gets a drum solo, and it isn't among the top ten weirdest moments. Welcome to Aquaman, where you won't have a clue what's going on, but you won't be able to look away either.
Our lead is Aquaman/Arthur Curry, a portrait of the superhero as bar-brawler. This sometime Justice Leaguer (it's barely mentioned) is larger than life and twice as fond of a beer. Arthur gives the impression Momoa just rolled out of bed, went surfing and drove from the beach straight to set, and the film's all the better for his slightly hungover air. But instead we cut away to endless Atlantean politicking, with Patrick Wilson's CGI-suited Orm floating around on a war-shark (which is a thing?), working on his Julian Sands impression. Orm wants a war with humanity, so executes a false-flag submarine attack. That might lead another hero on a film-long quest to prove humanity's innocence, but here it's barely mentioned again; nor is a first-act tsunami felt around the world. There are bigger, er, fish to fry.
There's entertainment in watching something so outrageously over-the-top.
Instead we're on two parallel but equally bonkers quests. Orm must unite his kingdom of Atlantis with Dolph Lundgren's seahorse riders, Djimon Hounsou's mer-men and Brian Blessed's crab dudes. Meanwhile, Arthur must escape a place, and decipher a thing to find another thing in order to earn the throne and stop the war. His primarily human upbringing means he's a fish out of water whenever he's in the water, following the long-ago disappearance of his mother Atlanna (Nicole Kidman). For guidance and a modicum of sense Arthur relies entirely on Amber Heard's Mera, a Little Mermaid cosplayer who is his main source of exposition.
The plot is honestly a mess: over-complicated yet predictable. What makes the film passably entertaining is that director James Wan throws astonishing amounts of action at the wall, and much of it sticks (though not always together). There's entertainment in watching something so outrageously over-the-top, exploding in such strange ways. Just when you think you have a handle on it, something bizarre will happen. Nicole Kidman defending her baby son by taking out a death squad, say, or villain Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, underserved) inexplicably detouring to the North Sea (the film's geography is deeply non-specific), or a Star Wars-alike battle on the seabed.
Momoa takes every inch of space the film gives him and runs a mile on sheer roguish charm, and Wan is a sufficiently gifted action director not just to keep you watching but to regularly dazzle you. But it's all just so much. You sense that they didn't trust this hero to hold our attention, and they really should have done. He's more fun than any octopoid percussionist.",Aquaman
201,Mike_Devine,"No 'Wonder Woman,' but wildly entertaining",7,23 December 2018,"The DC Universe has an uneven track record when it comes to recent film adaptations of its franchise. For every 'Wonder Woman' there's a 'Batman vs. Superman' or 'Justice League.' Thankfully for fans of these superheroes, James Wan's 'Aquaman' is closer to the former than the latter, at least in terms of entertainment value.While 'Aquaman' is pretty much billed as the Jason Momoa show, the cast actually does an excellent job sharing the limelight, even in the face of typically wooden dialogue. Amber Heard and Nicole Kidman do their very best as royalty from the sea, while Patrick Wilson surprises as scorned Atlantean brother King Orm - a role very different from those he is known for. Not to mention Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren, and a kraken voiced by none other than...Julie Andrews? As for villains, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II takes on the role of modern-day pirate Manta, whose suit looks like it would be a better fit in a Power Rangers movie.But the cast is not the main attraction here - it's the visuals. It's hard to imagine 'Aquaman' being filmed a decade ago when Vince Chase made it the biggest blockbuster in history on 'Entourage.' The level of preciseness required to make the underwater worlds of Atlantis and others come to life without coming off looking cheap is not to be taken for granted. There is such detail included to ensure these scenes are believable that in some instances it comes off as Pandora-like. This alone makes seeing the film on the big screen worth the price of admission.As for the plot, it's your standard comic book fare, with the hero story lifted from numerous films that have come before 'Aquaman.' In this case, the execution actually makes up for the poor storyline and scripting. The soundtrack and score are also above average for a DC Universe film, with the only exception being a ridiculous interruption from a Pitbull song that samples 'Africa' (but why?).'Aquaman' may not come anywhere close to 'The Dark Knight' series, or even hold a candle to some of the better quality Marvel efforts, but it surely is an entertaining ride that should be enjoyed for what it is.",Aquaman
202,arjunflamingfeather,THE MOVIE FINISHED JUST NOW,10,25 December 2018,"MEANING AQUAMAN brought a great celebration to CHRISTMAS 2018. Overall, all went according to AQUAMAN and since he is a man. CONTINUING that all THE WAY IN INDIA it has brought site searchers to this land of WARNER BROS PRESENTATION.",Aquaman
203,thomasjay-2201,Absolutely Bland,5,7 September 2019,"One of the worst superhero films out there and no surprise it's another from DC. A vast improvement on Justice League it's not much of a step up from rock bottom. It's at times unreasonable to expect realism from this type of film but I've never ever seen an outing that's looked so fan made or cheap as this. The non CGI costumes, characters etc. Look horrendous and there's two or three fairly big scale action sequences which are visually quite big moments but are vastly over crowded and just blur into a multi coloured mess. Overly long at nearly 2 and a half hours it's got no right to be so long and does seem to have moments where the foot is taken off the gas and becomes stagnant. Only positives to come from this are clearly Momoa and Dafoe who seem genuinely happy to be involved and perform quite well, other than that it could've been handled differently over multiple films maybe to be more impactful. Has similarities to the first Thor film but as you know by now the way these two franchises have been handled is vastly different and such Aquaman is a toothless and dull release",Aquaman
204,waqassaleem-85201,Fun film,7,6 July 2021,This is only a fun film. If you are looking for a serious dc movie then this isn't for you. The story of the film is good and the performances are good as well. The chi especially in Atlantis is faulty at times. Still worth a watch.,Aquaman

206,dianamarinelli,Don't listen to the critics it's not bad,7,8 July 2019,"One of the best movie of the dceu. It brings romance,action and humour to the film. The special effect and the action scenes were mindblowing. Definitely worth seeing!",Aquaman
207,vjnambu,Visual extravaganza,9,6 February 2019,"Following the marvel way and encouraged by the success of dark knight trilogy, DC established dceu in 2013 with man of steel which I found slow and boring but was a decent success. Then came another boring film dawn of justice and pathetic suicide squad. After that came the first female superhero film wonder woman which worked wonders for dceu. But those wonders didn't last after the release of justice league, a blatant copy of avengers.
And now, dceu comes with aquaman who we saw in justice league (but I was wondering where he was as only focus was on wonder woman flash and Superman).
Aquaman narrates the origin of Arthur curry half human half atlantean. In the first few minutes it captures your attention, with excellent action scene of Nicole Kidman. After then the film takes you to a visual treat. Jason momoa mass intro, underwater scenes, Atlanta kingdom, fight between Arthur and his half brother, escaping from Atlanta to get the golden trident, the superb action scene in Italy, Arthur getting the Trident and the final battle all these does not let you take off your eyes at the screen. Only drawback is story is not that great and slightly similar to Thor 1. Aquaman was my best 3d experience. On the whole, aquaman is an absolute visual treat which not even a marvel film provided me. DC must concentrate for the time being only on solo superhero films. Hats off to director James wan.",Aquaman
208,fciocca,Seems more a videogame than a movie,5,19 November 2019,"When it comes to ""Aquaman"" it is hard to write an opinion. The CGI is amazing, visually speaking, is stunning, I liked the representation of Atlantis and its creatures, it seems a scifi city, but underwater, being a fan of futuristic stuff. I simply loved it and I think that is one of the best SFX that I've watched recently. The problem is that, exactly like in ""Man of Steel"", the movie is overloaded of computer generated images. In fact you there are more CGI, than filmed scenes. You really wonder why they didn't just made an animation movie in motion capture. I can understand that the underwater location is actually very difficult to create stunt scenes, but with a budget of 160 million dollars (source: IMDb movie page), they could have come up with something.Costumes are simply horrible. I don't even know who approved them. Soldier costumes are a mix between a space suit and a diver suit. Without any doubt, the lowest point is Black Manta. It seems a bug, that you can easily crush. I laughed when I saw it. The actor that played him was really bad, not credible as a villain. They should definitely make better casting decision in Warner Bros. Speaking of which, I was really disappointed by Patrick Wilson, I think that he is one of the best actors in Hollywood and I watched many movies starring him, such as the entire saga of ""The Conjuring"", ""Insidious"" and I loved his interpretation in ""Watchmen"", so he even has already experience with superhero movies. In ""Aquaman"" was underwhelming and not credible at all as a villain, even less than Black Manta. He didn't even tried to create a credible character: no personality and no charisma. Jason Momoa is the usual supermacho guy that will always be stuck in this kind of roles, exactly like Vin Diesel, but at least this was a good choice, and actually I liked him playing Arthur.The DC Extended Universe has a lot of potentialities, but they are simply wasting it. Stop doing movies drugged of CGI like this one or ""Justice League"", give us some real actions, more stunts scenes like in ""Wonder Woman"", or ""Shazam!"" Stop creating this mindless movies with always the same story, try at least something different, as in ""Batman V. Superman"". DC is capable to create good movies if it wants to, and I have reported three valid examples. Let's only hope that the second Wonder Woman and ""Birds of Prey"" movies, will be good.",Aquaman
209,asb_deutsch,Aquaman or Rajnikant 2.0? Atleast this CGI roller-coaster will please every Marvel fan!,5,23 December 2018,"I have mixed response after watching this flick. First the visuals.
I watched Aquaman in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with no chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing. In a nutshell, a Picasso masterpiece of visuals.Where is the character development? And where's the mission? The first half was nice, especially the script falls flat. It was more like Slaughter-man to me. I mean, what was Aquaman's weakness, to begin with? Black Manta's father shot him with a launcher and it seemed that it bothered Aquaman like a mosquito bite! Seriously, if Manta was not part of the movie it would have been worse.For Superman, it is Kryptonite. Then why Aquaman was punched and KO in Justice League? At least there was a twist in the middle of JL.Or pure female fantasy? I mean it was nice that Meera's character was not portrayed as a damsel in distress. She was looking sexy in the tight suit but why forced feminism? Why did Atlanna cry when both brothers were fighting? Rather she just saw her son going to 'bars"" without a tear in her eye. Arthur and Meera going to Africa and Italy seemed like they were planning on a honeymoon!Verdict: Avatar+Tron+Star Wars+2.0*
My score is 4.5/10 but I will add 0.5 since the visuals were far much better than BvS and JL. And I watched The Dark Knight as it commemorated a decade recently. No DC/Marvel movie has even came close to that masterpiece. Sigh!*Rajnikanth can do everything and anything, and Aquaman is no different!",Aquaman
210,Puroo,"Since the haters have marked my review unhelpful, I will increase my rating to 10 stars just to rub salt on their wounds",10,21 April 2021,"Before this movie I had literally no idea who Aquaman was. I had never seen the comics, cartoons or the weird GameCube game. When this movie's trailer dropped I thought it was just a random superhero on whom DC is making a movie, like Plastic Man or Karate Kid (the DC one, not the popular franchise one). And so I walked in completely blind for this movie. And I'd say this may be a beautiful adaptation of the superhero, but definitely far from perfect.Unlike most DCEU movies which always have a lot going on, Aquaman has literally nothing going on. Or so it seems, because in this movie he has to discover his legacy, find his mother, stop his brother from attacking land dwellers, save himself from Black Manta who wants to take his revenge from Aquaman for having let his father die and also manage his relationship with his father, step-father, brother and Mera. And in spite of having so much this movie has a ton of breathing content, because each of these things barely last for 10 minutes.The visuals are absolutely gorgeous. The characters travel all across from the stormy lighthouse, the colourful Atlantis to the Sahara Desert and Sicily. The fight scenes are all well choreographed although they always begin with interrupting the dialogues. Depending on which character we look at, they are somewhat similar to their comic book counterparts. The sense of humour is, well, at least it's better than the 2017 Justice League.I was interested in the movie only because of its visual effects. And I got that. So I have no complaints. This movie was satisfactory, but not really great. I wouldn't mind seeing it again, it just won't be as interesting as the first time. It's pretty surprising to me that this is the highest grossing DC movie of all time, even though it literally had nothing substantial to offer. I hope they add a little more depth to the story in the sequel, because if Aquaman is really a legendary character then they have to make him look like one, and that won't come by just adding visual spectacles.",Aquaman
211,DeBBss,"Great visuals, but missing a good screenplay",5,6 April 2021,"Aquaman's plot is incredibly weak. Aquaman (2018) doesn't offer anything interesting to the DCEU, or the superhero genre. It's as bland as it'll ever get. The only remarkable thing about Aquaman was the visuals. It's a very pretty film to watch; it has a vibrant color palette, good cinematography, and decent CGI, for the most part. The camera movement in the fight scenes were by far my favorite part about the film. Other than that, it's either bad or average. None of the characters were interesting, not even Arthur Curry/Aquaman. His character was just written so terribly. At first he's down to Earth and serious, then halfway through the movie he starts acting like a dumb kid and cracking childish jokes. I don't know if there was a giant rewrite, but it was jarring to watch.There are two villains of the story, Black Manta and King Orm. Both of these villains are so forgettable and bland. The only thing that's unique between the two is Black Manta's armor. The antagonists are by far the worst part about Aquaman. The plot is generic, too. It doesn't do anything thought provoking, it's just a cliche superhero story.The only good part about the movie is the action and cinematography. The film is entertaining for the most part. It's a decent watch, but it's incredibly generic. I just hope that the sequel learns from the first and improves the screenplay.",Aquaman
212,W011y4m5,Average & hollow.,6,4 April 2019,"Aquaman is an ""alright"" movie which relies solely on its breathtaking visuals to maintain the audience's interest; the camera-work is kinetic & inventive & brings a real sense of liveliness to the sequences which are expertly choreographed & shot together harmoniously, as are the enormous battles - akin to James Cameron's Avatar or Star Wars set underwater; the visual effects are groundbreaking, mind-blowing & in abundance throughout - shot in a beautiful IMAX ratio that captures the scale of the film's multiple set-pieces but unfortunately, besides that, all the movie really offers is just mindless visual spectacle...
Granted, the world-building is impressive & the costume & set design really are a sight to behold but all of these things simply add to the slightly superficial feel... Purely aesthetic.
Won't however deny it it was fun to sit through - it's watchable - & Jason Momoa & Amber Heard have great on-screen chemistry but that doesn't excuse the paper thin plot & its total lack of substance underneath, not to mention the plot conveniences which had my eyes rolling, the cringey choices of music, wasted villain with great potential, weird score, forced humour & one-liners etc.
It's messy, convoluted, inconsistent & tries desperately to distract you from these flaws with its only reliable strength or selling point: the CGI.",Aquaman

A central theme that was wisely developed by Jason Momoa in his speech at the United Nations on September 27, 2019.Can't wait for the continuation of his adventures and his teaching.",Aquaman
214,gavinp9,Fun and not-too-serious - good superhero film.,7,26 December 2018,"'Aquaman' is almost the best DC film since the Dark Knight trilogy - it's certainly more fun, colourful and enjoyable than 'Justice League', 'Batman v Superman' and 'Man of Steel'. 'Wonder Woman' is still the benchmark, but only just. The film works well as both an origin story and a coming-of-age story. Arthur (Momoa) is the offspring of Tom (Morrison), a lighthouse keeper, and exiled Queen of Atlantis, Atlanna (Kidman), making him half-man, half-Atlantean and the heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis.We see Arthur trained by Vulko (Dafoe) in flashbacks and helped in the present by Mera (Heard). To stop his step-brother Orm (Wilson) from starting a war with the ""surface dwellers"", Arthur has to embark on a journey to track down an ancient trident that will make him King of Atlantis and unite the two realms. There's enough tongue-in-cheek-ness and charm from Momoa to help you past some of the daft moments - Manta's suit (overall a weak villain), octopus drums, plesiosaurs, underwater fire and giant seahorses.It's not too long (just over 2 hours) and is fast-paced and much of the story makes it feel like a cross between 'Indiana Jones' and 'Lord of the Rings', with many of the underwater colours reminiscent of 'Avatar' - none of which are bad things. The battle at the end is all a bit absurd, but there's so much colour, action and humour to make it worthwhile. Wish all DC films were as joyful as this!",Aquaman
215,thebricks,Felt like watching high school kids make a superhero movie,5,23 December 2018,"What can I say? Pretty mediocre movie from start to finish. Everyone is just here to pick up a paycheck. The lead, Jason Momoa, is too busy trying to channel nineties metal rockstars instead of trying to play Aquaman. It's disturbing at times to see alcoholism being glorified onscreen. What's up with that? Everyone onscreen is going through the motions because they're being asked to play a part in a movie that's already been done a few dozen times before or more that's been done to death. I'm honestly surprised no one has done a parody of superhero movies yet. So many of them follow the same formula.The end was the worst part of the movie. Nothing was convincing about it. Amber Heard just looked embarrassed. She can't act. It's tragic. She totally knew she was on a set, doing a movie role for a quick buck. She put no effort into convincing the audience of who she was playing onscreen.Watch in IMAX if you can, some of the cinematography is just gorgeous. Yahya Abdul-Mateen deserves some recognition for his part. I felt this movie may have been a lot better with him as Aquaman. Jason Momoa can't act, I mean, if this was the best you could do, at least just cast Yahya as the lead. He deserves much better and was the one good thing about this film.",Aquaman

217,januszlvii,King Arthur,10,26 December 2018,"There is no doubt that the British legend of King Arthur played a large role ( the character was even named Arthur and there was a pivotal ""Sword In The Stone"" scene, so if you like such stories Aquaman will be very appealing. What I really liked was 1: Spoilers ahead: Vulko did not die. In so many movies the mentor of the hero or heroine ( in the case of Wonder Woman) ends up well ""Sleeping With The Fish."" 2: The relationship between Mera and Arthur. It is serious ( Mera saving him), playful and finally romantic. In addition, both characters grow throughout the movie ( always welcome). 4: The special effects really worked. Far too often they are predictable ( like in Avatar where they created scenes that were supposed to be ground breaking but were rehashes of westerns like the Indian campfire and the animals which were obviously stuff like panthers). 5: Humor. Too many DC Movies lacked humor ( Suicide Squad excluded), here you get some without insulting the audience. Spoilers ahead: The scene with the bikers in the bar was exceptionally well done and it's outcome was not what I expected. Basically Aquaman was my favorite Non-Batman DC movie. 10/10 stars.",Aquaman

220,flicklover,Please let James Wan reboot Superman!!!!,8,23 December 2018,"Aquaman has never been one of my favorite superheroes but I was looking forward to this film because I like James Wan as a director. DC has mostly failed miserably over the years trying to create a universe to compete with Marvel. They do have what I think is the best superhero trilogy in the Dark Knight films but since then they gave the keys to Zack Snyder to start their universe with Man of Steel. Even though I kind of liked it, I never really agreed with his take on Superman. My fears were confirmed when Batman vs Superman came out. That film was embarrassingly bad. Snyder had taken two of the greatest comic book heroes and stripped just about everything we love about them. The only good thing I can say about that film is that it is only slightly better than Batman and Robin directed by Joel Schumacher. But that film was just horrible in every way. Justice League was ok, but not near as good as the Avengers series. Then finally DC got it right with Wonder Woman. That film was great. It presented an origin story but it also made the main character something that Mr. Snyder didn't do. Wonder Woman was a HEROIN!!! She wasn't the brooding bores that Batman and Superman were in his films. The film was fun and rousing, as I think these type of films should be.Well DC has finally got has gotten it right again with Aquaman!!! I hadn't really thought much about Jason Momoa as Aquaman in Justice League, but here he makes the character his own. The setup is relatively quick with Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, an princess that had escaped Atlantis to avoid marrying a man she didn't love.
Temuera Morrison plays Thonas Curry, a lighthouse keeper that notices Atlanna on the shore and rescues her. They fall in love and have a baby named Arthur. Shortly after he is born, they are attacked by Atlantian soldiers and she goes back to Atlantis to protect Arthur and Thomas. Then the film moves forward to Aquaman rescuing a submarine from pirates in a great action scene. In that scene Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is introduced as David Kane, a villain that would later become Black Manta. Then the film goes to Atlantis where we see that Orm, played by Patrick Wilson. He is Arthur's half brother and wants to wage war with the surface world. Arthur is almost killed with his father in an attack with a tidal wave but is saved by Mera, played by Amber Heard. She is an Atlantean that has been chosen to marry Orm but tries to convince Arthur to come to Atlantis to claim his birthright as King. He refuses, he had been rejected by Atlantis as a half breed. Mera convinces Arthur to go with her to help prevent Orm's attack on the surface. Once in Atlantis, they meet Vulko played by Willem Dafoe. Vulco had trained Arther in his youth to fight at the request of Arthur's mother. He tells Arthur and Mera that they should find the Trident of Atlan, a weapon that had been wielded by the first king of Atlantis. If Arthur would get this magic artifact, he would he accepted as King of Atlantis. Suddenly they are ambushed and Arthur is captured, but Vulko and Mera escape. Once captured, Orm confronts Arthur and tells him thT their mother had been executed for the crime of having a half breed son. Arthur challenges Orn to a duel in front of all of Atlantis do determine the rightful king. Orn defeats Arthur, but Mera rescues him. They both travel to find the Trident of Atlan. They go to the Sahara Desert to find where the weapon was forged. There, they unlock a holographic message that leads them to Sicily. They find the coordinates to the location of the trident. Orm had given David Kane weapons to kill Arthur, he used that technology to built the Black Manta suit. When Arthur and Mera are in Sicily, Black Manta attacks them, almost killing Arthur before being thrown from a cliff to his apparent death. Mera helps Arthur heal and tells him to embrace his destiny as a hero as they go find the trident. They arrive to their destination but are attacked by some monsters called The Trench but are able to escape. They find a wormhole and are transported to a ocean at the center of the earth. There, they are unexpectedly reunited with Atlanna. She had been sacrificed to The Trench but was able to survive. Arthur goes to retrieve the trident, facing Karathen, the creature that guards the trident. Arthur is able to prove his worth and reclaims the trident. Arthur emerges with the traditional Aquaman suit. Along with Atlanna and Mera, he goes to confront Orm. Orm had already started the war that would eventually go to the surface. Once Orm's followers see that Arthur has the Trident if Atlan they embrace him as King. Arthur then confronts Orm and demands that he renounce the thrown. After they fight, Orm is deafeated. Orm then discovers Atlanna is alive and accepts his fate. Atlanna finally returns to the surface and reunites with Thomas as Arthur ascends to the throne in Atlantis.Aquaman succeeds at being an epic superhero story. James Wan and company have created a very entertaining and I evolving film. And as in the case of Wonder Woman made Aquaman what he should be, a hero to root for. Jason Mamoa plays Arthur with a lot of humor but also with heroic conviction. All of the cast is good, especially Amber Heard as Mera. She and Mamoa have good chemistry. The look of the film is predictably spectacular. The world of Atlantis is really great to look at. Even though it is obvious that the characters are not underwater the effects make it as believable as it could be. But the characters and story make the film enjoyable. I'm glad that DC has finally found the way to do justice to their heroic characters. I hope with the success of this film, Jane's Wan is given the chance to reboot Superman the right way. I really enjoyed Aquaman!",Aquaman
221,eberkerbatur,Best visual effect movie by this year,8,27 January 2019,"This is my favorite movie in the dc cinematic universe.I liked the movie wonder woman, but I think this movie was better.
I had already guessed that this film would be beautiful beacuse the director James Wan and I was very curious.
I guess it was the best visual effect of this year as I wrote in the title.
I think the cast team was chosen very well and the acting was great.
I liked the battle scenes a lot,it was a nice,i would recommend to everyone.",Aquaman
222,sreeragmeppadath,THE BEST!!,8,18 December 2018,This is how you should direct a comic based story.Stunning visuals and pacement.Its More than what we expect.Dont miss the theatre experience,Aquaman
223,kermitkid,Better than it has any right to be,8,31 March 2020,"This was fin-tastic! In my ""Justice League"" review last year, I praised the way they handled Aquaman, and made him cool instead of the butt of the joke that he's been for the past 75 years. He's just as cool here. From the opening battle to the final battle, his awesomeness has no end. The story is pretty good, though I did feel like I'd seen a lot of it before, but it's such a fun journey, that I didn't care. The action sequences, at least when they're grand scale battles with wide shots or pan-shots, look gorgeous. The hand-to-hand combat stuff, not so much. The way those are shot made me feel like I was watching someone play the ""Injustice"" games. Some of the dialogue is pretty corny, but that's the case with most DC films lately. They're trying to be live-action Saturday morning cartoons. I have no problem with that in the action aspect, but some of the dialogue really needed some re-writes. I usually complain about CGI in Warner Bros. movies saying how it always looks like a trailer for a PS2 game from 2004, but that's not the case here. Ok, there were some parts underwater that were very obviously green screen, but those were few and far between, at least not to the degree of ""Wonder Woman"" where I could tell when things were CGI. Most of the cast is pretty good, but I do need to complain just a little bit about Amber Heard. During the fight scenes, she was great, but anytime she had dialogue, her lips came up into a sort of sneer, like she was smelling rotten eggs. It didn't matter what the line was. It always looked like that, and it was distracting, and a bit funny. A lot of times it also sounded like she was trying to imitate Scarlett Johansson with the line delivery. In fact, if I closed my eyes, I could almost mistake her for Scarlett Johansson. The movie also had a lot of unnecessary figurative hand-holding for the audience. Every time there was a new location it felt the need to tell you where you were, despite the fact that most people could figure it out from visual context clues. It's obvious we're in Atlantis, it's obvious this is the Sahara. You don't need to have the text on the screen tell us. We're not dumb. We can figure it out in the first 5 seconds of seeing the location. By far the best part of this movie is the directing and cinematography. The wide shots are just gorgeous and the non hand to hand battles are well directed too. For a movie called 'Aquaman' where the main character's power is talking to fish, this was a lot better than it had any right to be. This is definitely, surprisingly, one of DC's best.

224,MogwaiMovieReviews,"So, So, So, So, So, So Bad",1,6 March 2019,"'Aquaman' was so, so, so, so, so, so bad... It started out mind-numbingly predictable, but I thought 'well, it might still be a fun, colourful bit of disposable fluff regardless'. But then it got worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse.Not one single 'character' behaved in an interesting, believable or relatable manner, and the script appeared to have been written by someone who had never actually seen a movie before but had instead been raised exclusively on World of Warcraft.And actually, the experience of the 'film' was more like one of those youtube videos watching someone else playing a video game, passively observing someone else constantly 'unlocking levels' and being fed endless new challenges (""now you gotta get the OTHER trident!"") with no reason for any of them to matter to the viewer.Every attempt at humour fell flat and seemed out of character for characters that paradoxically had no character, and every time any of the actors (and particularly the actresses) had to do anything but walk forward in a straight line, they were replaced by terrible computer game CGI animation. I was trying to figure out if ANY of the scenes were not just shot in a big green room but I could only count about four.The only positive thing I could find to say about the whole embarrassing affair is that sometimes the pretty coloured lights looked sorta nice, once in awhile. That really is it. For a $200,000,000 budget.My GOD, it's bad. Even Captain Marvel has to be better than this(!)",Aquaman
225,Brooklynsmagicmike,Awesome Movie! Don't understand what the hate is about.,10,26 October 2019,Loved this movie very much. Engaging and moves along at great pace. Its also loaded with action and alot the Characters were fun to watch.,Aquaman
226,projectsgamer,7/10,7,18 March 2021,It is a decent movie I feel like the good of told a better story of Aquaman and the 2nd half is so boring did not do much for me and cheesy ness was not the best thing either,Aquaman
227,SilverOrlov,Is it really DC film?,7,22 April 2019,"Marvel films for me have always been bright, colorful and funny. While the films of DC were dark, serious, to some extent brutal atmosphere. That is how I divided these ""universes"". Up to this time. Aquaman is interesting, BUT! very colorful, romantic comedy with fireworks at the end. Was it really a DC movie?",Aquaman
228,CountJonnie,James Wan kickstarts the DCEU with his Aquaman,8,29 December 2018,"Sure, Aquaman has its flaws, being full of cliches and predictability. What else do you expect with a story about a man who is caught between worlds, and has to face his family, in order to unite the worlds? (LOL)Other than that, Aquaman is a brilliant superhero movie, playing in a newly created world, which is a wonderful combination of Lord of the Rings, Abyss and Avatar, and perfectly matching sound effects. Despite the story being predictable, and being loaded with effects, Aquaman never becomes superficial. It offers enough background and soft moments, to make almost every character, even those with little screen time, interesting, believable and likable. On the other hand it offers enough action and speed, not suffering under special effects, to be continuously entertaining.Is it a perfect movie? No. Is it the best superhero movie? No. But it's a movie that never feels rushed, contains all necessary elements including some well timed comedy, and is perfectly balanced. This makes this movie incredibly entertaining, and the first movie that can actually compete with Marvel, and is hopefully a promise of more to come. Having said that, the only real bad parts were Amber Heard who is little more than eye candy and may remind you of Pamela Anderson in Barb Wire. Dolph Lundgren may thank his lucky stars for being in this flick, but should focus on Expendable sequels.Aquaman is an epic and fun visual spectacle. Thanks to James Wan, a director who knows how to handle this and various other genres!!",Aquaman
229,dasa108,"Long, too long. If they edited 40 minutes it would be much better",4,8 September 2021,"The history of Aquaman according to historical tradition was undone to offer this film full of pyrotechnics and visual excess. That's a big mistake by the folks at DC and Marvel: remaking and remaking each character so they don't look at all like what we knew as kids. Taking this into account, the rest of the story is known: a queen appears lying near a lighthouse, is picked up by a caretaker who looks like a Latino, they have a son who looks like a Samoan, who later meets his brother who He is Caucasian and then falls in love with a dyed redhead. I forgot; one of the villains is black. Here Aquaman is a drunkard, partier, with a childish attitude and with small details of humor. With that in mind we started. The story then through a very long sequence of events that are only explained thanks to the large budget for visual effects. In the middle of the movie your eyes hurt. The ending is like Lord of the Rings without the epic or the depth of that masterful trilogy. The film is entertaining but has nothing to make it unforgettable.",Aquaman
230,WalkdenEntertainment,Fish out of Water!,8,9 January 2019,"At a young age, Arthur Carry discovers that he has the power to communicate with sea creatures and discovers he is only half human. Arthur also learns about his mother who was a Queen of an underwater kingdom known as ""Atlantis"".Arthur aka Aquaman is now fully grown and has been called to return to his kingdom to claim his throne and accept his destiny. Arthur will now also be hunted by a new ruler known as ""King Orm"" (Patrick Wilson), who desires to destroy Aquaman and rule the earth.For those who have seen the film Justice League, you will know that the actor Jason Momoa is fantastic as the character of Aquaman. Once again, Jason Momoa is easily the best element of this new superhero instalment. I also enjoyed how this film provided further character development in Aquaman's past and upbringing. I also enjoyed seeing his new enemies. Aquaman is a hero who has awesome skills but also isn't perfect. He is a hero who has faults which I feel many audience members will enjoy connecting with. I enjoyed seeing how Aquaman is a rather humourus character and as an actor, it's obvious that Jason Momoa is simply enjoying playing the character. I personally feel he was somewhat born to play Aquaman.As far as visuals go, this would easily be DC's best looking film. Sure, my mind tell me this is mostly digital effects and green screen, but I cannot deny how good this film looks and sounds. Visually this is a stunning film. The film's audio track is also fun, snappy and somewhat beautiful. The film's soundtrack reminded me of what we saw in Thor: Ragnorok, but still differs in its own way.As a plot I don't feel this is something that differs too much to what we have already seen in films. But! you know what, I still found this film fun and rather enjoyable. Previously, the highest rated film from DC from me was Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman delivered a great story and a dramatic film, but its jokes somewhat suffered. Here we now have what I feel is a simple plot with colourful fun, action and jokes. Some viewers may feel the duration is a slight stretch, but given this also includes Aquaman's origin story, I felt this was to be expected.Overall, once again DC has delivered a sucessful superhero. This movie is brainless, fun, colourful and not to mention... humourous. Jason Momoa is fantastic as Aquaman and brings a great addition to the DC world of superheros. While the plot might be something we have seen before, I still had a blast watching this film and look forward to what's to come next from DC.8.0/10

231,Apollo15AnnoPianoCatDogSnailAnt,DCEU solo flicks are good,4,19 May 2020,"I think that this movie upkeeps the tradition of DCEU being at least good with solo ventures, the story is kinda routine, dir. is good though (the same guy who did Saw 1).",Aquaman
232,srdjan_veljkovic,Not interesting,5,8 February 2019,"It's not boring all the time. It's actually boring just a few times. But, most of the other time it's simply not interesting.It has many flaws. It's way too long. It looks like a not-so-good video-game. Amber Heard is past her prime, at times she actually looks bad - and has not learned acting skills to compensate. Temuera Morisson's ""digital deaging"" is terrible. It was supposed to give us Jango Fett, instead we got some overweight strange-looking middle-aged guy. The story is way too ""all over the place"" and derivative (of Black Panther movie, Dune and bunch of others). There's no explanation for Mera's powers of water manipulation, which nobody else demonstrates. Most of the humor is pretty flat as is most of the acting (it's not only Amber). Most of the stuff that's going on does not make sense, even for a comic book movie.But, it's not terrible, not even really bad. There are good jokes here and there, most of the time it's not boring, it carries through and doesn't fall apart at the end. Feminism isn't too crazy. Sure, Mera saves and guides our hero in ways that don't make sense, including beating up several commandos, but at least she doesn't beat Aquaman and his brother up. The Sicily segment is nice, its action sequences are the only ones that make much sense and are interesting - hell, even Amber looks decent here and almost really acts.There are worse super-hero-origin movies, but, this one, all things considered, is not worth a watch.Probably the best joke comes at the start, when Nicole Kidman, finding herself above water for the first time, sees the terrible device that is the TV set and immediately destroys it as the biggest threat. But, there are a few later on. Just don't get annoyed at the many one-liners that Aquaman tries to pull (only a few of which actually work).",Aquaman

Who the hell wants to conquer water? It's stupid. Riding a sea horse. Ugh! So the question remains, has Aquaman been converted from a beta male soy boy ninny to a manly man with this movie? I guess. I don't know. Aquaman is entertaining but the ""special"" effects are a bit questionable. Some of it looks blatantly fake and some of the action sequences were quirky. But overall, it does have some creative garbage and the action was overall fun. The story is predictable just like every one of these dumb @$$ super duper hero movies and the ending was a bit anti climatic. The final battle sucked @$$. Aquaman was aiiight but nothing special.",Aquaman

235,williampsamuel,Good Dumb Fun,6,4 January 2019,"It occurred to me more than once as I watched this movie that Aquaman is basically DC's answer to Thor. Now I know full well that Aquaman was created in response to Marvel - then Timely Comics- Namor. But this Aquaman; the big, strong, kinda dumb hunk with the beard, the magical weapon and the goofball sense of humor, he's DC's Thor. And this movie, this equally goofy, fast paced, action driven blockbuster about a heroic fish out of water character (pun intended) fighting his brother for the throne; it feels a lot like the Thor franchise. For better and for worse.Like Ragnarök, this whole production Is so cheerfully goofy. For instance, when Aquaman first faces his brother in a gladiatorial arena in front of cheering crowds, there's a holographic display of the fighter's stats, just like on ESPN. Later, Aquaman actually suggests peeing on something to properly hydrate it. Yes, it's that kind of movie. So naturally, the plot, such as it is, is completely predictable and exists mainly to string together the fight scenes and comic relief sequences.And these are very good. I especially enjoyed the showdown with Black Manta that featured so heavily in the trailers, while the submarine fight in which they first meet made for a refreshingly serious change of pace. The gladiator fight is a lot of fun, and the massive final battle with multiple undersea fleets shooting it out even more so, though both scenes ended a bit too soon for my taste. The comic relief meanwhile is nonstop and pretty much all good, especially when Aquaman and Mera are bickering. They're a lot like Emmett and Wyldestyle from the Lego Movie, only with stronger romantic overtones.It would be an understatement to say that Aquaman has tight pacing. With the exception of one inexplicable Semi Obligatory Lyrical Interlude, this is not a movie that believes in slow build-ups or stopping to catch its breath. Towards the end things keep speeding up more and more until everyone's rushing through every plot twist and expository speech like they've gone way over schedule and the crew is about to kick them out of their sound stage. And it's a good thing the pacing is fast, or else the numerous plot holes would be even more noticeable.Like why doesn't Atlantis send emissaries to the surface to deliver a warning before declaring war? Why did Mera sneak Aquaman into Atlantis to show him something that she could easily have taken to him? How can the instructions for finding an ancient treasure involve something that wouldn't be built for millennia to come? You don't get to ask these questions, because by the time you get to them Aquaman is punching a bunch of monsters in the face.While the plot may not be anything special, the visuals certainly are. This is an absolutely gorgeous movie. From the impressive set pieces and location shots in Sicily, to the futuristic, glowing Atlantean weapons and armor, to the massive battle sequences, every bit of this movie is a feast for the eyes. The production design is honestly Oscar worthy, which is the only that phrase can be applied to this movie.Much of the dialog could easily have come from a Saturday morning cartoon or a high school play. Sometimes that's clearly intentional, meant to establish how clueless our protagonist is. Other times it just feels like no-one bothered to review the script or read the lines aloud before shooting, and the laughs are entirely unintentional. Sometimes I wonder how the actors are able to recite their lines without cracking up. Or why they didn't write new lines on a napkin between takes. But hey, I guess that's just part of the cheesy goodness.Overall, this movie is dumb as all get out, but fun enough to mostly make up for it. Aquaman may not be Wonder Woman, much less Avengers, but it's no Dawn of Justice or Suicide Squad either. It's a step in the right direction for DC, and a pretty good popcorn flick.",Aquaman
236,coombsstephen,A decent movie taking a different angle on the normal superhero caper.,7,6 February 2019,I must admit I am not a comic book fan so I knew nothing of Aquaman before seeing this. As a standalone film it works. The story of the sea gods is quite different for me and I thought is was done well.The lead character was a bit of a relief from the normal super hero and I thought he was played well. Some of the side characters got a bit irritating and the film took a predictable path towards the end but it was still well worth the watch.,Aquaman
237,Darkjak007,80 years of ridicule now everyone thinks Aquaman's Cool,7,19 July 2021,"James Wan takes a break from Horror and takes a shot at superheroes with Aquaman. One of the original founder of the justice and the butt of a joke since 1941. We follow the event after justice league Arthur Curry(Jason Momoa) is still saving lives and visits his father on occasion. One day Princess of Xebel Mera(amber heard) arrives and tells Him that his half brother orm(Patrick Wilson) has waged war on the surface and he needs to return with the trident of King Atlan and claims the throne. Jason Momoa is still enjoyable as Arthur however with still of going for a more relax funny aquaman there are just moments where they just have jokes and moments that make him just slow & dumb. I understand that they went more the 90s Barbarian aquaman, but there point in this movie where he's just slow. Though his personality does still offer a likable character given his past with his mother and doesn't really care about Atlantis,but see what's to come if he doesn't do anything he slowly learns want it means. Mera's with Arthur throughout the whole of the movie. While she does have her moments with her Hyrokinesis, but she never really does anything to really convince him into the mantle of king the entire time. The film also doesn't really warrant the romance between them they hold hands once and have one moment. This is one of the instances where a romantic bond needed to be there for leads. This is literally Aquaman's Queen and one of the most popular couples in Dc comics. I suppose they assumed younger audiences wouldn't be interested. Orm is pretty good you can tell that the director wanted to go for a more comic over acting villian,but still make him come off as a threat naturally he's a more skilled fighter on the water then Arthur. He's meant to have the best interest of Atlantis in mind, but it doesn't show. It just makes him feel less a guy who feel he's doing is just and best for his people. Then just more just a crazy fanatic who hates the surface. Last there's Black Manta(Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), having the whole throne war plot with orm wasn't a bad choice, but the same time they knew that had to fit Black Manta in there somewhere. He a pirate who wants aquaman dead for not saving his farther. The problem is that while his suit looks great and the fight with him is done well. The problems is how they did his character where it suffered. This is Aquaman arch nemesis and the history between these two is soak with the blood of loved ones on both ends. However want they do with David and his father doesn't really cement that hatered he should really have toward Arthur. To a extent you kind of forget about him for a while. The production design is beautiful and creative from the costume design, even given Arthur the goldfish armor. Atlantis itself looks good you can see everything. Which is good considering the major of this movie takes place underwater, most movies you can't see a thing everything's bright maybe to bright in certain areas. The idea of 7 kingdom is a nice expansion to characters. The trench, Brine, and fisherman welcome additions. The only uncalled for scene is the deserter kingdom it help leads to the trident but is that what you expect from aquaman a desert. Overall despite its flaws Aquaman is a fun entertaining film that shows off the creatively and quirks the heroes been denied all these decades.",Aquaman

240,patriciogl10,"I liked it, but I know it could have been so much better.",7,19 April 2019,"To this day, the best movie DCEU has provided it is still Wonder Woman. Aquaman falls into a second place, it is mainly a decent film with several flaws. I can't get over the fact of how dreadful the CGI is. I mean, I can understand that in the DCU's first movie they may not get it right, but after several releases and millions of viewers complaining about that same aspect, why wouldn't they try to improve it? Aquaman fails to deliver a believable proportion of action and visual effects, in terms of how realistically they should go together. Black Manta was such a weak rival, poorly acted, unlike the rest of the cast whom I thought did a pretty good job. Jason Momoa is fantastic as the titular character; Amber Heard and WIlliam Dafoe properly delivered Mera and Vulko; Nicole Kidman was fairly good in her portrayal of Atlanna; and Patrick Wilson did a phenomenal task in giving life to King Orm. Some visuals were cool, some of the music was not (Pitbull); the scene in Italy was fantastic, I had a blast watching that.I am almost certain that if the CGI had been great, it would have changed my vision regarding the picture as a whole, but to me it was entertaining nonetheless. The cast is what does it for me, the story could have been a lot better, or it could have been executed in a more non-generic fashion. I have to give it to Jason Momoa, from the moment he was cast we all knew he had a difficult task in playing a superhero that has been a laughing stock for decades, and yet he made Aquaman cool for nearly everyone! Although, the Arthur Curry from the DC Animated Universe is badass as well. Decent effort from DCEU, but I expect much more, as I'm sure many other fans do too.",Aquaman

242,thenolanfan,Review - Aquaman,7,15 November 2020,"Aquaman is very flawed, but it is still a very entertaining movie. James Wan while I don't like him, has his own directing style that makes this movie so much different from the rest of DCEU. Plus, the underwater fight sequences are quite enjoyable.
When I said that: ""Aquaman is very flawed"", I was referring to the acting performances and the screenplay. Momoa and Patrick Wilson are doing a decent job, but the rest of the cast, even Dafoe and Nicole Kidman are atrocious in it. There is not much to say about the screenplay other than it is plain stupidity.
For the reasons that I mentioned in the first paragraph, Aquaman is probably the second-best DCEU film.",Aquaman
243,FallenEye,"Worth a ""Sea"", But Did it Land?",7,21 December 2018,"""Where I come from, the water washes away our tears"".The absolute best part about Aquaman, is undoubtedly and unequivocally, Nicole Kidman. She had the best lines, the best story, the best performance and truthfully, she had the best fight sequence (which sadly, is at the beginning of the movie). Nicole Kidman will regrettably be, the unsung hero of this film.The interjections of Vulko and Arthur's growing past was a lovely touch, however, Zack Snyder did a far superior job of that technique, in Man of Steel. James Wan's horror addiction was impossible to ignore, especially given how literally, the very first shot was a type of jump scare, and I appreciated that trademark inclusion. The kiss between Arthur and Mera was also a visual treat.But, that's the thing with Aqauman. It suffers from too many cliches blended together, cliches I do and did enjoy even in this film, except for them being cliches done better before in other films, except perhaps for Arthur and Mera's first kiss.The score was, a bit scattered and uncomposed, while still being satisfying at some parts. It was like Suicide Squad meets Green Lantern. The composition had this tendency of pulling you out of the movie, and throwing you back in, instead of completely immersing you.Aquaman's suit was not great at all, and the Atlantean warriors looked quite silly, while the Atlantean weapon Orm gave Black Manta, looked like it came straight out of Power Rangers. And speaking of Black Manta, I wasn't really excited by him, unfortunately.Jason Momoa is an awesome Aquaman, albeit an unrecognizable one, and Amber Heard's beauty more than qualifies her for the role of Mera, however, her acting prowess felt a little out of its depth. I'm a fan of Patrick Wilson, and he did a satisfactory job, as did Willem Dafoe.Aquaman is a fantastic attempt. It's worth it to see, but, I'm not certain it stuck the landing, much like Arthur's landings in the actual film, or the humor. Except for 2 extremely distinct parts in the film, the humor was Sahara desert dry. 6.7/10.",Aquaman
244,TheCorniestLemur,Something here is fishy,6,19 August 2021,"You know what? Screw you if you're expecting me to dunk on this, I had fun with it. A hell of a lot of fun, in fact. It's hands down the most purely enjoyable film from the DCEU so far, but I also think that it might have the most legitimately good things going for it too.For some reason they got James Wan of Saw and The Conjuring fame to direct this, and while that was an...unconventional choice, let's say, I really feel like he tried, and mostly succeeded, to give it some personality. There's genuinely some memorable and nice-looking shots in this, which is far more than I can say for anything in this series that came before this.You know what else this has that the rest of the franchise sorely lacks? A sense of bloody wonder to it. I actually really like the designs of the kingdoms of Atlantis, because I just can't argue with things like a city of giant crabs, people riding domesticated sharks into battle, or a goddamn kraken playing the drums in a coliseum battle. And yeah, the politics of the kingdom isn't terribly interesting, but I really did find it nice to look at.Oh don't get me wrong, the CGI is as awful as it ever is in these films, but that didn't change how I felt about the locations in concept, even if Black Manta looks like a cartoon character awkwardly plopped into this world.You know who else really felt like they were trying? Jason Momoa. I wasn't lying when I said he was probably the best part of Justice League, and he brings that likable energy and then some to this role again. He actually manages to make Aquaman, the long time punching bag of the DC universe, pretty cool, and that's no small feat as far as I'm concerned.For a film that's nearly 2 and a half hours long, it's really well paced, because the time absolutely flew by and I was never bored, and oh my god the main character in this DCEU film actually has something of a character arc that makes sense. Fancy that.By no means is it great though, all I said is that I had fun with it. While nearly all the actors feel as though they are trying, and mostly succeed, Amber Heard could almost have been replaced with a literal fish and you could have got a more convincing performance out of it. I know we already have enough reason to hate her, but she really isn't good in this. And who could forget teenage Aquaman...I know he's only there for two minutes, but what a memorable two minutes he makes it, for all the wrong reasons.The story isn't overall anything special, the soundtrack is godawful, and some of the dialogue is really cheesy, but screw you and the shark you rode in on, I thought it was just as much, if not more fun than I had with Old, and you should all watch it. Yes, I'm serious, this film about bloody Aquaman is better than the films they made about Batman, Superman, or Wonder Woman, and some kind of sacrifice must have been made to make that happen, so let's not let it be in vain, eh?",Aquaman
245,martinrobertson300482,Disappointing,4,26 January 2019,I liked the look of the effects In the trailer. But when a whole movie is over the top CGI it quickly gets tiresome. Everything is turned up to 100 in this movie. From the overcrowded backgrounds to the ridiculous costumes. I thought DC needed to put the brakes on before. But now I'm just thinking they'd be better skreeching to a halt and starting over.,Aquaman
246,austin0731,Visually stunning step in the right direction for DC,6,28 December 2018,"Aquaman sets itself aside from the rest of the DC films by being what in my opinion is the best the franchise had to offer so far. Comparisons are bound to be made with the franchise's other arguable hit, Wonder Woman. Personally I think Aquaman beats Wonder Woman in that it had a final act that had a battle that was so visually appealing and interesting to look at that it absolutely blows Wonder Woman's failure of a third act out of the water.Which really is the story of Aquaman's success, it is a film that is wonderful to look at, the visual aspect of this film is that of a completely new level, with underwater shots and CGI that is groundbreaking and something that audiences have never seen before. The film had an interesting villain in Ocean mater, his motivations were well justified as the best villains should.Both Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were brilliant as Arthur and Mera as director James Wan excellently blends the actor's own traits into the characters. Utilizing Momoa's culture in the form of war cries and tribal tattoos to establish this new and modernized version of Aquaman.Aquaman is bound to wow audiences, while it's not the most interesting story wise it definitely sets itself apart as a fun and thrilling explosion of colours and visuals.",Aquaman
247,bhernandez2216,I am Aquaman,10,17 February 2019,"Aquaman was absolutely awesome to watch. James Wan did a fantastic job with all the action, and all the fun. This is why you go to the Movies.",Aquaman
248,fluffset,first DC action-packed!,7,2 January 2019,"Even though I always critic DC and favor Marvel more, I still watch all of them haha. So, for this one, I guess its the best DC movie ever. Its straightforward, easy plot, and total full of action. Unlike Martha, this one is really good! Love all the sea creature!",Aquaman
249,asifahsankhan,Perhaps the Coolest DC superhero movie ever made!,8,21 December 2018,"One of the most compelling aspects of Aquaman is the underwater superhero himself. While his initial casting was rather controversial, Jason Momoa absolutely nailed the role of Arthur Curry. Right off the bat, Momoa sold his performance to audiences as both a badass and charismatic character that everyone could root for. He had the perfect balance of snark that made Iron Man such an entertaining character and fervor that has made Batman such a big-screen spectacle. Even with these qualities, the future King of Atlantis was still a flawed protagonist. He wasn't a perfect character, which really only made him more compelling as the story went on.While the actual plot of the movie may have seemed incredibly familiar, being another one of the brothers fighting for the throne stories like Thor, Black Panther and The Lion King, it still did a decent job at making it stand out from the competition. While there were certainly familiar aspects that were similar to those other movies, like the duelling scenes in Black Panther, Aquaman still kept some originality in the matter in order to keep things unpredictable. Additionally, the movie did a great job of avoiding cop-out deaths in order to trigger emotional reactions from the audience, with all of the emotion in the movie developing from the story itself rather than from these cheap tricks that many superhero movies have ridden on recently.The absolute best feature of Aquaman, however, had to be its visuals. Whether the scenes took place underwater in Atlantis or in a city in Italy, nearly every shot of James Wan's was absolutely breathtaking. While previous DC movies like Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice had clever framing, the shots didn't really stand out like the shots in Aquaman. The main difference that made this DC adventure stand far above Batman v. Superman was the color pallete. Previous DC movies attempted to have darker visuals with a desaturated look, whereas Wan and his team pushed the limits of color throughout the movie's entire duration. Its color and visual effects were even better than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which broke records with the amount of visual effects put into it.All things considered, Aquaman is a huge win for DC and Warner Bros. Pictures. Its narrative is compelling, the protagonist is well developed, and it's just a whole lot of fun to watch from beginning to end. This is definitely a movie that you will not want to miss in theaters, as the big screen is truly the best way to experience the visually stunning look that this brings to the table. At the end of the day, Aquaman may just be the best DC movie we have seen in years, possibly even better than last year's Wonder Woman. Hopefully this fantastic storytelling becomes a pattern for DC movies going forward.",Aquaman
250,itsbobr,Long Live Atlantis,10,28 March 2019,"Arthur Curry aka Aquaman (Jason Momoa) is told that he is the only one who can bring the two worlds of land and sea together and he must do it as King. Arthur says he is no king and has no desire to be so. Princess Mera (Amber Heard) tells him he must do this because his half brother King Orm (Patrick Wilson) says it's time for the sea to claim the land and scorch the whole Earth. The only way Aquaman can do all this is with the Trident that the first King of Atlantis used and is most powerful. Aquaman believes the Trident is fiction. In time, Aquaman agrees to this mission, but first he must beat David Kane (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who wants revenge on Aquaman because he killed his father Jesse Kane (Michael Beach) in the submarine when they as pirates tried to overtake the sub.The story opens with Arthur's father Thomas Curry (Temeura Morrison) who finds an unconscious Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), who is the Queen of Atlantis and they fall in love and they have Arthur in time. She leaves him to protect Arthur and she must return to Atlantis to save him. She vows to return to Thomas.The rest of the movie has Aquaman and Mera going here and there worldwide looking for clues to where the Trident is. He does have a battle with his half brother, King Orm, but Mera helps him escape.The CGI is absolutely unbelievable and you'd swear you are seeing things for real. Yes, some of the CGI scenes do go on for a little too long, but they are mesmerizing and really, really good. And Director James Wan must be given tons of kudos for this absolutely great production. He may get an Oscar for his work. The acting all around is spot on. The cinematography is excellent.Notables: Willam Dafoe as Vulko a counselor to the King of Atlantis and he claims to know where the Trident is; Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus who King Orm wants an alliance with; Amber Heard as Princess Mera is also the daughter of King Nereus; Kaan Guldur as 9-yr old Arthur and the big shark in the aquarium sees Mike (Jack Andrew) bully Arthur and bangs against the glass enclosure until Arthur puts his hands up to tell the shark to stop; Otis Dhanji as 13-yr old Arthur being taught Warrior techniques by Vulko; Julie Andrews as Karathan the Voice of a giant monster that guards the Trident and tells Arthur that only the real king can extract the Trident.I did not recognize Nicole Kidman when she first appeared as Queen Atlanna as she has this amazing ability to transform herself into a more beautiful woman. Kudos. The music is excellent. Watch carefully and you will see an Octopus on the many drums. Ha!When the credits run the first time, stay and you will see that David Kane (from the sub, remember?) is still alive and wants to know who Aquaman is and this will lead us into sequels. Ready? I am. (10/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: Yes, at times. Language: Two S-words

252,FelipeCarrillo,"Epic, mythological CGI mega-spectacle blending ""Star Wars"" and ""Avatar"" with ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" one for the ages",8,22 March 2019,"""Aquaman"" is a stunning miracle; the most visually oddball and mesmerizing big-budget superhero film the world has ever seen. Do not misunderstand me, the Arthur Curry solo film is far from perfect, it presents an origin, born-to-be-king story, rhythmically goes from dynamite to languor and storytelling-wise is whimsical and silly dealing with Greek mythology, but that bravery and audacity, coming from a huge budget and an amazing source material, are what makes it an experience as dangerously unconventional as imperfectly extraordinary.It's no secret that the DC Extended Universe went from bad to worse within American comic book film landscape; diabolically histrionic, unnecessarily drawn-out, fiercely dark, overly serious; whatever the dilemma may be, Walter Hamada, the new president of DC-based film production after legends Geoff Johns and Jon Berg stepped down in early 2018, had to move quickly and wisely his cards after ""Justice League""'s inglorious financial outcome and poorly critics' response.An angel from heaven, ""Wonder Woman"" opened at the very right time - #MeToo and #Time's Up, - displayed a powerful war tale of exquisite female empowerment aided by Patty Jenkins' unflinching direction, introduced the only superheroine portrayed on the big screen so far through Gal Gadot' astonishing performance and let free a fictional universe as feminist and uplifting as promising with a few drops of fish-out-of-water humor that put the subsidiary of Warner in competition again. Clearing their minds and knowing what to do and what not to do as for the kind of movie audiences want to see, they left a bunch of projects behind, rewrote some scripts and gave the go-ahead to ideas discussed for a very long time. Among the category of polished and slightly modified scripts, with special emphasis on comedy, was its latest, most risky and pleasant Hollywood chaos.If ""Wonder Woman"" was somewhat like a Spider-Man for DC, Arthur Curry would oddly be a colorful hybrid with DNA from Tony Stark, Thor and Star-Lord. The King of the Seven Seas has chances to become the most outstanding, fascinating and exotic superhero of the whole combo out there. Momoa gives his role a dominant macho vibe and look, as well as silliness and sarcastic humor that provide much of the funny and not-so-funny jokes spread throughout the feature film. His acting range and rancidity in each of his scenes are the reason why he's so special, so unique, so emotionally relatable and flat-out politically correct.Bigger-sized muscles, two antagonists, responsibility, legacy, kingship, splendid chases, and hand-to-hand combats, we've seen this before, haven't we? - cough, ""Black Panther,"" cough. - But as Ryan Coogler diligently proposed to make a stand against racism, politics, Hollywood's diversity and some other highly important social matters, Wan loosens up and never takes the material too seriously; it's simple: a silly, funny, over-the-top fantasy actioner with two specific purposes on its mind: a message of solving your problems peacefully and an act of redemption for DC; its fuzzy proceedings are what makes it so enjoyable, so strangely magnetic and carefreely brilliant.
""Aquaman"" is a bona fide rara avis, and one of the big ones. Auteurs entrusted with a nine-digit budget to make an original screenplay a reality- Mr. Christopher Nolan - can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Fewer filmmakers get such whopping sums of money to pull off a bizarre comic book adaptation, which is under the eye of a whole company; judgments, visions and worldwide expectations included. After a hurtful slate of bad decisions and critical misfires, DC changed its mind and left its unexpectedly successful billion-dollar baby to one of the most qualified, professional and creative artists working today in the industry.James Wan is a filmmaker for the ages. Visionary, maestro of horror and action, creator and owner of the most profitable, breathtaking and poignant entry in ""Fast & Furious"" franchise yet and king of mainstream contemporary horror at the expense of his 2013 vintage masterpiece/hit, a billion-dollar IP from which spin-offs, prequels, and sequels emanate. These endless victories are the reason why the Malay is now Warner's spoiled child, which was more than enough to entrust him one of the riskiest, most crucial projects for the future of DC.His kinetic and idiosyncratic style for action is high and low from stem to stern. Fight sequences are provocative, diligent, straight out of the wildest video game. The filmmaker also finds time to experiment and toy with settings, nearly masterful camera movements and angles, with explosive 90/180-degree rotations he previously tested in the Hobbs vs Shaw hand-to-hand combat in ""Furious 7"" and then F. Gary Gray in the prison escape in ""The Fate of the Furious."" The camera savagely runs at the audience, endowing dynamism and thrill in large part by the uber-excellent technical, artful features of a couple of incredibly and masterfully executed sequences that might be easily part of the annals of this postmodern genre.Despite CG-overstuffed, even in scenes perfectly filmable in real locations, the film does not limit its creative faculties. We all agree that CGI is everywhere and at all times, which might constantly divert attention from the flick's narrative purpose. Its aesthetics and visual fearlessness, however, make pictures an alluring spectacle propelled by truly great VFX. So far, far away from the gigantic old-fashioned set-pieces of modern Hollywood masterpieces as ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" and ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout,"" and yet the film's an artificial delight. By taking place mostly underwater, it was to be expected that even with the enthusiasm and commitment of the crew, it needed to be conceived or at least rendered digitally. Wan and his team created an entirely unique aquatic world for us, certainly embellished by Don Burgess, which is over-the-top, dazzling and exciting, absorbent and carefully designed, is pure visual ecstasy crowded with creatures, altered animals, Atlantic beasts and, why not, an octopus playing the drums. There is time for natural, majestic landscapes as well, such as a beautiful Italian village, the stunning Sahara desert or the claustrophobic Trench. Portraying the fantasy-tinged Greek mythology from the comics sounds heavy, but it pulls it off fabulously with inventiveness and audacity unusual in big-budget cinema. In the end, it's appreciated that this extremely gorgeous world, harmonized by the high-sounding techno-compositions of an unbeatable Rupert Gregson-Williams, is not only a reflection of the cinema of our time, but a reminder of the magnificence sound and image can achieve.Kidman nails it as Atlanna, a kind of character not entirely foreign to her if you take a look at the prolific career of the ""Eyes Wide Shut"" actress. After the ten-minute prologue and a surprise appearance amid the story, she does have no time on screen. Still and all, her interpretative balance between fish-out-of-water humor and family drama puts her in a strange yet brilliant position; a golden gift for the genre. Played by Amber Heard, Mera's design is literally and figuratively sparkling; she's the one who leads a couple of commendable sequences that breathe #MeToo. Willem Dafoe as Vulko embraces ambiguity, having fun in a simple, smaller role that doesn't seem to agree with his previous efforts, especially keeping in mind that after the eccentric characters he delivered to the genre, the actor has focused on more serious, raw roles in outstanding dramas by Sean Baker and Julian Schnabel. Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, King Orm and Manta respectively, wrongly take turns for being the bad guy. It's hard to tell who and where is the real villain here, whether in the ambition of the former or the anger-driven vengeance of the latter. They both try their best, but the material does not help them at all.""Aquaman"" by horror mastermind James Wan is a cinematic oddity; it has an irregular pace, speaks louder than it should, ergo runs longer than it should, but even so, Arthur Curry's first solo adventure is the most playful, hilarious, rewarding and profitable comic book adaptation you will find in the troubled DC Cinematic Universe to date. Even if my voice is shaking, I dare say it is the most eye-catching, wildly stunning sci-fi show I have seen into a big-impact Hollywood production since James Cameron's ""Avatar,"" visually speaking. To make your life easier, ""Aquaman"" could be synthesized like this: ""Black Panther"" and ""Star Wars"" meet ""Avatar"" and ""Jupiter Ascending,"" and these, in turn, bump into ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" energized by a kinetic video game vibe and an unhealthy dose of toxic masculinity and sheer spectacle.",Aquaman
253,TheVictoriousV,DC has achieved mediocrity and I applaud them. (Copied from myself with permission),5,4 January 2019,"This one's worth skipping.Aquaman may yet be a beacon of hope for the DC Extended Universe. This one and Wonder Woman managed to get many superhero fans pumped, without needing to take too many cues from the Marvel Universe - which is a thing that other DC films have done, no matter how effectively one blinds oneself to that fact.I'm not saying Aquaman is especially good, but at least it's acceptable - sans a few laughable VFX shots and Power Rangers-tier costumes. It is fundamentally competent, thus outranking the likes of Suicide Squad and Justice League. It does everything a movie about He Who Speaks With The Fish needs to do, which really isn't much.Jason Momoa plays a half-human half-Atlantean prince, going by Arthur Curry on the streets and ""Aquaman"" on the underwater streets. Amber Heard is his love interested Mera, the daughter of the king of one of the Atlantis tribes (Dolph Lundgren). There's also Aquaman's evil brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), whose plan is to unite the underwater kingdoms to declare war on humanity. Willem Dafoe plays the typical old mentor (wearing his goofiest suit since Goblin) and Nicole Kidman is the Queen of Atlantis.This, as you can surely tell, is pretty standard and un-extraordinary. And again, this is quite the step up from the bowel movements DC and Warner Bros. normally release. You have accomplished mediocrity and I applaud you. On some level it is complete.Sitting in the director's chair this time around is James Wan, a man more at home in horror although not completely dreadful here, even if it goes without saying that this is more of a product than an art project. I wouldn't say this film exemplifies Wan's voice. He was just doin' his job. That said, the action is fairly well shot.The cityscape of Atlantis is admittedly an interesting setting and probably the main reason to see the film. It's pretty, albeit no more groundbreaking than worlds like Pandora or the city ruled by King Triton. I'm glad DC fans have gotten something more promising, even if my own thumb points downward, but we'll see what this means for the future of the DCEU (recall that key actors have dropped out and people are more hyped for the Joker of another canon). There is some speculation that next year's Avengers finale will double as a finale for the persistent superhero film craze. They say that this might be what finally - FINALLY - kills the comic-book movie. I'm sorry we didn't get to Darkseid.",Aquaman
254,Chalice_Of_Evil,Everything is 'awesome'...,8,13 October 2019,"Or so Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) seems to think, considering he uses that word to describe things several times. Aquadude is the offspring of Nicole Kidman's Atlantean Queen, Atlanna (lots of things start with 'Atlan' in the aquatic city of Atlantis, apparently) and human lighthouse keeper, Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison, who we first meet in creepily de-aged form, but later appears normal. Meanwhile, Nicole Kidman just seems to change hair colour from blonde to grey to signify the passage of time). Both actors try to sell the whole 'star-crossed lovers' thing (with mixed results), there's some humour (ever wanted to see Nicole Kidman slurp up a goldfish?), but the beginning's stand-out moments come from watching Kidman's Atlanna kick major butt. Nicole Kidman: Action Star...who'da thunk it? Blah, blah, seemingly-dead-parent origin story, blah. There's nothing really 'new' here (and it pales in comparison to Wonder Woman's origin story).Things pick up once we're introduced to adult Arthur, who battles a bunch of pirates, including a father/son duo who tries to kill Arthur (learning just how tough he is in the process). They end up needing his help, but he leaves, thus quickly establishing Aquadude as a 'different' type of superhero (yet somehow still less of a jerk than Batfleck or Neck-snapper). Naturally, the son swears revenge against him for his father's death. Dude, your motivation is CRAP. As Arthur rightly points out, you guys got YOURSELVES into this mess/killed innocent people, and then blame *him* for your father dying when it was HIS OWN actions that led to his fate? You get no sympathy from me.Arthur proves he's not totally ruthless in a funny moment where you think the typical barroom brawl is going to break out, but instead it's just fans seeking a selfie. Flashbacks to kid Arthur show that he learned to communicate with marine life at an early age (and show those who made jokes about him 'talking to fishes'), then later ones feature his mentor/trainer, Vulko (Willem Dafoe), teaching him how to use his gifts both underwater and on land.Things REALLY kick up a notch once Princess Mera (Amber Heard, complete with long flowing bright red hair, impressive butt-kicking skills and cleavage to match) enters the picture. Their history/previous encounter in Justice League feels a bit vague, but they get to know each other and Arthur soon learns her skills are equal to his (but with extra neat water-controlling abilities). They snark/bicker, save each other, and naturally this eventually leads to underwater snogging.Heard impresses as Mera, showing her character to be brave, intelligent, funny (her snarkiness towards Arthur is fun, but her expressions she makes at him are even better. Then there's the flower-eating...) and worthy of becoming a Queen...but, of course, this is Arthur's story, so everything's about characters wanting HIM to become King (even though he doesn't want to)...or in the case of his half-brother, King Orm (Patrick Wilson), trying to PREVENT that from happening. Meanwhile, they've got perfectly good King material in Mera!Momoa grunts and groans his way through the movie, getting tossed around countless times and seemingly 'severely injured' a bunch...only for him to basically shrug it all off. Once you realise any injuries he sustains will barely slow him down, any sense of 'danger' fades away. Really, that goes for basically ALL the characters (except cannon fodder, of course). It gets a bit ridiculous how often characters *should* be dead, but seem fine. It kind of kills any 'weight' the fights might have.Some are pretty neat to watch, though, like Mera's Italy rooftop chase (though apparently they still haven't learned from the 'destruction porn' of MoS, as there's SO MUCH property damage here), but others are less so, such as the CGI-heavy underwater battle at the end that just winds up losing all meaning after a while. That's not to say that the visuals aren't impressive. The creatures on display are quite a wonder to behold (Julie Andrews voicing a an enormous sea beast is probably something nobody realised they needed/wanted, but *will* after they see it). It's just that the battle blurs together/goes on too long.Much better are 'smaller' fight scenes, like the aforementioned Atlanna fight and Italy fight, then there's a wee bit of 'horror' during the trench scene, which is welcome. Too bad things got overblown at the end. Still, it's no wonder this movie has taken so long to be made, considering the fact that technology/effects have probably taken this long to reach a point where these underwater scenes can be brought to life as believably as they are. They might not entirely convince, but there are certain moments where you forget this is an effects-heavy world and just lose yourself in the majesty of the underwater kingdom.There's no really 'memorable' theme here (unlike Wonder Woman's, which remains the best/most memorable theme from ALL of these DCEU films), but there's some decent music sprinkled through the movie, both in the score and the choice of songs used (Roy Orbison's 'She's A Mystery To Me' makes an unexpected, yet very welcome/fitting, appearance. The end credits song isn't as 'rock 'n' roll' as you might expect from Aquadude, but also manages to fit well, given that it's his parents' love story which bookends the film).Momoa mightn't be the best actor out there, but he gets by a lot on his charm/likeability and is ably supported by Heard, who ensures Mera isn't just a 'love interest'. She too is a hero, and like Wonder Woman's Steve Trevor, doesn't 'steal' the spotlight from the 'title' character, but rather 'shares' it with him. Speaking of Wonder Woman, that film's still easily the best one of the DCEU by a country mile, but this movie isn't bad either. It's certainly more fun than MoS or BvS. Give Batfleck and Neck-snapper a break for a while, DC. Wonder Gal and Aquadude can take it from here.",Aquaman

Aquaman maintains masterful storytelling and gripping action throughout the entirety of its 2.5-hour runtime, with the exception of the last 15 minutes.

Beall and McGoldrick's Writing: NAY!I don't believe it's materially doable for me to scheme into words how carelessly ludicrous Aquaman is. I can't declare if I positively cherished the campiness and nuttiness of this movie, or if I positively despised it. Warner Bros have blown their 200-million-dollar budget on something ferociously miraculous, but also, something terribly disposable.In simple terms, Aquaman was acutely run-of-the-mill for me because, all though, Wan's supervision of the action (yes to those one-take shots!) and furthermore, the numerous of filmmakers' tackling of the graphics flowed lavishly, the writing and dialogue, nonetheless, ignominiously sinks to the bottom-ground. Soooo, I suppose I'll meet in the middle with this encapsulation and proclaim that this lunacy of a production-that is Aquaman-is, all in all, mediocre?Aquaman is testosterone fueled mania suffocated with oceans of shirtless men shrieking their heads off while mounting gigantic fishes. If that's what you like in your movies, I recommend trekking alongside this motion picture, but if you're seeking out a superhero flick with sagacity and dandy quality, turn the other way. I'll grant it this though, it's rigorously an improvement from Justice Leauge and Suicide Squad. And, hey, I'll even tally extra points for the Halo jumpsuits and the hardcore, drumming Octopus.

But, dare I say it? It is pretty fun! Not fun as in this is a good movie, because this is trash, but fun as in it tries so hard and it fails, and it has so many moments I burst into laughter over how inapt and dumb it is. The main ""bad"" guy is so hilarious I can almost recommend this movie for him alone.There are soooooo many stupid moments, and that B-movie feel never washes away (pun intended), and we see some weird attempts to make political statements - and those facts together ruin the movie.
The basic plot is very generic and those comparing this movie to Black Panther would not be wrong, it is very similar, almost copy paste similar.I am being generous and give this movie a 2/10.Would I recommend this? Ouhm... not really. I mean if you get a bottle of Whiskey that you can empty and throw in the Ocean, like Aquaman like to do, and you watch this movie at the same time it might not be so bad.
This is the second best movie of the DCEU so far, after Wonder Woman. Imagine that, 2/10 and it is the second best movie of an entire franchise... how is that for a record? Yea, yea, plenty of weirdo people went out to see this movie mostly because they spend enormous amount of money on marketing in China, but also other strange folk. Why? What the... *beep*... made you think that this would be a good idea?

It was an uphill battle from there and, thanks to James Wan (Saw, Insidious), this latest entry struck the right chords like a tidal wave.Plot: Arthur Curry/Aquaman was born a child of two worlds, his father an ordinary lighthouse keeper and his mother queen of the legendary Atlantis. Now, he must rise up to realize his destiny as the bridge between land and sea. He must journey across the world with the sexy princess Mera in order to prevent his half-brother Orm aka Ocean Master from bringing together the seven undersea kingdoms in order to wage war on the surface.Like ""Wonder Woman"", this film was not bound by excessive sequel-baiting or studio intervention and instead told a complete story into itself and, boy, was the story something to behold, one of love and legacy. This film embodies everything that makes Aquaman such a grand and badass hero (he rules 2/3 of the planet after all) and added enough flair and compelling character writing to make it a phenomenal work of art. The underwater world is a splendor filled with stunning technology, fantastical creatures, wonderful colors, varied environments, and a lore worthy of this world. The music by Rupert Gregson-Williams definitely left an impression, providing the right feelings in every scene. All the actors did a terrific job portraying these larger-than-life characters, especially Jason Momoa who made me cheer, laugh, and root for him in every conflict, carrying the right balance of drama and humor. And let's not forget the actions scenes, which got me excited every time fists, water, and laser blasts fly; the Black Manta fight and the climactic undersea war had me pumped. I also gotta give creds to all the little nods to classic nautical tales and ancient mythology.Amazing doesn't even cut it for this one. By the time it was over, the audience gave an applause, something I rarely see in theaters and it's well-deserved.

Quite often you spot little things you missed the first time around, but which add to the appreciation of the film. Sadly, with Aquaman, what I spotted was the movies flaws: how really banal the dialogue is, how bad the acting is and how preposterous the plot is. I missed those 'nuances' the first time as I was bombarded by the spectacle of it all. On second viewing, even that spectacle seemed cartoonish and obviously CGI-heavy. The writer(s) hardly miss a superhero movie cliche in this story. The movie tries to take a tongue-in-cheek approach at times, but the humour is quite lame. Much of what is enjoyable about this movie can be attributed to the charisma of Jason Mamoa who plays Arthur Curry/Aquaman - the first Polynesian superhero. His Aquaman scarcely resembles the character found on television and in comic books and is, in some respects, almost an anti-hero. He's not Deadpool, but he's going in that direction. Jason Mamoa isn't a great actor. I'm not even sure he's a good actor, but he's certainly charismatic and, I guess, that's what matters most in this type of film. It also helps that this movie doesn't spend the first hour or so explaining the origins of the main character, before he is seen on the screen. Instead, his story is told in flashback form throughout the movie. Maybe that's because his back story isn't really that interesting and can be dealt with quickly, but anyway... The cast surrounding Mamoa is pretty dull and includes all the perfunctory nods to being racially inclusive. It also includes the obligatory 'big stars' playing mentoring roles to the main protagonist although Willem Dafoe's cheesy character will make you laugh or maybe grimace (though not intentionally) and Nicole Kidman will make you yawn (as usual). Julie Andrews even turns up, or at least her voice does, playing what must be one of the more unusual characters of her career.Aquaman's closing credits make it obvious that this movie is set up for a sequel and IMDB reports that one is scheduled for 2022. I look forward to seeing that. It will have to be better than thisMy conclusion? Turn your brain off, don't expect too much, and you will probably enjoy this movie - the first time. Just don't rush to watch it again.",Aquaman
264,Lewis_Heather787,Very conflicted about this film!,6,20 December 2018,"To be totally honest and up front I am personally suffering from Comic book film fatigue at the moment, there is just an over saturation. I'd even go as far to say that I am getting less and less bothered or interested in them, the more that come out. I am more of a DC fan than Marvel but I have enjoyed films from both however I really couldn't care less anymore. Maybe thats just me.With that overly long intro out of the way onto the film itself, which I have to say I am very conflicted on because there are parts I really enjoyed but that there are also parts that were just ok for me. Unfortunately though that is the overriding feeling after viewing this film is that, it is just ok. Which is a real bummer because I go into every film hoping to love it.Lets start with positives firstly, James Wan. Wow can that man direct!! This probably from a visual standpoint one of the most amazing and breath-taking comic book films you're going to see. Some of the visuals underwater in the world of Atlantis are just incredible, and more importantly the camera work throughout some of the action scenes. Idea of showing two different action scenes going on simultaneously, switching between the two without cutting away is a brilliant way to give perspective on the overall area and scale of the action. Overall though it is nothing less than I expected from Wan because he is an uber talented director and he definitely added something fresh to comic book films in that respect.Strangely I thought that Jason Momoa was a good as I thought he was gonna be nothing spectacular but not terrible either, however I think there are couple other performances that really stood out to me. Firstly Nicole Kidman, she is one of the best around today period. So it shouldn't really be a surprise that she is really good, but you do worry now and then when you here about a huge name staring in a film like this. Are they just doing it for the pay check?? I thought her performance was really strong and is the heart of the film even though she has ""limited"" screen time. Every time she does appear on screen she is a scene steeler. Overall top class. The other scene steeler and this one was a shock is Amber Heard as Mera. Now this might be just me but I'm not the greatest Amber Heard fan, don't actually think she's that good an actress, average at best, maybe a little harsh. Wow has this got to be her best performance of her career as of yet. She commands the screen whenever she is on and I think she does a better job of carrying the film than Momoa. As soon as she is introduced to us you immediately warm to her or just latch onto her character and her motivations. However the best thing and probably the most harshest thing I could say is that she wasn't playing Amber Heard, she was actually playing a character......Do you get what i mean? Maybe my bar is set really low for her and actually this isn't really that good but who knows really......each to your own.All the other performances are really strong Patrick Wilson, Willem Dafoe and even Dolph Lundgren. They all do well in there respective roles.Now onto the negatives. Firstly the tone of the film, which needless to say is all over the place. In a way it sort of reminds me of the tone of ""Justice League"" or some of the Marvel films, one minute begin serious the next second being light hearted out of nowhere. There are so many ups and downs with the tone that it never really felt like an overall theme or tone to latch onto........Is it just me or am I going crazy. I can't quite put my finger on in it, but there was just a strange tone.Did we really need the character of Black Manta and he's sub-story? There is a lot going on in this film and I just think it might have been helped a little with a bit more of a simpler story with less characters. The character of Black Manta, although there was nothing wrong with the character itself or Yahya Abdul-Mateen II performance its just felt a little shoehorned in.Finally there wasn't anything in the film that made my jaw drop or was really fascinated by. Erm.......................can't find the words to describe it really, the film was just fine there was a lot of it that was forgettable not because it was bad but it wasn't really that great. Ah thats it there was no great moments in the film for me plenty of fine/ok moments, some good directing and performances but nothing......great.Overall this film is just 65% out of 100 or 6.5 out 10 it is ok/average, which is a real bummer because if you'd told me that about 2 and a bit years ago I wouldn't have believe you. I'm just a bit worn out with these films whether that is Marvel and sadly even DC now, and boy have I given DC some passes recently.....I'm looking at you ""Justice League"", ""BVS"" and ""Suicide Squad"". Some good directing from James Wan, two standout performances from Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard but as I said nothing great.......just fine.",Aquaman
265,aheaven2005,So bland,5,2 August 2021,"A plain boring two hours and a half of action scenes without a real gripping story. The beginning is a bit funny, but everything else is just bland. Sad because the technology, the myths and the ages were just not used to their potential.",Aquaman
266,Dragonsouls,"Great art direction, cinematography, fight choreography and characterizations!",9,21 December 2018,"Aquaman sets a new benchmark and standard for Superhero films on an aesthetic level. The art direction in this film was absolutely mind blowing! The costumes, sets, locales, CGI, was unlike anything seen outside of Game of Thrones. This film was not only immensely epic in scope but it works on a dramatic level, which was something I often wondered about before arriving at the theater. It did not disappoint.This is why I read pulp fiction and love Superhero films. This is not Deadpool. It's deeply spiritual and emotional and most importantly, relatable. Lots of social commentary in this film regarding real world issues, having to do with the destruction of the environment and pollution of the planet. And even Arthur, as super as he is, is very relatable in this film, written as a rather reclusive, depressed, underachiever archetype that all people will relate too. The DC motto was regarding their heroes was always that it's not about DNA or blood, but what people do that makes them heroes and nothing more. Aquaman is the poster boy for the alien hybrid, or fallen angel, whose Earth blood balances out his alien blood, making him more suitable for the throne than full blooded Atlanteans, who are can be too ruthless at times.This is supposedly an origin film but I had wished for more flashbacks. Perhaps another ten minutes of young Arthur could have fleshed out his relationship with Vulko, who I absolutely loved. William Dafoe played an excellent, even headed mentor to young Arthur Curry. Fans of Aquaman will be very happy and fans of stories like King Arthur will absolutely adore the neo myth of the Aquaman universe!James Wan, I am officially a fan. I am not sure how this could be the same director as those horror films. If you love long take action scenes, beautiful wide angles, and action choreography then brace yourselves. So many films today feature chaotic action with no sense of wow factor. This film felt like a roller coaster ride that I wanted to jump back into immediately after it ended.I can't end this review without talking about the art direction again...it is Oscar worthy. This film was like one big Romanesque painting. The makeup, costumes, the design of the Atlantean ships and technology, all looked absolutely gorgeous and this film is clearly a product of passionate filmmaking. Of course, all of this is nothing without a good emotional story with characters you care about and it truly was a touching story. Some of the comedic stuff felt out of place but never ruined tension. It got better and better as it went on and the 3rd act was very tense! Aquaman was always my 2nd favorite superhero film and is no longer underrated thanks to James Wan, who did it!",Aquaman
267,eldreddsouza,Best DC movie after the Holy Trilogy of course.,9,2 February 2021,"Honestly, this is the most entertaining and visually impressive DC film I've ever watched. Story wise, nothing beats the Batman trilogy, but speaking from an entertainment perspective, this movie is super fun and just full of beautiful visuals throughout. Also, Jason Momoa, what a guy! What an entertaining dude. Hilarious and masterfully acted. Watched it in IMAX. A one of a kind experience.",Aquaman
268,GraXXoR,Just one more pointless review,8,9 August 2020,"Camp AF and having far too much fun. That was my take away from this CGI fest of an action movie.Shallow motives? F'ck yeah...
Hackney'd plot? Is water wet?
Black and white, good and bad listed as clear as day? Does the sun rise every morning?This was basically every child born of the 60's comic book hero: plastered in gorgeous, ripped muscular manliness, glistenin' and bristlin' in technicolored, multicoloured and ink-coloured goodness!When you just want a story about a man (and his girl) who saves the day, this is it.Oh and: F'ken Willen Dafoe with a frikken Chonmage!!!!Pizza never tasted this good!",Aquaman
269,dussaultjulien,"Didn't have high expectations going in, but man did this movie flopped",1,30 March 2019,"I love superhero movies, if they are done well. The hype that was built up for this film really got me excited. I thought that Aquaman was going to be absolutely amazing, the commercials made it seem like it was going to be awesome, and just the general hype for it made it seem like it was going to be the best DC movie in a while, do not believe the hype, or even that this movie is good, because it is not. It's a sucker punch to the gut for the comic book nerd, and even more so for the untarnished average viewer.There is so much CGI in this film. Half of the time it doesn't even look real, scratch that, the entire film doesn't even look real. Almost every single scene is shot behind a green screen and no practical effects are really even used.What makes a superhero movie good, is a good villain and amazing practical effects, which this film Lacks and doesn't even have.This movie was made just to market Aquaman toys and merchandise nothing more. It doesn't even capture the spirit of the original storyline it was based off of. An utter and total disappointment and definitely not the best DC film. In fact I think that it makes the trial of The Incredible Hulk, and even Ang Li's Hulk look like Oscar worthy films. Even watching paint dry is more exciting, thrilling, and interesting than this movie is.",Aquaman
270,donttouchmeprimate,So Amber Heard beats Jonny Depp?,5,23 April 2021,"OK that was a low blow. Its true, but still.Erm OK film by all standards. Basic copy and paste story. Nothing unexpected happens and the acting is good. Basic fodder for the brain.But yeah, Amber is a monster.",Aquaman

272,TheOny13,"Beware, this movie is not just mindless action!",8,25 January 2019,"I finally got the chance to see this movie in 3D (which wasn't so great btw) and honestly saying I wasn't disappointed. Many people (including the critics) have praised this movie for being only ""fun"" or putting the accent on ""good old fun"". But in my opinion this movie has much more to it than that. The only reason I didn't gave this movie a ten is because overall is a bit cliched at times and overall the stakes aren't that high really, to make you surprised or mind blown by what turns this movie took along its 142 minutes run time.The story: Many people have compared this movie with ""Black Panther"" or ""Lion King"" but the story although being about someone who steps up to be the king of his people, is quite different. The main difference is that Arthur doesn't want to be king and his character along the journey this movie takes it, becomes more selfless and more dedicated to his people or to the saving of his people rather than on some claim he has. I'll say this: first like 20 minutes of this movie are awesome with a backstory that was touching, powerful and memorable. The movie loses its tempo only in the middle but you never lose the plot if you pay attention. I will also point out the development of Arthur's character and how a certain scene speaks so powerfully about what makes a good leader. Someone who doesn't think about himself but rather gives everything in him for his people. Very nicely executed scene, and one more reason why this movie was more than just good fun for me.The villain: Although some people said Manta wasn't actually needed in this movie, if you really pay attention to the movie you'll see he has somewhat of a role in it. But the other villain is what makes this movie good. Orm is very strong of a character and his motivations are very understandable. There's a scene between him and Arthur in Atlantis that displays all his motivation and how humans are responsible for that. For me that scene just spoke and raised the problem that we as humans continue to perpetuate upon the environment, and how we do everything that we like with it without worrying about it's degradation. Very nice and deep thematically.The supporting cast was good. Standard I would say: Vulko is the mentor, Mera is the ""partner along the journey"" for Arthur, but the rest which I won't spoil for you, two characters are very good even though they don't have that much screen time. Their story is superb and touching. The soundtrack again was very nice done by Rupert Gregson Williams, but a little to loud at times.The visuals: This movie is wihtout a doubt the most visual and the most beautifully looking movie I've seen in a long long time. It is beyond me how this movie wasn't nominated by the academy (btw one of the worst nolinations this year at the academy) for visual effects and production design, which are incredible well done. The amount of work that went in it must have been crazy. I couldn't but appreciate all the visuals and the digital altered faces (which are quite a few) throughout this movie.Overall, great movie with so much fun and excitement but also with a good and flashed out villain, good character development and good enough themes throughout the movie. Well worth watching. Stay until the mid credits for the post credits scene that sets up a sequel, which hopefully will be made.",Aquaman
273,isantistao,"Ridiculously Overdone, Painful To Watch",2,26 April 2020,"I was really looking forward to this movie because I love the concept of Aquaman and loved him in the Justice League. But this movie was absolutely painful to watch. Unfortunately I went to the theater to watch it and after a little while it became apparent that this was just an absolutely horrible movie, and I spent most of the time waiting for it to end and luckily falling asleep during parts. Unfortunately it is so long that it was exhausting to sit through. Everything about it is super over exaggerated it is ridiculous. It is like it was made for children or something. And it is also extremely over-produced as well. I went there hoping to get sucked into a fantasy land of the ocean and what I got was a fantastic atrocity. I was so relieved when it finally ended. What an incredible disappointment...and not only that, but what an affront to art this is! I give this movie a 2 only because it is visually nice to look at at times, otherwise I'd give it a 1.",Aquaman

It was awkward at times but there was some great humor and Jason Momoa played a satisfying role as Aquaman and was a great fit for the character. The story felt large in scale, the production design was unique and interesting and the visual effects were stunning. The chemistry between Arthur and Mera was great too with some great moments of humor.It was a overall a very well directed and fun Boxing Day blockbuster and probably DC's best standalone film which brought an interesting origin story and broughtas much justice as they could to a DC character that hardly anyone can actually take seriously at this point.

It was EXTREMELY obvious how this movie was going to go, the ending the not dead mother and all the other part of this were projected from almost the start. By the way even if it is was supposed to be assumed that Atlanta abdicated to be with her love it should have been in the movie all the same because she was still queen. Unless of course you are meant to assume a masculine only ruler-ship. But with all the other junk about the 'surface dwellers' being the bad guys and destroying all the sea and world it is doubtful that they wanted a male dominated image for this film.

It was incredibly cheesy and cringe throughout. The acting was pretty horrendous, which is too bad because I like a majority of the actors. The two leads are not much more than eye candy.Essentially this was a 2 hour plus CGI fest. Don't get me wrong, the CGI was fairly top notch, but when it's the only redeeming quality and 95 percent of your movie, then unfortunately the movie is just not that good. Viewers have to suspend their brain from actually thinking to even consider any of this believable. Yes, it's a comic book movie but come on it was all pretty ridiculous.I'm actually happy it made a ton of money, just in hopes that it will save the DC universe.

Solid main lead with occasionally well placed humor, good use of ancient mythology, sick action scenes from everyone involved in the movie and absolutely beautiful cinematography with a diverse world that has been created under the water.The best part is that unlike any other Marvel/DC movie, you forget that Aquaman is an actual super hero because of how immersive the story is.Bad part is that some of the scenes feel like they are stapled together instead of having a smooth flow. Oh and the song selection leaves more to be desired; however, the music that was used in the movie is good.Overall, this is no Wonder Woman but still a very good DC movie that is enjoyable in the cinema just for its sheer cinematography, action and a good cast that gels well together.",Aquaman

289,MinistryofDoom,Great Entry in DCEU but Too Long & Too Convoluted,6,15 May 2019,"Through DCEU's Aquaman, I discovered that there is, in fact, such a thing as ""too much"" when it comes to movies. Aquaman is nearly two and a half hours in length. Even though it is shorter than the ridiculous 3hr+ run time of Batman vs Superman, it still feels like too much. Normally, I wouldn't complain. I'm an avid movie-goer and would generally enjoy watching a lengthy story, but the 2.5hr length of this film made me groan and wonder when it will be over. Had it been a better film that kept me on the edge of my seat in excitement, I wouldn't even have noticed but this felt like all the epic grandeur of a Star Wars adventure minus the thrills and excitement, and that risks the onset of boredom. The story itself is needlessly complex and burdened by the weight of too many secondary sub-plots. We get it. Aquaman is discovering his destiny. He's on a mission to reclaim his rightful place as heir to the throne of Atlantis. That's a pretty straight forward story. Go with that. Why they had to introduce all these extra elements and side missions is beyond me.
It genuinely seemed like the producers wanted to incorporate as much of the comic book mythos as possible in the span of one film. It felt like they went out of their way to get all the locations, all the characters and species of creatures and mortals alike, in the comic books and highlight them in the film. It's almost as if they anticipated the criticisms of comic book and superhero purists who would challenge them on their choices and sought to go out of their way to ensure that those groups would catered to, and as a result, it felt forced. For instance, not only did you have Aquaman's plot to reclaim Atlantis, but you also have wars between several different races of underwater people resulting from the politics of this imaginary place we're only briefly aware of, as well as a sub-plot focused on the revenge of a black-ops mercenary turned laser-faced super villain named Black Manta (who just felt tacked on and unnecessary btw). The film also features gladiatorial combat involving sea creatures (which post-Thor Ragnarok felt like a rip-off). Heck it even had a giant Octopus playing tribal war drums. I'm not joking. The story was silly. Basically, Aquaman must reclaim his rightful place as the heir to the throne of Atlantis but in order to do that he has to go to a particular place to find a thing, so that he could take the thing to the other place to do the other thing. All the while fighting Atlanteans, and humans, and super-villains, and naval sub-marines, and simultaneously remembering all of the super-secret training he received from Willem Dafoe, to become an Atlantean Warrior, which we are slow-drip fed via flashbacks throughout the film. Oh and he falls in love. Of course.
Frankly, I would have preferred if they had split it into 2 films or condensed it by cutting out a lot of the extra stuff that did not move the film forward at all. Aquaman can talk to animals, he can ride waves, he can summon sharks and whales, and control the element of water and do cool stuff with it but none of these special powers are ever used when the need arises. If he can summon a school of killer sharks to do his bidding, then why doesn't he just summon them to eat his enemies and be done with it?
As far as acting, Jason Mamoa, just doesn't have any skills. He's good at flexing his muscles and looking intimidating, which, I guess, is good enough for a superhero film. His best asset is his looks. It's when he has to deliver lines that he looks awkward and out of his element (no pun intended). His portrayal of Aquaman is a very sharp contrast to the traditional look of character. One wonders where the line is drawn on the look of a superhero. For instance, Batman looks like Batman. He has a cowl and pointy ears and Superman has a red cape and blue tights, much like how Superman is traditionally supposed to look. So then why did DC/Warner opt to portray Aquaman as a tattooed biker that probably smells like fish instead of dressing him in green and orange tights with fish scales on them?",Aquaman
290,headly66,Nice movie...But Aquaman is white,7,22 December 2018,"I am so sick of comic book characters changing color. It has nothing to do with racism, I am an originalist. In almost every movie now we have a main or minor character turn from white to Asian, black, Hispanic and now Aquaman is Hawaiian.Don't get me wrong, Jason Momoa is great for the role, and his exotic looks make the character more interesting. But he isn't Aquaman.The original 1940's Aquaman was a regular man who could breathe underwater and control fish and other underwater life for up to a minute, and he was white.The Silver Age Aquaman was Arthur Curry, the son of Tom Curry, a lighthouse keeper, and Atlanna, a water-breathing outcast from the lost, underwater city of Atlantis, and again he was a blonde haired white man.I just can't imagine the fallout of turning a long time black character into a white person, it would never happen.Here is a partial list of characters who have changed colors....only from white.Nick Fury

291,achyutaghosh,Aquaman is a fun affair!,9,16 December 2018,"Aquaman is a blast!DC got everything right for a change, and in doing so James Wan conjures (pun intended) a level of entertainment that bests their greatest in this decade- Wonder Woman. The humor, action, acting, editing, all are spot on for a change, and Jason Momoa as Aquaman is as inspired a choice as Gal Gadot was.This connected universe thing is not DC's cup of tea. They never established the characters well enough to connect them like Marvel did, and each movie was tonally different. DC's 2018 shift towards independent, disconnected universe way is far better than them copying the Marvel way. Aquaman though, introduced in fine style in 2017's Justice League is a remnant of their connected strategy. Momoa isn't the only guy bringing the house down though, the key guy here is James Wan. Wan has injected a sense of fun that helps entertain a wider audience, which DC so far lacked. Not that he has given up on his horror roots- some of the sea creatures and inspiring visuals will not look out of place in the Conjuring universe.Watching a comic book movie requires you to enter into the theater with an open mind. In this case, that is an underwater world, complete with shark and whale riders, highways for turtle-cabs, sea horses that are quite literally sea horses, bongo playing octopuses, giant prehistoric monsters, pink haired Dolph Lungdren- you get the idea.Aquaman picks up where Steppenwolf is defeated in Justice League, and people of earth know of a sea dweller who is out to help them. A backstory gives Arthur Curry's origin- eldest son of the queen of Atlantis who fell in love with a lighthouse keeper. She was apparently executed for her infidelity, but you know DC movies are all about mommies, so hold that thought. Arthur's half brother Orm wants to unite all the undersea kingdoms (yes, there are 7!) and wage war with Donald Trump and the rest of us genteel land dwellers because of global warming, ocean trash, pollution etc. Only Arthur can take him on, but for that he needs the Trident of Atlan. He is helped by Mera, daughter of Sir Pink Hair Dolph, and Vulko, counselor of Atlantis, while in his way stands Orm and his dreams of becoming Ocean Master, and his comic book nemesis, Black Manta.Arthur Curry: I'm no leader. I'm not a king.
Mera: Atlantis has always had a king. Now it needs something more.
Arthur Curry: Well, what could be greater than a king?
Mera: A hero.In one fell swoop, Wan provides an exciting origin story for both hero and villain, a believable romantic angle, and an emotional family drama, replete with epic battle scenes that shade Star Wars, and thrilling expedition sequences that match up to Indiana Jones. Momoa plays Aquaman as he played Khal Drogo- brashness and physicality that he has made his own, along with doses of humor and charm- no lasso of truth required for him to lay out his feelings for Mera. Speaking of whom, Mera is perhaps Amber Heard's first big budget role, and she fits the Atlantean princess to the T. Nicole Kidman is the most charming DC superhero mommy, and Yahya Abdul Mateen is a passionate Black Manta. Patrick Wilson as Orm is probably the only miscasting, but he too gamely plays along.Many thought this year's greatest spectacle was Avengers:Infinity War but do watch Aquaman and you may be pleasantly surprised.",Aquaman
292,Semisonic,Scale alone doesn't cut it. Even a golden one,4,31 March 2019,"Marvel has Thor, and he was larger than life, at least while those charming blond curls lasted. Disney has Frozen, and it was all over the place. What could have DC done to prove that it's them who must be the most shiny and sparkling princesses of this realm? The answer is: to make The Most Epic Film Ever!Imagine putting together Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Avatar, Black Panther, The Lord of the Rings, TRON, Blade Runner, Hunger Games, Mission Impossible, Fifth Element, G.I. Joe, King Arthur, Jurassic Park, and even Shrek to spruce things up a bit. Then crumb a ton of lesser blockbusters and blockbuster wannabes on top. Sounds terrific, ""but will it blend?"" Of course it will! With the new WarnerBro 3000, we could mill this into a uniform, fine-grained mess, with giant seahorses, roaring sharks and blaster-wielding steampunk dudes bestriding them.Some superhero films at least have the decency to pretend to have some sense about them before plunging into the abyss of brain-convulsing insanity, but not Aquaman! Aquaman wants to be a Superman x Deadpool, both unparalleledly badass and unbelievably corny. Aquaman is a champion of heavy submarine-lifting and a wizard of cheesy oneliners. Aquaman flies, Aquaman jumps, he does all but sing Italian opera under the sea - and for that omission alone I'm indeed grateful.Being a total self-belittling goofus was maybe the only point of indulgence for the Aquaman himself, so at least we don't have to try to watch this farce with serious faces (like we had to with the latest Batman and Superman movies). Maybe if I was a woman, I'd find some another redeeming point about this movie, but seriously, if you just want to watch Jason Momoa look all buff, watch that Conan film instead, you would feel much smarter while you do. Watch this, however, if you've been sitting in a dark cellar for the last fifty years, and you want to recall what colors and moving objects look like. You might even be surprised by the (not so) delicately delivered ecological message - and start reducing, reusing and recycling right away.And if you do, please go ahead and recycle this trash first.

293,mohit_sinsniwal,More cheese than I can handle,7,26 May 2019,"I have no idea why somebody would give this movie a good score, let alone 10. After 20 minutes I have decided that its for the best to switch my brain off and enjoy the show. But damn this movie is way too dumb. Character development is rushed and is given in a form of cringy and weak dialogues. Jokes feel like they are just out of place, but specific moments are created just for them to happen (which makes it even more ridiculous). There are some really stunning shots, but its more of an exception rather than the rule. But the main issue, which makes this movie unwatchable without at least 4 cans of beer, is the fact that its linear as hell, there are 0 unpredictable plot twists, from the beginning of the movie (or even from trailers) you for sure know how its going to end. Also the mood is unbelievably inconsistent, at some points characters are dead serious, while in 2 minutes they may be cracking jokes. Its not as bad as in Justice League, but black manta just looks pathetic with his constanty frowny or angry face. WB, u evil corporate idiots, stop ruining your movies by trying to be like Marvel and making movies based on a formula which clearly doesn't work.

295,snowfre,"A film that keeps its head above the surface due to its visuals and fun action, but the script is thin as a paper boat",5,20 April 2020,"In James Wan's adaption of DC's classic Athalntean superhero Aquaman, the focus is clearly on entertaining fight scenes, vibrant underwater settings, and some non-imaginary one-liners, with less so on storytelling, pacing narrative, and dialogue that doesn't make you cringe. Jason Mamoa is the film's lead as the land based aquatic demigod who sets out to stop his half-brother, King Orm (Wilson) drom waving against the humans. Honestly, not being any environmentalist of any sort, King Orm's war seems justified as humanity's littering of the oceans is a driving factor for him but I'll just set aside that part I guess. So, what we're left with a film that reminds me of the quite tacky, yet often entertaining, superhero movies of the early 2000s, before Disney bought Marvel and turned comic book superheroes to the latest cinematic craze. ""Aquaman"" is of course visually superior to those old(er) movies, in fact, the underwater environments in the film are breathtakingly beautiful and stunningly well-made, and, besides the action, the CGI and visual effects are what makes ""Aquaman"" float. I wish the writing duo Johnson-McGoldrick and Beall would have polished the script somewhat, cutting down on unnecessary scenes, made Black Manta (Abdul-Mateen II) feel relevant, increased the villain vibes from blondie King Orm, and thought the dialogue through one more time. Damn that dialogue. It's unbearably awkward at times, especially when Aquaman and Mera (Heard) have their more romantically tense moments. It is easily overshadowed by the action sequences, yes, but I wish ""Aquaman"" would have a more mature atmosphere and focused less on filling its tank with the most clichéd superhero elements known to man.",Aquaman
296,Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,The young man and the sea,8,2 January 2019,"Aquaman may well be the least original film you have ever seen. Literally everything that happens and is of any significance to the plot can be seen from a mile away, but it doesn't really matter. DC has had enough failures in recent years to excuse their lack of risk, at least when this avalanche of cliches works to make an enjoyable film. And I thought it's nice that in such a formulaic story they found a place for Dolph Lundgren, because how best to wrap up a cliche-fest than with a washed up action star. Moreover, if the film was a bit older, Jason Momoa would have gotten a haircut during the first 5 minutes, which would be disastrous.I haven't really said anything about the film itself - disappointed hero/heir to throne gets called to save homeland, has to face evil brother, needs magic swo..trident, has help of wise old guy and pretty girl. I feel like Willem Dafoe should be rejecting this kind of roles, not that I can blame him.I wish superhero films weren't so hell-bent on advanced civilisations / aliens having so much blind faith in hereditary absolute monarchy, but as we established, this is not the place for such moon-talk. What you might complain about in terms of messages is that the whole ""humans / land-people are destroying the oceans"" thing isn't given the gravity it deserves.",Aquaman

298,gcsman,"""Worlds of DC"" has discovered color!",6,21 December 2018,"Aquaman has loads of spectacle and loads of color -- all the way down to Mera's ultra-red hair. In that one way it's the polar opposite of the dark and glum Batman v Superman or Suicide Squad. Director James Wan has decided to throw the kitchen sink at us, with giant armored sharks, supergiant weaponized crabs, fleets of manta rays, armies of mermen, magic tridents, and even wilder fantasy flights of imagination. What makes this work, which it pretty much does, is that it has the big advantage of being new: we haven't seen this before, by comparison with any other action-driven movies that are usually on the ""surface world"", as the Atlanteans refer to it.But as writer Ursula LeGuin once said, if the only thing we see happening is unrelenting physical action then it's a sure sign that there is no story being told. And that's where Aquaman teeters on the edge. It's got a storyline, which is actually quite simple and barely adequate to support all the action, but in a sense the real center of interest is the spectacle itself largely because of its new and unfamiliar setting. The overall feeling I got was that I was watching some kind of stylistic combination of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Pacific Rim, Star Wars, and King Arthur all piled together. My (adult) daughter says it's like a cross between Tron and Little Mermaid.About the acting: Jason Momoa is -- OK. Maybe a promise for better things to come. He and all the rest suffer from having to deliver a pretty simplistic script with stereotype dialog. I was generally pleased with Amber Heard as Mera; she got more to do than I was expecting and they gave her a distinctive water-control superpower that was fun to see and came in handy at certain points. Patrick Wilson and Willem Dafoe stood clearly above all the rest, however, just for their quality of diction; i.e. they didn't mumble. Why has slurring your words become a 'style'?? As a last comment, I thought Rupert Gregson-Williams' musical score was kind of a disappointment. It was workmanlike and did the job needed for an epic like this (essentially telling us how to feel at every moment) but it was nowhere near the standout work he did for Wonder Woman.Bottom line is that you'll get your money's worth for an evening's entertainment. For Worlds of DC it's a step up in production values. Now let's just add some serious storytelling to go with it.",Aquaman

I guess the CGI has been good in all of the DC movies. That used to be the only goo thing about them. The acting was great. All the character parts were also good. The first scene were the brothers were fighting with there tridents was a little slow. I was thinking that that scene could have been a little faster. Also Black Manta was barely in the movie at all. I wish he could have been in more of the movie. He is a spectacular character with great potential. This movie was a nerdy movie. It could have gone either ways like Star Wars The Last Jedi.

303,AnishMisra,Aquaman Review,8,22 December 2018,"Aquaman is a film co-written and directed by James Wan. I remember being the few people who actually liked the trailer and what it was actually going for. I was with the film from the beginning. After watching it today, it felt like an adventure filled ride.Plot: Arthur Curry, the heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, must step forward to lead his people against his half-brother, Orm, who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world.Story and direction: I have adored James Wan as a director for quite a long time. I even liked his film Furious 7 (maybe I will go on to say the best the series had). So, with the film I was quite positive that I would fully understand as to what Wan wants to achieve. And he totally achieves it in this film. His vision is huge and he does complete justice to it. The film is a big celebration of CGI and style. The action scenes are wonderfully choreographed and filmed on wide angles, which hugely impressed me. The creature designs and production design are impressive. Also, the comedy is just spot on. I laughed at even the smallest joke that was cracked. The emotional aspect of the film, although very small, was just great. The characterization for most of the characters were spot on. They were not perfect which is what I liked. The musical score was fabulous. The VFX was great and in 3D it just was awesome. Some things that bogged me down was the runtime. At times, it does feel that the film was dragging. Also, the first act did feel a bit rushed and I did feel that they could have built on certain aspects of that act. Orm as a villain was a bit cliched. He didn't have any such motivation for his actions.Performances: Jason Mamoa lived through the role of Arthur Curry. From the first scene onwards, he just makes you believe that he is strong. Amber Heard complements Jason's character nicely. Patrick Wilson was good with what he was given to do. William Dafoe was good as Nuis Vulko. Yahta Abdul Mateen II was bad-ass. It was god to see Dolph Ludgren. Finally, Nicole Kidman and Temeura Morrison were great as Aquaman's parents.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene with Arthur and Mera on the Sahara. That scene was very funny. The jokes were spot on. Adding to that, the scenery was just awesome.Verdict: If you enjoy big adventure and CGI filled action films, then this film is perfect for you. If not, then I would advise to stay away from the film. Yes, the film is not perfect and has some flaws, but I did have a fun time with the film. If the makers are planning a sequel they surely have excited me. The DC Extended Universe has definitely redeemed itself and I am looking forward to its future films.I am going with an 8/10.",Aquaman

Jason Momoa is good, Nicole Kidman is even better, the CGI is just overblown, and the underwater scenes just don't seem to cut it, not enough bubbles or something?

310,aliases-53334,What a snoozefest,2,28 December 2018,"This film caught me by surprise by how bad it was. While the effects and the underwater world were nice, the entire movie was lacking a smart script and storyline that can drow the viewer in, however packed with cliche jokes, pointless characters, too long battle scenes to the point of yawning, and a very childish like design of the enemies.
Aquaman is clearly a great actor who drew attantion with his drooling body, but after 15 minutes the lure is gone, and the very long film could have easily cut 40 minutes.
Amber Heard lacks charisma and her only role being in the film was clearly to creata a romance interest for the lead actor, which is flat out boring.
The best part in the film was Nicole Kidman's story, which was sadly only a fracture of the film. Maybe they should have done a movie about her story instead of Aquaman.",Aquaman
311,torrascotia,Now that was just silly.,5,6 March 2019,"Aquaman is just the next comic book hero movie to come along that nobody in particular asked for. Part of the underwhelming DC universe its a surprise that this movie was released based on the bad reviews of so many of the DC universe cannon. It was a strange decision to release the Justice League movie which was an ensemble cast before each of the individual characters had their own movies released.
Back to Aquaman. The basic story is that Aquamans mother (Nicole Kidman) is cast out of her underwater kingdom and is taken in by a lighthouse keeper, played by Temuera Morrison. Fast forward and Aquaman is born and his mother is dragged away by some angry Aquaworld police in space uniforms. This sets the tone for the movie as it seems that any time we have any relative quiet, something explodes. This a repeated theme throughout which begins to seem laughable on repetition. Another odd motif is the use of shouting. Not people shouting in arguments using actual words, just AAAAAAAAAARRRGGGGHHH for no real reason. Trust me this happens. Although this is supposed to be an underwater story it really looks like a sci-fi set in space with lazers, space ships and space suits. At one point it actually looks like Tron Legacy and even sounds like the Tron Legacy soundtrack, this cant have been a mistake?
As for the actual storyline its quite hard to keep up as it seems to bounce around quite a bit, there is a subplot about an evil pirate who is out for revenge against Aquaman called Manta, but he should really be called Frog Helmet due to his ridiculous costume. Watching the movie you basically forget he exists until BOOOM, another explosion and there he is. I warned you about the Booms.
Despite a few well known faces the acting is quite poor, Aquamans is case in point, he seems to chew his words and it looks like the only reason he got the role was his looks. His jokes and pretty much all of the jokes in the movie fall flat.
Some of the visuals are impressive but its a 95% CGI movie and despite the sheer amount of onscreen action its neither engaging or exciting. Its a very Zach Snyder type of movie, at times dark visuals with slow mo but a very hollow experience.
You could easily stick this on to watch while you tidy your house but I doubt that it would be enough to draw you in to make you give up the housework.
It can be interesting visually at times but with a messy script, zero emotional content, sub par acting and very little to remember after. Still, you will have managed to complete over two hours worth of housework with some flashing lights and loud noises for company.",Aquaman

319,samyoung-82648,I laughed because it was so terrible,3,9 March 2019,"This movie is a mess. The acting is awful (except Amber Heard, Mara, who is good 1/2 of the time). The first 15 minutes are a competition between Jason Momoa (Aquaman), Nicole Kidman (the Queen) and Amber Heard for who is the most arrogant, stereotyped character. Kidman (usually a great actress) comes in a close second to Momoma for the most obnoxious character.Then there's the story. What an incoherent mess. This seems to be something Wan struggles with as he had the same problems in Star Trek 3 (which was also an incoherent mess). The story has no continuity and only the flimsiest of arcs. The characters are the most cliched I've seen in many years. I thought it was a spoof at times.I will give Wan credit though. He's seriously politically correct. If there's a box to be ticked, irrespective of talent, Wan will do it. However, this movie had a black villain and a female who didn't win every fight. Then, the male and female lead weren't antagonistic to each other - there was actually some romance (naughty, naughty Mr Wan). Finally, Kidman and Heard become doe-eyed and say ""Aquaman saved me, what a hero"". I nearly died! That was the sort of rubbish that only made it Into the worst of movies 50-60 years ago. Far too much of the time I felt like I was watching a b-grade direct to TV.This movie will not stand the test of time. There are very few super-hero movies that will. However, this one was definitely below par. Down there with Wonder Woman, Black Panther and some of the Avengers films.Score: I only gave it 3/10 because it made me laugh at the stream of cliches and it had nice visual effects of Atlantis. I'd almost give it 4 for those two aspects alone, however, delivering bad performances from Defoe and Kidman?!? That's hard to do for a capable director. So, 3/10 stays.",Aquaman

Princess Mera,played as a red head,portrayed by Amber Heard and shows up to him and tells him that a war is being started by the bad guys against Atlantis head up by king Orm who is played by Patrick Wilson, and that he Aqua is inherent to Atlantis and must com back to the under water and help them the Atlantis to win.It seems when Mera introduces aqua to her king Orm, does not trust Aqua and puts him in a hard duel that Mera rescues Aqua and both ends up in adventures in an underground of a desert to Greece ,where Mera eats flowers,but more of the bad guys shows up and they have to fight. It seems like the bad guys look like a dinosaur whale combo crocodile half man.A percentage of the story is adapted form the king Arthur stories,since Aqua man name is Arthur and the huge monster he has to deal with,reminds you of Lord of the ring dragon,when Aqua fights to get the sword that is held by the corps ,well preserved in water of King Atlan,played by Graham McTavish.It seems there is another enemy too King Nereus,played by Dolph Lundgen .Everyone is fighting to take over Atlantis ,so they can take over the land and attack the humans.This is what princes Mera is trying to stop.This film was very impressive in 3D ,like creature from the black lagoon,the under water set were impressive of the city,but, whats good is that the story just like in,"" Ready player One,""stands out and can be enjoyed equally in 2D also. There could be another sequel,because near the end you see Manta recovering from a wound,looks like he at a house of some scientist and a bomb goes through the ceiling almost hitting the scientist,and he is wanting revenge against aqua and thinking about his next plans for that.Good entertainment. 12/21/18",Aquaman
325,ScoobySnacks66,A lot of crashing through things and blowing things up,4,27 November 2019,"The film looked great but it lacked heart and intelligence. It's basically a revenge flick. Everyone seems to be seeking some form of vengeance. It was filled with mostly stupid violence, crashing through walls, blowing each other up, constant fighting and destroying ancient Roman cities, subs, Atlantis, etc.. and because of all the violence, it was mostly boring. Even with the good looking cast, this flick was a soggy mess.",Aquaman
326,yashrajs536,Looks like DC is on the right track to get its mojo back !!,8,26 December 2018,I am a hard core Batman fan so I can call myself a DC fan also. Well after the DCEU started I was excited that it can give a neck to neck competition to Marvel but that never happened.Marvel always got good critical reviews as well as phenomenal box office numbers. And yes apart from Man of Steel the other consecutive movies BvS or JL they both were not upto the mark. Wonder woman was a good movie though.Because of these dissappointments I was not excited for Aquaman. I thought this will also be added to the list of the above movies I mentioned. But I was proven wrong !! How did I forgot that the director of this movie is none other than Mr. JAMES WAN who made The conjuring and Furious 7. But everything aside. James wan yet again proved his mettle. And this movie is a sure shot blockbuster.DC has a bad repo for not giving much freedom to its directors. And that's why its movies become dissapointments. But as Wan claimed that he was given full freedom in making Aquaman we can ourselves see the results of it. And I hope that DC continues this trend in its future movies also.Back to the movie let's talk about pros and cons:-Pros :-1. Wan's direction is fantastic.2. Action director who has designed the action deserves a praise.3. VFX team also deserves a praise. A film like this is quite a difficult task to do. But still these guys have done it.4. Adding emotions in a proper proportion adds a character development aspect which we missed in previous DCEU movies. Though they could have shown more emotional attachment of Queen of Atlanta and Ocean Master.5. Performances by all the actors are fantastic.6. Art director also deserves a praise.Cons:-1. Film gets boring in between especially in Italy scenes.2. If character development of Black manta and Ocean Master could have been done a bit well. Then it could have been more amazing.My rating is 8/10.,Aquaman
327,troy-daniel-bush,It grew on me.,6,21 September 2021,"I can hardly believe it myself. I have a lot of fun watching it.It falls flat on its face in terms of writing but everyone in front of the camera and behind it really tries. This is not a superhero film that is devoid of passion. On top of that, I have fun watching it thanks to Mamoa's charisma, the dumb but well-filmed action, dumb love story between Atlanta and Aquaman's father, bright colors, visually appealing shots, Black Manta, and Drumming Octopus. Also, this movie is 2 hrs 23 mins long? It feels like an hour and a half. And there are lines of dialogue so ridiculous that they make me laugh. Yeah, I know, that's a long list, which is why I'm not posting one in this review. The several guitar riffs with sexy eyebrows make me laugh, too.

332,intrepidami,An Honest Review,8,22 December 2018,"The 10's? are a bit ridiculous. This was not a ten movie. This guy is clearly Aquaman. Society hasn't kind of figured that out? He's not trying to hide or disguise himself. He's not working a regular job in an alternate identity. Lex Luthor is not required to figure this out. Yet Manta says several times he needs help finding him? Clearly Mantas...a retard! Yet....There was nothing to imply Manta was adapt at reverse engineering advanced technology, yet he does it in 2 minutes? Because he needed to! It would have been far better to have an Atlantian weapons tech create it for him He's one of those annoying cardboard characters that they leave open his specific skills sets so they can just create an expertise for him whenever needed. Like how 100's of people in TV and Movies are fantastic world class hackers in their spare time. In this case Manta is Tony Stark when he needs to be.To me if somebody is THIS SMART, why are they a pirate? Why are they covertly working for Atlantis? How did they meet? Too many ""just because"" things. Another annoying thing...the bad guys of Atlantis clearly know EXACTLY where Arthur lives, which opens a large kettle of fish.At one point a villain will reveal he's known who was loyal to him and who wasn't the entire time. Which again brings up more questions than answers.Jason Mamoa plays Aquaman as a surfer/biker. It helps cement him as about as non royal as King Ralph. He's a fish out of water. One thing that should be amended is he's able to talk to all sorts of Marine life, not just fish.Ok so there's flaws. Then there's these 1/10 reviews. Also ridiculous. The movie is light hearted without mimicking Thor Ragnarok which got a little too silly. The acting is not going to win any awards. But I don't see Anthony Hopkins getting considerations for his Marvel work either.The visuals are stunning. The fight scenes are great! The chase scene rivals any Bond movie. Aquaman is very strong and invulnerable. But he's not Superman and this is shown very well that he's a notch below, but not too far below.This was a great effort. Not as good as WonderWoman, but not too far off.",Aquaman
333,timeblank,Visuals is Amazing! A little Anticlimactic!,8,23 December 2018,Aqua man is just beautiful in its visuals. Would be amazing in 3D. It has great action sequences. Story kind jumps from certain places at times. When characters or places are introduced felt Anticlimactic in way. Especially the war battle. Wish Black Manta has more screen time. My only gripe about is the intro on how Aqua man was born. Wish they cut that scene out! Seems dull. Especially adding love story. Did not work for me.Love the visuals and cinematography. Story was okay. But I still like the The Dark Knight more than this one. Because their is meaning behind it and Aquaman doesn't have that magical feeling. It's okay but it's amazingly beautiful in its visuals. Hands down.,Aquaman

The acting is dreadful though, anytime amber heard says one word I want to kill myself. The dialogue is awful, every sentence turns into a motivational speech. The action though, is amazing! It looks really cool, sometimes a bit over the top, especially with the costumes, but the long scenes where the camera moves around a lot look very nice. The plot is your pretty average superhero movie, it does the job just about. The motive for the villain I found to be pretty dumb, personally but I let it slip. Overall it's an alright movie with fun action but bad acting. 5/10",Aquaman
338,paulijcalderon,"Giant sea battles, parkour with laser blasts and one ""fish-man"" caught in the middle",7,16 December 2018,"Is Aquaman the savior of DC or merely that fish-boy from the TV? Well, it's not perfect but it's actually better than expected. It seems the character has gotten some justice now with a grand scale movie that's solely about his story. Jason Momoa still goes around with his ""surf"" attitude but he ends up growing by regretting some mistakes and assuming responsibility. However, there are cliches and storytelling tropes which can't be escaped. Luckily it doesn't bring everything down as the action is fun and the visuals are a feast to the eye. It's a movie that will entertain to the max. An element I was happy to see was the usage of mythology (especially Greek mythology in this case). I've always been endlessly fascinated by what legendary mystic stories could be explored in the profoundness of the sea. And that tone was transmitted nicely to the screen. I loved the depth in the cinematography. You'll see the sunlight reach the corals while the characters swim across. It's vibrant, warm and full of life. So the visuals were big standouts. The story was decent yet formulaic. I could have gone with less explaining and skipped of some of the obvious jokes. But most surprisingly it finds moments where clear human purity is brought out. The tale about Arthur's parents, his training with Willem Dafoe's Vulko, even his relationship with Mera doesn't come across as annoying (considering it's super obvious that they're gonna be together). It somehow works on plain simplicity. It's nothing too much, just clear and simple enough that you can see the sincerity there.It's bloated given how grand James Wan wants to go with the story. You better stay awake for two hours because this thing moves like sharks chasing their pray. The action is always energetic, except for when they decide to throw a character into a wall. The parkour set-piece was a lot of fun. Partly with how well thought out the shots were and where the next part of the sequence would lead to. And this is coming from someone who thought it looked stupid in the trailers. Loved the look of the bad guys. Manta has been one of my favorites and it's amazing to see him adapted properly on the big screen. I wanted his part in the plot to be even more integral. Ocean Master is OK at best. His costume and helmet are great but the guy's a bit of a Shakespearean villain cliche. I will give him credit for at least having a motivation I understood and agreed with. His solution to his problem however... That's where the villain aspect comes to play. I would also have trimmed out some levity that felt pandering. Some of the characters didn't get enough development to make you undertand their place in the story. I was kind of confused as to who Mera was and what she was up to during the first act. But to be fair, that may have been because she looks so otherworldly it drew me away. Anyway, it is a fun movie and a lot more decent than I thought it would be. Just be ready for some stupid bits here and there, or very convenient plot points. But the visual spectacle delivers with some imaginative underwater worlds and creatures. Better than ""Justice League"" which doesn't say too much, but I see this being very enjoyable on repeat viewings.",Aquaman
339,domtaylor,"The worst superhero film of the year, and one of the year's worst full stop.",5,28 December 2018,"The DCEU has never produced a 'good' film and sadly 'Aquaman' is no exception. It's an overlong slog that has a terrible narrative, unbelievable CGI, average performances, and an awful exposition-filled screenplay. The film just gets worse as it progresses, and I had completely lost interest by around the half-way point. There is one good action sequence near the middle of the movie that is actually rather entertaining, and that is probably due to the fact that it uses real stunt-people and fight choreography as opposed to the awkward CGI body doubles that are used in 75% of the action set-pieces. The problem with these is that, since we don't care for any of the characters at all, it is easy to notice that CG has taken over. If we were invested in the narrative and were bothered by the film's stakes, then the CG replacement would probably be less of a problem. Talking about character, some of our hero's decisions are completely unbelievable and make him a totally unlikeable character. The film does use some good scene transitions sometimes, but that's hardly enough to save the picture. The worst thing about it, however, is that it's simply not fun. It could have at least been entertaining, and I could have even excused the bad narrative and dialogue if I was having some kind of fun. Yet, I was bored throughout most of it and was never invested within the story. It's the worst superhero film of the year, and one of the year's worst films full stop. 4/10",Aquaman

Although it has something original, we saw lots of cliches and similarities with other super hero characters and movies. What Aquaman did it first is creating a world under water and they did it alright. CGIs are really great. I liked it but sometimes you can easily figure out it is a visual effect because editors have to use these effects every time. And thats the hard part of the job. Even so this movie has the best CGIs in any DC movie for me. Also, Aquaman has a great action. Italy fight, submarine fight, big battle in Atlantis... Casting is great too. Momoa and Heard did a wonderful job on this project. But generally characters doesn't have tough motivations. Especially King Orm, he is not a so intense villian. On the other hand, film is so long. I think it could be better if it would be 15 minutes shorter. Another great thing Aquaman did it great is connection of opening and final sequences. It was enjoyable.",Aquaman

345,tresm87,"8.4/10 James Wan has crafted the most visually magnificent and triumphant tale of the DCU, full of heartfelt emotion and genuine fun albeit ridiculous at times.",8,21 December 2018,"Had someone ever told me I would enjoy an Aquaman film with Jason Momoa more than any film in the DCU, I wouldn't have believed them and laughed. The truth is imho this is the most effectively executed film of the extremely polarizing DCU, and is filled with an array of epic moments throughout, as well as a fantastic portrayal of the comic story. While it might stray away from comics in certain aspects, it thrives with its own distinct identity. The attention to detail from Wan is impeccable as usual and the visuals in this are mind blowing to say the least. The world building through the diversity of colors, environments, creature designs, costume designs, and the overall perspectives are spectacular. The CGI was heavily utilized but never looked cheap or unrefined and is some of the best work I've seen. The characters are all acted well besides Black Manta's character which I thought was a laughably bad performance though maybe it was just how his character was written. Momoa did well enough and was extremely fun to watch, but Patrick Wilson stole the show with an incredible role as King Orm and added a whole different dimension to the majestic story that I did not see coming. It's clear to see why James Wan casts him so much in his great films. I also thought Willem Dafoe did a fantastic job as Vulko and it was cool to see him once again in a comic adaptation. I did think some of the dialogue and forced comedy was hit or miss at times, and bordered on ridiculous to where i laughed in absurdity. There are some really oddly placed songs in the soundtrack that also add some laughable ridiculousness. Luckily the story thrived so much with its triumphantly heartfelt core and exciting high octane action, that some of the more cheesy parts can be overlooked. It's satisfying to see that Wan took the time, effort, and heart and broke away from tired formulas of the DCU for the most part, to procure an epic original adaptation that sets up a bright future. I just hope the Black Manta character/actor will improve, because if he will be the main villain, he will have to be more convincing and slightly better written. Overall this is a fantastic film that needs to be seen in theaters to truly savor the details and grand scapes.",Aquaman

After watching it, I can say I was fully entertained. DC movies were always great on spectacle, and this was no exception. In even managed to create a new world that could be enough to make Aquaman a franchise in its own right. With James Wan at the helm, this movie does not feel like a DC movie. It is not moody, nor mopey and had lots of fun. The sea creatures were great, and the underwater world was breathtaking. Jason Momoa proved he could carry a movie. Despite his hulking presence, and badass look, Momoa's Aquaman is a quite a character. He is charming, witty, and persevering. But he is not broody like Batman or Superman, nor is he a doe-eyed idealist as Wonder Woman during WWI. He is a relatable character who just happens to have superpowers. Besides Momoa, Patrick Wilson was excellent as a villain. Unlike previous DC villains, he is interesting, and proves a worthy nemesis to Momoa's Aquaman. Though his performance is not as compelling as Michael B Jordan's Killmonger, we can still see understand his character's motive. As for other supporting casts, Dolph Lundgren stole the show. He chews every scenery he is in. That is not to say Amber Heard, and Willem Defoe were terrible, but I just enjoyed Lundgren more.

I saw this film and it's just okay. It's not very good and it's not very bad. The things I liked about it:Black Manta: One of the only DCEU archenemy villains that they get right. I love the improvements on his suit design and how tough and intimidating he was. The lasers that shot out of his eyes were very cool.Mera: Even though Amber Heard is not a redhead, she still was a good leading lady role, and I wonder why movies like this in the DCEU have better love interest roles than Man of Steel (And Superman's my favorite DC Hero!!)The things I disliked:Black Manta: I liked Manta, but some of him seemed like a Killmonger knock off. With the story of his dad and his vendetta against Aquaman. Also, the fact that he wasn't the main villain was a disappointment. He only had 19 minutes of screen time.The Humor: I believe it was a worthy thing for them to try and brighten up the DCEU with humor, but when you think about the universe that these movies exist in, it seems sudden and out of place.That being said, it's definitely not a movie I would buy on blu-ray, but it's a better entry in the DC Extended Universe. I'll give Warner Bros. that.",Aquaman
350,mbhgkmsgg,Aquaman,7,26 December 2020,"Aquaman is another character introduction film in the DCEU. Like the other films in the series, it's long, action-packed, and often a little too cheesy. However, it's also tremendously entertaining.Indeed, I've had a surprisingly hard time deciding how much I like this film. While on the one hand, it has great visuals, fun action, and it's wonderfully entertaining. On the other hand, it has fairly poor CGI, cheesy and stupid lines, and pacing that, for the most part, feels odd. However, at the end of the day, movies like Aquaman are meant to be entertaining. And being completely honest, I had a great time with it. By the time it ended, I was cheering for Aquaman, just like I'm sure many others did. And it's that sensation that these films strive for. And if they achieve it, they tend to be quite good. The best example of this, and one that will most likely never be topped, is the Avengers Assemble moment in Endgame. It's a moment of triumph and joy, and no matter how much one might dislike superhero movies, it's hard to dislike a moment like that. And so when I see a new superhero movie for the first time, I always look for that moment of triumph where I can cheer for the hero. If that moment exists, and everything else isn't complete garbage, I really have no reason to dislike the film.The story is what bothered me the most about Aquaman. It follows Aquaman as he starts coming to terms with who he is. He learns that his half brother is planning an invasion from Atlantis to the surface, intending to teach us 'surface-dwelling' humans our place. However, Aquaman, who has lived his whole life on land, has grown quite fond of his home and wants to protect it from the impending invasion. To do so, however, he must claim his rightful place as the king of Atlantis, even though he never wanted to do so.
It's as much of an origin story as an origin story can be. Along the journey, we learn about his past, his powers, and his true destiny. Since it is an origin story, there isn't much to say about it. However, there is a lot to say about the way it was done. You see, stories like this should be simple. They should focus on the character being introduced, and that's it. However, Aquaman doesn't do just that. Not only does it introduce the character of Aquaman, but it also attempts to introduce others, like Black Manta. While I'm sure that it seemed like a good choice, as my understanding is that he is a bit of a fan favourite, the resulting product was needlessly complicated. It added extra to an already long runtime, and it added a plotline that had nothing to do with the actual story being told.Indeed, Black Manta is one of the most useless characters in the whole film. And one of the reasons why it was so difficult to decide how I felt about it. While I'm sure that the character is interesting and even powerful in the comics, the way he is treated in Aquaman, makes him seem weak and pointless. You'd think that a war between worlds would be enough of a threat and plot for a film like this, but alas, it wasn't. However, it's not just the character of Black Manta that bothered me. One of the most striking things was the surprisingly poor CGI. Especially in scenes with close-up action, or just close-up shots of people underwater, it felt cheap and looked weird. I understand that a big part of the movie taking place underwater adds its own challenges, but in a movie like Aquaman, that relies on looking good, I was expecting to see top-notch CGI. And, certainly, some moments look absolutely stunning. Shots that pan around the city of Atlantis, especially, look great. In fact, every time the CGI isn't up close to the camera, it looks fantastic.But, despite all my complaints, I had a great time with Aquaman, and it's certainly of the better films in the DCEU. While the ending, which really is the highlight of the film, comes quickly and out of the blue, it still delivers a satisfying and triumphant conclusion. And while there are elements that shouldn't be there, the focus always remains of Aquaman and his story, amounting to what is fun and entertaining superhero film. Just what it was meant to be.",Aquaman
351,Wililjam,Pretty good...,7,27 January 2019,"Aquaman is a much light-hearted DCEU movie than we've previously seen, more so than Wonder Woman. It has its pros and cons of course. Pros would be that you weren't taking the movie seriously, and cons would be that the comedy just fell flat at times.The CGI looks pretty good, I absolutely love the colors they used, but parts of the story was actually pretty horrible. Manta is one of the most stupid characters in this movie, and his story was awful, plain and simple.Manta and his father murdered innocent people on a submarine, Aquaman saves the remaining innocent people, Manta's father is trapped, Manta begs Aquaman to save his father who, mind you, just killed a bunch of people. When Aquaman doesn't save his father, Manta has the audacity to be upset. Really? Piss off.Another small issue I had with the movie was the kissing scene between Aquaman and Mera. While half of everyone you're there to save is dying in the background, you're busy smacking those lips for half an eternity. There's probably time to kiss AFTER the whole ordeal is over.Yet another small issue I had was some songs that were extremely misplaced, I swear I heard Pitbull somewhere, and that's never a good thing.That being said, I really enjoyed the movie.",Aquaman

The plot might be pretty standard and the pacing way too fast for it's own good, but the characters are interesting enough to stand out on their own, the action is exhilarating and the CGI effects are so eye-popping and colourful that no other DC movie resembles them.",Aquaman
354,Endless_01,"A decent and fun DC movie, but still not achieving excellent quality.",6,15 June 2019,"Despite the harsh criticisms that the cinematic universe of DC has received over the last few years, they have managed to remain stable and again and again have tried to meet the expectations of their audience, yet again and again failed; now, as for Aquaman, it seems to be a green light to a ray of hope for the future of these movies, because they finally offer us something that is both entertaining and decent, without mediocrity or folly.Aquaman is an entertaining movie, full of intense moments designed to satisfy our eyes through a pretty cinematography and a great choreography, this but a soundtrack quite attractive that manages to help the scenes are quite satisfactory to our senses, well, at least the action scenes.Leaving the action on one side, I think that the rest of the film during the moments when nobody is fighting, are then, boring, full of dialogues and performances that sincerely do not contribute anything to the importance we have on these characters. His narrative is full of the cliches expected in any film, however it is something forgivable, but reaches a point where we simply want a break from observing the same thing over and over again during these dialoguing scenes. I think this is the weak point of the film, in contrast to the very good action it has, it lacks a strong narrative or structure in which we can be interested enough about the story of the film, the motives of the characters or the characters themselves.In spite of this, it is finally a healthy and well-received attempt in the action genre, apart from a good movement on the part of DC. Although the movie was entertaining, the reality is that it was simply ""good"", nothing outstanding or anything excellent, but even so, it is worth having a look at it if someone is interested in the DC film universe, this is probably their best movie.",Aquaman
355,CountVladDracula,A pleasant surprise,10,6 March 2019,"I just saw Aquaman. I liked it. Yes, he made a huge mistake in not showing mercy to that pirate in the beginning but it becomes apparent he had a chip on his shoulder because he thought his mother was dead and by the end of the movie he's learned to show mercy. It's like half scifi and half medieval / ancient Greek with some Game of Thrones elements and it has some nice visuals. I also love that his parents reunite at the end. This is what a DC movie should be. Action, drama, and hope. Not that darkity, dark, dark nonsense Zack Snyder was pushing. Also Mera is a well developed character here. This is probably the best depiction of Mera I've seen.",Aquaman
356,mandagrammy,Good Action and Humor,8,31 March 2019,"Growing up with the superhero comics of the '50's and '60's, Aquaman was one of my favorites. I was super excited to see what they would do with his character, and it was a double pleasure knowing that Jason Mamoa would play my hero. I wasn't disappointed at all with the exciting action, especially being thrilled with so much of it underwater. Loved the brief love story in the beginning. Loved the costuming and special effects too. One important note, if you are one of those who stops watching the moment the credits roll, don't do it. You'll miss out on something very important part way into the credits. I'll give this an extra 1/2 star for the humor in this film, which many superhero films lack.",Aquaman
357,punisherversion1,It's so busy,5,13 June 2019,"Aquaman:
Directed by James Wan. Written by Geoff Johns, James Wan, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will BeallAquaman is a character that many people have long since thought to be an incredibly silly idea. He talks to fish and lives underwater. He will sometimes fight crimes taking place on the high seas. Justice League introduced him to the world as a beer chugging bad ass saving the world from aliens. No one and I mean nobody thought this movie would have been good or even a success for that matter. It was a huge success. Was the movie any good though? Eh somewhat.This is a very busy film. Something is always happening at a fast pace. They are having a scene on the beach where Willem Dafoe's character Vulko is training Jason Momoa's Aquaman to fight for the throne in the future, the camera is spinning around and around and around. This is just one example. The underwater scenes are filled with so much detail. It is incredible to watch what all these animators are able to accomplish. What those hundreds of thousands of animators working overtime for exposure were able to accomplish is impressive. I am of the mind that when a movie is this full of CGI, it might as well be an animated movie. There is almost nothing in it that's real. It's beautiful and impressive but not real.The thing about this movie is it's not a superhero film. At least not in the traditional sense. It's a prophecy film, a fantasy film. Kingdoms warring over the throne. It's without a doubt a fantasy film. It works in those perimeters. It delivers this world and all the characters work in simplistic terms. The movie is incredibly flashy and won't stop. It tells you what you're supposed at every turn. While all the visuals are filled with details, the script and characters are delivered in the most basic way. They have only character trait and they play it well. I didn't believe a word of it with the exception of Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master.Man he plays it up. He is acting his ass off. Most of the time he is solemn and barely shows emotion. Not as Ocean Master, he is selling the evil and his bigotry against the surface dwellers and his brother. He was the best part for me. I don't know why but man I laughed at him calling himself Ocean Master but he was going to be the best Ocean Master he could be. He was true to Atlantis and its way of life. He's tired of the pollution and he wants to control all the kingdoms to wage war against the surface for their constant crap.I didn't feel any suspense because Aquaman is basically invincible unless he's fighting King Orm. This is a trend in recent superhero movies, I know this is not a superhero film generally, where the hero is so powerful that nothing seems to phase them. I hate it. My favorite heroes have flaws and have to work to win or survive. Aquaman is way too powerful to feel like anything won't go his way.In the end, it's entirely too long. It is entirely too flashy. It could have benefited from slowing down just a bit but the visuals are terrific, Patrick Wilson is stealing the show and it is fun for most of the runtime. I give this movie a C.",Aquaman
358,cappiethadog,Becca goes through the rabbit hole,5,12 January 2019,"Becca(Nicole Kidman) fell into a rabbit hole. The young man who ran over her little boy was right about alternate universes. ""If space is infinite,"" he tells the grieving mother, ""anything is possible"". The title of the film derives from a comic book that Jason(Miles Tenner) created. The plot synopsis goes like this: A boy's father dies. He was a scientist who uncovered a system of interconnected holes to alternate universes. The boy goes looking for him. In one of the panels, from behind a tree, he spies on a man who is indistinguishable from his dad, but it's not dad, interacting with duplicates of mom and himself. He is both here and there, an audience of one watching an actor play the story of his life. The tree is a demarcation; a metaphor for a bunched-up curtain pushed to one side, which separates him from the domestic scene playing out in the front yard. It could be a scene based on real life, his life, from the universe he just departed from. As a passive observer, in a sense, it's like almost being able to touch the movie screen, the filmic world that lies beyond it, a double for the world we live in. To the boy, it's an imitation of life, an adaptation, but in this movie, the screen has no negative space, filled with actors, dopplegangers unaware of their multiplicity, who play the same people from other galaxies. He is an extra; he knows not to walk pass the tree and walk into the ""mis-en-scene"".The more you think about it, every film is like an alternate universe. For Kidman. sitting at the Palais in Cannes, or in this case, Comic-Con, she sees her twin, just like that boy watching life unfold and go on without him, objectively...and subjectively. It's still her; it's just another version, a queen from Atlantis. The boy, confronted with seeing himself being played by ""himself"", an impersonator, he can't be objective. Gestures, delivery of words, comportment; all these actions are second-guessed, as would an actress. Films, being what they are, self-contained worlds where anything can happen, and in theory, interconnected, with the actor in his/her many guises being the linchpin, Kidman, theoretically finds the portal that allows her to be an Irish immigrant(""Far and Away""), a sociopathic broadcast journalist(""To Die For""), a courtesan(""Moulin Rouge""), or a grieving mother(""Rabbit Hole""). In ""Aquaman"", she is a princess who can breathe underwater and kick ass on land.The lighthouse keeper finds a strange woman splayed out on the rocks. Tom(Tememura Morrison) presumes she washed-up on shore. He is orientated to think horizontally. But for the sake of phantasmagorical thinking, imagine a scenario in which Becca, similar to the waitress from the A-ha music video for ""Take On Me"", finds passage into the comic book? Furthermore, accepting that hypothetical, imagine again, if ""Rabbit Hole"", the comic book, not the film(or the play it was based on) was adapted for the screen and was renamed ""Aquaman"".She fell from the sky. She landed on her back. She tumbled out of a wormhole. She is on the same mission as Jason's stand-in, the illustrated boy; to be reunited with a loved one. Becca gets her wish. In ""Rabbit Hole"", she muses aloud, ""Somewhere out there, I'm having a good time."" Becca is an atheist. It's science that comforts her. Becca wants to see her child, not in heaven, but in another world because in another world, Danny is alive. Becca despises angels. If you think about it, they're not much different from the undead. Angels are like flying zombies. Becca wants to undo what as a parent she feels is a transgression. As Queen Atlanna, she gets to start a family all over again. This time, mother keeps son safe, making up for the day she forgot to latch the gate. The atonement is all the more impressive, owing to the degree of difficulty. It takes more than locking the door to keep King Orm's soldiers from bringing harm to her son. She kicks, punches, and throws these invaders all over the house. In ""Rabbit Hole"", beyond the white picket fence, beyond the road where Danny was run over, is the ocean. The mother, a transfigured woman, the queen of Atlantis, watches her son emerge from the water. For Becca, it fulfills a wish from her own world; to see Danny walk through the fence door. Redemption, at last. Finally, the long-awaited hug, the clinch from another universe.",Aquaman
359,anupapu8,Yes It delivers on the promise.,8,16 December 2018,"AQUAMAN - Before starting the review a little box office update. Right now Aquaman is forth highest grossing Superhero movie in China behind just Infinity War , Venom and Age of Ultron. And with this speed it will probably cross Age of Ultron and then Venom to take the 2nd spot , so i think the box office prospects of the movie are going to be good.Now just for the sake of Comparison i think Aquaman is on the par with Batman Begins in Ranking DC movies behind Dark Knight , Dark Knight Rises and Wonder Woman. But just like last year's Thor 3 (being the most fun movie of MCU) this is the most fun movie of DCEU , which is not saying much actually because DCEU is not known for being fun and no the Jokes of this film doesn't go as high as Thor 3 but its still a movie as good as that one (another Comparison).I mean this movie doesn't go dark ever. And honestly m not a big fan of this type of Superhero Movies . Its not like i dislike them , its just something which i don't prefer in comparison to the darker movies likes of Batman Trilogy and Man Of Steel. But in anytime i would prefer a good fun movie then an average Darker Film. And thats what Aquaman provides.Honestly saying the storyline is pretty basic. There is not much in the writing section. Its very much like Fast and Furious films , having a basic plot and jumping from one location to another for one after another actions sequence not providing much when action is not happening. But we still love Fast and Furious films for its action and its gorgeous visual , and I loved Aquaman for the same.The imagination and World building is on some other level (Oscar for Best Visual Effect written all over it). Far far far better then Black Panther (with which it also had some storyline similarities). Watching this movie in 3D (which i did) and if possible in IMAX(which i unfortunately didn't) is the best possible way. Its so grand and gorgeous that it will take another whole review to just discuss about ATLANTIS.The action scenes ? They were HARD , i mean really really HARD. Another comparison to Fast and Furious movies. Every punch in the movie is like a Steel Punch, with Heart Pumping sound effects. U can feel the hurt that the person receiving the punch was feeling.Unfortunately the only technical department which disappointed me was the music. Its good in some parts but weird in some other parts. Never unique , some weird song choices , i mean who needs songs in Superhero movies , there 4-5 of them in this film. Which is shocking because its the same composer who did Wonder Woman , which had exceptionally good music.Them comes Jason Mamoa. Well he is a below average actor, but thats what we got. And he managed really well when tough scenes were not provided to them. He certainly looks the part and damn good in the action scenes. But that's it. And i am not complaining.In comparison Amber Heard acted really well. I always liked her acting but she has always been considered a B Grade average actress with alot of bad movies in her filmography. I hope this will changer that thinking. Nicole Kidman didn't get much to do , but got one really small yet great action scene.So its a step in the right direction for DCEU(a line many reviewers are saying because its true). Lets see what SHAZAM will have in its bag when it will release next year.8.1/10",Aquaman
360,BlueSkies765,A good popcorn movie,7,22 April 2019,"There's a fairly standard storyline but this movie is a winner because of the amazing waterworld. The underwater sound, the graphics, the culture and just the overall attention to detail.
It's really creative and a great experience. The fight scenes were also fun and the jokes were good. For a 2+ hour movie Aquaman managed to keep me engaged most of the time.Someone new to movies will be blown away but experienced moviegoers might not appreciate it for the storyline but can appreciate it for the aesthetically pleasing spectacle.A good popcorn movie.",Aquaman
361,trevorwomble,Overblown and overcomplicated but fun too,7,20 December 2018,"First the negatives. Aquaman has a ridiculously complicated script, is too long and full of plot holes. The film is, at times, visually derivative ripping off various better films like Thor Ragnarok, The Hobbit and The Matrix and is highly predictable. The CGI is also ridiculously over the top in places. Don't watch this if you are expecting anything original.Now the plus side, Jason Momoa is a piece of inspired casting, he has the look and charisma of the 'halfbreed' Atlantean. Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman give their characters some real gravitas and Dolph Lundgren is a natural fit for his role. The dialogue is occasionally clunky but having established actors like these deliver them does help make it not so obvious.I hope we see more of Jason Momoa in the role. He has a charm and lightness of touch that is welcome, much like Chris Hemsworth's Thor. I'd like to see more witty one liners as he delivers the few he has very well.Not a perfect film and Wonder Woman is still the DC high spot in terms of recent films but Aquaman delivers action and character even if there is still room for improvement. If there is to be a sequel I hope DC will improve on this decent first effort.",Aquaman
362,mitchell5954,The DCEU As It Always Should've Been,8,31 December 2018,"Aquaman is the latest entry in the DCEU movie list. I was excited, but nit extremely enthused about this film given the track record with the DCEU. However, I can now say I love this movie. This is now my favorite DCEU movie, even over Wonder Woman, and is now my second favorite film of 2018 behind Infinity War. This film hit every mark. It's not an overly deep or complex film, but it isn't trying to be. It set out to be an entertaining and outlandish comic book film, and it goes full throttle with it. It's essentially your average MCU movie, though I enjoyed this more than many of the recent Marvel films.The story is relatively simple. Arthur Curry/Aquaman is a half breed. His mother was a queen of Atlantis and his father is human. Now, his mother has disappeared and his brother, Orm/Ocean Master, the king of Atlantis is threatening to invade the surface. Now, it is up to him to challenge his brother to become the rightful king.The best word to describe Aquaman is spectacle. This film is a great visual and action spectacle. This is easily the best, most colorful looking DCEU movie to date. The action is a thrill and it never sops going. The film is almost two and a half hours, but it doesn't feel it like some of the other movies do. There were a couple pacing issues, but overall I was never bored watching this film.Unlike, Batman, Superman, or even Wonder Woman, I was never that big of a fan of Aquaman growing up. It wasn't until I read Geoff John's brilliant comic run in the DC New 52 that I really appreciated the character. Throne of Atlantis especially is one of my favorite stories in comics. This movie felt very much like an adaptation of that run, which isn't much of a surprise as Geoff Johns was also a writer for this film, and a producer.The cast is spectacular too. You have a cast of Jason Momoa, Patrick Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Dolph Lundgren, and Nicole Kidman. Jason Momoa especially did a fantastic job here. He was badass, funny, charming, and even charismatic. I was never sold on his version of Aquaman. His performance in Justice League didn't do much for me, but he killed it in this film. Seeing him the traditional Aquaman costume near the end was great, and it felt earned here, unlike in Man of Steel.Overall, Aquaman is a great superhero film, and just a fun movie all the way through. I can't really think of much wrong with this. Again, it isn't a masterpiece like the Dark Knight, but not every film needs to be like that. It set out to be an entertaining ride, with just enough heart to it, and it works. Even if you don't think Aquaman is cool, give this a watch anyway. You might change your mind.",Aquaman

Blast these superhero movies,2,23 April 2020,"Finally, we get a movie about Atlantis, something which has not really been done before--but sadly it was Aquaman. What can I even say? I shouldn't have expected more given it was a studio superhero movie but I honestly thought it would at least be visually interesting. If you thought it was I won't hold it against you, and it had at least some ambitions, but the CGI video game fight scenes, the lame, weird humor, and the verbal reference to the monstrosity called Justice League threw me off completely. Maybe when someone with directing skills and an actual story comes along...",Aquaman
366,bluepink,Aquaman isn't relateable,4,14 December 2018,"As a whole, I enjoyed the movie but I have some constructive criticism:1. I didn't feel a connection to Aquaman. The opening scene was great, but after that... he was quickly thrown into the position of trying to save the world, before we got to know and find out more about him as a person. e.g. what does he do on a daily basis? Some context would have built more connection, understanding and likeability of the character. The bar scene with his dad was great, and personally I think more of that would have been beneficial.2. Normally in a movie you have a clear idea of beginning, middle and end (even if they're following the comic book). Initially I had a clear understanding of what Aquaman's mission was, but too many things came in the way, and it was not re-established what Aquaman was doing. I think this is a key principle for really great movies.3. Some of it was cringy and cliché e.g. a perfect example is the kissing scene. We all knew they would get together in the end, and when they finally did, it was just an awkward scene and there was no chemistry (I'm not sure if this was due to the acting / script / directing).4. Lack of diversity - I'm not one to pipe up about diversity, but there were only 2 black characters who happened to be evil, and one of them had a questionable name. I get that it relates to the comic book, but because of the way it looks on camera, I would have suggested more diversity in other aspects of the movie to mitigate this.",Aquaman
367,WiseMan26,Overall High Quality Except The SFX,8,5 June 2019,"I dont like the special effect use in this films.why??? Because its sooo ecessive until you cannot differ between the ""live-action"" and ""animated"", it is indeed tooo muchh muchh sfx. God, i feel every scene in the movie too bright it hurts my eyes.

369,nitro72,Overlong Mixed Bag,5,4 January 2019,"Neither cool underwater effects nor Jason Mamoa's unbridled enthusiasm can save this flick; (at times) bad greenscreen, poorly timed/written exposition, crappy songs, pointless fight scenes, & too much plot drowns this overlong mixed bag.",Aquaman
370,sujith789_reviews,Good Watch - (7.7),8,23 March 2020,"Watched the movie through DVD.Actions and graphics are good.Story is good, but was little predictable. There is not a single moment where we get bored.Overall a good movie to watch from DC.",Aquaman
371,Dello_,Puddleman is surprisingly entertaining,5,27 May 2019,"Director James Wan intended this film to be an high level superhero movie, one who could re-establish DC status as far as movies. It can be seen by his camera movements, forcedly ingenious that felt like he wanted to show how good he is as a director. The problem is that this feeling is not received, with numerous scenes that were annoying to watch and one in particular where the camera is moving excessively fast where I felt a bit of nausea. The direction was not all bad, indeed at the beginning of the third act there is a really beautiful scene, that shows Wan's history in the horror genere.
Another bad aspect of this movie was the CGI. The underwater setting was way distant to seem a bit realistic, with a lot of light effects so artificial that were disturbing to watch in a 2019 movie.
Also the plot was not that good, very linear, with some plot holes but in the grand scheme of the film it could have been acceptable if not for a narrative pattern overused. There are like 5 or 6 scene where the screenwriters didn't know how to start the action and so they decided to interrupt the dialogue between two or more characters with an explosion. The first time is ok, the second time you can accept it but when the third happens before the 40 minutes mark it's not good. Also the lenght was a bit excessive like a half an hour could be speared.
But why didn't I give Aquaman a terrible rating (less than 5)? Because at the end of the day it is an enjoyable film, with some big big problems but that entertains. Yes you will probably feel that some things are not working but you won't leave the cinema in pain.
In the end Aquaman is formally a bad movie but it has the rare power of entertaining, obviously not on an high level but it's not a poor experience.",Aquaman
372,hfreinoso,It was just...... fine,7,16 November 2019,"The visuals in this movie was phenomenal, the CGI they use in this movie was up to the max in this film, I like Aquaman, but it wasn't great. I don't blame James Wan (He is one of my favorite directors) or Jason Momoa. The writers wrote something so basic, that I couldn't care less but the actions, the times when James Wan directs he puts his actions first and he has done so phenomenal in the film. But even he can't do it justice to much. The film was OK visually and action, and acting is was all good. this isn't James Wan best work but he did the best he can. The invasion is seen a bunch of times and we don't get to see other things other than Arthur Curray, we don't see to much Atlantis or Athlatians, we just see how much the visuals have done through. We only know the invasion of the world again. So basic. But still it was an OK film. 7/10",Aquaman
373,Mike_Noga,A Whale of a Tale!,7,28 January 2019,"Hahaha That was a pun. Or word play. Or something.Ooooookay, on to the business at hand. The Aquaman movie.I try to see every comic book movie that comes down the pike. I went into this one not expecting mush. The character came across as an obnoxious frat boy in the Justice League movie and I figured this one was just a showcase for Momoa and his pecs and tattoos. "" Pecs and Tats"" might have been a great title for the movie, I thought.Well was I pleasantly surprised. It was actually pretty entertaining. It was fun and had some nice bits of comedy and the action was good. The cinematography in real world settings, like the small village where Arthur first encounters Black Manta, was really good. and Momoa might not be a great actor but he did have good chemistry with all his co-stars.While it wasn't a great ,movie like say, LOGAN, it delivered fun and action and adventure, pretty much everything you could want out of a good, solid, comic book movie. As a matter of fact I liked it so much I saw it twice.",Aquaman
374,evan_harvey,All the rubbish we dump in the ocean...,4,20 January 2019,"... finally ended up in a movie.It's entertainment, so really, people are going to like all sorts of things. But this one was big, loud, colourful and not great (to me).Everyone is commenting on how Jason Momoa is having fun. I'd be having fun too if I was paid a couple of million $ to basically do nothing. Plus, when the film is a bad as Aqauman, what else was he going to do?Aquaman probably worked as a comic but on the big screen, no so much. The story is okay, but drowns in the ludicrousness of being, you know, underwater. The film drowns in CGI. There's lasers underwater, armour underwater, flying around underwater - you get the idea. Admittedly, what else could you do with a character as lame as Arthur Curry? At least James Wan had a go at it. He failed, but whatever. It made a billion $, so he wins and the rest of humanity pays the price.I think that it proves that CGI wins the kiddies over every time, regardless of how lame the story is, or even how lame the premise of the film is. Without the CGI, this film would still suck, it just wouldn't look as good.The acting is okay, if the acting equivalent of watching wet fish are your thing. These days in films like this, you don't really need to act. You just stand there. You may have to jump around a bit, but that's all. The 'acting' part is not really required.The story is bleached like today's coral, lifeless and cliched.The CGI is numbing, like your eyeballs getting slapped with a million tiny wet fishes.I'm sick over CGI, over-hyped comic book hero movies. Every Marvel film is the same. DC are at least different: they eschew even the semblance of story for bloated CGI.Hey, I mean, I paid to go and see it too. But the difference is that I regret it.",Aquaman
375,TheGreatMarkukini,A drop of water that can restore faith in a bright future,7,3 April 2019,"For a long time DC has produced movies that are quite enjoyable, deliver stable intake of action but don't dwell too hard on the scenario. Kind of a quick bite to fight the hunger before the feast that is cooking behind the kitchen door. After giving the trailer a look I thought 'Aquaman' was going to be a bit different and has a potential to stir that stiff dark matter that we call a universe.Fairly enough we can call it an origin story but the character has been on our radar before, which means that the basic knowledge is there and we don't need a fundamental course. I really like Arthur simply because he is down-to-earth guy: not nerdy as Barry Allen, not pompous as Bruce Wayne, not inconspicuous as Clark Kent, kind of like Diana Prince but male and for sure not metal as Victor Stone.Will not hide anything from you by saying that in the end the plot as usual goes down the drain and as always, we can observe some particles of good ideas getting stuck on the exit. 2h23m was the amount of actual time, although if we take out all the slow motion and sugaring of viewers' eyes with abnormal amount of visuals we are left with a common 1h30m or even less.The most confusing and disgusting point of the movie was the build-up of the villain that has never been finished, which can only mean the path for a sequel, and on this the curse of abruptly cut stories continues. A lot of actions that should have borne major consequences were just forgotten and walked on by like a beggar on the street.You know what they say: each Hollywood project has two wolves - Visuals and Story, the one that you feed most eats another - here we have the first one already gnawing the latter but the poor thing has a few breaths left. Going back to the conclusions I would say that Jason Momoa has been training all his life and is worthy wielding the Trident, however, as the rule says - if it's not planned as a one-man movie then it cannot be carried like that. I hope DC will understand it and put a little bit more effort next time.",Aquaman
376,Jini-B,Better Than Expected!,6,16 March 2020,"This was definitely an improvement on the DCEU movies. I enjoyed it much more than the recent movies based in this universe. First, the pros- the visual effects are aesthetic and absolutely stunning. The action scenes are also great, and the amount of CGI work on this actually shows. It looks really good. Jason Momoa is also a big asset in this film, because, to be honest, he makes Aquaman cool. Aquaman hasn't been one of the most-liked superheroes in popular media, and many have previously made fun of the character. But, Momoa here really flips the script. The way he carries himself in the film has really changed the way I look at Aquaman, and I'm sure he has done the same for others too.The supporting cast were good, and I liked Nicole Kidman's portrayal as Queen Atlanna. Patrick Wilson was also good in his role as the antagonist.Moving on to the cons, I thought the script was a little weak. It seemed like a rehashed plot and was very similar to other superhero origin stories and a little cliched too. I especially thought the movie was awkward at times. Without going into spoiler area, I thought some moments didn't make much sense. Black Manta also was not so well-used here. I wish we could have seen a little more of him. I am expecting better for the sequel as this movie really makes me want to get into the DCEU. This was fairly good; one extra star for the CGI effects, which were very well done.",Aquaman

This movie also remarks that James Wan could produce a very good action packed superhero movie. This is a really sexy movie with bold characters beautifully built to make us want to live in the ocean. The plots are combination with gentle romance of love, origin of superhero Aquaman, the appearance of politics under the water kingdoms, and also some real footages about global warming. In this globalization world, perhaps humankind just felt guilty about what happened in our oceans, but here the main idea is how far a population could defend the existence of their kingdom and how much the power to have peace than to do war. Peace and war is finally seen in the actions of Aquaman, as the master of ocean, King of Atlantis, and the peacemaker of Earth and the Sea. Aquaman never denied his hidden identity, but at the same time, he felt guilty as the death of his mother. On the other side, his half-brother doesn't want to approve Aquaman as his family. Family conflict then becomes international issue with the timing of global warming against the existence of the ocean kingdoms, credited by profitable scientists who argue and debate for the myth of Atlantis itself. Atlantis is protected by the Trisula and the appearance of Trisula many times. Trisula is also the symbol of Aquaman. Triangle form of Trisula is somehow a perfection, balance, and solid ground theory to do more and more to be the best and unbeatable foundation of life's aspects. To support the main story, we are being told the Aquaman insight in his ""Trisula"" stages; in child times, growing up, and being mature that all directed us to his identity to be himself, but by scarifying some of his ego in land base to be united with sea base, being defeated, then cameback, and tried to be peace maker. The beautiful editing finalization, professional special effects, cool back sounds, and soft developing characters make us believe that ocean has a more beautiful underwater kingdom, than the bad political condition above (on the Earth). All details are so real. This movie will stay for a very long time in our heart and make us want to live in the ocean.",Aquaman
378,Brevin_Campbell,A fun generic blockbuster,7,1 January 2019,"For a decent while now the DCEU has been subject to controversy with the only movie being loved by both fans and critics to be Wonder Woman. Beyond that each film has had some sort of issue in the filming process before its initial release. Rather that be Suicide Squad with all of the Joker scenes being cut or Justice League with its infamous Superman mustache issue. All of these factors and more led to these films getting poor reception from critics and a few fans. So going into Aquaman there were many who were very skeptical.However with James Wan at the helm I had little worry. The man was known for making films that were commercially viable. The Conjuring 2 film made 320 million dollars on a 40 million dollar budget. Saw made 103 million on a meager 1.2 million dollar budget, and Furious 7 made over a billion dollars on its big budget 200 million dollar production cost. So there was little doubt that the film would do well. As far as quality Wan usually churns out quality work. His Saw series is beloved by many fans, his Conjuring work had been exceptional, and Insidious while not as beloved as Saw is also its own franchise. So I was pretty optimistic on him taking on the visual spectacle that was ""Man who can talk to fish: The Movie.""In regards to visual effects the movie isn't all that spectacular. There were areas that I found to be very clunky. Mera from a purely special effects standpoint never looked real, there were a lot of water effects that looked fake. The designs of the home where Aquaman lived were nice looking, but still needed a bit more rendering to be done. The fight scenes I will admit are pretty bad ass. Every fight seemed to find a way to surprise me. The ones underwater seemed to impress me the most with their visual flares.Jason Momoa also bolstered a lot of confidence and charisma in the role. His flirtatious attitude with Mera and his audacious approach to to his brother always put a smile on my face. He was defiantly perfectly cast in the role of a superhero.Additionally the film tends to be very funny. It always knew how to make you feel good when you watched. There was a lot of great chemistry between Aquaman and other character that allowed for some really enjoyable sequence that made me grin from ear to ear. It was just a good, upbeat, and fun experience at the movies.But my favorite aspect of the film was Black Manta. He was a marvelous villain. From start to finish he always kept me interested in the pain he was feeling at the loss of his father and how Aquaman chose not to save him. This anger fuels the antagonist and pushes him to vengeance. This desire makes the audience feel sympathetic to his plight and his desire for revenge.King Orm wasn't nearly as compelling, but I did like his character. He was more your standard bad guy who wanted to become king for his own selfish reasons and hated the people on the surface. There is a part of me that wishes this was two movies instead of just one. Perhaps then King Orm would be a little bit more three dimensional than he turned out to be.I really loved Aquaman and Mera's relationship. It was really sweet and funny. Jason played it more in the tone of him seeing her as a sexy catch and she was the sassy redhead who wanted him just as badly, and when looking at it through those eyes then they really work well for each other.Overall though there isn't really anything surprising here. It pretty standard superhero stuff. There a big awesome fight at the end of the movie that was cool to see. Mera and Aquaman have a overly dramatic kiss, and the movie ends with Aquaman giving a hopeful monologue to the future. So it was good.",Aquaman
379,SimonD1900,The most ridicolous movie I've seen in a loong time. NOT in a good way!,2,3 November 2019,"It was so bad it actually made me pissed off over how bad it was, and I rarely get angry at movies even when there not so great.The plot sucks and how the events unfold is like the diractor followed some manual of Hollywood's 80-90s adventure/action flicks. And the acting is uninspired with uninteresting character that gives you nothing worth to remember. And it's stupid.Well to be honest, Momoa had some moments that were alright. And Temuera Morrison is always fantastic, here no exception, but he has like two scenes? Best parts of the movie anyway!
Kidman is good and have been in som great movies, but here, her character could have been played by anyone. Also Dafoe is good actor, but the character here, it doesn't matter could have been anyone. It's hilarious to see Lundgrens face in a movie, just beacuse, but here it didn't matter, not enough to save the movie by a long shot. The rest I don't even remember. And I saw it 30min ago.People talking about the cgi scenes? Attack of the Clones had far better cgi scenes then this.

But it's literally just 2 hours of world building and CGI. It's boring. This is certainly one of the better DCEU movies in recent years, as it isn't as ridiculous as BVS and it isn't a broken dumpster fire like Suicide Squad, but at the same time, if the best DC has managed to do in recent years is this and Wonder Woman, which was only decent, then I don't think this cinematic universe thing is gonna take off. I get that quite a few people like this movie and in the end that's fine, but this movie made me incredibly bored by the half way point. And this movie tries to be retro a lot and while I appreciate the effort, it just came off as jarring.It's an average movie with glimmers of a great one throughout, but they're only that.

385,margulanabutrlov,Aquaman Review,9,22 March 2019,"Arthur Curry's (Jason Momoa) parents are a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison) and Atlantean queen (Nicole Kidman). When a war between the subsurface world of Atlantis and its ruler Orm (Patrick Wilson) threatens the human world, Curry must confront his past to save the day.
Imagine if someone cut together all the biggest action sequences from the last few decades of Hollywood, resulting in a mash of Tron, Avatar, Clash Of The Titans, Superman, Jurassic Park, and Gladiator. Imagine a film where an octopus gets a drum solo, and it isn't among the top ten weirdest moments. Welcome to Aquaman, where you won't have a clue what's going on, but you won't be able to look away either.
Our lead is Aquaman/Arthur Curry, a portrait of the superhero as bar-brawler. This sometime Justice Leaguer (it's barely mentioned) is larger than life and twice as fond of a beer. Arthur gives the impression Momoa just rolled out of bed, went surfing and drove from the beach straight to set, and the film's all the better for his slightly hungover air. But instead we cut away to endless Atlantean politicking, with Patrick Wilson's CGI-suited Orm floating around on a war-shark (which is a thing?), working on his Julian Sands impression. Orm wants a war with humanity, so executes a false-flag submarine attack. That might lead another hero on a film-long quest to prove humanity's innocence, but here it's barely mentioned again; nor is a first-act tsunami felt around the world. There are bigger, er, fish to fry.
Instead we're on two parallel but equally bonkers quests. Orm must unite his kingdom of Atlantis with Dolph Lundgren's seahorse riders, Djimon Hounsou's mer-men and John Rhys-Davies' crab dudes. Meanwhile, Arthur must escape a place, and decipher a thing to find another thing in order to earn the throne and stop the war. His primarily human upbringing means he's a fish out of water whenever he's in the water, following the long-ago disappearance of his mother Atlanna (Nicole Kidman). For guidance and a modicum of sense Arthur relies entirely on Amber Heard's Mera, a Little Mermaid cosplayer who is his main source of exposition.
The plot is honestly a mess: over-complicated yet predictable. What makes the film passably entertaining is that director James Wan throws astonishing amounts of action at the wall, and much of it sticks (though not always together). There's entertainment in watching something so outrageously over-the-top, exploding in such strange ways. Just when you think you have a handle on it, something bizarre will happen. Nicole Kidman defending her baby son by taking out a death squad, say, or villain Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, underserved) inexplicably detouring to the North Sea (the film's geography is deeply non-specific), or a Star Wars-alike battle on the seabed.
Momoa takes every inch of space the film gives him and runs a mile on sheer roguish charm, and Wan is a sufficiently gifted action director not just to keep you watching but to regularly dazzle you. But it's all just so much. You sense that they didn't trust this hero to hold our attention, and they really should have done. He's more fun than any octopoid percussionist.",Aquaman
386,ajzeg,Loved it.,9,15 September 2019,"I'm going to say right away that I hate the DC Extended Universe. Out of the movies I've seen from the series, Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad, and Justice League, I have not liked a single one of them. In fact, they just might be up there with the worst movies I have ever seen. However, (I can't believe I'm saying this) I really enjoyed Aquaman. Yeah. The movies starring some of the most iconic and beloved DC characters? Hated them. The movie based on arguably the stupidest DC character that is pretty much only popular because he's seen as a joke? I really liked it! It had fun action, a brisk pace that took you all over the place, a light tone that didn't take itself too seriously, enjoyable characters to go on an adventure with, and breathtakingly beautiful colours. Imagine that, a DC movie that's bright and colourful! I'm a sucker for neon and bioluminescence especially (Avatar, Tron Legacy, and Blade Runner are some of my favourite movies for that aspect alone), and this movie has a lot of that! Some of the CGI looked a little phoney at times, almost like a video game cutscene, but that just added to the charm in my opinion. Another thing I really appreciated was the fact that it was a stand-alone film with little to no connection to the other movies. There's a loose connection to Wonder Woman and a reference to Justice League, but that's it. This is the kind of movie they should've been making for the DCEU from the beginning, I'm glad that they seem to be going in this lighter, more fun direction rather than the dark, convoluted Zack Snyder stuff. I highly recommend this movie if you just want to have a good time. It's The Little Mermaid meets Indiana Jones meets Black Panther featuring battle sharks, crab people, and dinosaurs! Doesn't that sound awesome? If it does, you'll like this movie a lot, I think! I'm gonna go watch Wonder Woman and Shazam now. Maybe I do like the DCEU after all!",Aquaman

391,Benslie,A surprisingly good movie,9,23 December 2018,"First of all, the actors did great jobs as their characters. One that shocked me the most was Jason Momoa. I honestly thought I wasn't going to like him as Aquaman but I did. He had some funny lines that made me laugh and he also came across as a guy who honestly didn't want to be king. This film has a lot of underwater scenes which means that they're going to need great visual effects and they did. Every time you see Atlantis it makes you feel like you're there with those characters. It kind of reminded me of Avatar with how the visuals looked. The musical score, which was composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams, helped intensify every scene. The music matched each scene perfectly. My only complaint about the music was the song ""Ocean to Ocean"" which is a hilariously bad version of ""Africa"" by Toto. I'm just thankful it only played for a few seconds in the movie. All of the action in this film is well choreographed and well shot. Every scene where people are fighting you can clearly see everything that's happening in that scene. There was not a lot of camera angle changes and when there were they were to keep somebody in focus and to show what they were doing. James Wan directs this film and he's mainly known for horror movies, and there are elements of that in here, but he makes it clear he can direct anything and make it great. The main villain Orm is a great villain and is well portrayed by Patrick Wilson but I wish they gave him more of a reason for hating the surface world. I wish they did his training scenes before they showed him as an adult. This way you would know how he got to be this comfortable with his powers. There is an end credit scene that gives a hint to a possible storyline for the possible sequel. In the end, Aquaman was a surprisingly good movie. Hopefully, DC continues with stuff like this because then maybe they will be able to challenge Marvel.",Aquaman

Ignore the haters! Ten out of Ten!Here is a real review,.This is a CGI overblown, loud, badly written, badly directed and with a few exceptions, badly acted movie.The hero of the film was better off in Game of Thrones where he just needed to look mean most of the time, and flex his muscles.William Defoe is badly miscast, the story is confusing, there are many, many locations, and there are three seperate bad guys. It is a terrible mish mash and a shining example of why, if you write the script, you shouldn't also direct it!At the start of the movie I thought I was going to enjoy what looked like an over the top, humourous paradoy. Then I realised they weren't joking.Because I was given no interest in what happened to the characters I found the countless fights and battles boring. I spent most of the movie closing my eyes and listening to the sound effects. At times I was lucky enough to fall asleep, which made this way too long film, feel slightly shorter.At this movie I had my first Choc Ice in many years. An ice cream that can't be beat. It is made to a consistent formulae.

396,HanShotFirstGR,"Best DCEU movie, stop judging it for not doing things it actually didn't promise to do!",8,26 December 2020,"Plot:Arthur Curry, the human-born heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, goes on a quest to prevent a war between the worlds of ocean and land.Analysis:After the major success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, DC didn't seem able to compete at all, even Wonder Woman who had been somewhat good was nowhere near what Marvel could easily do. Aquaman was the first step of DCEU for something new, the acceptance of the comic book cheesiness, and it nailed it. Way funnier and easier to watch than most of today's superhero films, this one didn't aim for a deep philosophical plot or something too risky, instead the creators decided to do a very funny adventure that follows the exact same pattern as comic books and chose James Wan to deliver this feeling. With all of these elements and the great talent of the badass Jason Momoa, they took the least interesting super hero in DC comic books and made the best movie in this universe.Cinema beyond a form of art is also a form of entertainment, people need movies that are not deep and don't need too much thought, some movies should be easily digested, fast paced, adventure films to have a nice time and relax, Aquaman does exactly that, it embraces the whole childish cheesy theme of early 20th centure comic books and gives the viewer one of the most entertaining experiences of the year. It's cheap entertainment and for sure it's no match on terms of quality for some other hits of the genre like Thor: Ragnarok or Guardians of the Galaxy (movies which share the same pattern), but it is way cooler than many other good movies. The key to success isn't always a serious dark themed movie and the funny, cheesy Aquaman was a much nicer experience than all of those dark DCEU failures.The main reason is of course the great production. It's such a gorgeous film to look at, cinematography is quite impressive and totally captures the appropriate feeling, the costumes, the cgi, everything has been done perfectly and the movie already looks promising. After that, it's the amazing vision of James Wan, a talented man capable of creating a really interesting image to highlight all the good parts of a film. His experience on hit movies (mostly horror ones) gave him enough confidence to not rely on other creators' styles but to use his personal vision and generate a more personal theme for this movie. His amazing combat style that looks terrific, the use of color and water to give this one a fairytale geeky look and the cheesy feeling that is completely justified in a movie about a man who can talk to fish, Wan gave the audience a beautiful adventurous experience without listening to film snobs and pretentious viewers who can't just enjoy a fun movie.The other major reason of this successful result was the casting choise on the main character because Jason Momoa is the best thing happened to DC after Nolan's trilogy. His badass looks and behaviour gives Arthur a more anthemic and mythological feeling, he kinda feels like a young Poseidon, the greek god of the seas, he is terrifying to look at, he is skillful and can be a big threat to his oppenents, the perfect style that redefines a silly character and makes him more iconic and more awesome. It's true that this casting was a big comic book inaccuracy, but it's one of those rare cases that the artistic choice of a production team is actually improving the character, it's a great choice and a great actor that was excellent in this movie and definetely deserves at least a sequel. The rest of the cast was pretty good, from Amber Heard as Mera, to a very classic style of a comic book villain like Patrick Wilson's Orm and a great William Dafoe in the role of Arthur's mentor Vulko.The plot is kinda the one thing that doesn't impress at all. It's a classic villain plan, the promise of a war with humans gives a cartoonish and silly atmosphere and adds a lot to this film's cheesiness. The story is very fast paced so you don't have to try a lot to pay attention, it's one part classic fish out of water story and one part treasure hunt, it does nothing too meaningful, just quick steps towards the last act with an adventurous feeling that keeps you entetained and invested despite the lack of fresh ideas or deep thought in the whole story. Some movies just don't need a serious and complicated story, but a simple, funny and more straight forward one to produce a very enjoyable result.It's about time for some viewers to stop asking only for complicated movies. Simplicity isn't bad when it's done correctly and a movie that leaves you satisfied and entertained doesn't need this kind of overthinking, it won your attention, it gave you a nice time, so it's a very good experience that doesn't need to be measured by standard movie review elements on how good it is.Conclusion:Aquaman is the perfect film to make you embrace the cheesy form of entertainment, it's over the top, it's pretty-looking, it's fast paced, it's badass and leaves you entertained. Movies shouldn't be judged by the same standards when they don't have the same goal and this one definetely lived up to its promises so I will not hesitate to say it's a very good movie and a must-watch for an entertaining, relaxing experience without much thinking.Rating: 8/10",Aquaman
397,antoniokowatsch,Aquaman just saved the DC cinematic universe.,10,13 December 2018,"Wow, just wow. I'm totally blown away by this movie. Everything was done just right. The pacing was overall fast but did leave enough room for some quality character development every now and then. Aquaman's two arch nemeses (Ocean Master and Black Manta) were properly introduced so that new audiences got the opportunity to get a good idea of why they antagonize Aquaman.
Overall, the movie explored three main themes; revenge, redemption, and forgiveness (in that particular order). I think it was done rather well.
Aquaman used to be the butt of many jokes in the past. He was widely regarded as the ""lamest"" super hero but with this movie they managed to totally re-brand Aquaman's bad image. This can mostly be attributed to the strong cast and good script. I, for one, was very happy to see that Willem Dafoe was cast for movie. I'm still secretly hoping that he'll play the Joker in an upcoming Batman movie but that's another topic for another time.
Towards the end the movie reached Star Wars levels of epicness. And I'm not talking about the new Star Wars movies.The film score was rather modern and had plenty of synthwave elements. I'm a huge fan of these types of orchestral-fusion scores.
Aesthetics-wise the movie had a very futuristic vibe; Atlantean guards who kind of looked like Storm Troopers, and the bright neon lights that illuminated Atlantis. It was very reminiscent of the first Blade Runner movie in that regard.As a long-time DC fan I'm really happy with the movie. I have collected comics for over a decade from both, Marvel and DC. But truth be told; aside from the Batman movies DC had really produced mostly unwatchable movies lately while Marvel was pushing out one good movie after another. Now that I've seen Aquaman I remain hopeful that DC might turn it around and get their act together.p.s.
I don't know why the ""professional"" critics hated this movie. But I can tell you this much; don't trust the metascore. It's bogus. This is one of the most epic super hero movies. Totally recommended.",Aquaman
398,jackson_ro,Aquaman,7,2 January 2019,"I think Wan's Aquaman portrays the character and stays loyal to the story as well as it can. It's impressive how they were able to bring all those fantastical battle scenes and underground scenes to the big screen with modern technology, a true dream come true for comic book fans. The story is a great standalone movie but doesn't feel like it serves any greater purpose like those Marvel films, I guess for both better and for worse. Also unlike Marvel movies or previous DC films, I think the movie finds a good balance between being dark/deep and comical. The build-up is a little long, but the content within doesn't feel like filler and makes the world of Atlantis more interesting, it's impressive how so many integral elements of the film was integrated. The biggest problem with the film are the dialogues. They are painfully simplistic and uninspiring to the point where it feels awkward, someone needs to tell the writers that writing movie lines are not the same as writing comic dialogues!",Aquaman
399,thisseatofmars,"Aquaman is in the same class of Excalibur, Lord of the Rings, Conan, and Highlander.",9,24 December 2018,"When you hear ""comic book movie"" you probably think of Disney/Marvel (D/M) because of all of the D/M movies out there. Let's face it though, D/M have definitely developed a formula to making their movies, which isn't good, because movie formulas make movies samey. It is a successful formula, to be sure: D/M have made, what, 20 movies? But this kind of formulaic approach will kill the comic book movie. Perhaps part of the success of 2018's ""Venom"" is how it broke from the mould by being its own weird and wonderful entity. ""Aquaman"" goes further still: Aquaman does not just break this mould, it *shatters* it. Aquaman is an excellent film, one of the best fantasy films I've seen, and highly worth your time. It is not formulaic, it is not a filler movie until the next crossover: it actually helps reinvigorate the term ""comic book movie"" and succeeds on nearly every level.The plot is classic fantasy: there is a rightful heir to the throne, an evil dictator, a princess, and magic, all set through the lens of the sea. Instead of swords and sorcery you have tridents and Atlantean technology. It is familiar but different, thanks to the underwater aesthetic and how the movie treats its lore. It is not constantly patronizing us with stupid jokes or nods that break immersion like Marvel and Deadpool movies, nor does it take itself too seriously like the Dark Knight movies. Perhaps that should be the distinction between DC and Marvel: DC adheres to its lore more closely, and in doing so benefits from greater immersion.The leads, Aquaman and Mera, have chemistry together but neither are fantastic actors. But they are earnest and look their parts, and there is so much wonderful content to this movie that when they fumble a line or a moment it is of little consequence. The movie is also quite long, but that is a nitpick: you can't hurry epic fantasy.It is fitting that the characters call Aquaman ""King Arthur"" at the end of the movie. Aquaman is in the same class of Excalibur, Lord of the Rings, Conan, and Highlander.",Aquaman
400,ryanwinning1,Aquaman was far better than I thought it would be,8,26 January 2019,"Aquaman exceeded my expectations in every way. This is the type of superhero story that I've seen directors in the past get over confident in, and simply tell the story. It appears the director James Wan has seen that far too often and really got creative on how to keep the viewer engaged beyond just the CGI.
The story within the story is how a man who was raised on land, but the powers to live under the sea adapts to living in the abyss for longer than he has before. Some of my favourite moments are when Mera/Amber Heard is adapting to life on the surface, and her acting indicates that she's enjoying her experience on land more than she thought she would.
James Wan has all sorts of little plot twists that helped keep me engaged throughout the whole movie. I would like to see more of that style in the upcoming DC films.
The acting is just OK for me in this film and that's why I didn't score it a 9 or a 10. No one really steals the show, and Jason Momoa has a tough rugged image, but I haven't seen anything from him that would suggests there is an Oscar in his future.
This is a movie you can just sit back and let it entertain you for 2 hours+. I highly recommend the film and I believe this is a cut above the rest of the DC movies I have seen to date other than the Nolan movies.",Aquaman
401,amarshoaib,DC on track finally,8,11 August 2020,"It's packed with high action & delivers a simple yet well-told story.

It's not perfect but for DC, it's a step in the right direction",Aquaman
402,andrewmerritt-31652,They managed to turn a worthless superhero into a decent movie,7,4 November 2019,"Aquaman stars Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, and Patrick Wilson. Aquaman is how the story of how Aquaman became the king of Atlantis. I was never a big fan of Aquaman because he talks to fish and that's not really a superpower and he's the useless superhero in the D.C. universe. But D.C. had an idea to give Aquaman a makeover and make a movie where audiences around the world could respect him. I didn't think it was possible, but they did that and I was wrong. After seeing Jason Momoa's performance as Aquaman, my opinion on Aquaman is changed and he did a fantastic job. I could see that he wanted to take the role seriously and bring an Aquaman to life that we've never seen before. There was a show called Entourage and one of the seasons involved Vincent Chase as Aquaman. So when I watch Jason Momoa's portrayal of Aquaman compared to the fictionalized portrayal of Vincent Chase's Aquaman I believe that Jason Momoa would blow Vincent Chase out of the water. I wonder if the Entourage Aquaman was released how would they have stuck with this plot that I saw now or come up with a different one? We'll never know, but I would like to think that what I just watch would be what they had in mind. I felt a slight beacon of hope for the D.C. universe cause I see that they're trying to do, but the movie does have its problems. The problem that I found was the villains and how they chose to handle them. We have Oceanmaster who is the main villain and then we have Black Manta. When they first mentioned Black Manta I was excited because I remember him from the Challenge of the Super Friends and how I always wanted to see him on the big screen. And we finally have him, but unfortunately he has little screen time and I was disappointed because I was hoping for him to be the main villain and not Oceanmaster. Also we don't see much of Atlantis at all. We see Atlantis, but not very much that we don't get to explore enough of Atlantis to enjoy. The director of Aquaman is James Wan who directed Furious 7 who I thought was a great choice of a director as the action sequences are very well choreographed that even if I found the movie to be average it does make up for its action scenes. So overall, D.C. is on the right track with a movie that has problems here and there, but I found that they did a great job in turning the worst superhero into something fantastic.",Aquaman

404,RJBrez,DC is finally getting it,8,31 December 2018,"Thankfully, finally, DC comes through in a big big way. What a beautiful, well written movie. The best part? Zak Snyder is nowhere near this project. The soundtrack, cinematography, and cast worked so well together. I believe it also helped that this origin story hasn't been told that often. I was beyond impressed. I think I only caught one mention of the monstrosity that was Justice League and once this movie was tied to that universe they made the right decision and steered clear. Seeing this movie done so well, it made me wonder what could have been for the DCEU had they been smart about things and you know actually built their universe from the ground up with movies like this. Either way, it looks like things are finally looking up if they can continue to make movies like this. Give it a try! 8/10

Visually, it's stunning and once you get the idea, fun to watch.Shakespeare it ain't, but somehow the movie manages to make it all work. The dialog is cheesy and many interactions are camp. I mean what other superhero movie can you think of that tries to make us feel something for a bad guy that just killed a bunch of innocent people? Okay, maybe Loki. But in the same scene? Or one that has an endless kiss that takes place in lieu of the hero stopping the carnage of a major battle? That latter was a bit much for me, but hey...Obviously, the movie doesn't want you to take anything too seriously, so don't. Just sit back and enjoy a nearly endless stream of fascinating visuals and action sequences, and the off-kilter approach.

I got up out of the theater to just take a breath of fresh air this was so bad. I only stayed because my ride was in movie.
First the main actor is not much with words so not sure why they make him do comedy. The story you don't even understand, especially the underwater people. The one villain is just killed off with pretty good ease in middle of film. The connection between main characters doesn't match.
This is just bad DC writing, hire some Marvel people please before doing another. Or at least make sure Wonder Woman is involved since she's the only decent movie to come from DC in a while.",Aquaman
408,arod_85,Utter ridiculousness,6,27 December 2020,"Gosh, I miss the days of Christopher Nolan's Batman which took a realistic approach to superheroes. However, Marvel has done a fairly good job with making comics come to life. DC is failing in every aspect with the latest super hero movies. I understand it is much more difficult to make a man who commands the sea more ""realistic"" than it is a billionaire with a vendetta, but this movie was flat out ridiculous. I literally laughed out loud when one of the guys showed up riding a shark like a horse. Even "" The Boys"" had much better execution of the Deep which is somewhat of a parody of Aquaman. The villains were just as stupid. The casting was also horrible. Jason Mamoa did a decent job as Aquaman and the man who played his father was believable, but everyone else was poorly casted. Kidman did not fit the roll of Mamoa's mother, the brother was a joke, Manta was a benign villain, and the worst of all was Amber Heard. Heard (though I don't like her because of her recent abuse debacle, I'll give my unbiased opinion) is a horrible actress. She is undeniably beautiful, but I could not take her character seriously. The movie made her character look like Ariel from the Little Mermaid underwent combat training. She didn't have chemistry with Mamoa. I usually love superhero movies but with this one, I asked my husband twice if he wanted to leave the theater. We finished it because we paid for it, but staying is still a regret of mine...",Aquaman

I went into this knowing nothing about Aquaman and the explanation of the backstory was well done and not overly long.All in all a pleasant surprise.Very very high production standards.P.S. Amber Heard looks very good wet
P.P.S so does Nicole Kidman",Aquaman

This is a movie that should not be watched unless you can rock at the very minimum 1080. Definitely should be watched in 4K. The amount of work the CGI department did in fulfilling the Director's dream deserves to be watched properly to see how truly amazing and beautiful this film is.

413,alanhowden-86367,"Looks nice, shame about the story/acting",2,5 April 2021,"I was curious how they would make a film look that was mostly set under water and I was pleasantly surprised- I think they pulled it off pretty well and generally the film looks good if obviously very CGI heavy.The story is about a king who wants to save his people from the evil surface-dwellers who are destroying the oceans but is betrayed by his betrothed and his most trusted advisor who are both plot to put his illegitimate, idiot brother on the throne.But seriously, the story is predictable and boring. We already know Aquaman is going to win in the end so can't he do something less cliched than search for a mystical macguffin (in this case a trident) that only he can use to defeat the bad guy along the way?And how exactly is Aquaman going to be a good king, he is written as a lazy moron. Putting him in charge of all the underwater kingdoms hardly seems ideal.Jason Momoa is very handsome but his acting was terrible. Amber Heard was just annoying though Patrick Wilson was surprisingly good as the villain.I actually didn't watch the last half hour, I just couldn't bear it anymore. So maybe the film gets much better in this final bit, but unless it introduces an entirely new cast of characters doing something completely different I seriously doubt it.",Aquaman
414,Nomad007,Weakest part of the rebooted DC universe.,6,6 March 2019,I have to think the movie was just the wrong vechcile for Aquaman. I enjoyed his character in Justice league but it just doesn't work here.,Aquaman
415,Kirollos-Noah,#02 of the top 10 movies of 2018! (In my opinion),8,24 January 2019,"Aquaman was the most anticipated movie of 2018, I was so scared to be bad or disappointing, and fortunately it wasn't, in fact it was great, not perfect but still amazing.. so it's time to talk to u, guys about this amazing movie, so let's get into it!Aquaman is directed by James Wan, his very first superhero movie, screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall, and starring Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson and Nicole Kidman.
Story by Geoff Johns, James Wan and will Beall... The film reveals the origin story of half-human, half-Atlantean Arthur Curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetime--one that will not only force him to face who he really is, but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be a king.This review will be spoiler-free, because I don't want to ruin this movie to you, guys...
I really don't know where to start, guys... Let's start with the direction.. James Wan's first superhero movie as its director is Aquaman, so I was concerned to see him failing, because we're used to see him mostly in horror movie like The Conjuring Universe, Saw and Insidious.. so yeah I didn't expect him to make a great job with the direction, in fact I was blown away of his amazing job with this movie, especially with the action scenes, he made every single scene epic, and breathtaking, thanks also goes to the crew of the CGI which I'm gonna talk about later on. James Wan did some mistakes with the direction as I predicted when I first heard that he will direct this movie, he actually tried to make some jump-scares in this movie, for no reason I don't get why.. let me tell you how... Most of the NORMAL scenes, when people are talking or doing anything but fighting, especially when they are in a house or somewhere closed, they always ended with someone exploding the wall or anything unexpectedly just like horror movies, and that's what I was afraid of! That's my only issue with the direction.Let's move to the flawless CGI!!!! Every scene of the underwater world was was well made, by the CGI and the direction as I said above, it's amazing.. I can't find any proper word to say about it.. it was fascinating, i was super-entertained by how well done the CGI of this movie is!! They weren't afraid of making that much of Atlantis, like Godzilla did, I don't want to compare movies, but Godzilla was too afraid to make that much of scenes of him, but Aquaman took that risk and they nailed it!Also the performances were very talented by everyone, Jason Momoa is amazing as Aquaman as he was in Justice League, and maybe more! Amber Heard is badass as Mera... Patrick Wilson is an amazing villain and I loved him as King Orm and I can't wait to see him again in other DC movies!Let's move to my biggest flaw of this movie, and it's a random choice.. I don't know but this might have some spoiler for you... There's a scene when Aquaman and Mera were fighting CREATURES in a boat, and in this scene Arthur AKA Aquaman said a very random line, that these creatures are from the bottom of the sea so they fear the light, so he opens a random box to find a LIGHT SOURCE and he scares the creatures with it... This scene was so random, the line of Aquaman can be forgiven, but the random choice can't be!
I tried to make it spoiler-free as I could and I highlighted some keywords, which who watched the movie will understand what I'm talking about.So for those who want to know if Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse is better than Aquaman or not, my opinion is yeah, it's better than Aquaman, but it also depends on what you want to see, if you wanna see an epic, old fashioned way superhero movie, so Aquaman is your movie, but if you wanna see a surprising and with a very powerful story, so Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse is your movie. Anyways I really loved Aquaman and I'm gonna give it an A!Alright, guys, and thanks for reading my review, and if you liked it, you can click on my name up above to see all of my reviews. Look forward for my up coming reviews...",Aquaman
416,borismk-38942,The most overrated generic superhero film you'll ever see,4,6 January 2019,"I don't know where the hype for this film comes from, because it can't be from the content. The dialogue and characters in this movie are often ridiculous in the least entertaining way possible. Silly can be entertaining, but it can also just feel stupid. The female characters only seem to exist to be Aquaman's conscience (because he can't think for himself, as he's boring), they have no flaws or vices (in other words no depth). The villain is a cheap charicature of the warmonger, with a few poorly expressed environmental ideas thrown into his perspective. The good points of this film fall mostly on the visuals. It is a stunning film in terms of the undersea beauty portrayed, a literal riot of colour across the screen. I would also say that action is pretty positive, the combat is intense and epic. Overral though, I wouldn't reccomend",Aquaman
417,Wikkid_Gamez,Another one I enjoyed that has so many bad ratings...,8,23 May 2021,"I'm not a comic reader so that probably counts against me.... But IDC tbh.... I loved this movie. It was fun, kid friendly, and full of excellent acting and really good CGI. I had my doubt's that anyone would be able to pull off someone like Aquaman while still maintaining the masculinity you would expect from a male superhero ( yes, I know he doesn't have a tail but thats still the first thing to pop into my mind when I think of the character for obvious reasons to those that don't follow comics ) ... Not many could have pulled it off at all, but even fewer could have done it without coming off like they belonged on Bay Watch and not fighting bad guys. I honestly had my doubt's about this movie all together and admit I didn't bother seeing it when it came out. Here I am finally watching it because I am just now really catching up on cinema for the last few years as I am usually really busy and don't have much if any down time between kids, work and life in general. I would definitely watch this again at some point, as well as watch any sequels (of course there will be sequels with how the superhero genre is pushing out ish left and right) if they maintain the same actors for the characters. As it seems happened to Jared Leto's Joker... He had brought a fresh spin on the character that I really liked, anyway, I digress, back to this movie... Not much else to say, plenty of action, excellent CGI and music score, good story line, excellent acting, completely enjoyable for me. I don't see the need to go into any real detail as most have probably already seen this movie so I will leave this review at that.",Aquaman
418,ElliesWonder,A typical heroic movie,8,22 December 2018,"This is a very typical DC heroic story, it's straightforward and predictable, but I really appreciated the brilliant underwater world CGI, it's so mysterious and fantastic. The plots run a little slow and stupid in the beginning, but climax and underwater battles are much compacted and excited later.In my very own opinion, I don't like the aquaman because the character is arrogant sometimes yet self-abased inside because he knew himself is a half breed, and the cinemagraph world also insulted him by that. I have no idea why the beautiful princess would treat him differently from the beginning? Probably every hero has a hallo, and only heroine can see. As a girl, I admire the beauty of Mera, her red hair is so charming, and the texture is so fairly flowing in the water. I really appreciated movie creator's works by giving this effect!Lastly, such a shame, underworld killed their own kind before revenge the surface.",Aquaman

There are great movies within this line of story (superheroes) and this one isn't as funny, as exciting nor as beautiful. Nicole Kidman - I admire you as a woman that fights for women rights and I think you are beautiful. Please stop freezing your face (however you do it). It doesn't move and that doesn't favor you.",Aquaman
420,Eclectic-Boogaloo,So good. So much more than a just a superhero movie,8,26 December 2018,"Aquaman is unlike anything I've ever seen on the big screen. The look and feel of Atlantis, the costume design, creature effects, are rivaled only by Avatar and the Middle Earth movies amongst recent tent poles. More than just a really good superhero movie, Aquaman is a great sci-fi/fantasy epic. It can't be stressed enough, the underwater world of Atlantis is so rich and absorbing as to merit the price of the ticket on its own (not that the dry land stuff isn't good too. It is, but it's not game changing like the underwater stuff is).And don't be worried about the underwater sequences as it pertains to the movement and talking either. It was outstanding. The action, especially the third act stuff was phenomenal (among superhero movies released in the last 3-4 years only Infinity War's was better).The only weaknesses the movie had were the handling of Arthur/Aquaman and the movie's ambition: Jason Momoa spent most of the movie playing Aquaman as Arthur, the dudebro, which got a little tiring (many of his comedic moments were spoiled in the trailers, and others fell flat). But once the third act came around and the dudebro stuff gave way to more kingly matters, Jason really came through. All the other actors were note perfect: Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson, William Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Temurea Morrison, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen, Julie Andrews. They were all terrific.And on the ambition: just how much story there was to tell was probably the only real negative. The many side plots and changes of scenery, and the degree to which they necessitated a change of tone did make the movie feel a tad bit uneven and clunky at times, but ultimately, every single plot thread was entertaining and interwoven. The ending was fantastic, and there was really no fat to the movie. It was just a really big, decadent, swashbuckling superhero sci-fi-fantasy epic with a little Shakespearean tragedy, comedy, and a smidge of horror. So much to digest. So good.",Aquaman

The 6 means, it is really average, but genrefans might like it. A 7 would be a recommendation to buy the BluRay, but I certainly cannot recommend anything like this.From all the critics and the ratings I really thought this is going to be a good movie. Here are some points, why it is not:Nicole Kidman and ""the father"" have 0 chemistry. Why in earth would a queen be interested in this guy? We will never know. When they meet again at the end of the movie at the dock and run towards each other, I actually laughed.Amber Heard cannot act very well. She is a beautiful woman, no doubt, but she could not carry her weight in the storyJason Momoa cannot act good enough for a main lead. He can act, he has done a good job, but there are way too many scenes where he fails miserably to transport emotions. Just playing the badass is not enough.What is up with the extremely colourful, over the top CGI? If I want to watch a big war like this, I will watch a space opera. Not a single time I thought ""cool"", all the time I thought ""hey this is like shooting scenes in the 70s: long, drawn out, completely meaningless without anything really happening for minutes"".The story was completely predictable from minute one. The only ""twist"" was for me that Aquaman was not betrayed by the character of Willem Dafoethe costumes look so plastic, the weaponry, the armor, here was a possibility to show creativity: How would weapon and armor look like of an army from the deep sea? The movies answer: Just like on land, only colourful and plastique lookingagain 0 chemistry between Momoa and Heard..... why would they love each other? Because the script says so?really, why is Aquaman ""worthy""? Because the script says so? Why should a creature that protects a weapon for 1000s of years (without eating anything, biology anyone?) hand that weapon over to Aquaman? Because he is like King Arthur and pulls Excalibur from King Atlan? That was so cheesy and stolen, it made me cringe in the inside.I nearly forgot about the ""Black Manta"".... when he was on screen with his ridiculously big helmet for the first time, I had to laugh. Is there a more laughable, ridiculous villain in any movie?I am actually really sorry for the DC fans. While Wonder Woman was a great movie, amazing timing and good enough acting, this is the only movie that stands out. Everything else is just not good.
Justice League or Aquaman are so far away from the quality of even ""average"" Marvel movies, it hurts.",Aquaman
425,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,Movie Review: Aquaman,6,6 April 2019,"Any rating I give this movie should come with a massive asterisk because this movie may have broken me a little.I want to say right upfront that this is not a good movie, this is far from being a good movie but I implore you to see this right now! Aquaman has provided one of the most fun movie going experience I have had in a while.If you read my 2018 retrospective you will know that this film reminded me of many other films, that is one of the things that fascinates me so much about this Aquaman. Really this should feel kind of fresh and new given the director's previous work and the less serious tone within the DC movie universe but so many scenes feel ripped from other movies.The special effects are absolutely incredible throughout the movie, the attention to detail with the underwater world makes watching this on the big screen feel rewarding, every action sequence in the kingdom of Atlantis feels like the exact opposite to the one on Wakanda during Black Panther. In that movie often the special effects and action choreography felt like an after thought so that the movie could focus on other things while in Aquaman they are given the time they deserve to leave an impact. Having said that the other moments in the film are also polar opposite to Black Panther, where in that movie slow dialogue heavy moments felt like they had real weight here they are usually laughable (and not when they mean to be).James Wan is a great director and their is no denying that. He has had an impact on the horror genre with greats such as Saw, The Conjuring and Insidious and his mark will felt on that genre for years. But in recently his foray into the action genre has had interesting results. There is no doubt that Furious 7 was more than a little goofy but with Aquaman Wan has outdone himself. None of the character arcs are memorable or interesting, the two leads have no chemistry, there is no real villain of the movie but there are two side villains and about an hour into the film I lost track of the plot and started laughing uncontrollably for way to long.I am seriously finding it difficult to put into words how bizarre this movie is because on paper it sounds almost par for the course with comic book movies but really this is so much more than that.I have to recommend checking this film out but as I said earlier I don't recommend it as a good movie, just a fun one. Like a lot of people I hope that Wan will return to his horror roots soon and stop dragging Patrick Wilson into strange action films, they both deserve better than Aquaman.Also they play the Pitbull's version of Toto's Africa in this movie right when Saw co-creator Leigh Whannell makes a cameo. That might be my favourite moment of 2018 cinema.",Aquaman
426,Phil_M_A_Kerr,"Come for the visuals, stay for the visuals",10,28 December 2018,"Epic scale.
Drops a few cheesy lines.
Schools DC and MCU on how to be grim but enchanting (BB & TDKR excused).
Must have had a whale of a time shooting wave after wave of action sequence.
Heard's performance bouyant with bravado and absolutely gorgeous looks.
Momoa captures the spirit of the half-breed King hook, line, and sinker.
This movie versus the somewhat disappointing The Justice League are oceans apart.
James Wan's horror movie pedigree occasionally floats to the surface to profound effect.
Should help change the tide for DC cinematic universe.
Supporting cast - Morrison, Kidman, Lundgren, Wilson, Dafoe - are sharks at their game.
The intelligent design, beautifully rendered (for the very most part) special effects, shakespearean tragi-familial plot points, and the mesmerising underwater-filmed performances provide the depth to the movie. The frequently shallow dialogue remains submerged under this sea of blockbuster brilliance.
Saw it on Vmax with Atmos, however, the argument that this needs to be seen on a mega-screen doesn't hold water. The sense of scale in this film is presented more with heartfelt, artistic creativity than size alone so if someone tells you that it must be seen on a huge screen, don't take the bait.

The world of Atlantis in particular was beautiful and I hope future films focus on this and expand a lot more on the people and sea creatures.Surprises: the acting was great from everyone and the storyline made sense (some tropes of course).The reason the film lost a star for me was that some of the writing was super lame. I understand these hero films don't want to take themselves too seriously but the acting was so good and the story so engaging that some more earnest and sincere responses would have been appreciated instead of lines like 'what a d*ck'. I also didn't like that they made Aquaman come across as a bit of a douche. This is a guy who (thought he) lost his mum as a child and has seen some horrific stuff while saving people's lives but comes across as some carefree surfer dude. I hope the next film shows him exploring Atlantis, taking on his duties and really seeing what it means to be King - perhaps also losing either his mother or wife in some tragic way so that he can grow as a person and change his character's personality in a legitimate way so that the writing can improve as well. As it stands, Aquaman is like a watered-down, less-funny version of Thor and needs his own unique personality.Minor issues which can be fixed in subsequent films. I'll definitely be watching sequels.9/10",Aquaman

432,adamsmith-51004,A great superhero film,7,16 December 2018,"This film has received mixed reviews from the critics and after watching it not sure why the negative ones.Aquaman is a solid superhero film, yes you could say we have seen it all before but that doesn't make it any less fun. Jason Maoma is brilliant at playing the strong yet dump Arthur Curry/Aquaman. The story is very solid and makes good use of the main villain Oceanmaster and side one Blank Manta. The visuals in the film are brilliant you truly believe that it takes place under the ocean. The film passes by really quickly with a good amount of action and humour. Easily one of the best DC films of recent years and a good superhero film. Would recommend for anyone who is a fan of comic book films",Aquaman

437,StregaAsuka,Move over Marvel!!,8,23 December 2018,"DC has finally woken up!!! (But just woken up and they still have a lot to catch up). As it happened with Wonder Woman, there is hope for DC and this movie is a prove that a job well done is possible when on the right hands.The story takes place after the events from Justice League (although it's like the previous movie didn't exist at all, and we are not complaining about it). Plot is interesting, there are no aliens invading us this time, it's purely a survival matter that happens all underwater of our world. Most of the movie is underwater, so imagine how brilliant and awesome the visual effects are. I can only say: give them already their Oscar, please! Amazing. Not only all the animals we see but also the clothes and specially the hair of the main characters, you feel like you are inside a tank of your town's aquarium.All along the movie you will feel like you are watching another movie, because at some point there is a mix of other movies or simply things that will remind you of them, like: Riders of the Lost Ark or Avatar. And let's not forget that Little Mermaid moment with the Octopus playing the drums. Fantastic! Plus the female character reminds us of Black Widow, just kicking asses but with her own power too and she's not just a secondary player. Marvel, please take note on that. It's like a mix of movies, but in a good way. Not for a minute will you check your watch while watching the film.It seems that DC is finally finding their path with the storylines. Aquaman is as Wonder Woman was, a really entertaining movie. It has mythology, it has action, it has a good speed and it has humor. And probably the best visual effects of the year. So what are you waiting for?",Aquaman
438,MattyRich92,A roller coaster ride... but not in a good way,6,20 May 2019,"Its only purpose is to setup the next movie. It makes no effort to be a good stand alone movie. Aquaman is a flat and one-dimensional character with a predictable journey, which is fine. The only problem is the villains and supporting cast are more boring than him. I can't really remember the things I liked about it because it's a pretty forgettable movie experience. It's not a ""bad"" movie, à la Justice League. But it's not a ""good"" movie either, à la Wonder Woman. It's a ""competent"" movie.",Aquaman
439,hiraishinnojutsu,The Best (and The Greatest) Marvel Phase 1 Movie Ever (if it were in Marvel),8,13 December 2018,"Breathtakingly (almost) non-stop action scenes, visually stunning (kinda like star wars, but underwater), cool fight scenes (as expected from DCEU Movies), perfect cast for the main character, a lot of fun and laughs (makes you think DC is going the Marvel way, which is the case) are all the things that you can ask from the latest James Wan's work.Indeed, it's not perfect. Some misplaced or unnecessary scenes (which Wan could've done better) were added just to (imho) increase the the duration of the film rather than strengthen the story, Arthur's behavior sometimes doesn't befit his counterpart in the original source (he's to much fun as a king of the planet's most powerful kingdom, he's should've been more like T'Challa instead of Thor), and the resolution is quiet (or at least a little bit) cringe worthy for a conflict between two (or more) great (underwater) nations (or kingdoms, or races).At least, what Wan has delivered us is better than anything Snyder offered (thanks to learning from past mistakes, and a godly touch from DC's lord and savior, Geoff Johns), though he and his wife still take the credit as producers. It's great to know that DC is going the right way, which makes me unable to wait for their next year's project: Shazam!",Aquaman

Ocean Master. Trident of Atlan. Robots in ancient Atlantis. Blah, blah, blah. So. Much. Exposition.

Momoa, however, was outstanding as was most of the cast.",Aquaman
447,ivans536,Delightfully Trashy,7,8 March 2019,"A fresh take on the DCEU is nestled somewhere between epic & camp. It's obvious that they were going for a more Marvel-like vibe and they almost succeed. Where they come short is the writing, as some scenes are so over the top that they are almost groan-inducing (like the one on the Italian island), but it seems like they almost embrace it. On that note, I liked how they tackle & try to explain all the illogical concepts from the comics before people can criticize them.There are some good action set pieces, however it seems like we're just going from one to the next and the scenes in between are treated like filler. The CGI is good although very comic book like at times (which I guess is on purpose).Altogether a fun romp, although a bit tiring at times.6.5",Aquaman

449,sherilcarey,Great comic book interpretation,9,25 December 2018,"If I wrote all day I might not finish telling how much I liked about this movie. I've heard several times in the last few years that the character of Aquaman from the past was lame. I realize maybe I'm not the average audience member because I liked him a lot in the animated Justice League of my 70's childhood. And my youngest who strongly preferred ""bearded aquaman"" and I both agreed that this was an excellent updated Aquaman and both thought this would work for very nearly any type of audience.The movie making ensemble that made this fab show did far better than many superhero movies do in not frustrating or confusing people who actually like comic books or previous screen interpretations. It showed just what's so great in comic books which we refer to in our house as the Moments. This had good writing, acting, directing, editing, etc. There were grand visuals. And the whole thing just swung along from one great moment to another with good (and sometimes awe inspiring) transitions.And here's my own odd bit: I have a weird quirk where even though I like certain types of action movies in recent years I tend to accidentally tune out fight scenes. It's truly not intentional but its sometimes so thorough that I miss something just after a fight that mattered. I guess they often bore me and often seem to me to have pretty ridiculously poor choices in how they are filmed. But I actually didn't have that problem in this movie. My family would say that was a Very positive commentary on the movie.It's not that there are no criticisms that could be made by those who seriously enjoy critiquing but from my point of view, just wanting movies to entertain me and this movie reaching a very high level of entertainment value, it just isn't worthwhile to do anything other than to focus on the positive.",Aquaman

451,sfinancing,Not the best DCEU...,6,2 January 2019,"...but not the worst either, granted that isn't a high bar.Just gonna put it out there, though many will disagree, Mamoa does action hero well in my opinion. There were a few other other solid performances, but nothing anyone should be putting out there as their shining moment.Special effect blockbuster with over the top CGI. While it was indeed visually stunning in spots I think they would have been better off investing in some better writers. CGI should not take the place of a good story.Which brings me to the tired plot, lifeless dialogue, mostly 2D characters and much recycled, cliched script.Directing and pace...well this one dragged. This one would have had slow spots at 1 1/2 hours, at almost 2 1/2 hours lets just say the editors should have gotten a bit busier.I'm a comic book geek and don't claim otherwise. I would love to see DC get their act together and start putting out great movies on a regular basis, but I don't think this is one of them.",Aquaman

454,joanacatbagan,James Wan did it good,7,23 February 2019,"More dumb than fun, but you can't quite ignore the fun. Also, visually entertaining and Jason Momoa did great. Reminds me so much of Thor Ragnarok (2017).",Aquaman
455,Wirxaw,Wonder-man,6,14 March 2019,"DC never learn, do they? Well, baby steps. They thought that the success of Wooden Woman would do the trick... and they were right, clearly there aren't enough pirates in the world to show that making bad movies is bad for business.The first thing I'd like to say is that this movie is extremely dumb. Painfully. Clinically. Not Gravity level, not Prometheus or even Martian. It is Logan level of dumb. The absolute abyss, it is technically impossible to watch this movie and think rationally, so the only survivors either have their brains disabled by default, or had to. Luckily, unlike Logan - this movie is more like Avatar. It's probably the most visual since Avatar. Yes, both Nibber Panther and Infinity Quip were stunning, but... not really visual. The difference is like a game with good graphics and... Subnautica. This makes Aquaman more or less easy to swallow. Indeed, if you do NOT think about what you are watching - this is a fancy popcorn-muncher. Perhaps even worthy of going to some IMAX.Another very important feature about this movie - is that, unlike Nibber Panther and Wooden Woman, or even Captain Feminist - this movie doesn't seem to have a deep agenda. Sure, there are a few allusions and suggestions, but... I'd hardly compare it to the modern world, because we don't have a ""Karathen"" and any attempt to replicate such a scenario for politics would hardly be done in CGI. Agenda, propaganda, the things that pollute Martian, Wooden Woman, Nibber Panther, Zootopia, Frozen - they are the first and foremost things that inhibit the suspension of disbelief. Because you are almost ready to give in, when the writers remind you that ""hey, this is kinda relatable, dontcha *think*?"" The same goes for pretentiousness. Logan, The Shape of Water - when movies actively try to pretend to be something... that also tends to itch for people, who have problems turning their brains off. And that's the thing - Aquaman doesn't have any of that. It's a perfect example of a visually brilliant, sort of fun, filled with action superhero flick. For that - I can sort of agree that it's worth 6\10. It's nowhere near the first Avengers, it's not half as thrilling as the Dark Knight and it doesn't even begin to scrape the surface of the Watchmen, these movies were first of all ""whole"" movies, with superheroes and CGI being sort of... a background. And that's what truly deserves the peaks of the rating.Aquaman isn't insightful, it doesn't show anything new. In fact, its plot is even more stupid and painful than Logan. Its characters - a copypasta from Wooden Woman. Most of the ""memorable"" scenes have a ""Blue Steel"" face in them, just like Wooden Woman(sorry, Galya Gadot, a model ain't an actress), so you can't really feel the characters, you don't feel anything towards them. There is no danger, no real drama, everything is as artificial, as superficial as it could be. Nichole Kidman washed up ashore? Well, let's get busy. She was hiding? Well, but how does Aquaman learn to do things? Oh, apparently he is trained already. He's fighting the bad guy? Oh, well, skip that part. Then there's some desert quipping, property damage in actually better parts of the world, then they go where they need to go, do things they need to do, chop in a CGI battle and voila - that there's a movie. I've watched a full-spoiler review of this movie before watching, so if you consider this summary a spoiler... I feel sorry for you. Someone has to.The villains make Lex Luthor look good. I guess Patrick Wilson signed up just because he was told there's an Annabelle cameo. That nibber with his father... That whole scene makes Martha look painless. There are two absolutely, clearly and unmistakably a-hole guys, one of them is allowed to live. Then he gets a chance for revenge. Then he also lives. Okay, I am a racist, but casting him as a Black Manta after Black Panther... seriously, writers, YOU make the world racist. YOU do. Either way, the perpetual survival of this absolutely E-level villain that makes Malekith and Ronan look impressive(and that's saying a LOT) - doesn't help this movie, it only helps to establish an even more stupid sequel.For all intents and purposes... An effort should've been made to turn Aquaman into the Ocean Master. Because clearly there haven't been any for a while and it's not like anyone but Momoa can do that. Ocean Master... that resounds. That's somehow more meaningful than Starlord. Aquaman? That's a Seaman joke bait. Good for a movie title, I suppose, people wouldn't have 1\5th of a brain to figure out what is the movie about otherwise, but for the movie to end with him accepting the name ""Aquaman"", a moniker given by hell knows whom, when he clearly has a title... Again, I suppose the target audience wouldn't understand what ""Ocean Master"" stands for.Speaking of target audience, I guess the shareholders at DC figured that DC has only one set of powers - the As-Man. So no matter who that is - Cyborg, Batman, Wooden Woman, Aquaman - all heroes need to be some sort of bullet-proof, need to be crushed into buildings and stuff, need to occasionally bleed, need to fly and be super fast. Sure, Aquaman doesn't fly or run. But somehow the only identifier that the movie sort of happened underwater - was the visual background. Otherwise it's absolutely, 101% no different from ... Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy. People talk, things fly, sounds are heard, you know, bullets, battles, physics and all that. So, yes, Aquaman is about as original as Drax. Okay, scratch that. Drax is a memelord and an actually good character. Aquaman is just Jason Momoa, and his enemy is just Patrick Wilson.Maybe in a few years - DC would learn to flesh out their characters. Plots. To imagine heroes with more abilities than virtual invulnerability and lasers out of their eyes. Maybe origin stories would have some moments, where the audience would feel something for their heroes, when heroes do actually incredible things. Instead of pulling the sword from the stone. Until then - Seaman is a decent movie to download, worthy of some popcorn and IMAX. But it's not something to write home about. People, who praise it... clearly have abyss-bottom low expectations for DC movies and, in DCEU, ignoring the Dark Knight trilogy - yes, Aquaman is definitely the best movie so far. Sadly, a hero in town is only a commoner in a city, and most people live in cities...",Aquaman

If you want a brainless popcorn flick with lots of action, then this is worth a watch. It's visually stunning and the actors try to do their best of a poor script.However, there are many negatives. As usual, DC try to do too much and seem to be in a rush to get as much covered as possible. Aquaman learning his powers should be done in the 1st act, not the 2nd. By this point, it was just assumed he'd learned over time, so no point having his training so late in the movie.The overall tone was all over the place. One minute, it's serious like MOS and BVS, the next it's slap stick like Looney Tunes.Mera was beautifully played by Amber Heard, but there was too much change in the character. She starts off like the Little Mermaid, then progresses to Black Widowesque, then some sort of Jean Grey type character.The movie felt like it tried to take the best bits of the 3 Thor movies (not necessarily a bad thing but would have been nicer to see Aquaman as something different).Overall, not a bad movie but could have been so much better",Aquaman

There are holes in the plot so large that the movie repeatedly disappears into them (Where do the ocean's denizens dispose of THEIR waste products and pollution? The Atlanteans are technologically sophisticated, but they are a culture that practices superstition and worships war. What is the source of production, and the power behind the production, of all that tech? What affect is the ocean dwelling civilization having on ocean temperatures? And how come the land dwellers don't know about all those creatures?). The acting is brutally melodramatic, and all the big ""plot twists"" can be foreseen ten minutes into the film.But it is a fine looking movie, with lots of dazzling CGI effects.If you've got a 4K tv, I suggest you wait until ""Aquaman"" releases on home video, then check out a copy from your local library.",Aquaman

Gone is the failed attempts to make the series dark and gritty, instead here's a film that accepts that the audience of a modern superhero film is there for an exciting and light-hearted action film, then proceeds to hit the mark.

They gave aquaman himself a really fun and interesting character, they had an excellent story with really well written characters and a lot of laughs along the way too.

471,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,DCEU found out what it wants to be,7,17 December 2018,"Aquaman is good. Not brilliant, not fantastic, it's good. It might not be the grade it wanted to get nor was it the top it could have gotten, but Aquaman is in its core a good movie. It achieves what it set out to achieve: entertain and dazzle with stunning visuals and great performances.1) The story. Aquaman is the first movie after the Justice League debacle (in all fairness to the cast and crew, JL was not what it should have been). So, Aquaman had to come up with a story that was not an origin story (yet needed to be one), be a sequel to a movie that disappointed hardcore DC fans and restore their faith, and tell a unique and entertaining story worthy of the first ever live action Aquaman movie. Strangely, it succeeded in all of those fields. The story is multilayered with a more than a few plots intertwining and moving forward simultaneously (as well as the origin story/flashbacks alongside the Atlantis origin/history). This might sound convoluted, but the way the story is told actually doesn't hurt the storytelling. There are almost no plot holes and all characters (with the slight exception of Black Mantis) are given enough time to provide us with their background, philosophy and motivations. Unfortunately, the downside of this is the overall duration of the movie (143 minutes). Even though the movie doesn't feel very long and there are just enough action sequences to keep the dynamic going, there were certain segments that could have been cut a bit short (maybe for an uncut edition later on). It would be unfair to judge the movie by its length, especially because there were many points that needed concluding, but a few more riskier editing choices would have made this movie and its story far superior. Also, because of this, the final battle that is spectacular in all fairness, didn't have that necessary final epic kick this type of movie is known for. Everything blows up and all hell breaks loose, but I found the one-on-one battle afterwards to be much more satisfying and epic (mainly due to Momoa's and Wilson's stellar action performances).2) The acting. This movie rounds up much of the old school masters (Dafoe, Kidman, Lundgren, Wilson) and a few very promising newcomers (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Heard). Dafoe was given a beautiful little supporting role that he embraced with such joy that it was a delight to watch him. Lundgren, regardless of him being best known for B-movie action roles, executed all of his lines and expressions with such ease and fluidity, in such scholar like style that he actually awed me most of all. Even though erased almost halfway though, Abdul-Mateen II did a decent job. Nothing spectacular, but he set up a good character for the sequel(s). Also, the Sicily fight is one of the highlights of the movie. Kidman was, unfortunately, very bland and unceremonious. Her God-like posture and wooden acting took me away from her character most of all. She also had no chemistry with Momoa or Wilson and her storyline was the one that could have been written and finished better. The almost Deus ex machina ending with her feels way to happy endish and took much from the dark and gritty fight between Momoa and Wilson. On the other hand, another performance for the acting school books is the one executed by Patrick Wilson. His understanding of the character is phenomenal, and his execution spot on. No line is overacted, no expression is unneeded. All of his gestures, the tone of his voice in every scene is perfect to the point of perfection. He, alongside Dafoe, gave the best performance in the movie. Heard was a bit underwhelming. She has a beautiful character to play with but never actually takes her to new levels. She took no risks in depicting Mera and that is a little sad. As she and Momoa lead the movie, and taking into account that his presence simply dominates every scene he is in, Heard should have done more. Like this she is just good. Momoa however had a dual quality. His presence in the movie is breathtaking. He lives and breathes Aquaman with every cell in his body. He has fun while doing it, but he just does not have the same quality of acting as the others (which is quite understandable given he is still a sort of a newcomer compared to the others). Every scene he is having fun and is telling jokes or is fighting or threatening others is a blast (especially when he yells parts of Haka), but when he has to execute high drama like scenes, he simply vaporizes. Put up against Wilson or even Heard, he looses his intimidation as the acting of the other party outdoes Momoa's. But, as all of the DCEU characters, he is the best live action incarnation of Aquaman. Put plainly, he is awesome.3)The directing. Wan is a superhero! He is a god, a legend, a titan, a master. Even though his specialty is horror, his masterful skill at keeping a movie like this so compact and solid is astounding. He never looses his grip at what this movie is supposed to be. Every scene is fixed, no improvisation, with scalpel-like precision. Certain scenes that seemed to be one take shots were so perfectly developed and performed they literally take ones breath away. Beautifully orchestrated (in every sense of the word) directing makes Aquaman a movie worth seeing over and over again.4) The music. R. Gregson-WIlliams does a great job. He really got certain characters and their themes, but it is noticeable that he had much more fun and much stronger ideas in creating the villain tunes than the hero ones. Simply put, Aquaman needs a better theme. But a solid job was done altogether.All in all, Aquaman fixed most of the problems Justice League created. It also created a path the DCEU should follow in a very VERY straight line and not deter at all. This was a correction exam for the DCEU and it passed. Aquaman is fun, entertaining, with SPECTACULAR visuals (even though most of it is pure CGI) and is a pure delight to watch. Certain characters could have had better execution, some story lines could have been omitted or shortened, and the music could have been a bit more innovative. But all in all, Aquaman is simply a good movie that deserves to be watched over and over again in the highest possible quality and it will always deliver exactly what it sets out to deliver - a good time.",Aquaman
472,A-Shekhar,Over 80% on IMDB gave this movie above 5 stars,3,6 March 2019,"Over 80% on IMDB gave this movie above 5 stars so I'm glad that this movie was able to make that many people happy but this movie was in my opinion made for the kids as superhero movies really was meant to be however, with the era of Marvel and it's absolute brilliance in making even the most unlikeliest of heroes such as Iron-Man, Captain America....ANT-MAN!!! as popular superheroes as Superman, Batman and Spider-man - this movie was below average - horrible shiny colorful suits - continuity errors, immensely predictable and done to death with story line, childish humor, high pitched noisy sound almost throughout the entire movie - the production, the script and the direction all seemed lazy. But like I said, I'm happy that at least others liked it.",Aquaman
473,gav_c,Not as good as I was expecting but it's still watchable,6,24 August 2019,"2 things that let this movie down for me.1. there was no real beginning/real explanation or any thought into how aqua-man grows into his powers. The story takes a running leap from him being a little child to him being an adult doing what aqua man does in the sea with pretty much no build up.2. The CGI, there is so much CGI in this movie. Some of it good, some of it terrible.I would still recommend this movie you just gotta not take it to serious. Kinda reminded me of a cross between Tron and black panther movies. Overall this movie could of been better and I can understand some of the bad reviews but it's still watchable in my opinion.",Aquaman
474,rustonreviews,A step in the right direction for the DCEU.,7,30 December 2018,"James Wan, a director-producer mostly known for his immensely popular horror films, shifts genre gears once again to take on one of DC's most iconic heroes. Having made his first appearance in last year's Justice League, Aquaman (Momoa) returns in his first stand-alone adventure that is both ridiculously corny yet ludicrously enjoyable. Aquaman, A.K.A Arthur Curry (half Atlantean-half human) is the rightful heir to the throne of Atlantis, and is reluctant to leave his human life behind in order to face up to his true destiny. With the help of warrior Mera (Heard) and Atlantis counsellor Nuidis Vulko (Dafoe), Arthur must fight to overthrow his malevolent half-brother Orm Marius (Patrick Wilson, a frequent collaborator with Wan), who is preparing to wage a cataclysmic war with the surface world.The DCEU, in a nutshell, is a complete misfire of a cinematic universe. Although Wonder Woman (2017) showed great promise for the franchise, even the most hardcore fans can't ignore the disaster that was Suicide Squad (2016) or the total mess that was Batman V Superman (2016). With Aquaman, James Wan makes the most of a cliché ridden script and delivers a surprisingly fun film. Momoa leads the film with great charisma; his performance holds the film together entirely, and it is clear he's having an absolute blast in the role. Patrick Wilson was a fitting choice for Orm; he's menacing when required, yet his performance at times is corny beyond belief. Both Heard and Dafoe were also excellent casting choices, although their characters aren't as developed as they could have been. It is the action sequences that work best in the film. In previous DCEU films, the action sequences have ranged from excessively dull to criminally forgettable (with the exception of the terrific No Man's Land sequence from Wonder Woman), but Wan crafts sequences that are thrilling in execution and epic in scope. A fight sequence with side villain Black Manta (who makes an appearance more in the name of fan service rather than plot) is particularly awesome, and the final conflict may be an overload of CGI, but it's certainly epic and absurdly entertaining.Aquaman is definitely one of the stronger entries of the DCEU. It's cheesy for sure, and the writing is clunky in parts, but with Momoa's excellent screen presence and Wan at the helm, Aquaman manages to pull off all its absurdity. If the DCEU continues in this direction, it could finally live up to its full potential and even rival the MCU.",Aquaman
475,BBogus,"Ariel? Disneyfied DC with terrible dialogues, wooden acting too much makeup and mediocre CGI.",1,29 January 2019,"If you like Disney go watch it. Otherwise stay clear of it. Jason Momoa is not great but also not bad in his role though. Yet, Amber Heard is terrible and should stick to suing exes and becoming a makeup sales rep. What the hell were Willem Dafoe and Patrick Wilson doing here (wasted talent). Was there even a plot? Typical dumb Hollywood film.",Aquaman
476,fiftycentqueen,Wowwwww,10,25 December 2018,This movie was visually stunning. The action kept me glued to the IMAX screen. I was in a complete trance watching the man I loved as Khal Drogo play the hell out of the role of Aquaman. This is by far the best recent DC movie that's been made. I would even say this was better than a lot of the Marvel movies I've seen lately. Thank you for finally making a DC movie that's just completely bad ass.,Aquaman

479,heatsink98,This movie's heading changes with the breeze,2,11 August 2019,"Inconsistent. That's a problem that plagues this film from start to end. As a prime example, some CGI effects are spectacular, some not so much. Compositing is atrocious. Amber Heard's red hair frequently has a white glow around it because the composite work looks like it was done in minutes on a $5 budget. And what's with the horrific anti-aging effects at the start of the movie? The actors looked like they had rubber masks glued to their faces.The direction is just as up and down as the script. Tone is all over the place. Goofy one moment, serious the next, and then back to complaining about missing happy hour at one point by our hero. WONDER WOMAN'S excellent story provided some hope for DC's film universe, but AQUAMAN didn't carry on with the work.",Aquaman
480,shvmbanerjee,Not Good,4,10 March 2019,"James Wan certainly produced a better enjoyable DC film than the previous ones in the line. But however, it fails at a number of places. Firstly, the logic didn't add up, it was plain stupid. I know you don't need logic but this was pure stupidity. Secondly, Orm didnt really feel like a villain, he was weak and pathetic. Even Steppenwolf appeared to be a more challenging one than Orm was. I had keep Manta in the main villain but lets skip that. I do feel it was a bit rushed. There was a lot of plot holes and off topic or unnecessary scenes. Not to mention it became boring and cringe, more it advanced to the end.",Aquaman

483,alexqueens,Injects some much needed magic to these types of films,7,30 October 2019,"I wholly expected to be rolling my eyes throughout this film, because I'm no fun of superhero fantasy. But that didn't happen, despite it being over 2 hours long. (well maybe I rolled my eyes a bit somewhere in the last 10mins after the 'final' sibling battle)Superhero movies should be all about bringing a certain magic to the screen, a spectacle that you can marvel at and simply switch off and enjoy. And Aquaman does exactly that. Plenty of beautiful locations, lots of action/fighting, some awesome effects (especially all the under-water stuff) and a nice mix of Superman and Indiana Jones type adventure.
The kind of movie I could watch with my kid one day (when he's old enough) that will give him that sense of wonder and magic that some older movies from my childhood did for me.I also think they did some justice to the whole Atlantis mythology here. Great stuff.
And having 'good guy' Patrick Wilson play the villain to good guy Willem Dafoe? A welcome and interesting choice.",Aquaman
484,butravi,Another Downer from DC,1,11 December 2018,"Shocked to see so many 10/10 ratings! This movie is a sad mix of clichés, and genres. Sad because, its not good as any genre. The action is too micro or macro.. No chemistry in love aspect, humor lines come as jarringly at inappropriate moments, and no twists at all. With such movies, DC might sink for good and thats the only good thing about this movie.",Aquaman
485,Ingrouille181,Not enough to save the DCEU,7,17 December 2018,"Aquaman was good in the Justice League movie last year, and they picked a good actor who fitted a dark gritty version of Aquaman: Joan Momoa. Now we have a full on Aquaman movie. Momoa, Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman, and directed by James Wan. Makings of a great edition to the DCEU, the problem is it runs on a by the numbers story for the main character. Warner Bros did something out of the blue: they had the ensemble movie first, with each new character a follow up solo movie; the beginning of Aquaman gives us a backstory, with the main movie focusing on the aftermath of Steppenwolf.The story takes place sometime after the events of Justice League, with Arthur Curry (Aquaman) being forced into the open when Orm, his half-brother and King of the Legendary Atlantis is trying to begin a new war with the surface world. Now Arthur has to embark on an adventure with another Atlantean, Mera, to find a way to defeat arm and unite their two worlds.For positives, the visuals are amazing. Atlantis looks phenomenal, the action set pieces are well done, especially the continuous shots that Wan is known for in his action films. The set designs and costumes are inspired, especially the classic Aquaman suit and Black Manta's armour. The budged for the CGI was definitely well spent, we get the studio mandated third act battle but I didn't care: we get War Sharks and War Sea Horses and King Crabs and a GIANT KRAKEN, THING! with missiles and lasers on them, smashing into each other while flaming balls of molten magma are being flung around on CATAPULTS!; I felt like I tripping balls for 10 minutes but it's so worth it.The film has fun montages and flashbacks, and funny moments of humour sprinkled throughout. Amber Heard is very good as Mera. The way the Atlanteans live and function is interesting to see. The film is well paced and keeps you interested; can't say there were any times it was starting to bore me.All that being said, Aquaman is very good on its own; if it had been the first instalment in the DCEU, or the second, after Wonder Woman, the DCEU could have continued on a better thought out franchise, instead Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have left, Batman v Superman and Justice League were messes, and Shazam doesn't come off like it'll be a surefire hit at all. Wonder Woman 1984's already in production so the train can't stop now, and the DCEU movies are heading into pre-production before any well thought out thinking can be done, It's gonna be distracting going forward; I still think they should have rebooted it post Justice League, especially since they're gonna have to ""Don Cheadle"" Superman and Batman now. The DCEU still has no concrete plan for their universe, and they certainly don't have a competent Kevin Feige figure.But, for two hours of fast paced, action packed entertainment with a charming lead and supporting characters, definitely give Aquaman a see.",Aquaman
486,GoUSN,Did anybody read the script prior to filming?,1,18 January 2019,"A zero-star script. One star added for competent CGI.And the worldwide public has to date paid a billion to see it.Aquaman was a series of lines and stagings from every movie you've ever seen. And not in a good way. Every scene was predictable. It doesn't take long for that realization to set in. Wait. Didn't we see that scene in Dr. Doolittle with hints of Flipper? And that scene. Was that Casablanca? And were those creatures the flying monkeys from Wizard of Oz? No? Could've fooled me.Want a poignant father-son pirate presentation of a manly heirloom (ugly and savage pirates, not Johnny Depp) right in the middle of a violent boarding?

494,coastdaze,Now THIS is Aquaman!,10,2 January 2019,"At the risk of sounding ""gushy"" I really, really enjoyed Aquaman. Sure Jason Mamoa was a big reason for that, but this was a pure fantasy excitement ride. A few times I had to remind myself to ""relax"" while watching the almost non-stop action. IMO, forget all previous incarnations of Aquaman, Momoa nails the part. Gritty but not too much, cool but not fake cool...he's just cool period, perfect physically for the role. I mean wouldn't Aquaman be 6' 4"" and very handsome? The action and CGI of this movie are beautiful, you really get to delve into fantasy-land for 2 hours. Every character was portrayed well by each actor. There is no portrayal that I didn't like. And it has a good story line that kept me interested. Frankly, it was so entertaining I've already seen it twice and plan to see it in IMAX at least once more. Definitely a BIG screen movie as there are scenes where there is a lot going on visually.",Aquaman
495,pronker,"Aquaman delivers the fun in a pretty, happy movie. Good work, DC and Wan!",10,8 February 2019,"I've just gotten home from the theater and was wowed by the movie. The actors, except Dafoe and Lundgren, are new to me, so they had the appeal of not comparing them to other roles. Flash Gordon was the first thing to mind after seeing the Fishermen, Trench, familiar two-legged Atlanteans, and so forth in the matter of undersea races - all it needed was the Hawkmen.I just loved it and didn't expect it to be a Power Couple movie at all, but then I stopped reading comics about four years back so maybe the latest comics do more with Mera? Anyway, Momoa, in addition to being smoking hot, did okay as Aquaman. He rushed his lines a little once or twice, yet held up in the dramatic and romantic moments. The effects couldn't have been better, either, seamlessly sliding from land to water. Atlantis was perfectly composed. Since Aquaman became my first superhero love in the Silver Age, not Superman or Batman or any other 'man,' this was a happy 2 hours and 23 minutes. Recognizing Temuera Morrison was the icing on the cake. The aquarium scene with young Arthur hailed back to a favorite panel from a long ago comic, with Art's hand the focus of multiple fish species' attention. Aquaman's ending costume couldn't have been better.Speaking of ending, upon reading credits to Nick Cardy and Mort Weisinger, my little ol' fan's heart beat faster.",Aquaman

Him and Aber Heard also had some charming and even cute chemistry. The effects and action are also serviceable exciting but nothing mind-blowing. Atlantis looks beautiful if not a little busy. This is a CGI heavy film, but that's hardly at fault since there is really no other way to faithfully present such an imaginative landscape as it takes place in.There is also a level of the heart to it that is simple, but effective enough. It's not without its cheesiness though, lots of over the top creatures, and Patrick Wilsons villain, but they all fit. At the end of it, all this film can be viewed simply as a fun, creative action romp with a good deal of exaggerated landscapes and the characters found in those landscapes that seem to know what kind of movie they're in. It's epic and fun and, despite the simple tired story, is one of the DCEUs better outings. It has a color where the others were grainy and charisma where the others were stoic.

Jason even ripped Amber Heard's pages from her books without her permission while working with her for the Aquaman film.

Part of it is about Arthur's birth and childhood and then about him finding out he is the prince of Atlantis and then becoming Aquaman. The haters say he is a mindless thug, ignoring the fact that he can speak Japanese and has an in-depth knowledge of the history of the Roman Empire. He did not grow up in Atlantis so when he arrives there is a lot he doesn't know, because it's like him traveling to a country he has never been before. His female companion is as much as a historian as she is a guide, because again he didn't grow up in Atlantis he doesn't know the legends and laws. Despite what the haters say the movie is less of a social commentary about polluting the oceans as it is about racism.

The cringe worthy characters and over the top cliché sequences between father and son (Villains) or the cheesy betrayals and shortsighted plot are the bulk of this mess. This could have been a real stand alone flick given the star power but only Willem Dafoe stood out but only because he's a straight up lunatic and everyone loves him. This is literally a really expensive Power Rangers episode with the same bad dialogue, acting and ""super villain"" complete with bad costume and all.

509,ksdouglas-23618,100% Cheese 100% cliche 100% Heart,9,11 February 2019,"Aquaman is a traditional fantasy plot you've seen 10,000 times. However, one thing the movie has that a lot of those fantasy films lacked is heart.This is a superhero film that doesn't take itself serious and doesn't care to. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the film for what it is. A superhero movie.",Aquaman
510,Students_SimoneVeil,THE MOST BORING SUPER HERO MOVIE,2,9 January 2019,"Aquaman is a blockbuster realized in 2018 and my friends love this movie, not me.
In my opinion Aquaman is a bad movie because the plot is really bad ! The actors play good and the decors and costumes is good but I think this movie have been creat just for get lot of money. The plot talks about Aquaman (I don't know his true name and I don't want to know it). So, Aquaman wants to stop a war between the Surfaciens and the Atlentes. The Atlentes want to do war because the Surfaciens use the sea like a bin and Aquaman ar half- Surfacien half-Atlante,and mother of Aquaman she the queen of Atlatide. The SFX of this movie is so bad, look like so mutch a power ranger episode and is unacctable for this type of movie. If you like losing your time, you should watch Aquaman.",Aquaman
511,sirquickie,Indiana Jones,9,16 December 2018,"The film came out unusual. I did not see Jason as Aquaman. However, the actor was able to convey the inner world of Arthur. The plot does not float, but smooth and winding. Locations are vast and incredible.",Aquaman

Only flaws are the story is not good and amber heard is pretty bad. Really fun movie and I highly recommend watching it.",Aquaman
514,cliff_bd,Predictable story.....but still great fun,9,15 December 2018,"I really enjoyed Aquaman......... sure the story was predictable..... but the movie is great fun and does not take itself too seriously.If I was to compare Aquaman to Black Pather and Antman and Wasp, I would say (in my opinion) that Aquaman is the superior movie. (See my Black Pather review).It has to be said that the Marvel and DC films story lines are predictable..... it's the characters and heart and of course action and pace of the movie that makes them.Aquaman characters are fun, the pace of the movie is fast moving and unrelentingThe measure I normally use is when I watch a movie for a second time, does it still hold my interest? For me, although I liked Black Pather the first time round ...... it did not hold my interest the send time.Anyway Aquaman is just a fun movie, don't take it too seriously and you will probably enjoy it.",Aquaman
515,seronjaa-797-313124,Worst superhero movie I watched so far,4,20 April 2019,"I don't know where to start with this one, but I'll try...
the storyline- nothing is happening and they are showing us this in the most boring and predictable way you can imaginethe dialogues- they are like watching a children's cartoon show with robotsthe characters- what characters?! we didn't get to know them, because of bad writing and too many fight scenesthe cliches- you can get drunk everytime you notice a cliche stolen from other movies in this one. we have everything mixed in here- the rotating camera, the spinning camera, the tiny ships fighting giant monsters, the pretty girl who wears waterproof makeup all the time falling in love with the main character, while being engaged to his evil blonde brother and so on. it's painful. i was thinking all the time- how did the poor actors feel, when they had to partake in this horribly unoriginal story?the visual effects- i don't know if this is a movie from 2018 or 2001? buffy the vampire slayer from the 90s has better visual effects than this. most time i was thinking, that i'm watching a video gamethe underwater world looks like it somewhere in deep space. everything is minimalisticly pure white, clean and shiny. they just could have watched disnye's arielle and see how their underwater castle was build of corals, algae, clams and other naturally occuring underwater plants and rocks. but no- they have shiny copper and white glas or somethingthe looks of the villains is just stupid- one looks like a giant ant, which doesn't make sense- why would a human make a mask with a huge head to drag around?! all the others look like transformers or some spaceships",Aquaman

I will come back post my comments and reviews. Because right now my favorite Marvel movie is Wonder Woman, Justice League, Batman vs Superman . Avengers-Infinity and last but not least Black Panther.",Aquaman
517,young-erika65,Please Don't make a Aquaman 2,1,11 August 2019,This has to be one of the worst movies ever. And it had to come to HBO. Disney you can have this one for sure. This was terrible! I hope No ones career gets blacklisted for this garbage. Every fan of DC marvel who purchased a ticket should sue for emotional damages . I truly thought people were over exaggerating when they said Aquaman was a horrible movie. I found out the hard way and the only good part was at the end with Beautiful and Gorgeous Nicole Kidman. That's why I gave Aquaman a 1 point. I give Nicole Kidman a Perfect 10. Nominations for Aquaman is a Joke! False advertising and lying to people who use their hard earn money to watch crap like this should be a federal crime. I said what I said.,Aquaman
518,janoffpeter,Good. Could have been better though.,7,19 October 2019,Unfortunately this had the potential of being a 10 but didn't measure up for two major reasons. The over use of certain techniques that made it visually impenetrable in certain crucial scenes. Sometimes less is more. That was the lesser of the two issues. The biggest problem was that Nicole Kidman was cast into a substantial supporting role. She was an exceptionally poor choice for this film.Just about any other woman would have been better in that roll. It was kind of like having Senator Gillebrand of New York play in a mythical roll. Nicole Kidman simply wasn't made for that part. It was an inexcusable casting error and ultimately should have sunk my rating to a 6. I liked Jason Momoa William Defoe and Dolphin Lundgren's performances. Period. Oh and and a particular octopus',Aquaman
519,toofancorp,Entertaining film but nothing special,7,25 August 2019,"The movie provides a fun summer Blockbuster with special effects, action, and entertainment galore. The actors all have their charm and the cinematography has that Hollywood sheen to it. There are just a few things I can't ignore that glaringly bothered me....It's downright offensive how many scenes this movie downright steals or copies from other films. Tron, fifth Element, Indiana Jones to name a few. The cheesy dialogue at moments didn't help either.",Aquaman
520,salonsoab,The comeback that the DCEU needed!,7,4 January 2019,"Aquaman is a superhero film that might have a messy story and some corny dialogue, but because the visuals are really mind-blowing, the acting (especially from Jason Momoa and Amber Heard) is outstanding, most characters (except Black Manta) are well developed and portrayed, and the fighting scenes are unique, the movie is a fun spectacle that serves as a great time at the theaters.",Aquaman
521,jerralagbayani,A solid story with long action sequences.,6,26 December 2018,"I likes James Wan's Aquaman, which on a mega-budget surprised me with a solid story and a big fish hook. The sequences were well done and it has a big enemy but the only problems were the action sequences were too long, some parts were too cheesy, and too many explosions. Maybe if they focused more on the story and had more transitions during battle sequences i'd enjoy more. I'd be down for a sequel.",Aquaman
522,LorenBieg,Lost interest in 30 minutes and turned it off..,3,10 March 2019,"...which I never do. And I really like Jason Mamoa. But this is just the most generic, inane, over-CGI'd under-written recycle of other superhero movies. So much exposition about tridents and politics and next to nothing about the characters. Except the first ten minutes about Aquaman's mom and dad, an awkwardly youthified waste of Nicole Kidman and Jango Fett. And dude, Amber Heard (aka poison ivy) is smoookiingg hot and wtf with Aquaman's indifference to her and zero explanation of how they know each other.The coolest thing about Aquaman is his connection with fish, which is completely overlooked in an opening sequence involving a machine gun fight. The only interesting scene in the first 30 minutes takes place in an aquarium when Aquatyke is being bullied.The underwater talking and flying and armpit sniffing was unbearable. And I'm just getting going here. I can't beleive the script made it to screen.",Aquaman
523,mistela67,Nice action. Amber was looking HOT!!!!,8,21 December 2018,"I liked this movie. I felt the actioni kept things interesting, as is par for these types of movies. You don't go see an Aquaman for a compelling story. I felt the pacing was good, too. I wasn't bored really. The fight and chase sequences were well shot. It was bit cheesy at times, predictable. Violence was kept in check. The intro to Manta could have been more compelling, but it fit within the pacing of the movie. For you ladies, you have plent of shirtless scenes with Mr. Aquaman to fantasize about. And for us guys, two word...AMBER HEARD. This lady just oozed the sexuality, wet or dry. Her face and body are just flawless. Great movie, great eye candy so-so story line, and did I mention...AMBER HEARD!!!!",Aquaman
524,Thekeybaldemasterrises,It's an awkward transition from the Snyderverse to the future of DC,7,16 December 2018,"So I saw Aquaman anddddddddd ehhh? It's not bad but it's not goood? Let me just give you the bad first. This movie is too long. I kinda felt the same about Wonder Woman as well, but I really felt it here. You could've easily cut down a half hour of this movie and nothing about it would've changed. The story is serviceable but not new. It bears similar resemblance to a Marvel Phase 1 movie so like: Thor 1, Captain America 1, but it lacks the performances and charisma of either of those. I like Patrick Wilson as an actor but King Orm is no Loki. He's pretty one note and cliched as the movie's villain. The visuals were a double edged sword so for the bad I would say it just got way too distracting for me. Infinity War had tons of cgi too but I was invested enough to ignore what wasn't actually real. And lastly, I'm just gonna say it, Aquaman's story is NOT interesting. Call me a hater but I've never liked Aquaman I'm sorry! There's a reason Family Guy keeps making fun of him all the time. Ok but what's good about this movie? Actually there's a lot of good things. The movie's visuals while distracting were colorful. The DC cinematic universe has stumbled with the Zack Snyder look that's just gloomy, lifeless, and boring. Aquaman actually tries to course correct the ship by creating a really bright and well animated world through Atlantis. The action is epic and ambitious because I can tell James Wan is a confident director. He definitely gave this movie a nice look so kudos to him on that. And lastly Jason Momoa, I can't deny how much I love him in the role. His character isn't written as well as it could be, but he does what he can, and he's so goofy I love it. It sounds like I hate this movie but I actually don't. It just feels like it's trying to get out of their past mistakes by making a safe and marketable movie. Which is fine. But I wanted something new and different. Here's hoping Shazam can give me what I'm looking for from DC. Should you go see it? Well.. If you're not into superhero movies you're probably not gonna care for this one either. If you want to see some good action and Jason Momoa doin his thing then I'd say it's alright. 7/10.",Aquaman
525,tendobear,Sharkboy and Lava Girl was Way Better!,1,28 June 2019,"Oh man, what a waste of 2.5 hours! I'm really not understanding why this piece of tosh is getting so much hype. Zero story, non-sensical plot, one-dimensional characters, cringe-worthy dialogue, horrendous production design, costume design looked like they ripped-off the Power Rangers, and the visuals weren't even that great! The ""young-ification"" of Temeura Morrison and Nicole Kidman at the beginning of the movie was absolutely laughable. Manta's - actually all the costumes - looked so cheap and plastic-y it reminded me of those kids' costumes that you get at the Dollar Store. Momoa does his best impersonation of Thor, but ultimately fails to draw any laughs or garner any emotion. They absolutely ripped-off every sci-fi fantasy concept out there, mixed them together and hoped something would stick. It was just a loud, chaotic, brash, flashy, low-brow, seething mess. I think even Sharkboy and Lava Girl did a way better job! Just give up DCEU, you're no match for the MCU, the harder you try the worse you look.",Aquaman
526,misswritercreates,It was enjoyable,7,28 March 2019,"Like any marvel movies it was enjoyable. Wasn't boring at all, has a lot of fighting scenes and stuff blowing up.

527,Timbo_Watching,Cliche but alright,6,14 March 2020,"Yeah, this film had every superhero cliché ever. The visuals - especially underwater - were very pleasing to the eye though and made my experience for this film better than it probably should be. I don't understand the hate from the top reviews, but I can definitely see this film isn't that appealing or special. It was alright for a one time watch; nothing more.",Aquaman

Nicole Kidman, who plays mother , is still so beautiful. This movie, at the same time, gives you the refreshing fighting scene, and brings you the warmth of family and love. Finally, in the sunset dock, Aquman's father finally waited for his love, accompanied by the melody of ""everything I need"". It's so beautiful.",Aquaman
530,rupert-ian,Great job DC!,7,18 December 2018,"It's not easy to write a story with a character like Aquaman and be able to make it look good, not be a silly mess, and to be serious enough to engage people.DC really came back and did a great job with this movie. They didn't inject any political junk, it was well-paced and acted, the story was good, the effects were great.I'm a MARVEL fan mostly, but I love the DC characters as well and it made me happy to see DC put out something so entertaining. I really hope they can keep it up because they have so many awesome characters that need movies that do them justice.Amber Heard did great, even she would have been a better choice for Captain Marvel IMO.I give this a solid 7.5/10 with no real complaints.",Aquaman
531,ahmetkozan,The enormous visuality of Atlantis!,8,30 December 2018,"We know that the DC cinematic universe that emerged as a result of the partnership between DC Comics and Warner Bros does not go well. Aquaman does not fall into this category. The film first appeared in China. Then the comments about the movie excited me. I was looking forward to it. It was a movie I really liked.The story of the film is a complete story of origin. We see how a character emerged and how he was a hero. We see what Arthur Curry has been going through since his birth. I mean, you can follow the course of the story very easily and there is no scene you will be surprised. From time to time clichés and boring moments can be experienced. When you think it's a story of beginnings, the cliches don't bother you much. I think this is a must for superhero films.While watching Aquaman, you feel a lot more of Wan's touch to the film. Aquaman literally makes you feel like a ""movie"". Because while watching the film, you can see the introduction, development and the result line in a very comfortable way. Everything is as it should be. The characters perform their duties more than enough. In the first 20 minutes, you already feel inside the film, and your attachment instinct confirms this. The origin of Aquaman is generally preserved. There are some minor changes to the film. At the same time, there are critical changes in the Black Manta and Orm. But if you are a comic book reader in general, Arthur Curry's story will give you pleasure. The film also touches on a beautiful subject; People pollute the oceans and nature. Jason Momoa had a successful performance. In particular, he has reflected the character change very well. Willem Dafoe is an actor that everyone will enjoy watching. Willem Dafoe had to have more scenes.The film has technical errors, logic errors, clichés. But in spite of all this, the good aspects are much more. James Wan really created a separate world for the film. The underwater scenes were very good. The visuality is tremendous. Sea creatures, underwater conversations, used camera angles, location preferences, costume designs, fighting scenes, visual effects were very good. The music was just as good as the visuals. Even a separate film for Atlantis can be shot. 8/10",Aquaman
532,WylieJJordan,Uterly fantastic,6,21 December 2018,"The story is faily simple and largely predictible but only very loosely connected to reality, which may appeal to many viewers.

Nimrods, it's a movie, pay your money and enjoy the ride. The Special Effects were superb, the acting believable, only I would have chosen and different person to play Aquaman, but, hey you go with what you got.In 2015 Warner Brothers released an animated movie called Justice League: Throne of Atlantis. This movie is like the live action version of the 2015 movie, there are a few subtle changes, but the basic concept is the same. Guess it's art imitating art.For those who want to tear this movie apart, you are missing the joy of watching an entertaining movie. I say your ticket, take your seat, eat your popcorn and don't spill the drink on the floor, and enjoy the ride.Unlike Marvel, there are no Super Heroes, fighting Super Heroes for two hours, this is an action movie of the good kind. Who cares if they use wrong words to identify things, if you watch most period piece movies people are using words and terminology that wasn't invented in their time. It's called a movie for a reason, they are made for the entertainment value and not for its historical content. It's called taking creative licensing. AQUAMAN ROCKS!",Aquaman

538,andrea-brianna91,Not good,2,28 December 2018,There was tons of potential for a good story. But they didn't really develop a storyline much.

539,mrinalmmehta,My Review!,8,29 August 2019,"Aquaman, Let me put it this way, Wonder Woman - Rank 1, Aquaman - Rank 2, Batman V Superman - 3, Man of Steel - 4 and Justice League - 5. So, now you know this is a must watch.The storyline is pretty much a copy/paste from the animated world. So much is predictable. The CGI is pretty good (the designer might have got lazy here and there). I was blown away at how they managed to do a few things (won't say, it's a spoiler) and fit it so well in the storyline.Jason Momoa This huge beast is the best thing there is in the movie. The underwater CGI version of him is 8/10. Amber Heard'' did a pretty good come back.DC has pretty good characters but screenplay-writers, not all are great. It is clearly visible that the pressure from Marvel has made them rush. This did not end well for rank 3 and 5. WonderWoman and Aquaman are the key reason why DC is still afloat. Maybe, this says, DC should have done what Marvel did, story out each character and then fit them like Avengers. Justice League is this case.Peace Out!",Aquaman

Yay. - The token women get stretchy, form-fitting iridescent costumes. Most dudes get armor or tactical gear. Sea Man gets nothin' but tats, contact lenses, hair product, & motorcycle chic. WEARING BOOTS IN THE OCEAN IS DUMB. - Oh, you got your mom's magic trident weapon? That's nothing compared to your dad's 'sacred' one! Hers is ""powerful, but flawed, like her."" Nice. WHAT MISOGYNIST IS WRITING THIS?!? - ""She's crazier than I thought."" Powerful, adventurous women are 'crazy'.

Never a dull moment as it moves quickly and without long winded character expositions that have dragged down previous DC films. The underwater visuals are the gold standard here, much like Avatar did eons ago, and the action is just as breathtaking. Most of the dialogue was uninspired hero encouragement (like lesser ""with great power comes great responsibility"" and without the same emotional weight). There are a few questionable scenes/concepts that may cause some brain cells to drown themselves.My main complaint is the audio mixing, primarily with the dialogue being way too low compared to the bgm most of the time. Compounding this, they add an echo-like effect for underwater scenes, which sounds like an immersive idea but only makes the words less clear and not easily understandable.But if you see one last film this year, you can't go wrong with this.",Aquaman

The whole thing feels like a series of trailer moments. Horrible dialog. Heard is terrible and drags the movie down further. There are fun sequences for sure but the movie can't get out of its own way - it knows how corny it is but can't seem to fully accept it. The score is generic and painfully obvious.

Men on Sea Horses (sounds stupid, but works quite well). Dolph Lundgren! Some really great shots and the overall feeling of a beautifully cheesy fairy tale. And the best thing: This movie doesn't take itself more seriously than it should.Sure - it could have been, no, SHOULD have been way shorter, and it would have made the movie much better, but if James Wan has proven anything with this flick it is that you can tell the most cheesy story for the thousandth time - and it will still work, if you tell it well.I enjoyed this way more than I thought I would.",Aquaman

While I do agree that Jason Momoa makes a good Aquaman, there is not enough in this film to justify its hype. On the surface is everything you want from a popcorn movie: big fights that makes you yawn, sexy topless superhero, sibling rivalry, silly villains with crappy plans, awkward moment of comedy.But there are other popcorn movies that make you care for their characters and don't bore you to tears with nonsense fighting scenes.I wanted it to be epic, I truly did, but there is nothing original about this movie. It's okay for one viewing but if there will be an Aquaman 2 I really do hope they will up the stakes.

Jason Momoa is a stud guys.Visuals and sounds? Comparable to Avatar if you have seen it (The Trench and Karathen/Trident scenes alone are worth an Oscar my goodness) The soundtrack is addictive and amazing probably my favorite in the DCU.Acting was great and fitting especially Patrick Wilson, Jason Momoa, Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe.James Wan is simply a genius.

And Atlantis is a fun topic!However, what made Aquaman extra enjoyable to me is that it does not fight the culture war, except for a soft jibe at polluting the oceans. I saw some Marvel movie and it was increadibly politicized and preachy. That so many Hollywood movies are preachy and political have made me stop watching Hollywood movies, by and large.Another aspect where Aquaman really really excells is that it does not divide the world into good vs evil. Instead it divides the world into factions pursuing their own self interest, with varying degrees of wisdom. The main ""baddie"" in Aquaman simply has another opinion of what is best for his faction and does his best to pursue such a course of action. But he is not demonized and he is not portrayed as dishonerable, unlike in ""normal"" hollywood movies that go out of their way to demonize and crush the faction or person that is the designated ""baddie"". This was immensely refreshing to me. I will definitively check out more movies made by the same company/director/producer/writer or whoever made this movie watchable.",Aquaman

Another half-brother/family member competing for that same crown.

Not a single moment of boredom, interesting story, incredible adventure and a visual spectacle that gives us a glimpse into the glory of Atlantis. Not to mention the beautiful appearances of Amber Heard and Nicole Kidman. And Jason Momoa was perfect for the role of Aquaman.Along the exciting action scenes, the suspense and the entertainment that this movie provides, we're subtly reminded that ""the surface"" really needs to be kinder to the ocean, for we cannot leave without it, I'd recommend the film Seaspiracy to everyone, it's on Netflix.I used to read comics as a teenager but was more into marvel, so I don't share the disappointment that some of the fans have expressed, as I'm not that familiar with the origin story, but even marvel deviates many times from the comics.

Parents should know that there are a lot of jump scares and plenty of violent, scary scenes in the movie. It's directed by someone who typically directs horror movies.

580,Here_2_Review,Why is this in the DCEU? Deserves better than that...,9,1 June 2019,"So, I have watched Aquaman and I am ashamed that I almost didn't! I almost decided not to because I really hated Batman vs Superman with a passion.... AQUAMAN WAS PRETTY DANG GOOD!!!! I really hope that Aquaman 2 happens!A lot of people on a different thread of mine said that Aquaman was crap and all that... WERE WE WATCHING THE SAME MOVIE???!!!! It is the best DCEU movie since Wonder Woman. Officially a fan of Aquaman now! Did not expect the badassery in this! One of the best parts of the movie is Black Manta jumping Arthur and Mera in that small town they were in... My gosh, what an immersion!!!! The camera work, the visuals, the sfx, the fight choreography, JAMES WAN is brilliant!!!! He knows his superhero movies and his horror films XD Good stuff!!!! Black Manta turned out to be a really cool character! I thought he was only the movie opener but I was very wrong.Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master... Wow... What a performance! He is not exactly known for these kinds of movies and he really owned his role! Reminded me of Loki. He was not even corny at all! Just right! Dolph Lundgren was also really good in this movie too! He's known for his tough guy brute characters, but I really bought his performance in this.Amber Heard was also great in this. Thankfully her performance didn't suck in this and she really had some shining moments in this, especially the wine scene..... I say ""thankfully"" because I know about her irl status... At least I think it's true. Cannot picture Depp being a beater. Just cannot do it.The visual effects were absolutely beautiful..... I mean, they even handled everybody being all floaty underwater VERY well, I mean the hair, clothing, jewelry, the detail is stunning, from big and small! I was happy that I was able to take even actors who are known for brutal edgy roles seriously, like Lundgred, Dafoe, Momoa....yes I remember him very well for Khal Dragon.Everything was just done VERY well.... Any flaw that I may have noticed was very small. I noticed how in a flashback, Vulko was talking to a teenage Aquaman during pitchfork training about his mother being killed, I could tell Vulko was lying, they never touched back on that later in the film, when Aquaman's mother returns.... I also noticed that the teen's acting was not very wonderful. Wasn't horrible, but he did not put enough emotion into it.Another thing, as the movie was coming to a close, I was afraid that Black Manta's storyline wasn't gonna be revisited in the movie and was very disappointed when the movie ended, then the credits happened. I take it Manta will be the villain in part 2! That was a neat storyline. I would have preferred Manta's story be revisited during the film, but I guess it would have been too much.I was VERY impressed with how they handled the plot structure! They handled the Ocean Master storyline and Manta's very well, by having them connect in a particular way, and it was very good!One more thing, I am happy that I totally bought Aquaman and Mera's relationship in the movie. They played off each other VERY well and it all totally worked. They had wonderful chemistry! Mera's character was great! I really liked her place in the movie.I seriously hate that this and the WW franchise are part of the DCEU because they are too good for that weak universe.... They should be licensed elsewhere, however that works.One thing that reminded me of my enjoyment is how fast it went by. By the time I had paused to do something, it was already an hour in and it kinda felt like ten minutes!Overall: 9/10. A very watery, wonderful ride that really kept everything in check and was brilliantly paced and consistent, minus a couple of small errors that are totally forgettable. The role of Aquaman totally belongs to Momoa and him alone. One of my favorite more lighthearted superhero films. I gotta see more",Aquaman
581,SeriousMayhem,This is how you do it,9,11 March 2019,"I wasn't very impressed with Justice League and the first introduction of Aquaman. Quite frankly, the character Aquaman didn't do much for me to begin with. Subsequently, I was pretty sure I wasn't going to like this movie. Man, I was wrong, very wrong. This movie is one hell of a ride, from start to finish.Let's start with the CGI, because it is present in abundant amounts. It is very well done, but sometimes nears the point of being too much, especially towards the end. For me personally it never did cross that border, though, because of the simple reason that it has its place; it makes sense.The musical score, ranging from orchestral to 80's synth is a weird mix of awesomeness. Is this a case of catching a ride on the bandwagon of what seems to work for other movies/shows? Maybe, but it works, and I'm digging it. It never goes overboard.The movie doesn't take itself too serious, but still manages to stay serious enough for you too care about what happens. There's no unfunny joke every two minutes. There are some, though, which didn't bother me.Usually, this type of movie features a one-dimensional plain evil villain with a simple agenda to rule the world. Well, this movie is actually no different. However, it also features a bunch of ""villains"", which aren't quite that. It's not near as black and white as you may expect.Story-wise, it's simple and predictable, but the story is there. And it works. It's a superhero action movie, folks, not Hamlet. Enjoy the ride.All in all, great stuff. Must see for superhero movie fans. Definitely one of the better, if not the best, DC superhero movie of recent years.9,5/10. Go see it.",Aquaman

585,matthewjloller,Silly but on purpose so its fun,7,14 August 2019,"James Wan knew exactly what he was doing here. Aquaman is a return to classic cheeseball superhero cinema. The narrative may be sloppy. The music may not always set the appropriate tone. The villain may be way over the top. But you will have a blast with this movie! Aquaman is here to entertain, and entertain it does. The themes are hinted at throughout, but the main goal of Wan is to have a good time even if that means throwing all logic out the window. If you are the type to over analyze movies, this is not for you.

586,darioilg,Classic intro to a new superhero that shoots every single bullet available,4,12 January 2019,"I've been a superhero comics fan my whole life, so I was extremely excited at the idea of Aquaman having a legitimate movie of his own, less so that it would be in the low-quality context of the DCEU.First off, Momoa was a great casting choice for the man himself: he has the energy and looks to actually make a lesser superhero very charismatic nonetheless. The problem comes with almost everything else: the other members of the cast have nothing interesting to give their characters, not even the ""queen"" herself Nicole Kidman, and the plot is... just a mess. It's a fun mess, but a mess still. What I mean is that Aquaman has an interesting mythos, but also a limited one: the authors managed to stuff the plot with Orm, Manta, the War between Land and Sea, the trial of the Trident AND the Trench, a newer and awesome addition to the canon of recent years. Now, this has consequences: the story makes no sense, of course, but this has to be taken into account when watching a superhero flick (a DC superhero flick, rather); the story is so absurd it's fun and funny: I found myself laughing at some of the most bombastic and/or cliche scenes, but this is not necessarily a bad thing; last, but not least: this makes it incredibly hard for a sequel to happen. I know DC is already considering throwing away the whole project, and I'm honestly happy with that, but the team could've focused on fewer plot points, delivering a sharper, shorter film, instead of burning every cartridge with a long and messy one.",Aquaman

Great casting in Amber Heard as she's in 90% of the movie and makes Mara as powerful as she's meant to be.
The whole cast did an amazing job and should be commended.
The CGI is top notch and REALLY REALLY needed to be for this film to stand any chance.
James Wan made a film thats up there with all the other superhero offerings.
DC are finally on a role with Wonder Woman and now this,so PLEASE DC keep it going.

590,iamjacksmoviechannel,A True Underwater pleasure,7,22 December 2018,"So the best Aqua-version doesn't come from James Cameron and Vinnie Chase anymore but from James Wan and Jason Mamoa.Mamoa is Arthur, the son of a love affair between a human and the fish queen of Atlantis. A grown-up Arthur wants nothing to do with his mother's kingdom but is called upon to stop his half-brother from starting a war with the surface world.And Mamoa's got this, turning what is a silly looking character into a true Son of Anarchy. He checks off all the boxes, the physique, the brood, the macho rough-necking, and the funny.Really the whole cast is excellent here. He's got good chemistry with Amber Heard, who trades comic barbs and personal lessons with him, and fights well, but will be remembered most for this.Willem Dafoe shows up sporting a man bun as Arthur's former mentor, Nicole Kidman plays Arthur's mom.Patrick Wilson plays the half-brother, he does a fine job, but runs into the problem that usually plagues Marvel villains of having nothing to do after a while.I much preferred Manta, a villain with a legit reason for wanting revenge on Arthur.Most of these fish people talk perfectly underwater, which is silly, but the way they're able to see underwater is a gorgeous effect that rivals Avatar.Really everything from the action sequences, sets, costumes is a fantastical visual. Is it going for realism? Well at one point we see an octopus playing bongo drums so you tell me.Point is- it's pretty zany mix of things you might see in a Thor film and Pixar film and it's fun.Much of this focuses on a magical trident and fish people angry over pollution. Do we care? To a point. 2 hours and 20 minutes of this is a little much though and there should have been more of an effort to curb that.Overall this is fun, thrilling, and a visual pleasure with a real star turn from Mamoa.

592,lurpak,The Aquaman Game,4,26 January 2019,"While watching this film my sone and I devised the Aquaman game. The premise is simple. You watch this film with a timer running and a pen and notepad. Every time you see a line, concept, scene or cliche which is undeniably stolen from another film you write the time and the reference down. The person with the most wins.The whole film is just scenes from some of the most successful films of all time, strung together in some sort of ""guaranteed formula"" concept of ensuring success, that patently has failed to work.
IIt'snot a bad film, it's not as terrible as people make out, but it has too many plot holes and failures to allow yourself to escape into the universe and put the faults behind you to make any real constructed frame which makes the film whole. But, no joke its like watching every film you have ever seen before strung into one, with scenes from star wars, Warcraft, harry potter, game of thrones, how to train your dragon,""King Arthur"", Avatar, Finding Nemo, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribean, Hercules....and I don't mean these are similar themes, they are full identifiable scenes!Throughout the film you question choices of rational, like why did the mother stay away so long? it tries to explain, but the answer doesnt make sense?

598,neobateman,Rousing excitement.,7,5 January 2019,"Aquaman is the latest installment in DC's cinematic universe. Their sets of films have generally left me personally, with mixed reactions. I enjoyed Wonder Woman's refreshingly emotional narrative and Justice League's lighthearted chemistry between the main cast. Films like Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad however suffered strongly from overly convoluted stories and unlikable characters. Aquaman luckily succeeds with the adventure formula, presenting a exciting, fun and action packed narrative headed with a charismatic lead actor. When a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison) shares a romance with the Queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman) results in the birth of a half blood son, Arthur (Jason Momoa). The Queen is forced to return to Atlantis where she is sacrificed for her treachery. This fuels the hate within Arthur's half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to wage war with the surface world. In order to protect humanity Arthur is trained and helped by Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and Mera (Amber Heard) to go on a deadly mission to dethrone Orm. A story that has been seen a zillion times in superhero movies I feel. But what makes Aquaman so much fun is it's fast paced energy, charismatic performances, production design and action scenes. Jason Momoa really puts his stamp on the character of Arthur Curry, a drifter who has no will or ambition to become the King. He shares great father / son chemistry with Morrison where the audience really buys their loving relationship. Unfortunately the character becomes less significant as the story gets going. Kidman for her limited amount of screen time shows off prowess, strength and beauty. Patrick Wilson is a competent villain, certainly the best in the entire DCEU, there was potential at the start to make him more than a two dimensional bad guy. Unlike Killmonger this arc feels unfinished and the villain loses the initial interest. However unlike Steppenwolf, Ares, Zod and especially Lex Luthor, there was a actually a sense of threat that functioned about Wilson. His ambition and blood thirst makes him effective but nothing special, he is a standard MCU villain. Willem Dafoe also has great chemistry with Momoa as this mentor figure and it was certainly nice to see Dafoe in a superhero film again. However there also were some let downs in the acting department, Amber Heard is wooden and shares no chemistry with Momoa. I fully understand why Wan decided to cast Dolph Lundgren in this movie, but he unfortunately is an incredibly stiff actor that doesn't even possess this guilty pleasure 1980s charisma (something that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris or Christopher Lambert perfected). Some of the cgi effects still look unconvincing especially a deaging effect used on a certain actor. The story is contrived and thin and is only supposed to lead from one action scene to the next, from one exotic and interesting location to another. And as this, Aquaman succeeds. Fans of adventure serials and lighthearted superhero movies look no further. For those who look for something with more depth (no pun intended) should perhaps stay away. This is not comparable with The Dark Knight, The Winter Soldier, Logan or Infinity War. But for fans of Brendan Fraser's The Mummy will feel right at home.",Aquaman
599,jgreed-49807,Music score sucked,7,25 December 2018,"Thought it was awesome story outside of black manta and the music score. I'm black so I don't know if the over all origin of black manta was forced for sake of the comics 20 years ago or if he was thrown in at last minute for this movies sake, but regardless it didn't fit in at all. The animated dc movie aquaman vs Wonder Woman and otter versions of black manta have been better in my opinion.The score was garbage. I'm one of those ppl who will literally go out and buy music based on the movie. I at no time enjoyed any of the music (classical type was fine).All that being said, it was awesome. Aquamans half bro was nicely cast. The red heads father was great. Jason mamoa awesome. Great movie which seasoned with mythology.Other than black guy and music great movie.",Aquaman
600,sugardaddy-31900,Cheesy in a can,3,3 April 2019,"This was awful. Cliche to the max and a god awful storyline. Everything about this movie was crap. So predictable and so boring.
I watched it till the end just so I could say I watched it all as I'm warning people off of it.
If you want the worst kind of cheesy and cliche, watch Battlefield L.A or this. It's really that bad.",Aquaman
601,thetyvonlesure,Terrible Movie,2,17 June 2019,"To say that Aquaman is disappointing is an understatement. The story takes every cliche you've ever seen in an action adventure film and marries it with Superheroes. None of these characters receive respect from the filmmakers. The humor is forced. The characters and story contradict themselves. The CGI varies from amazing to bad. The tone is inconsistent. The soundtrack/score is incohesive. This movie doesn't know if it wants to be Man of Steel or Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Overall, this is an incredibly lazy/generic movie that is carried by an all star cast.",Aquaman

I will still give it a 10 because of reasons I mentioned on my profile.",Aquaman
603,politicidal,DC finally learns the most important lession from the MCU: PURE IMAGINATIVE FUN!,8,24 December 2018,"AQUAMAN is one of the strangest superhero movies ever made and it is also one hell of a crowd pleasing popcorn flick. It sucessfully combines action, adventure, fantasy, romance, and even horror in spectacular fashion!Director James Wan (The Conjuring; Furious 7) handles the gargantuan scale with gusto, unafraid to embrace the absolute absurdity that comes with a superhero that can talk to fish. Atlantis is a glistening metropolis of aquatic creatures, skyscrapers made of lava and coral, and technology that would feel at home in a Star Wars movie. Aquaman battles sea monsters that look like the offspring of the Xenomorph while underwater gladiators ride atop giant seahorses, laser equipped sharks, or even draconic leviathans.The movie looks HUGE and the action scenes are outstanding. They put most of the recent DC movies to shame, with perhaps only being rivaled by the unfairly maligned Man of Steel. Instead of having to rescue a city of human civilians, Aquaman has to fend for the lives of his fellow Atlanteans plus crab people, and even mermaids!If the movie was po faced and self serious, it would fall apart and result in a disaster. But James Wan luckily remembers how much fun and joy can be had in a superhero story. The visuals are bright and wondrously imaginative while the tone is pleasantly cheerful.Jason Momoa is a swaggering roguish hero that smiles at danger and cracks one-liners aplomb instead of frowning in scorn, That is Patrick Wilson's job as the villainous Ocean Master (yes you read correctly). And with a name like that, he hams it right up. Momoa has the chops to be a strong likable action lead. As Princess Mera, Amber Heard acquits herself to the action surprisingly well but unfortunately, some of her lines are wooden.Indeed, their romance is one of the weaker links of the movie. But due to the movie's earnest sincerity and the buoyant spirit, it remains digestible. Also there is a key character who is built up as a major villain (even remaining true stylistically to the comics). But then is promptly dispatched as soon as they appear. Patrick Wilson is appropriately smarmy and haughty as Aquaman's half brother King Orm (aka Ocean Master). But it feels odd he doesn't have this other antagonist at his side as a henchman in the big climax.It may sound hokey but there is a heart to the proceedings that falls back on the warm family ties between Aquaman and his parents (Morrison; Kidman). Their family dynamic clearly serving as a metaphor of biracial families. And isn't it nice to see a superhero movie where both parents are still alive?Aquaman is yet another step in the right direction for Warner Brothers' DC film franchise. It's a blast from start to finish with outrageous action and an enormous sense of fun.",Aquaman
604,pokedom,Alright who peed in the ocean?,3,21 December 2018,"While I can tell that an effort was made to make this movie good, Aquaman still reeks of untapped potential, completely goofy and dumb moments, and all the cheese you've come to expect from the DCEU. I went in open minded, as I had heard good things about this movie. I left pretty disappointed, and even kinda baffled. They thought this was enough to redeem the cinematic universe? It isn't.We'll start with the cons and then work our way to the pros. If a movie has more pros than cons I start with those first, but more cons than pros I go with cons first. There's a lot to wade through, so bear with me.* Horrific overcompensation of the character of Aquaman. With powers as lame on paper as ""can breathe underwater"" and ""can talk to fish"", they tried making him an utterly unstoppable beast with as many muscles as possible. ""He can chug a whole glass in a second!"" ""He doesn't even flinch at bullets!"" ""He can bend steel!"" Am I describing Aquaman or a mad science experiment with a heavy emphasis on drinking? The dude is completely invincible except for when the script needs him to be weak, like when he's fighting his brother in the first act and gets his butt handed to him.* Awful effects. I swear half the sea creatures are missing frames of animation. Anything that was designed for the movie looks just plain ugly. For a movie mostly set underwater you would think it would be more magical than what I'm seeing here. Seeing characters float around and interact with each other underwater also comes with an awful microphone effect. I get its underwater but it sounds broken. Also really bad green-screen. It sticks out a lot and you can tell at all times.* Boring as hell. People sitting near me were taking naps and not missing anything. Interspersed with the action and effects are, at minimum, 20 minute scenes consisting of underwater politics and Aquaman talking with his red haired lady friend. Nothing is achieved with these scenes. Sometimes its plot relevant but most of the time it really isn't.* BAAAAAAAAD soundtrack. Whoever gave Pitbull and Rhea the green light to ruin Africa by Toto should be thrown into the trench with Aquaman's mom, then we should throw Pitbull in there too. The rest is that mystical ""wow look at this scenery"" music, thrown in with synth ripped straight from Thor Ragnarok and other bland music similar to Pitbull. Seriously no one likes Pitbull. He's a joke in the music industry and he shouldn't be allowed near movies ever.* Speaking of Ragnarok, this movie is trying really really hard to be Ragnarok. A strong man who thinks he's got it all has to learn how to be a leader after being exiled by a relative bent on conquering all that is. Wow that's the same exact plot description as Ragnarok. On top of the half synth soundtrack and reliance on CG I just felt like I was watching, and forgive me for this, a watered down Ragnarok.* The twists and turns this movie goes through don't add up to much, and you can see them coming from the horizon.* When the action works, it works. When it doesn't, it really doesn't. Stop getting fancy with the camera! The first two action scenes are great. They don't move the camera much, hell the first one is a one-take. Oceanmaster vs Aquaman in the first act was awful. There's this moment where the camera zooms out to them being little specks on a statue, and you can barely see what's going on. I don't care about the statue, I care about the two men with pointy sticks! Is it because they're fighting over something bigger than themselves? Just keep the action on them, their actions speak much louder symbolically than the statue. Black Manta vs Aquaman was also lame, Oceanic Warfare in the third act was just baffling, and the rematch at the end was also lame. Why is it so inconsistent? You had it right the first time!* Costume design was just plain goofy. The Aquaman suit looks super dumb. The Oceanmaster suit looks like LEGO. Black Manta's suit looks simply idiotic in broad daylight, and of course that's the only time they use it. Atlanticops (the police people in the red and white suits from Atlantis) all look stupid.* Positives now. Like I said the first two action scenes are great. One takes will always make me happy in any movie, and one take action scenes are very impressive. The second scene where Aquaman is taking out the pirates is also great. Even though its just more Aquaman compensation, the sound design and close quarters action makes this look and feel brutal.* Black Manta, as a character, is great. Easily the best thing about the movie. It's dumb that the first thing he does with Atlantis technology is vandalize it, but other than that he's awesome. Reminds me a lot of Killmonger, who was also one of the better things about the movie he was in.* I'm happy that Aquaman isn't just given all the strength in the world right away. He's really strong but he still has room to grow, and needs to learn new things to get an edge on people that have been waiting for this moment for years and years.* I think that's it.TL;DR, this movie is bad and isn't worth your time. DCEU has done nothing but disappoint for... what, 5 movies now? Of course they won't die, we've been saying ""DC's goose is cooked!"" since Suicide Squad and nothing has changed. So just keep away and let the tide pull this one out to sea.",Aquaman
605,jon_hsieh,Nostalgic feeling of Power Rangers the TV series.,5,10 January 2019,"Its been about 25 years since ive watched Power Rangers TV series and somehow James Wan nailed it even with all and technological advances in cinema.Average movie and bit over the top with a bunch of cliche's. James Wan over did it numerous times. How do you hire a director with a horrror/thriller background and not have one ounce of it in the movie. Everything is predictable. When i went to film school your taught TONE. James missed this concept completely by jumping around everywhere. Batman felt like Batman throughout the whole movie. In Aquaman, i didnt know if i was watching a comedy, romance, action or dark action. What the hell waa going on? Excited much?Acting was decent. DP was fairly good.
Entertaining movie to watch with the kids. Nothing worthy of a clap.",Aquaman

Just nothing that quite stuck out or made it memorable.

But is PG +13 with no charming for audience to watch, i mean, a whole movie it's just like reveange with no good message.

The CGI was quite good, not something in particular I would point out but still good. The costumes overall were great except for the last costume aqua man wore which looked...well... different is the word. The storyline was a bit all over the place at times but about a quarter of the way through the movie it becomes a bit more clear. This film unlike most other dc films had some comedy in it rather than another 'seriously dark' dc movie. Most dc films are quite dark and barely have any comedy. It needs that balance of comedy to get the audience laughing but still a deep movie at the same time. Too much comedy and the movie feels like a joke but too much deep stuff and you feel like your eternally falling through a black hole, if you know what I'm saying. There was the 'I'm going to blow you up every five seconds' which is pretty much in every dc film (apart from wonder woman and the original batman trilogy). It was a good film and by any means watch it but if you are looking for a go to dc superhero/hero film, the batman trilogy is the way to go.

The special effects were astonishing in this movie, the way they made you believe they were really under water and breathing! The scope of the movie was amazing and the story held your interest. I would have rated it a 10, but here comes the, BUT! The vilian and men in the submarine their acting and parts to me were flawed. For me this is where it became cheesy and none of it just didn't seem to fit. In fact I think just leaving the villian being the brother would have worked fine for the movie. The whole submarine bit in the beginnning and the making of the vilian because Aquaman left his Dad to die just didn't work or seem to fit for me. This is something that they could have done better with if they wanted it to work, it just seemed to be a side bar that doesn't fit in the scheme of things. If they had done it up better or just left this out, then for me it would have been an easy 10! Otherwise a great addition to the DC family and one I would recommend to go see if you haven't!",Aquaman

Jason Mamoa was excellent as Aqauman and I can't imagine another actor in the role doing as good a job as him! The movie had the perfect balance of great action, humor, drama, and emotion! The special effects looked amazing! The only complaint I really have is that I thought it was a bit too long and could have been a bit shorter!Overall, this is easily the best DC Movie yet and one of the best superhero movies of the year!

It seems that DCEU have learned from their mistakes and understood the taste of the common audience, the movie follows a medium tone which is a heartwarming visual treat.Aquaman makes a slow progress in the first half where we get to understand Altantis and its people but it is not at all boring due to the beauty of Altantis which is a major highlight in the movie. The second half is the heart of this movie filled with action sequences which have the potential to provide goosebumps especially the classic suit scene and climax fight is one hell of a fight.Jason Momoa has brought Aquaman to life. His performance as Aquaman cannot be defined in words. William Dafoe And Dolph Lundgren have served their purpose of portraying two strong supporting characters of Atlantis. Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard succeds in enhancing the beauty of the movie and proves their might as Atlanna and Mera. Patrick Wilson(King Orm) and Yahya Abdul -Mateen II(Black Manta) provides the seriouness that the movie deserves at some point. They are excellent in their roles.On the whole the movie is a must watch in 3D for its visual effects and strong acting performances. James Wan have provided us with a visual feast which is filled with action sequences, comedy and Wan also adds his special touch by adding some horror element using the Trench Monsters.

At the time of writing, this is probably my favourite solo superhero movie! It was so entertaining, the visuals were like nothing else you've ever seen, the story was coherent (well done DC) the action never stops yet doesn't get exhausting, the pacing is perfect, even the 'back in time' scenes slot in well and never become dull, and they are usually an annoyance of mine! Mera is a strong and awesome female character, without them having to shove feminism down your throat, Kidman, Defoe and Lungdren are superb, as os Wilson, Moama naturally and rightly steals the show ... There's not much else to add really, to pull off an underwater movie like Waan has done here is a true feat, I just hope people go and see it and haven't been put off by previous offerings from DC (even though I have personally liked them all) if you come out of this movie not having truely enjoyed it, you are either biased to a scary level or are dead inside!If you want to be picky, the 'selfie' scene joke falls flat and it gets a bit busy in the end underwater battle scene, but if any of that bothers you, you've gone in to it with a negative attitude and looking for issues!",Aquaman

629,Ceredon1,One of the better DC flicks but still a 6.,6,28 December 2018,"DC movies always seem to come up short (though their tv series are absolutely the worst). Having said that this one was one of their better showings.Not sure how much they paid Nicole Kidman to stoop down to being in this film but they gave her horrible, stunted lines. She honestly seemed very out of place and I don't blame her for that.There was no reason for it to be such a long movie. Seemed to want to have big CGI scenes just for the sake of having them. Also they seemed to be very confused as to how indestructible aquaman should be. In one scene he eats a RPG to the chest (who the hell brings an RPG on a submarine?) and it barely stuns him and he takes no physical damage. He takes a plasma blast (that earlier vapourized a huge boulder) and gets back up with some superficial burns. He jumps out of a plane from hundreds of feet in the air and just rolls his landing. Yet he is stabbed by a plain old dagger (and not just the Atlantian blades).Anyway, it was a fun movie and for all it's flaws I enjoyed it. I can't put my finger on why marvel movies are always so much better but I think a part of it is that they don't take themselves too seriously (or are able to give that impression). That might be why this was one of the better DC films, in that they seemed to just have fun for the most part (but not entirely).",Aquaman

It's a pod of second rate b-list celebrities that are phoning in their performances in front of a green screen. There has to be bigger fish in the sea than the mess they managed to bait for this deep water grave.The music is absolutely horrendous. I think somebody got the wrong fish on the hook. They hired Rupert Gregson-Williams, brother of the respected composer Harry Gregson-Williams. And it's apparent. The music switches between Jarre inspired synthesizer and stupid little guitar motifs that feels more at home in a 1990's Zimmer soundtrack.
There is no originality in this wreck whatsoever and all you get are the leftover chum and clichés from other composers and movies. It's insultingly amateurish.The whole movie follows that pattern. And I'm not surprised. this movie has 5 writers, 1 director and over 10 producers. it lacks a strong captain.
At no point does it feel like a coherent story. It's more like 3-4 different scripts was shoot 3-4 times by 3-4 different people, and then they pasted together the ""best"" parts. When ever the story tries to float it sinks like an anchor.This movie is an absolute assault on taste and intelligence. It's mindbogglingly bad.

I think they sacrificed too much of the story for more action. It felt like they were trying too hard to include too much for 1 movie. I think it might have been better served splitting it up into 2 parts but then it wouldn't have been as exciting. This movie really needed a good writer, someone who could have condensed the story into something that flowed more smoothly. The dialogue was at times silly and out of place. Momoa trying to be funny is like Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to be funny as the Terminator, awkward. Momoa is a great straight man, he has good comedic timing and had some really funny moments in Stargate Atlantis when he wasn't trying to be funny. If they wanted humor in this movie, they should have used the same technique vs. using corny jokes.Maybe because I'm older and grew up watching movies with incredible actors and dialogue but the CGI stuff doesn't impress me that much. Some of it was incredible some of it was just off and made the scenes look fake. I knew it was CGI and what they were showing was inaccurate, it took me out of the movie. I admire the movies that use CGI but don't make me aware of it. There were times I wished I'd had a remote control so I could fast forward through parts that were just way too drawn out. I wasn't crazy about the music, at times it didn't enhance the story and sometimes it was downright distracting. I think the music and background noises were overpowering, making it more difficult to understand what was being said.I like Momoa as an actor, he is visually impressive but I still can't wrap my head around him being Aquaman. It was like he as an actor didn't believe he was Aquaman? Nicole Kidman's performance was not all that believable either. Maybe it was the CGI or lack of great dialogue but it didn't pull me in. The antagonists were the worst, their lines were laughable. I'm reminded of a quote from W.C. Fields ""If you can't dazzle them with Brilliance than Baffle them with Bulls##t"" they tried to dazzle us with Brilliant imagery so we didn't notice all the Bulls##t.I love Super Hero movies but the biggest problem I have with them is they try too hard to be epic. Yeah I want a Hero and action but I want a good story as well. Too many times the story gets lost in the struggle to make it more Epic than the last Super Hero movie. I hate that they're always trying to outdo each other with action and special effects at the cost of the story. If you have a good story you don't need epic battles. I think this movie really sacrificed story for action. It's like when you go to a buffet and you eat a little of everything but you don't get enough of the few really good things. When you leave you're full but not satisfied. Although there were some great moments in the move it left me unsatisfied.",Aquaman
638,TheJohnnyPHreak,Wild Well Direction Crazy Fun Superhero Action Ride,9,23 March 2019,"Interviewer: Our next film I would like to ask you about is Aquaman...JohnnyPHreak: Dude! Holy wow. I mean no disrespect when I say this but Aquaman is the most fun movie to come out of DC/WB.Interviewer: Can you elaborate on that?JohnnyPHreak: Wonder Woman is fantastic. I love that film. Gal Gadot is Diana/Wonder Woman to a T. The film has a decent story, great emotional beats, and some fun action sequences. There are comedic elements and it so cool to watch. It does so much for actress, female-led superhero movies and I don't want to compare them at all. Aquaman is a bananas fun fantasy ride, that us DC Comics fans have been waiting for.Interviewer: So you take DC over Marvel?JohnnyPHreak: If you were to put me on the spot I would easily take DC over Marvel only because DC has my favorite comic book character of all time, Superman. Let me explain Aquaman. I'm not a huge of the character. He's not one of my favorites. But when we finally got to see him serious in the comics and animated films, it did the character justice. (No pun intended) Jason Momoa's take is a bit different but equally as cool and confident. He's not just a man who can talk to fish. He's a bridge between worlds. He's this powerful being who's also a total badass. He's having so much fun being this character is drips off-screen. I can't wait to see more of him. And I hope we get to see more of him interacting with other DC superheroes. One day I'll explain my love of the Justice League movie.Interviewer: Can you give us some of the plot details for those who haven't been following the story?JohnnyPHreak: It's actually pretty simple. Arthur Curry, Aquaman, is half human half Atlantian. His mother fell in love with a human and they had him. His half brother Orm, hates him and the land dwellers, they declare war on the land from the sea. In order to save his world and all of the world, Aquaman has to team up soon to be queen Mira (Amber Heard) to prove to Atlantis that he is the one true king. One the way he makes enemies of a train pirate who goes by Black Manta. The film jumps all over the world in a fun fantasy adventure with elements of Indiana Jones, The Fifth Element and even some old school monster movies.Interviewer: Much as been said about the cast, how are they in this film?JohnnyPHreak: As I said earlier, Momoa is excellent as the Aquaman and easily carries the film whenever he's on screen. Amber Heard is very good as Mira. She's not the helpless damsel in distress. She's a soon to be a queen that cares about her people, her land and is just as capable of kick-ass as Aquaman. The filmmakers did her well. Patrick Wilson as Orm is okay, you get his ideology. He likes to chew scenery and is very over the top in his portrayal but it fits the film he's in. Willem Dafoe is the excellent mentor role, bring his talents to the character. The scene stealer of the film is Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Manta. He effectively in what screen time he has to give DC film fans the best villain they've had in all of the DC live action films. His character has weight, style and a personal attachment/grudge with Aquaman. It gives him more depth than most superhero villains get to have. I can't wait to see more of him.Interviewer: This is a big action film, how are the action sequences and direction?JohnnyPHreak: I'm not saying this as hyperbole, James Wan is the best action director working today. He has a few other directors on his heels but I would place him at the time. The action scenes in this film are wild. They are so well shot, so much fun and pretty crazy. He doesn't put himself in a box. He goes for broke and they all shine when happening. There's an opening sequence with Nicole Kidman's Atlanna (who she is great in this) that looks to be filmed in one take. It's jaw-dropping. The film uses neon colors and sets to express this is a fantasy world and it pops. This is a trippy watch but so enjoyable. Wan even gets to go back to his roots with one sequence that is very horror inspired. It's probably my favorite scene in the movie. It's violent, kind of terrifying and feeds into my need for Wan to make a monster movie.
Interviewer: Any final thoughts about Aquaman?JohnnyPHreak: James Wan has created a wonderfully rich and deep universe here with his first superhero entry Aquaman. The whole cast is great with Momoa, Heard, and Abdul-Mateen II being the standouts. The film looks beautiful, including a bunch of sequences shot in IMAX. The action is wild, easy to watch and just fun. The story is not that deep but it spans all over the world. It has the best elements of Indiana Jones with none of the Crystal Skull. All fans of DC should have seen this on the big screen because it's worth the price of admission. But if they couldn't see it in 4K because the transfer is gorgeous. Aquaman was one of my favorite films of 2018 and is now tied for my second favorite DC Comic live action film.",Aquaman

640,CinematicGarbage,It's not a waste of popcorn to be brought to this movie,4,1 May 2019,"Aquaman (2018) is the latest movie directed by the director of Saw (2004), Insidious (2010), The Conjuring (2013),.., James Wan. He's known as one of the most talented modern movie directors. I haven't seen his horror movies but I saw a few clips and they were scary. And now, he took a challenge on a superhero movie: Aquaman (2018).
Starring Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman, Amber Heard as Princess Mera, Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master/Orm, Willem Dafoe as Vulko. I'm okay with how they acted, there's nothing bad but the problem is that the screenplay was really childish, making the acting a bit childish. In that case, Jason just made Aquaman not really one true king but more like one funny king.
The plot is about a man arthur curry born by a father from the land and a mother from the sea. When his mother went away, he heard that he had a brother, who tried to conquer his mother's land Atlantis and he had to stop his brother to be king. A bit childish right? I saw many superhero plots are like this and this is quite normal and sometimes too easy. I really like the jokes they had done to the movie. I laughed at many scenes, especially when Arthur realized that peeing on the...(I don't know how to call it) a thing is much better then Mera taking his sweat from his forehead into...that thing. It made me giggled.
""Showoff! You could have just peed on it!""
--Aquaman--
The action scenes were quite epic as Atlantis looked better than a paradise with underwater technology and high-tech ships and other transports. People wore robotic armors and creative weapons. The battles are quite unforgettable with stunts here and there and also explosions and disasters.The CGI was mind-blowing and jaw-dropping. It was surpring that the budget was just $200 million but the box office had crushed a lot: $1,147 billion. But for the CGI, Aquaman (2018) wouldn't have had its box office so high like this. It was totally worth a good DCEU movie. I also liked the costumes: the robotic armor with suitable colours and they even put some on animals like sharks or a few more unreal creatures.
I like the score. It made us feel like we're in a high-tech paradise. Rupert Gregson-Williams did a good job with the original score. It was really good and it sounded like Tron. I had no idea how he made those sounds (as long as it's not orchestra like John Williams). I wasn't just relaxed but I also felt really impressed because it's really satisfying like Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle or Black Panther.
I like Aquaman a lot, though it was really childish at the screenplay. It is one of the best, most mind-blowing, jaw-dropping and unforgettable movies in the DC extended universe. I recommend people like wars underwater should watch this movie.
Points: 7.4/10",Aquaman
641,NarniaIsAwesome,Aquaman is... Corny and Terribly Written.,3,9 January 2019,"Not being a superhero fan, I was surprised when I was impressed with 2017's 'Justice League.' Aquaman was actually my least favorite character, but the trailers for his own movie showed sea monsters, and that sold it. So I saw it.For starters, the script (written by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall) is absolutely awful. Not only can you predict the outcome of the story from the moment the title comes up, but the dialogue is bone chillingly bad. It is even full of cliches like the ""du du DU!"" music that plays when the villain says something ""scary."" It also contains things that I never wanted to see or know, like an octopus playing drums, and the fact that apparently Aquaman doesn't wear deodorant.And then we come to the cast: a fair enough group tainted by terrible lines. Jason Momoa (Aquaman) quotes his ill-timed one liners with all the dignity of smoked ham. So... yeah. Amber Heard (Ariel-Meara) graces the screen as your standard ""tough superhero girlfriend"" with all the dignity of, again, a smoked ham. Patrick Wilson (the evil Orm) is generally a talented actor, but is ruined by cliche ""bad guy"" yelling. Willem Dafoe is impossible to take seriously after his role in 'Mr. Bean's Holiday.' Dolph Lundgren rides a giant seahorse - and that's about it. And finally we come to Nichole Kidman, who looks lovely and doesn't botch her lines or performance. She should be apologized to for working with these people.The visuals are amazing, if a bit overwhelming at times. The most impressive advancement of Atlantis is their waterproof make-up. It's almost 2 hours into the movie before we see the creatures promised to us in the trailer. They are truly the highlight of the film and mostly the reason for my 3 star rating.This is a long, lingering, rather dull movie and only watchable if there's nothing else to rent at the video store: Carson Clay's 'Playback Time.' I mean, uh, 'Aquaman!'",Aquaman
642,macfaefan,Beautifully colorful,9,30 December 2018,"Good story. Good acting. Good character placement.
Grandsons loved it. Grandmother enjoyed it..",Aquaman
643,robh,Gave up,2,23 April 2019,Watched about half the movie on blue ray and then switched it off. Luckily it was a $2 special rental.The story was a yawnfest and the underwater vocals too weird to get used to.I feel sorry for the cast who would have been doing their best in front of a green screen and unaware of how dire the end product was going to turn out.,Aquaman
644,mattclap28,Better By DC,7,27 December 2018,"Ok lets get this straight, Aquaman is a decent enough film. There is plenty to be excited about and its visually spectacular. Hell if we went by the first ten minutes this would be a ten. DC always does what DC does, thats take itself too seriously. Ant Man and Deadpool are perfect examples from Marvel where you practically take the piss out of yourself and still be great. DC are known for darkness are mystery, Aquaman is meant to be light hearted.
This movie in particular as stated earlier starts off excellent, character development and storyline. Also off the bat Jason Momoa is perfect for the role with his wit and general persona. The actual main plot is very thin though (even for Dolph Lundgren standards). Im by no means saying dont go, however just lower your expectations a little bit. Its overly long for what it needs to be.",Aquaman
645,angelicseven,Dolph Lundgren would of been better choice,4,4 April 2021,"This aquaman looks like a cross between god poseidon and a criminal. I couldn't watch the movie in its entirety, not just because of such but, cause aquaman was always known to have short blonde hair and be clean shaven. Which Dolph Lundgren would of better fit the part. Only thing good about it was the beautiful under water scenery and special effects. Not a movie I would care to watch over and over.",Aquaman
646,mr-whyte,Fun of you're 14,6,15 December 2018,"Action is good, pace of the movie is good, dialogue is mediocre, story is ok. If you're into superhero movies definitely go see it, but it isn't the best you've seen. Enjoyable nonsense.",Aquaman
647,The_Sonuverse,Superhero movies have never been this good,9,14 December 2018,"So what do you know about any superhero movie? It has good the origin story, a conflict and resolution. but Not this one, The movie starts with the pre-origin of Arthur Curry (loosely based on New 52 comics) when his mother Queen Atlanna meets a surface dweller Thomas ""Tom"" Curry, a light house keeper. She spends about 2 years with him and has a baby named after an hurricane ""Arthur Curry"" later to be known as Aquaman. Before you even dwell into the aquaman/arthur curry's story line you come to see a beautiful lovestory between the parents. and eventually same continues between Mera and Arthur.This wasn't just an other superhero/comic book movie, this had all elements of surprises with various kingdoms of the sea (Trench & brine) The emotional development of characters like Thomas, Atlanna, Manta/BlackManta and even our very own Patrick Wilson's King Orm. He isn't a regular villain who wants to take over the world, he has a right agenda and equally justified reason to hate surface dwellers, its just his way of doing this isn't politically correct though.The editing/Narration of the film takes you places, literally. I love how transitions are shown through Water/Sun and those time jumps.I could go on and on about this, but to sum it all up.... I felt like a child while watching this movie. I was so fascinated looking at all the visuals, characters and the beautifully narrated story-line.PS: Watch out for BlackManta and Shin ;)",Aquaman

Special effects, soundtrack, unique and epic costumes. 3D surprised me, I was so fascinated by the visual quality of this film. All the scenes of the action are good and the final EPIC battle. James Wan as a director, unique and his great work was noticed. It is a film made to surprise, excite and love this movie, it is one of the best of the DCEU and an incredible surprise. The best movie of the year.",Aquaman
650,running_with_scissors,Enjoyable but forced in places.,7,31 December 2018,"Firstly its nice to have a fun superhero movie, not something dark and gritty. This is how Superman should be.I like Momoa, he delivers.There's parts however that are just poor, really bad writing such as the child with a ridiculously coincidental Pinnochio book as a gift, the clichéd story arc of a person who is dead that you know is not really dead.I think the constant bombardment of visual entertainment helped hide most of how shallow the movie really was and as such was my favourite DC movie so far.",Aquaman
651,Chillihead1,Well,7,24 August 2019,"What an odd film, it appears to have been written by a 12 year old who manages to cram every boys fantasy weapon,super power and love interest into its rather long story. Sharks that you ride, whales that are hollow, a baddie taken from Blade, guns that convert seawater, a colossal undersea world that we somehow missed. I could go on but it would spoil the film. There is no real plot, we are told the outcome in the first 3 minutes, Nicole Kidman has a fish suit that appears to age, there is no real explanation of what she had been doing for the 20 odd years that she went off grid. Bottom line, the film is complete fantasy with strange humour thrown in amongst gruesome fifer scenes. Very disjointed, almost as though 3 children had conspired to outdo each other then random bits of each story were cobbled together. BUT I actually enjoyed it.",Aquaman
652,SharkByteAudioProductions,James Wan does the DCEU 'Justice' with Aqua Man,9,19 December 2018,"After Arthur Curry aka Aqua Man was properly introduced in Justice League, I felt the character was lacking and wasn't given enough material to work with. Justice League left a bland taste in my mouth but I'm very happy to say Aqua Man is excellent!Essential it's the DC equivalent of Thor Ragnarok; the visuals are amazing with an explosion of colours on screen which were actually goosebump inducing at times and the action is the best seen in the DCEU yet! The choreography and wide camera shots mean you can track every fight scene and really see the impact of the fight. The battles are just epic in scale and destructionThe story has definitely cemented Arthur Curry's place in the DCEU, much like what was done with Diana in Wonder Woman. At times it is silly, a bit cheesy but honestly, it works in favour of the character. I couldn't see a gritty Aqua Man film working because look at the character material!8.5 / 9",Aquaman
653,cinemawithcj,Aquaman - Cinema with CJ Review,8,12 December 2018,"Aquaman is the Nicholas Cage of superhero movies. Wild, unpredictable, off-beat, all over the board, crazy, funny, entertaining, and you'll never really know if it's bad or good.If anything, Aquaman is a gift. If this wasn't a year with a great line-up of superhero movies, this would be the best superhero movie of the year, and not by default.It seems that every Worlds of DC movie not involving Batman or Superman (tragically) has something great about them. Not perfect, but great.Aquaman feels like everyone was just given free reign to do what they want, so they just made it the most insane concept ever. At the base of it it's the usual hero's journey, but it's one that on the surface has you jetsetting under and over the sea, Aquaman punctuated by guitar riffs, one cartoonish pirate villain who customises a suit given to him by a secret underwater race in order to stop the true king of Atlantis from taking the throne from his half brother therefore putting a stop to a war against sea and land, a sea creature voiced by Julie Andrews, and a cover of ""Africa"" by Toto.It's something saying that the soundtrack is more diverse and more fun than the work of Hans Zimmer, or Junkie XL, but it is. Whether it's a cool Aquaman theming, or the left-field choice in covers, or the neon-fuelled Atlantean City music, all the choices are out there and work, which is the lifeblood of all of this movie.Given the reigns to James Wan was the best idea. Wan, probably always more well known for this horror work at the time of writing this, also gave the world Furious 7, the first time the seventh film of a franchise is seen as second best/the best. Like that movie, Wan takes everything up multiple notches, crafting an utterly cartoonish and more accurately, utterly comic book feeling movie.The colours of this movie leap out of you just like the colours would leap off the page. We're not working with darkness and shadow, we're not dark and gritty, and the more we strive away from that in superhero cinema the better.Aquaman is fun. Plain and simple. It is utterly crazy (it seems to be the season for crazy given my last two reviews) and it embraces it so strongly. It knows just how ridiculous it is.The entire cast bring this movie alive, but goddamn does Jason Mamoa lean perfectly into his characterisation here. It's the surfer dude Aquaman you've seen before, but here it works perfectly for the tone.Clearly everyone has realised that if Aquaman was gonna have a film, he'd have the potential ridicule aimed right at him if it was attempted to be made seriously. Pop culture has filled the world with Aquaman jokes, but by the time you even get to Aquaman getting a version of his iconic costume, the laughs aren't in ridicule, it's in the ridiculous of the world and being baffled of actually liking and enjoying the movie.This film is going to be divisive. Not in a critical way, not in an offensive way, but in the admission to whether you actually had as much fun as I did with this movie.It's got its flaws. I wish there was more Black Manta, I wish the film was shorter, despite my fun and enjoyment, I wish there was more bonkers sea war stuff, I wish the 80s adventure peppered with romance sequence carried through a bit longer, I wish for all of DC to embrace this tone. It's not Marvel Imitation Syndrome, it's going in the ridiculous comic direction that's just fun and over the top and true to the larger than life superhumans of the DC Universe.It's hard not to keep coming back and saying that Aquaman is such an enjoyable and confounding-ly weird but great time at the movies. It should have failed on every level, and it's potentially not going to be a financial or critical hit, but really, this is another slice of how these movies should be. Shazam! looks to be in the same direction, so I'm down. I am legitimately excited to see what else comes in this new world of the DC Universe.And you'd think that of all things, Aquaman would be the least likely place I would have thought that.A controversial, in most eyes barely scrapes if at all,8/10 Stars.",Aquaman

What they got instead is a huge missed opportunity.
Some of the visual ideas are breathtaking, the CGI is incredible and Jason mamoa and amber heard have charisma to spare, unfortunately what they have to work with is a script not even worthy of a bad B movie and a storyline so hackneyed and obvious it will literally make you groan in places.

Started well apart from Atlanna Tridenting the classic puppet series Stingray! They're the good guys Atlanna!. Enjoyed meeting big boy Aquaman whilst taking on Manta,was a pretty cool opening action sequence. After that it got a little too much with excessive CGI and really too much going on for a single viewing. Dafoe was ok but not enough mentoring for my taste. Plot was overall ok except for the Duel with Orm. Aquaman was not getting his ass kicked to hard so seemed a bit cowardly to run away with Mera. Tended towards the cheesy in closing sequences but I will watch again to see what subtleties I may have missed in the crowded action sequencies. Momoa was very good in the part (liked him since Stargate Atlantis and obviously as badass Khal Drogo in the butchered GOT) Others fitted in well even an obviously aging Kidman (check out the facial wrinkles that werent covered well). I liked it on the whole and I am sure it will improve with each additional viewing. Hope you liked it too.",Aquaman

It's well-shot, perhaps the biggest scope of scenes and locations I've seen in a superhero film lately. It's lively tone and layered action scenes won't leave you bored with its swift pacing.Otherwise, it's by no means perfect. The film is your standard superhero narrative with not much changes to the formula other than some ties to adventure genre. It's mood is quirky, and character motivations seem one-dimensional.

I really love how they depict the sea world, mix between fantasy and high technology. It feels so magical. You can feel how much effort they gave for the visuals, every fine details in it is so captivating.You can also love all the characters in it, even the villains (or at least you can't really hate 'em). Why? Because even though they are the villains, they have reasons of why they do what they do. Even though it is still wrong, I think you can't really hate what they do.I think James Wan did amazing job to bring Aquaman on the screen.

Given she doesn't die, but is made to have been the blood curling reason for Aquaman to become king and fight his pure-blood brother the whole story is just a little OTT.

663,phantom_pixie,"Better than I expected it to be, not as good as it ought to be",7,1 January 2019,"After years of DC failures I had no hopes for Aquaman, but to my surprise the film was good. Not as good as you'd expect a film of this magnitude should be, but worth watching. Atleast as a friday night popcorn feature.My main problem with the film is that it doesn't really know what it want to be. As Jason Momoa tries to deliver puns without an ounce of comedic timing it seems more like a childish attempt at trying to be funny, but at the same time the film has so many random events that are darker and dumber than they should be. The scene where two frogmen are in a sinking submarine with one trapped under a heavy object seems beyond stupid as they both have breething equipment and should just wait until the room fills with water to be able to lift the object. Instead one pulls out a grenade and kills himself. Allthough it causes no harm to the submarine. This is to setup just an extra enemy of Aquaman, but one that serve no purpose at all. As he comes and goes, and then goes for good, without causing more than a water ripple in the movie overall.
It makes you wonder how a script like that passes the initial reading.
Same with the scene where Atlanna stands on the docks, I get that it's supposed to be a cool scene, but how long has she been standing there. 20 minutes? 2 hours? This film doesn't know what it want's to be; funny, dark, romantic... and it falls short of all of it.The GCI is amazing though. And the films visuals are worth a view.
Patrick Wilson is great as Orm, and really gives the DCEU a villain that has both depth and clear character motivation. I hope to see more of his character in the future.",Aquaman

He was always that weird cousin that everybody just kinda puts up with and halfheartedly oohs and aahs when he tells a dolphin to pull a rope. So, firstly, props to Jason Momoa for bringing the grit and toughness to this superhero. He makes Aquaman cool, if for the first time ever. Also, the movie is beautiful. The fight scenes are well shot and the CGI makes every land a picturesque landscape of color and flash. Also, Amber Heard is absolutely gorgeous in this movie. Her red hair and outfits pop every time she's on the screen. The story, however, is kind of all over the place. How do they stop pollution? Isn't it a bad thing to let someone die? What are these people's motives? The film feels like its a bit too long as well. Did I enjoy the experience of the movie? Yes. Would I watch it again like I would other current superhero films? No. Still, great job making Aquaman a cool and valuable character again in the DC Universe.",Aquaman

king arthur pulling the sword from the stone. and his knights of the round table.
lots of lord of the rings stuff, giant stone statues, giant monsters of various sizes including a kracken, etc,
starwars stuff, flying ships through lots of tight spaces, even if underwater. a space battle with lots of dogfighting fighter ships and battle ships, all underwater.
if they can swim so fast, why do they need ships, or even the boat?
a bit of harry potter with the hidden world of the undersea people and even some moana stolen plot lines of the bottom of the ocean air bubble and its creatures.when are they going to have an actual hero that sought out and wants to be a hero? and not someone who is resisting and has to be trained while everyone else who is completely trained and educated sit around waiting and dying.how many die in the battle only to have the two leaders have mommy make them behave themselves and shake hands to be friends again? i thought was just as story killing as both of them have a mom named martha, even if she was mom to both.
rules of physics kept changing. sometimes the tridents could go through metal without any problems, other times it didnt even scratch, the same metal. can jump out of an airplane a thousand feet up and not get hurt, falls a few feet and gets hurt.
girl beats the crap of out the guards without any problem, then runs like hell from another guard just like the others.
in the beginning the sub, stolen by our bad guy, to shoot at who? the guy who he already has a deal with to start a war so that the shooting sub will make him want to start a war?????????????????
like i said, this movie is great for younger teens. logic is out the window so many times but its a lot of fun to watch if you ignore that. if you can ignore that. i couldnt. if this was a one off never seen before, first of its kind, i would have blasted it, more than i already did :) as a well informed adult with to many movies seen, i give this a 5.5 out of ten. 9 out of ten for everything visual, sfx, acting, dialogue etc. minus 4 points for the plot holes. and that is being generous.
it wasnt at all the aquaman i saw on tv cartoons as a kid, nor in comic books. i missed how much he relied on the animals of the seas for help and him, not his girlfriend, using waterballs as a weapon. and there was no hint, not in the late 60's and early 70's when i watched and read about this character, of an entire underwater kingdom. one that could easily outnumber the surface world. it is 3 times its size and the tech they got? we wouldnt stand a chance. but, like harry potter, they give the right of way to a bunch of ignorant morons like us. i doubt it. they would rule our asses off and probably better at it too.",Aquaman

687,prestocito,The visuals are not even worth it,3,25 March 2021,"I could tell by the trailer I would not like it very much. I kind of have that superpower where I can watch a trailer and tell whether or not I will like that movie. That is exactly what happened. We were trying to find something to rent (my parents don't rent that much because we already have Disney + and amazon prime and a whole bunch of other streaming accounts where we don't have to rent. Rarely we rent, and that is if my parents are in a good mood trying to reward us because of our good behavior or good grades) We didn't really know what to watch because our 7 year old sister was with us and we were to trying to find something that would entertain everyone. We had just recently watch Wonder Woman, which is probably the best recent DC movie from the new DC franchise. So we all had high hopes when we watched the trailer (I did not though. I could tell it would be a cringe fest) I tried to tell everyone it would be a mistake, so we all voted on it and it was a 4 to 2 vote. After we finished, everyone was complaining that we should have listened to me because no one liked Aquaman. Here is why
1. Everything is sloppy and rushed
2. You feel no emotion towards the characters
3. The back story or origin story was generic and stupid
4. They tried to make it funny, and none of the jokes were funny at all (except one joke, but that was a very light chuckle and the joke was more idiotic than funny)
5. Aquaman is ugly, you don't even want to look at him(especially when he gets the orange suit, it is just so bad)
6. Soundtrack is just so annoyingly bad
There are only a few good things about this movie that is semi tolerable
1. Amber Heard was kind of hot(my mom thought she was too revealing but my dad just said she was jealous, OH SNAP!)
2. The graphics were fun too look at
That is basically the only good things about it. Trust me, the visuals was the only back bone of the entire movie. Just screen saver after screen saver. Literally only reason not a two or one because of the visuals. But still, the visuals are just not even worth it.",Aquaman

692,alvesmarceloalves-73751,"Aquaman, another flop of DC",5,24 December 2018,"Marvel x DC is the rivalry of this century. Clearly, though, Marvel has always taken a lot of advantage in this confrontation. Simply because their adaptations are better, better done, and especially, have infinitely better scripts.It's amazing that at a time when technology is so advanced as to create amazing scenarios and great underwater scenes, perhaps what ""Aquaman"" does best, DC can not get someone decent to write a story that is minimal enough evoke Freudian problems with father or mother, and embarrassing situations. The scripts are the greatest Achilles heel of DC productions. If ""Batman vs Superman"" (2016) had that embarrassing scene of the two heroes resolving a fight just because they discovered that they had the same name of the mother, in ""Aquaman"" we were presented to the monster alone and with depression. Alone and isolated from the world in the depths of the endless sea, Karathen warmed his heart just because Arthur (Jason Momoa) talked to him.""Ohh, you talked to me. How beautiful. In a thousand years, no one has ever done that. Can take the trident for you"".This is just an example of how ""Aquaman"" is flopped, although it had great potential.Overall, the tacky aesthetics established by Zack Snyder also tired. And let's face it, never worked very well in the DC film series. The best works in this sense were precisely the ""300"" (2006) and the ""Watchmen"" (2009), perhaps one of the best films based on comics.Joining this to the moments worthy of a cinema that is not practiced more - what was that kiss of the Aquaman in the princess Meira (Amber Heard) in the middle of the war? - there is very little left to praise about the film.But let's try a few moments. For example, the underwater scenes are actually very good and well made. The special effects idem. The whole fight in Sicily is also a high point. All the aesthetics and design of Atlantis, a civilization extremely advanced in relation to the human, have also been very well made, although sometimes Atlantis looks like a scrap of ""Avatar"" (2009) with ""Carbono Alterado"" (2018) .On the other hand, it is too tiring Aquaman's quest for such a magic trident. Was it even necessary to show in detail and with generous time all the peoples of the seven seas? If they were more restrained, it would save at least half an hour of film. And there was still the parallel plot of the Manta (Yahia Abdul-Mateen II), a surface villain who gave a hook for a second movie.Speaking of villains, King Orm (Patrick Wilson) is an embarrassment that only DC gives us. He has tantrums because he has a half-blooded half-brother, wants to start a war with the surface based on a supposedly nasty assault. In addition to becoming the Lord of the Oceans, what ambitions are Orm wanting to start a war with the surface? Want to be the lord of the planet? After all, you can not believe that men are polluting the planet and you have to act before it's too late. And all part of an anger of the half brother, whom he blames for the death of his mother, in short, everything very badly counted.Speaking of the relationship of Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) with her children, another DC problem arises. Lack of care with what we call transmedia storytelling. This is another moment in which Marvel is giving a bath in the rival. During the film, Princess Meira quotes that the Aquaman needs to reclaim the throne or the brother will initiate a war. And it recalls its importance in defeating Stepenwolf, thus implying that the film follows the events of the ""Justice League"". So far so good. The problem is that in ""Aquaman,"" Arthur says that he never treads on Atlantis because of what the people did to his mother. Only that of stepped there in ""Justice League"" to speak and fight Steppenwolf.In addition, in ""Aquaman"", it is clear the love and devotion of Arthur for the mother since always. The problem is that in ""Justice League"" he speaks of Atlanna with rancor, as if he had been abandoned (""Your queen left me at the door of my father's house""). But in ""Aquaman,"" it is shown that both had a coexistence in Arthur's childhood and the clear love between them, in addition to the devotion that has lasted forever. That is, the DC multiverse has holes and contradictions. And it is not tied tightly. And this is further evidenced by the lack of planning for the next steps.James Wan did not deliver the Aquaman to his full potential, but Jason Momoa looked very well in the lead role. It looked like it was the right choice, though the alpha male bombed look was very different from the original Aquaman.But DC still owes a string of great movies in its new phase. The only one that deserves all the praise remains ""Wonder Woman"" (2009).",Aquaman
693,djjimmisgr,Quite fun movie,7,22 February 2020,"The truth is I don't know much about Aquaman to compare how good he was transfered from comics.

Jason momoa's portrayal of Aquaman has revolutionised his character into something more modern and acceptable in today's pop culture and is doing a great job at.
From start to finish I can honestly say that I really enjoyed whatching it and was thinking throughout that this is probably one of the best DC movies. I would even say I put it up there with Christopher Nolans 'The Dark Knight'.",Aquaman
695,luningyuan-23687,"Aquaman, awkward man",5,13 December 2018,"Aquaman movie full of business movie element and cannot tell the whole story well. I have to admit it that Wan is very talented. He know how to use elements to attract audiences. Nicole's 45s long camera fighting scene, thriller elements, hero moment, fantastic camera, and highly restored comic character settings which can attract comic fans, but a good movie need to use these elements to tell the story right, to decorate the movie in stead of steal the story's thunder. The film originally had a very clear main line, but it was influenced by the cumbersome elements of the story. Especially, those hero moment. The film is about the growth of Aquaman, so there should be only one real hero moment, that is, when he gets the king's trident. However, this Aquaman seems to be posing from beginning to end, but the real hero time is inferior, because by then the audience has been tired of watching him pose.",Aquaman

That it's generic, formulaic, predictable, but most critics neglect to mention what an entertaining and visually stunning spectacle this is. Granted it's got some cliche dialogue and some of the humor falls flat. Jason Momoa is a cool guy and very charismatic and despite his obvious departure from the comic book look, short blond hair and blue eyes, he's got the physical attributes to sell the part. Amber Heard is also a very interesting addition and she's got some of the coolest underwater superpowers from any of the characters in the movie and along with Michael Shannon's General Zod, we get one of the strongest villains in the new DCEU, Patrick Wilson's King Orm. Strong cast, very good CGI, but what really takes the cake here is the production and costume design. The level of detail and the obvious amount of work that was put into recreating every last detail of the underwater kingdoms, specially Atlantis, is breathtaking. 3D viewing of this movie is mandatory. If ever there was a movie for which this format was created, this is it. In short, a very entertaining and amazing looking film.",Aquaman

699,gatsby601,Soggy THOR Clone Reverts to Camp Over Quality,4,19 December 2018,"Two brothers fight over a throne that will allow the winner to guide the destiny of multiple kingdoms/worlds etc. The younger brother is an usurper who lies and murders his way to the crown while the older brother is reluctant to accept the responsibility of the office.Sound familiar?Aquaman is very familiar from the 'sky bridge' needed to enter Atlantis to the quest to be worthy of a signature weapon we've seen this all of this before only done much better.And with Loki. No Loki here. Only lots of CGI fish.I don't mean to pick on Aquaman the character, I didn't expect much from the Wonder Woman film and I came away very impressed and I was willing to give this outing a chance but, God, from the corny dialogue to the idiotic aquatic theme - sharks with lasers strapped to them? - Aquaman is hard to watch after Marvel has raised the bar so high over the last 15+ years.Aquaman starts taking on water early on, with far too many gosh darn earnest speeches about uniting two worlds, a remarkably clumsy origin story designed to explain how Atlantis went from being, you know, up there to down below and worst of all, a main villain so bland the writers added a SECOND supporting villain who pops up every now and again for the odd inconclusive battle.Finally, all of this 1970s Saturday morning cartoon level idiocy drags on for a good two plus hours so be sure to set your wake up call for the 68th minute because that's how long you'll have to wait for the first bit of action that doesn't involve talking to fish.Pixar elevated animated films from kids only dribble to mainstream entertainment because they created interesting characters and thoughtful stories. Richard Donner, Tim Burton and later Marvel would do the same with the superhero films. Basically, they made them better then they had to be. Aquaman is a huge step backwards. Uninspired and dumb I was reminded more of the 1980 Flash Gordon film then anything from recent years. Another bit of evidence that DC is throwing stuff at the wall hoping something will stick.",Aquaman
700,INTXb,Spectacle of dumb,4,17 January 2019,There was not a single intelligent line delivered in this entire movie. It is was a non-stop spectacle of the absolute dumbest variety.Those that are saying this movie is boring are obviously referring to the fact that their brains were left to rot for 2 hours and 23 minutes.I can't imagine a movie being more devastating to the industry than this one... having it be so successful and so dumb at the same time is a formula for more dumb movies to follow...,Aquaman
701,newguy85,"Perfect Mix of Camp, Action, Plot & Style",8,24 January 2019,"This movie wasn't on my radar, I was thoroughly disappointed by Justice League and had zero desire to see this. Yet as the reviews came in, and as Jason Momoa killed it on the PR trail, I finally decided to give it a go and really enjoyed it.Some standouts:
Jason Momoa is a star. He carried this script with all of it's tongue-in-cheek groan-worthy lines... I read somewhere that he uses Metal songs to get into character and that Tool was one of his inspirations. Personally I think Tool is a Very Serious Band and so is their front-man Maynard, but he has a pretty weird sense of humor.For some reason I kept paying attention to the physics - there are a lot of people flying through walls and getting hit really hard, you really feel the kinetic force of the action.The plot is predictable but epic, the final battle is outstanding, and the world design is colorful, interesting, and fun.DCEU really steps up the game with this entry into its universe, but I don't really see Wonder Woman, Super Man, or Batman as having the ability to carry a movie with this level of humor and color. They're going to need to introduce a new team in an alternate setting that can be comical, colorful, and have a ton of action - I think the Lantern Corps are going to be the best way even though it was attempted previously.",Aquaman
702,d-alston,Does DC now stand for Dumb Cartoon?,2,26 March 2019,"A simplistic cartoon of a story, with shallow, two-dimensional villains and predictable cardboard cut-out heroes, speaking painfully-feeble dialogue between the frequent and overblown fight scenes. The superhero genre doesn't have to lack nuance and depth to this extent, as several of the Marvel movies have demonstrated, so I assume the film makers were deliberately aiming at the most undemanding under-twelves with this movie. For everyone else, the artists and designers involved have worked hard to compensate for the lack of any emotional weight, and anything even approaching an interesting plot - so there's a wealth of gorgeous visuals to be distracted by; but there are scenes that are so excruciatingly awful that no amount of trickery can save them. The moments of ""triumph"" are so contrived and hokey that the obligatory orchestral score which swells up on cue is downright embarrassing to sit through. I defy anyone not to squirm when Aquaman steps fully-uniformed from a waterfall, or when he stares dramatically at the bad-guys through the prongs of his trident. As feeble and trite as this movie is, it doesn't fail as badly as it ought to because recent DC movies have set the bar so low, but nothing except the visuals will move you, intrigue you, or leave you wanting more.",Aquaman
703,BecauseIAmBATMAN,It may be flawed but its Damn Fun,8,15 December 2018,"There is no denying that Aquaman is a damn fun visual spectacle of a superhero action adventure film even if its a flawed one. Its worth watching on IMAX for its fantastic underwater visual effects and action sequences alone. A lot of visual imagination is put into the underwater city of Atlantis. The action sequences are beautifully shot and you have a lot of different action set pieces that are a marvel to watch at the big screen.Aquaman is an ambitiously large scale film, that tries to go through a lot of world building and backstories. Even at 2 hours 22 minutes, it feels like the film rushed up some of it by mere exposition to save time. The large scale nature of the film makes it feel a bit messy at times even if its basic story is simple. The age old story of two brothers fighting for the throne one may have seen or read multiple times. This one done in a reverse of the way Black Panther did. Jason Momoa is perfect as the macho hero and has his roguish charm that carries the film. Amber Heard as Mera is jaw dropping smoking hot rocking the red hair sharing a nice chemistry with the hero.The climatic final battle is pretty epic. Comparisons to Avatar are warranted in regards to its CGI and world building. Its kinda sad and ironic that the Aquaman movie in DCEU feels the more grander and epic than Justice League.",Aquaman

709,dokrauss,Fish Story,3,28 December 2018,"I am not a DC guy, so I went into Aquaman with a bit of dubiousness. We Boomers chose sides in the DC/Marvel rivalry decades ago and you either were fer or agin one or the other with a fanaticism bordering on Cold War intensity. There were some outliers who claimed to like both equally, but they were viewed with suspicion, like pacifists who insisted the Commies weren't all that bad. Adding to the dubiousness, it's Aquaman, a blond spandex/fish scale armor-wearing guy who rides a seahorse and pals around with spandex wearing Aquakid, a la Batman and Robin, evoking the same uncomfortableness regarding their relationship. And he talked to fish. Fish.Not that I felt any particular animus to the character. I watched the cartoon
back in the 60s with some satisfaction, thrilled that TV had finally come to its senses and was showing comic book characters, even if it was DC. Cartoon Aquaman remained in his wheelhouse, the ocean, and did ocean things so was not to be taken seriously. This movie Aquaman, though, is deadly serious, done up in the person of badass cool guy Jason Momoa who did quite a good job in Justice League...which I liked.Yes, I know, that places me in a very small minority and lends suspicion that I might be one of those aforementioned pacifists going soft on the Reds, but it was pretty good. As was Batman vs Superman. See? I can be persuaded. Aquaman might turn out to be this year's Dark Knight.It's not.Instead, it turned into a mash-up of Lord of the Rings, Excalibur, Starship Troopers, the Cthullu mythos, Gladiator, the Little Mermaid, the Hunt for Red October, the Avengers, oh, just about every movie of the last twenty years or so. I swear some computer geeks got together and said, ""Man, we gotta make some money, so let's CGI every trope from every movie because you know people like that stuff."" There's even a Skywalker finding his mother. I swear.The first ten minutes or so was great. Nicole Kidman...or her stunt double... kicked royal butt and butt royally, depending with whom she crossed tridents. Gotta say, all the movie fights were stellar. But, danger, Will Robinson: a copy of ""Dunwich Horror"" lies on a tabletop. Now, why would that be? 'Cause, you know, if you show a gun in the first act you gotta use it in the third and, yep, Cthulhu shows up later. Along with his/her fish monsters. WTF? Did one of the computer geeks note ""Arkham Asylum"" in Dark Knight and figured there was a Lovecraft connection?I blame public education.Minutes later, the scene that killed the movie: a line of armoured seahorses facing off a line of armoured sharks. With lasers. And all roaring at each other. I laughed out loud, then asked, ""Is this a joke?""No, apparently not. Even when the timpani playing octopus was beating out the Planet Hulk combat rhythm in the arena, when the Green Goblin CGI-floated around pretending he's still loyal to the Master Race, and Aryan God Boy Ocean Master screams like Howard Dean on the campaign trail, you're supposed to regard all this as serious and intense.It's like Springtime for Hitler.I can go on and on and on but I'll just hit the lowlights. F'rinstance, the entire Russian Navy knows Aquaman exists. Aquaman even speaks Russian. Fluently. Everyone on the East Coast knows Aquaman exists. They party with the dude. Yet, the news media pish-poshes the idea of Atlanteans among us.Must be CNN.There is an eeeevil villain who simply can't get over that Aquaman didn't save eeevil villain's Dad from a watery death. Dude, your dad was a pirate. Sort of goes with the territory so lighten up. But noooo, evil villain constructs an eeevil costume replete with a dirigible helmet that fires plasma. You'd think a guy who knows he's going to be maneuvering around submarine interiors would select something a little less unwieldy. But, it's DC. Simple physics never bothered them. Like the Batcopter.And for all their high tech, the Atlanteans are not the brightest. Aryan God Boy knew for decades where his hated half-brother lived and waits, of course, until Aquaboy is full on badass Aquaman before deciding to take him on. For that matter, the plasma firing laser shark Atlanteans have had a beef with the surface world for nigh-on millenia, but, of course, wait until we've got badass Aquaman on our side before making a move. No wonder the gods drowned them.But Nicole Kidman showing up in a lobster suit...that's it. Done.Make mine Marvel.",Aquaman

Overall I loved the way the movie looked, they kept well to the DC universe mythos, story progressed well. The Dum-Dums at Rotten Tomatoes have frequently missed the mark on many good movies, formulaically criticizing a certain type of movie unless it falls into the pre-approved guidelines that have cooked up.

The movie is better than most of the others DC movies, but still got a lot problems, including story connections, logic and physics.

The film is extremely formulaic, lacks character development and even the dialogues are cringe worthy. The jokes fell flat. I was hoping until the climax that something would happen that would be a surprise. But, James Wan gives nothing of that sort in this movie. The visuals have been wasted. An emotional, character driven story could have been told. In the end, we get a shallow and boring film that relies too much on action sequences rather than its characters to carry the story forward.

740,SaintNinja,"Not a Masterpiece, but solid.",10,18 December 2018,"The best parts of this almost christmas time heart warming movie for me were:
Music. Original score is fresh and moving just like Thor 3 Ragnarok score.The Jukebox songs work very gwell placed. Black Manta doing Tony Stark's thing with the sounds of Depeche Mode ""It's no good""! Roy Orbison and Toto's ""Africa"" with rap - that's a combination, old pal.
The first song/theme in the movie is some kind of Atlantean lullaby - you can cry a sea of tears, it's very romantic.
Viuals. This is eyecandy - that's all.Momoa and Lundgren are great. Black pirates are cool. Main antagonist is charismatic and deep. There are some really good jokes in Marvel style.
Now let's talk about weak parts:
The Plot is too big for one movie in my opinion. Hollow Earth's sea and dr Auaman Jones in Sahara were thin and raw.Same thing with Black Manta and the city of Atlantis. I would love to see him walking around the underwater streets watching simple alien life etc)) All this glory didn't fit the screen time. Lord of the Rings was too fast and rushed too, but Aquaman is like 10 times faster. Maybe they will add some cut material in DVD versions.

The two biggest issues I had were the casting choices of Kidman and Wilson and the length. I like Kidman as an actress, but feel she is only in here for face recognition due to the many low level poor actors used. A waste of her talent. Patrick Wilson is so far from a believable villain as to be almost a parody of himself. I realize that there are probably a lot of A list actors that don't want anything to do with some of the super hero movies, but there must have been someone that could have been more threatening. My second beef is with the length of the movie. No reason at all for this to run almost 2 1/2 hours. Not enough story to fill that time.To end on a positive note, some of the special effects are pretty decent.",Aquaman

He tried his heart out to make the best of what is certainly the worst dialogue in the last 10 years.Nicole Kidman is always a charmer, however this movie somehow dulled her usually effervescent glow. The actress can deliver a line, the problem here is just that there was nothing good to deliver. Amber Heard is lovely yet quite boring in the role she hoped would define her. Still, Johnny Depp didn't deserve her.The most confusing fight scenes ever seen on film are present throughout, and this is probably the weakest storyline since Independence Day 2.I can't fathom how anyone saw this movie and thought ""Wow! That's the best thing I've ever seen!"" My teenage daughter, who is a lover of all things superhero, agreed with me wholeheartedly that the CGI work on this film was substandard, horrible dialogue seems to have been made up on the fly, and the giant Seahorses knocks you off scale because we all know Seahorses are just a few inched high. At one point my daughter turned to me and said ""dad, how big are the Altantians, like 4"" tall?"" We both cracked up at that mental imagery.The DCEU still does not compare with the MCU. It just doesn't. It never will. I loved Wonder Woman, but that was in spite of the story, not because of it. Gal Gadot is just fantastic, and wonderful to watch.This movie had me looking at the clock. That's never a good thing. I wanted to give this movie a 4, but my daughter said it had more redeeming qualities than that.

751,JasonR77,Delightfully Fun,10,26 December 2018,"Well, they managed to make Aquaman cool.I don't say that lightly, either. The superhero with the odds-on worst reputation of all has been redeemed by a talented leading man and a sound director. James Wan's work with this script managed to blend high action, character development, and tremendous visuals, with a smattering of utter ridiculousness for good measure.Jason Momoa is the star, but Amber Heard cannot be overlooked, as her character is the one that drives the plot, and not as the love interest. Wan did his homework, and ensured that Mera was more than eye candy or a damsel in distress. She is a butt-kicker, and more intuitive than Arthur is for most of the movie.Arthur is done consistently with what we got of him in Justice League, but fleshed out more, and Momoa is up to the challenge of doing more with a guy who to this point had been a hard drinking nobody who could fire off the occasional wisecrack. The backstory he is given is less tragic than many other superheroes tend to get, complete with one guaranteed living parent. Kind of an odd fact in this genre.Patrick Wilson is definitely committed as the would-be Ocean Master, and brings a hammy gravitas to the role, as though he understands how ridiculous he is and plays it up at every opportunity. This should make him cheesy, but instead it makes him more distasteful, adding to the strength of the performance.Black Manta is another good choice, and his part in the film is helpful at moving the plot along, and bringing more action. His anger, and unfettered rage for revenge makes him a good, gritty villain to counterbalance the others.The action is fantastic, and the scale on which it is done in many scenes is great. But at no point do you lose track of Arthur or Mera as they get through it all.Like Wonder Woman, this is an example of what the DCEU can be when it is given to directors and writers who are of quality, and there's less Zack Snyder.",Aquaman

The thing is children shows like Peppa Pig (I watch it with my 3 years old nephew) or Ladybug (I watch it with my 6 years old niece) are hundred million times more mature and more suspenseful than the average superhero movie. Not to mention that the many animation movies out there have some of the best storytelling you can find nowadays. So why Hollywood? Why does it have to be so ... dumb? I don't get it. I'm a writer myself. How hard can it be to write some good dialogues? I was never a DC fan, but I always thought the DC Universe would be more mature and darker. Maybe the whole atmosphere is ""darker"" but sure the stories aren't more mature.
So talking about Aquaman: I like the character and the actor. The movie was not terrible, but it was like 99% CGI (even the hair in the water was animated), some superhero things happened, there were a lot of fights going on and yeah ... he became the king of Atlantis.

Arthur is now 30 years old, and Mera, the actual princess of Atlantis has asked him to go on a quest: they must research a trident to prevent a war between the worlds of ocean and the humans.This is an action, adventure and fantasy movie. It was produced by DC Comics, the company who has produced Justice League. This movie is 143 minutes long, so it is extremely short for an action film.About the cast, Jason Momoa and Amber Heard are the funniest actors for an action film. They form an explosive and emotive duo and it was incredibly funny to follow this strange squad during the film.This film is action-packed: the wars between Atlantis and the humans, the powers of Aquaman and Mera... So the visuals are terrific, that explains the budget of 160 000 000 $.The score of this movie is disappointing and it doesn't correspond to the movie.So, to summarize, thank you DC Comics for this magnificent film: it makes me laugh, it makes me happy, and it is entirely original and fun.Last but not least, the scene when Aquaman finally meets his mother is the greatest moment of the film because it was full of emotion and very beautiful.",Aquaman

764,neil-shrubb,Terrible,3,15 December 2018,"I went in with no expectations having not read any reviews. It started poorly, mainly due to Nicole Kidman's Botox and lip fillers, and just got worse and worse. This film boasts terrible CGI, appalling acting, a script you wouldn't wipe the floor with, and a dead feeling inside that this got released at all. I have really liked every other DC universe movie, and I can only imagine the star power involved in this dogs dinner was as a result of how good Wonder Woman was...... James wan doesn't make decent horrors, so why he thought he could make a fantasy I'll never know. I will be telling everybody I meet to avoid this movie.

766,drawnsupreme,Feels Like a TV Show - Don't Waste Your Time,2,24 March 2019,"This Aquaman movie has to be one of the most overly cheesy and boring movies I've ever seen.There are EXCESSIVE jokes and one-liners sprinkled ALL OVER this movie. Some of the scenes look like they were filmed on the set of a Power Rangers TV show, especially the Black Manta scenes. Just awful and uninspiring.Jason Momoa is a terrible actor who comes off as a surfer dudebro joker in just about every single scene - when we all know the Aquaman from the comics, TV shows, and video games - is portrayed to be more of a serious, charismatic person with leadership qualities - all of which Jason Momoa fails to bring to the table. In addition, if you're a REAL fan of the Aquaman character and have seen the DC animated film 'Justice League: Throne of Atlantis', then you may have noticed how significantly different the story is.Not sure what the writers, producers, and director were thinking, but this is an epic fail in the story-line department because they decided to basically make Aquaman a comedian and change major plot points from other reiterations of Aquaman's backstory.The only good thing about this movie was simply just some of the CGI action sequences (when Aquaman fights the trench monsters, for example).The villains (Orm and Black Manta) are extremely weak. Orm spends most of the movie talking smack but when it comes down to the epic final showdown, he doesn't put up much of a fight.Black Manta is another major disappointment. Again, if you've read the comics or even played the 'Injustice' video games, you know Black Manta is a warrior with some DAMAGING fighting skills and abilities - but again, is under-utilized and comes off as a weak side villain.These villains should have been much more BRUTAL, but unfortunately, they were weak.Skip this movie, especially if you're a fan of Aquaman from the comics, video games, or animated content. You'll be disappointed.",Aquaman
767,mikeyboy26,What a mess.,4,4 January 2019,"After the promising first scene Aquaman becomes long , silly and predictable. It thinks we will be satisfied by a series of computer screen-savers. To highlight how poor this movie is the impressively looking Jason Momoa almost fades into the background because of how ridiculous it is. No, not even he can save it. The best part of the movie for me was the goat.",Aquaman
768,Nikar4,Am I the only one disappointed?,6,26 January 2019,"I had such high hopes for this movie and it just fell short. I think mostly this is down to my age. I had hoped the movie would be slightly more adult than it is.Jason shines in this role and is by far my favourite aquaman. Yahya also did really well in his role as black lantern. Unfortunately I found the cgi used on other actors facial features somewhat distracting. They all looked like they'd had bad plastic surgery at times.The underwater scenes were fantastical and the movie is visually beautiful. But for me that isn't enough to justify adding stars. I came for the story and to be entertained. In this respect it failed for me. I felt there were a few holes in the story and his abilities seemed inconsistent.Another failure was in marrying the comedy with the serious. At times I was watching a dramatic action film at other times a cheap comedy sketch. It never quite pulls off either. I think this was to please the younger audience (since the jokes were both childish and predictable)One aspect I loved was the ocean throwing out its garbage. Pollution was a theme throughout the movie and I loved this. Hopefully some fans will take note of the message being sent.Overall I think kids, teenagers and young adults will love this movie. But those of us hoping to finally see an aquaman for grown ups will be disappointed.",Aquaman
769,taranpannu01,Aquaman (2018),5,4 February 2019,"Another late screening for a film released last year, I wasn't dying to see it but had heard great and exciting things about the film and caught a late screening with my best friend to which we cackled and laughed throughout almost the entire film and I have no idea if this was good or bad.This film was laughably cringy. The dialogue and delivery by actors was at times awful and head shakingly poor. The slow motion and L'Oreal esque style zooms on the femme fatales were so laughable.The story was there I guess, a sort of swash buckling adventure film. Momoa was Momoa and not really a character. Amber Heard was much better then her shameful appearance in Justice League although some plot points seemed to be created with Arthur not even knowing her name despite meeting each other before and the two seemingly having a history.The supporting cast were surprisingly poor. Willem Dafoe did nothing and you could tell he was immensely bored. Nicole Kidman was bad and I hate writing that as I LOVE her. Her American accent which she couldn't even hold was shocking as well as Temuera Morrison's accent he attempted to put on here and there.Patrick Wilson was suitably over the top and chewing the scenery and he managed to make me laugh with his long drawn out war cries.Dolph Lundgren was there I guess and his third act character shift was so poor. Djimon Hounsou, Ludi Lin and Randall Park were not in the film enough to make an impact. Graham McTavish was probably the least worst, with his suitable powering performance. Michael Beach whom I also enjoy had some disgustingly cringy lines as did his son played by Yahya Abdul Mateen II who portrayed fan favourite Black Manta.The effects at times were great and at other times horrible. The cinematography was decent. The music was decent if not forgettable. Some music choices were so bad, SO bad that they had to be pranking the audience, especially that scene in Italy, we were just laughing our heads off it was unbelievable. This film is so unbelievably cringy that it makes one wonder if what they are viewing is even real.Lord knows how Julie Andrews and John Rhys Davies got into this mess.The imagination was great, props to Wan especially with character designs, creatures and weapons etc.I can't express enough how laughable the film is and this is what worries me as since I was laughing, I technically enjoyed the film at it's own expense so I really have no clue what to rate it. Yes it was enjoyable with the action sequences and frankly superb uses of the long take in those scenes but it was also so hilariously poor.The dialogue which is at times was hard to hear was so expected that I was literally guessing the lines that would come next. Shameful. Another small gripe I had was the fact that the inhabitants of an underwater kingdom had American accents, like really?Everything is over directed, Wan must've been saying on production that everything needs to be bigger, sillier more ridicilious as if this was his only chance to make a superhero film (which it doesn't even feel like).Cringy dialogue, cringy close ups and cringy delivery makes Aquaman a laughably defective but still somehow entertaining few hours.It's a must see rubbish film, like Clash of the Titans or Prince of Persia",Aquaman
770,mgitts1977,"Good movie, but...",7,31 December 2018,"It was visually stunning, no doubt about it... Imax is the way to go. Action was not in short supply, it was very entertaining.... The story line was not hard to follow, and made sense in order for the characters to achieve their ultimate goal.
The issue I have is with the casting... I enjoy Mamoa in certain roles, but I felt like too much of him came through in the character....I felt the same about him in JL.Patrick Wilson stole every scene he was in played Orm brilliantly!... and interestingly enough, physically looked like he should've been cast as Aquaman. All the other actors fit their roles perfectly, but when it ended, I was left feeling like something was missing. It was good, but not great..close second to Man of Steel for DC.",Aquaman
771,rebornblr-06371,This was a GOD DARN masterpiece!,10,20 December 2018,"Idk what anyone else says this is so far the best action movie of the season! Creed 2 was good but this is such a different spin on the everyday REG super hero. They are fighting massive battles, riding great whites, being surrounded by a million farrils and doing it all in this diffrent world under the sea. It's just amazing really Aquaman is amazing! I will say I LOVE dolph lundgren making a big appearance as the king of one of the ocean relmes; most of the characters were cast perfectly but they decided to go with a weird cast choice for the secondary villian he a modern day pirate. His backstory is a little wacky. Though there primary villian; Auqaman's estranged brother and prince of the ocean whom is trying to obtain the title ""Ocean Master"" and wants to wage waron the "" land dwellers"" was an amazing cast choice!

772,rowpotdroid,Hollywood has given up!,2,17 December 2018,"Laughable, I couldn't stop laughing at the ridiculous under water battles with sea horses and riding giant sharks warriors due battle. I think some of these Hollywood
directors have completely lost touch with reality and are doing way too many drugs.
Comic book Hero's was a distraction initially back when they came out with Superman. But like always Hollywood latches onto anything that generates box office returns they will milk it to death. The art of movie making has been lost to the computer age of CGI it's all about special effects. The age of movie goer's now must be 12 and younger. As for movie making continuing to be an art form it's been lost decades ago as both directors and actors sell out for a fast buck in over hyped productions that cater only to those with the attention span of 5 seconds. Character development, story line, plot, all rolled into on area the Fight Scene. They don't even build up the suspense just drop you right into the violence right from the start and pretty much continues fight scene after fight scene with laughable sprinkles of emotional bonding between pretty girl and boys.",Aquaman

774,ahsawesa,Flawed But Entertaining,6,24 December 2018,"Film Review: Aquaman (NO SPOILERS)Indiana Jones style adventure mixed with Black Panther style of tussle between two contenders for the throne. I was expecting the story to take a different route but it didn't. Also, it's fast paced and that can be a bit jarring because at times the way it abruptly cuts to a scene that explores another subplot.It feel like it's just another superhero film with just another okay pair of villains. But it's an entertaining one.Why was I entertained and engaged regardless of cliches? I cared about the characters of Aquaman and Mera. I was rooting for them and was invested in their adventures. They learned from each other and what they went through. This is how a character arc works and while it is a pretty simple form of character arc, it works.There are some really awe inspiring visuals in underwater scenes especially near the third act. The use of bright and vivid colors in some of those underwater moments is so good that the same cheesy Aquaman moments in some of the old comics pre-New 52 that you would've thought will never work in live action somehow look great. Action scenes are fantastic as well.While it is beautiful at times, at other times, it looks very very cheesy and artificial. This is one of the negatives that I'm going to discuss in detail. Maybe it's a personal preference but at times the comic book-esque costumes don't mesh well with the world they're inhabiting. This is one of the reasons I don't like visual aesthetic of some of the MCU films. Their worlds look too plain and the costumes end up looking silly.And talking about silly, I have to say that Aquaman should've taken itself a bit more seriously than it did. Jason Momoa is constantly trying to make you laugh, villains are making cheesy entries in slow motion like Bollywood films. It feels DCEU is giving in to MCU's approach in order to please the critics.. I'm not saying MCU films are bad but DC needs it's own signature style. But Aquaman does not feel like it belongs in the same universe as MoS, BvS or WW.I preferred Zack Snyder's dark and gritty style. Snyder knew how to balance realism with comic book visuals. Zack Snyder also brought that sense of ""gods among humans"" to these heroes. In his films, you felt the weight of their powers. How the world reacted to them also added to that but in Aquaman it seems like they have kind of nerfed these powers and brought him down to earth in order to make him more human. Yes Aquaman does a better job at making you care for it's hero than Man of Steel did but it doesn't quite treat it's hero like the godlike being he's supposed to be. I preferred the latter approach (with good writing of course)Back to the pros. Surprisingly, Amber Heard is pretty good in this, I was skeptical about her but she was very charismatic and charming in the role. Jason Momoa did a decent job of carrying the film as well considering he has never really led such a big blockbuster all by himself. Nicole Kidman put on probably one of the best performances in the film. Patrick Wilson was just okay.My verdict is that Aquaman is a flawed but decent ride for film goers. I will not say that it's a step in the right direction for DC because I want them to at least tone down the humor just a little bit especially with characters that are not entirely comedy based.Even with the flaws, it pleased me with heroes that I could root for, certain moments of sheer badassery and nicely tied up character arcs. I hope they improve upon the flaws in the sequel.I give it a 6.8/10",Aquaman

Jason Mamoa does a solid job here, Amber Heard is a goddess, literally and figuratively, and James Wan shoots a beautiful looking film aside from a few weird CGI uses. The story is pretty similar to Black Panther, but it's not that derivative. There were some cool action sequences and I'll admit Aquaman's official suit was pretty fricken sick, but the music choices were baffling at times. I'm not ready to say this film or character can save the DCEU, it's a very solid superhero movie, but if it was set in the MCU it would certainly be one of the lesser entries. Kudos for not making a film that sucks though, choosing creative directors like James Wan will be key to DC regaining some of its former glory.",Aquaman

779,tommy5677,Yawn.. worst superhero movie ever.,2,29 June 2019,"Watching this movie was nothing short of painful and it wasn't long in until I was asking myself if I've ever actually got up and walked out of a movie. It was tempting. I decided to stay to see if it would actually go anywhere. Turns out it's one of the worst ever. The only barely redeeming value was the fact that they had a couple of major stars in Nicole Kidman and Willam Defoe. I have no idea why either would take part in such a ridiculous venture. Perhaps it was flattering to have any evidence of aging removed and it was a digital facelift for both.
Like many of its superhero predecessors it is so over done on constant unrelenting action, violence, and CGI that it rapidly became a real snoozer though impossible to actually fall asleep.
This movie is also not for children. If you don't want your child exposed to this sort of thing then leave them home. There was one 7 year old seen covering his ears and ended up on his fathers lap. Please do your children and yourself a favor.
Many here cite the fact that it was a ripoff from so many other stories but the silliest reference of them all was that to King Arthur as he pulled the Trident from its impossible-to-remove resting place. Oh brother. Please don't insult such wonderful fictional legends.
If you need someone with a killer body in your hero, please do so with an actual actor. Someone who can run with the big boys.

Well, I'm a male victim of domestic abuse and watching this court case play out amd seeing how Johnny Depp is being unfairly treated reminded me so much how the authorities, organisations and people are so prejudiced against domestic abuse committed towards men. Fundamentally, even if you have evidence and report it, no one cares. There is no social support (police will stop immediate problem but no long term resolution).

Maybe it's the best DC films since 10 years for some, ok, but lets not rate it 10 stars just for that. be objective, because this most certainly is not worth 10 stars. it absolutely can't live up to Black Panther if you are looking for to compare it with another movie. While watching this, I was litterally thinking that there is a reason why it took 15 years to develop Avatar and yet another 10+ years for the sequels. Because the time and money went to good CGI.

I mean Aquaman the protagonist here is even annoying the guy that plays him looks like a wrestler and acts just as badly as one too. The bad guys are so lame some look like they would fit in a GI Joe film and some look like they would fit in a star wars or space scifi world. Just when I thought it couldn't get any lamer than the Thor actor and character they make a full length Aquaman movie with an actor who is possibly the worst protagonist of all time. The lines are lame the humor attempts are cliche and not funny in the least I also felt a bit childish like some executive let their son help with the writing cause its that shallow and the only thing that is funny about it is the costumes and . I also don't know what people are raving over with the visual I think it's horrible it looks so unrealistic you cant even imagine the characters are there and there are many movies that get it right including some of the other super hero films its not that they didn't also use CGI but they certainly didn't abuse it either. Next thing is the actors Dolph Lungren his movie career was over years ago I think maybe even in the same year he started as hes pretty much always been a B action actor and even then he's pure cheese and his movies unbearably lame I cant believe hes still in movies.William Defoe lets get serious here I would buy him as an alcoholic retired cop or dirty senior cop he just look so out of character and place in this movie.Amber heard is terrible as usual I mean every role she gets she either goes too far or the polar opposite she doesn't want to be there or its a simple script reading. I found in this film she even gives off body language like shes nervous and sometimes like I said she doesn't seem to be into it at all. Patrick Wilson looks so out of place in this and to me hes always been nothing but a second rate fill in actor not fit to be one of the main in a movie hes ruined a lot of films for me.I love Nicole Kidman but not even she could keep this film above water.

It's plot is quite interesting and although it's predictable it's definitely entertaining. It was, though, quite cringey, the colours and costumes were excessive even for a sci fi action movie. The target market seemed to be aimed at 12 year olds rather than adults and while it did have some good special effects, it's safe to say that D.C has done far better in it's past movies.",Aquaman

Probably beating out Wonder Woman!James Wan, the directed, has done a fantastic job. There are no dull moments in the film. The action is top notch. The story is simple, and perhaps predictable, but you'll not regret sitting through till the end.What I liked most about this film was its experimentation with colours, unlike most other DCEU films. Actions scenes and set pieces shot at daytime look equally amazing, if not more.The cast is great, the sound and visuals more than great.I would definitely recommend watching this movie to everyone.",Aquaman
804,tuanskie,The computers want their CGI back,2,30 April 2019,Ok Computer...this movie really stunk. The CGI was overwhelmingly bad. The fight scenes were boring. The acting...what acting? Don't waste your time on this movie.,Aquaman
805,beandip57,"Is it Cheesy Yes, Is it Awesome Yes!",8,26 December 2018,"As a comic book fan of Marvel. I am happy to report that Aquaman surprised me. Although I am not a hater of DC, I am a hater of bad comic book movies.DC has been really hit or miss with their movies. But to me this was a hit. Let me just start by saying, I went to see this with my girl, a couple and 3 guy friends. All of us with different likes. 1/2 liked the movie, the 1/2 not so much.Why was it good:
The story was a good story, giving Aquaman a outsider feel. A reluctant hero of sorts. But overall a strong presence. Jason Momoa does a great job of giving a new spin on the comic book version of Arthur Curry.
The action was a blast. There was a couple of really cool fight scenes and the ending battle was a blast.
Amber Heard was better than I thought. Now lets say she is not going to win an oscar here, but she is believable and could handle her own.
CG was off the hook. Really Amazing.
Imagination was really cool, all the different species and monsters.Why was it bad:
Well lets say this was a fondue party. Cheese was at an all time high. So many needless poses from Jason and bad one liners. Nothing that we haven't seen in any Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone movie. But still more than usual from a DC movie.
To me, it seem like it copied a couple of things from other movies, again nothing new, but for me to notice, its sometimes makes it not so cool.Overall:
Yes its Corny and Cheesy, but man was a lot of fun. I was impressed by the action and the CG. The main stars did a great job playing their superhero characters and I for one think it will come off very well with fans and non fans alike.
If you are looking for Great acting, great story telling, well you may be disappointed, but if you are looking for a lot of fun, which is why I go in the first place, then this movie will be great for you. Enjoy.",Aquaman

809,jeymatt,Better Than Expected!,9,13 December 2018,"Have always been a fan of my favourite idol James Wan, director of horror movies. Initially I was sceptical about him directing his first ever Superhero movie Aquaman but guess what? It was better than I expected! Casting Jason Momoa as Aquaman is just perfect for the role although I would prefer Aquaman to have short beard with short hair instead of long beard, moustache and long hair hahaha. Ahemm, red-head Princess Mera (Amber Heard) is hot and sexy too, while the secondary villain Black Manta looks exactly from the comic book... a very funny big headed black ant to me hahaha.I tend to agree that 145 minutes is a bit too long for this movie but one thing for sure... it's full of actions and never boring. One of the scenes was filmed in the beautiful island of Sicily, Southern Italy... which is now on my travel list to visit.

The difference though is that Power Rangers is meant to be taken too seriously, this disappointing few hours wants you to. Don't get me started on the CGI either.

812,JC_Ride,That was weird!,4,18 May 2020,"This movie is one of those that aren't good at all if you analyse them as mere movies, but are actually so stupid at times that they're entertaining. This thing is ridiculously cheesy, over the top, with an extremely basic plot, forced romance and cliches. But I'll take that over something boring any day of the week. Just leave your brain at the door and laugh at the stupidity of it. A perfect example of this is the fact that at least 4 times in the movie someone is taking, only for it to be cut off by an explosion. It's actually hilarious how they do this again and again and again! Gotta say I did like Black Mantas character and some scenes were nice. The fight scenes were ridiculously over the top, especially the last one, but thats fine. The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and rightfully so, cause its extremely stupid. And if you wanna enjoy this movie, I suggest you don't take it seriously either. This movie is like a 3/10 but William Dafoe is in it so I'll give it a 4, plus it unintentionally made me laugh more than I'd like to admit. However the fact that this movie made more than 1 billion in the box office is exremely alarming!",Aquaman
813,rolando19552001,Aquaman,10,13 December 2018,"AquamanThis film is the most ambitious comic book film ever. James Wan manages to create a make believe world as implausible as it may seems at first underwater, the director makes it a make believe world. James Wan creates a make believe world as the likes of Pandora like James Cameron, also in the film Tron Legacy, James Wan creates a world that is fictional but like a magic wand the film Aquaman and its world makes the film a reality that you heavily invest yourself in. Momoa as the protagonist makes himself totally vulnerable as a man of two worlds, one the surface world and the other Atlanteans. The story of Aquaman or Arthur Curry begins with the coming of the queen Atlanna to escape an arranged marriage and the father of Arthur helps her in her vulnerable moment and a love story begins and there is a fruit of that love in Aquaman, a child of two worlds who is very reluctant to believe in the hype that he a chosen king like Mera played by Amber Heard with a heroine in her own right and fights as well as Momoa´s Aquaman, many times Mera saves Aquaman and the story is thus richer.
The main plot is that Aquaman´s younger, baby brother the always charismatic and suave Patrick Wilson wants to wage war against the surface world and needs four of the seven oceans´ kingdoms to wage the war. Mera´s father is one king that supports Orm, Patrick Wilson. Orm tries to get at least the four kingdoms needed to make his dream war true and almost manages to do this until the true king cometh.
In one of the side stories that is emotional invested Aquaman is asked by a pirate who begs Aquaman to save his father´s life, but Aquaman responds without a soul that the ocean´s rage and justice is the pirate´s justice. The son of the dead father becomes a villain of his own who had a secret accord with Atlantean king Orm who gives him secret tech to enhanced himself as the pirate becomes Black Manta, a villain full of hatred against Aquaman and in one of the sequences in Sicily, Italy, the about five minutes to ten minutes through the walls, roofs escapade of Mera and Aquaman against Black Manta is a very good scene.
Aquaman is a combination of the best movies of their respective genders, Indiana Jones in the archeological element done great by Dafoe who played an adviser who trains young Arthur and does indeed believe the coming of the true king, Aquaman himself. The visuals and the technology of Tron Legacy comes to mind, the ever made make believe world of Avatar and the metaphors of Lord of the Rings the Return of the King. Momoa makes a great work of Aquaman as a broken man who does not have faith or belief or hope in himself but many do believe in him like his love interest in Mera who always support him even if she makes many jokes on Aquaman´s expense, also Dafoe as the adviser and Nicole Kidman´s Atlanna and his father Senior Curry. Many believe in the great destiny of the true king Aquaman and finally when the moment of coronation happens, here cometh the great Atlan king remade, King Arthur Curry, Aquaman himself.",Aquaman

Nothing groundbreaking here but a solid addition to the DC universe. As a fan of Wonder Woman and Man of Steel, this is my third favorite movie of the franchise so far.The writing is lacking and this movie definitely is a paint by the numbers superhero movie, but I really enjoyed the ride. The visual effects, the music, and the acting are all top notch.It is not a full set up of him becoming Aquaman but it is a setup of him becoming King.

816,keithsealy,This movie is terrible,2,29 December 2018,"I felt cheated paying full price to see this in the theater.The dialog was inane.
The story was predictable and formulaic.
The actions of the characters made little sense.
Massive plot holes (and is inconsistent with events of the other DC movies).
Much of the acting was stilted or 'phoned in.' (Then again, with the poor dialog they were given, perhaps they were doing the best they could.)
The action sequences were boring.
Terrible CGI.
There was no chemistry between the two main characters/love interests.
And... I was bored. I started looking at my watch less than half way through.This was a clearly movie conceived, written, and directed by a committee. It had no direction, no soul, no purpose. I honestly rank this at the bottom of DC's recent crop of movies, I would watch Batman v Superman again before I would watch this.The BEST scenes were between his parents. I would have been happy to have just watched a two hour movie with Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman's relationship.My kids loved it.

817,poewilson,Jame Wan still does not understand physics.,6,9 December 2018,"The P.H. Metric 60.5/100 The P.H. MetricIn short, Fast and the Furious logic and storytelling in water, but I am sure that is what people are expecting, so enjoy.*********************************Light spoilers********************************Directing: 6/10The directing is decent there is a reason Wan keeps getting big budget jobs, but it is only a little bit more than average as it slams everything in your face. Wan's directing style is more like a comedy that continually keeps firing jokes at you so that you will forget any of the ones that did not work and only focus on the fun stuff.Acting: 3/10Not sure if it was the actors or the script, but for the most part, it was very hammy as they say and I am sorry did they read the script and go wow we are recreating a cheesy 1980's action flick let us cast Lundgren in it so that we can show how meta we are. (Also the cheesy 80's style songs as well.)Cinematography: 6/10I love cinematography it is probably my favourite aspect of a film, but I cannot entirely agree with the shots in this film. For example, the shot when the two are on the boat with the sun over Aquaman's right shoulder. I would not take a personal photo that has the sun burning out my retinas why would I think to put it in my film. Again the action is used to hide the framing and use of the shots, but ultimately it is far from stellar especially in the undersea war near the end.Editing 8/10Editing feels reasonably tight. You can see a few times where it could have been tweaked. A slight pet peeve of mine is when you know the camera just got rocked by a colossal set-piece run amok, which breaks the illusion of the experience and reminds me that I am not immersed.Score/sound effects: 8/10Sound effects team. Excellent job, no fault there. Score, not so much it comes off as cheesy and a throwback to a time that mainstream blockbusters have long forgotten.Visual Effects: 9.5/10Visual effects team did a great job and they deserve all the credit in this film. Not writing, not directing, not any other factor. If people love this film in any way it is down to the visual effects. Great job.Writing: 1/10Wow! Did someone steal a script from a 1980's Arnold film and say that is good enough because that is what it feels like. Everything is cliche. Everything. Right down to the kiss the two leads share during the war scene, and she does the left leg lift.Production Design: 7/10Was decent enough, but the details were not there. I suppose that can be forgiven given what the director was asking of you.Costume Design 7/10The people I went to the theatre with literally said ewww, when they saw the costumes, and they loved this film. Again not sure if these designs were forced on the department or not, but they seemed to miss the mark.Make-up/Hairstyle 9/10I want to give them a ten for Kidman. They made her appear exceptionally young, but there were little hiccups here or there, and a little bit of age would have been appreciated on her character. Especially toward the end as the comparison when her and her partner hug at the end seemed quite odd.",Aquaman

It is such a pity that the story line was so diluted (pun intended) because this was such a wonderful opportunity to make a significant statement about the rape of the oceans and the abuse of the environment - but instead we were presented with a limp excuse of a story line that was about class and prejudice. The injustice was the theme was held back by poor dialogue and Americanism of vocabulary.

823,jackson-regurge,Aquaman Makes a Splash!,7,3 January 2019,"Aquaman is an exciting and enthralling adventure that must be seen on the big screen! It offers one of the best stories produced so far by DC's cinematic universe.The visual effects in Aquaman are spectacular. The film is reminiscent of Tron, Avatar, How to Train your Dragon and Star Wars in its creation of the world of Atlantis on screen. As a fan of the comics, the vivid colours and comic accurate costumes are so pleasing to see cinematically. It is clear to see that director James Wan has done his homework. However, the de-aging effect used on Temuera Morrison is a little bit distracting. This is only a small criticism though, as otherwise, the effects are something to behold.James Wan brings everything that's good about the original source material. However, he also brings his own flare to the property, adding horror elements that merge beautifully with the world he has forged.Jason Momoa was born to play Aquaman! In recent years, Aquaman has been treated as something of a laughing stock. However, these times are over! Momoa has brought gravitas to the role and has made the character very cool. Amber Heard is also fantastic in this film adding a really interesting dynamic to the film. Her character surpasses the typical damsel in distress that superhero films typically have, instead giving us a powerful and stylish equal to Momoa's Aquaman. Patrick Wilson's portrayal of King Orm is good, but in the grand scheme of the film Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's portrayal of Black Manta shines out, offering a very compelling villain for future films. I must also add that Willem Dafoe's Vulko really helps add authenticity to the world of Atlantis with a subtle and considered performance.Overall, I would highly recommend the film to fans of casual film goers but also to die hard fans. The film's visuals are spectacular and are also supported by a strong storyline that will keep you totally invested throughout. I would give Aquaman 7.9 out of 10 as nothing is watered down!",Aquaman

Black Manta was an awesome villain and his suit was faithful to the comics.if i had one minor gripe, it would be the romance between Arthur and Mera. i have never been a fan of romance in my comic book movies as i feel it takes you out of the flow, and that kissing scene, while explosions go off in the distance was cringe inducing.so, a success for DC, so lets hope they can keep the ball rolling with Shazam shall we?",Aquaman

828,redcanofevil,Better than Justice League atleast,7,12 June 2019,"I always have a soft spot while reviewing and rating comic book movies and this will be no exception. I was one of those who believed Aquaman wouldn't be anything special, and even though it earned over a billion dollar pandering to a select demographic I wasn't wrong.For every step this movie takes in the right direction, it rewards itself a flaw that in the end brings it back to where it started. Let's start with the story, it is surprisingly an almost faithful adaptation of the ""Throne of the Atlantis"" without any of the Justice league; and if you watched the Snyder-Whedon travesty you'll know it's a good thing. A linear but enjoyable storytelling that isn't convoluted with exposition heavy dialogues nor peppered with the 90's laugh track. Being a fairly simple plot it enjoys the freedom of incorporating elementary gimmicks that is enjoyable for the whole family but wouldn't necessarily leave a bad taste for movie purists either. And as a result Aquaman doesn't shy away from taking a hearty approach to make the titular character more relatable and lovable. Aquaman ironically worked best when it pandered to the 12 year olds and played its strong suit of heart, emotion and family.As simple as the storytelling and plot is, the script is indifferent. I would have a hard time believing this wasn't actually written by a 12 year old. You hear a line and if you can't immediately guess the comeback you really haven't been seeing movies much lately. The script has to be one of the most generic stacks of line ever put together in a billion dollar movie.The jokes are minimal and are not bombarded after every 10 seconds, which doesn't make the J-bombs decent though. Most of the time they're not even funny but you'll still crack a smile a few times because your inner 12 year old is still alive inside you. One thing I have to appreciate is how they don't ruin heartfelt emotional scenes with a joke, which has become quite the CBM tradition nowadays.I'm not entirely delighted with the cinematography; it's pretty rough around the edges and really hard to believe this was by James Wan. This is a type of movie that could've been made by literally any director and if you didn't know who it is by, you never could've guessed it. Everything about this movie lacks originality and you can't help but feel it quite often. There are some undoubtedly cool shots here and there like the trench diving scene or waterfall scene but those are too few and far between. The awkward camera pans made it feel like a Hindi TV serial at times. Hugely disappointed that James Wan allowed all these bloated mess of a camera work in the final edit.The score was nonexistent, aside from the Toto remix by Pitbull I can't seem to remember any sound even slightly resembling a theme or tone. CBM's really needs a decent score to pump up the juices, which Aquaman offered none. The pacing as I mentioned earlier is actually quite satisfying, which doesn't drag on and overstay its welcome in the slightest.This is the part where the aforementioned ""one step forward- one step back"" quote comes to play. The costume design for Aquaman, Orm and Manta were absolutely impeccable. Emphasis on the word impeccable as I never could've conceived that they could make the corny looking orange outfit so badass on screen, the prop obviously goes to Jason for pulling it off but I'll come to him in a bit. Mera also had her comic accurate leotard on and not gonna lie looked really well on Amber Heard. But for every good costume design there are also few horrendous ones. The white Atlantean suit looked beyond ridiculous and cheap. It reminded me of those henchmen in the old Power Rangers series, and not in a good way. The terrible wig of Nicole Kidman was too bad to ignore, Amber wore her wig better although it's just the longer end of the same straw.The CGI in this movie was painfully inconsistent; some amazing underwater scene gets totally overshadowed by a stack of utter disgraceful CGI work. I am sure the slow-mo Mera jumping off buildings during the Black Manta chase sequence is a perfect example how rough the edges really were. On the contrary the visuals were actually quite delightful and the backgrounds selected pleasant. The sea creatures looked as good as how bad the CGI looked. The trench creatures played in accordance with James's horror root and looked pretty good.Some of the biggest surprises I got from the movie were actually due to the acting. You got more renowned actors like Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Amber Heard and on the other side relative lesser known creds like Dolph Lungdren (not exactly lesser known, but stereotyped), Jason Momoa, and Yahya Mateen. And guess which side did a better job! I always believed Jason Momoa cannot carry a whole movie himself, and he brutally proved me wrong. He practically carried the whole movie for me. If Aquaman was someone other than Momoa I don't think the rating would've been what I gave, it could've easily been far less. He pumped the charisma up to eleven and even managed to rock that goofy orange outfit like a total badass. Honestly though, most of the points I gave are because of Manta, Orm and Momoa.As for the villains, lets just get it out the way: Aquaman had the best villain adaptations so far in DCEU. Manta was exactly how I know him to be, down to his iconic outfit in a proper adaptation. Although he was fairly underutilized and sidelined I can't wait to see him pop back up in the sequels. Yahya did some sweetass work properly portraying Black Manta and deserves more praise.Patrick Wilson is silently becoming a household name each year and his role in Aquaman cements his case. He naturally blended in with the character like no ones business, and actually added subtle nuances. Orm looked, behaved and sounded just perfect, where he easily could've been a Luther, an Ares or even a *Honka Honka*. Props to the costume design team for the faithful recreation of the iconic facemask and cowl and finally doing justice to the rogues of DC universe. I am also kinda glad he wasn't made out to be a power-hungry one dimensional stereotype (even though he was sort of) right in his first outing.Now for the terrible acting, Dafoe wins it by a mile with his most horrendous acting ever, really hurts seeing such a talented actor just be there to cash in. Nicole kidman was a step up but nothing extraordinary. You can blame the script she was given and I'd agree with you. Mera on the other hand was definitely the better among the trio having more screen time and a better script to work on, but as I said, nothing that speaks volume.For a superhero movie Aquaman doesn't have many fights to showcase. I didn't like any DCEU action sequence other than the warehouse scene in BVS and maybe it's just me but overall it was below subpar. The first Orm Vs Momoa was bland and contained no gravity and the stakes felt artificial. The final encounter was better in every way which unfortunately was abrupt. So aside from the Manta fights there is absolutely nothing that Aquaman offers that begs a rewatch.For all the highs and lows Aquaman was quite enjoyable to me; more than I thought was possible. It had a good heart and was brimming with a weird innocence that I appreciate. I can't stop thinking how better this movie could've been if they paid more attention to the little stuffs. But I can say for sure this was a onetime movie and really has no merit to secure a second watch. But hey lucky for them, it worked out just fine.RATING: 6.5/10",Aquaman

It's not nearly as good as Wonder Woman or Man of Steel but with that being said, it's still a pretty good movie. It's not perfect by any means, dialogue, pacing and narrative especially in the first half really bog this film down.

You can thank Jason Momoa because that's the only reason this movie made so much money. It was the best DC movie they've put out, but it wasn't anything special. Cheesy and boring story line. I don't know what it is with DC movies, but they just lack something in their movies that just leave you questioning why you wasted over 2 hours, every single time.

Wan seemed to want some sort of memorable catchphrase for Aquaman, but all of the ""Yippe Ki Yay"" lines were just dull and unimaginative. Add to that a plot that just careens from one useless hazardous situation to another and a My-Little-Pony excess of luminescent colors and you just have a 2-hr headache.To be fair, Temuera Morrison delivers a great performance (hey Hollywood, this guy needs more work) and so does Dolph Lundgren. But these guys don't have a whole lot of screen time.",Aquaman
843,jacobcichy,Stated poorly but ended great,8,12 January 2021,The movie started off with a lot of cringey scenes and dialogue with a pretty basic superhero introduction.

844,bmynars,A completely entertaining flick....,8,23 December 2018,"If you read the critics, it almost sounds like this movie is horrible and not worthy of your time. My mantra for this movie (like for many others) is: do not listen to others. Go and watch it for yourself. Only after you experienced the movie, only then you can have an informed decision about it. If I wanted to be treated to a philosophical debate about a meaning of life or culture, I would not go to a movie theater. I would read books. A movie is an 'escape' from reality, an entertainment so to speak in order to decompress. Aquaman does just that. It's pure entertainment topped with stunning visual effects. To see the underwater city is worth alone to give it a try.",Aquaman
845,euandaley,Too much,6,3 January 2019,"The film overindulged itself in special effects and big money action slow-no shots that leave the entire film feeling less interesting due to a lack of a final big payoff while the final battle is expertly done many of the action sequence before fail to hold you in, due to ""unrealistic"" happenings, there are people who walk unscathed out of situations in which they should not.
And this draws you out of the action ruining the immersion.This film also falls flat with its villain, Ocean master, who lacks any good motivation unlike the black manta villain placed in the subplot, manta is an expertly executed villain who deserves to be the main villain. All the actors pull out decent performances apart from Wilson, who feels out of place despite looking the part.

Mamoa is good in a difficult role. The mera role thing didn't work. Not because of her lawsuit or anything like that. She was just awful, and a little bit embarrassing.

Male and female main appearance level is also super fight ~ in the movie involved in the ecological view, hero view, in a wonderful way to present in front of us. Land and sea are part of the earth.

A great film, a great picture/fresco, absolutely sublime visuals (it's teeming with details and breathing expertise), excellent music, charismatic characters, humor and also a beautiful message of love and humanity.Simply a striking universe (this is just my opinion, huh) ... Colorful costumes and armor (because the film is a deluge of colors & textures, which I personally love). The construction of the film is coherent and the whole piece is really well thought out visually. Each plan makes an impression ; I would say that it is a production that has confidence in its qualities and that puts each of its assets forward, in a frisky & uninhibited way. And of course, action scenes, fighting & battles = badass ++ big slap of awesomeness.Then it is clearly also an adventure film in the pure sense.
Jason Momoa (Arthur/Aquaman) and Amber Heard (Mera) have a great complicity. And everything about Arthur's parents brings a great emotion to the story ...That's it ! 🔱",Aquaman
854,damian_hockey,An Ocean of Awesome.,9,17 December 2018,Aquaman..... Spoiler free review.So. I'm going to gush over this movie... Pun intended.Where to start. Oh I know James wan is a directing and producing genius and the only man who could pull off the perfect aquaman movie.The cinematography for this movie is something I never expected. But had me in awe all the way through. With movement and camera pans and angles that my mouth open saying wow all the way through.A multi genre storyline that crosses from fantasy. Sci fi. Comedy action and suspenseful horror. Everything I was not expecting and surprised by.The story is a mix match of every Aquaman comics origins managed to make every single one connect and work coherently.The cast is perfect. Not a single actor is out of place and feels perfect for the role. I especially liked Patrick Wilson as Ocean master who gave it his all along side Jason mamoa.Special fx and CGI. So I'm always a stickler for CGI in movies but this time I can't say this. The put down in this movie is due to props . But only in the costume department. Where some of the costumes look like outcasts from late 90s power rangers although very aesthetically correct to the comic books. Some costumes look a little cheap and look slightly cosplayish.Music. Wow that music...... I SAID WOW.... THAT MUSIC. A great mix of genres once again that work within the circumstances of the scene TThey are put in to. With a mix of orchestral synthwave rock rap. This films score works on every level.To sum up this movie had me smiling all the way through. It is DCs best movie. Better than wonderwoman (And I love wonderwoman) Better than batman the dark Knight. Better than watchmen. Yes..Better than one of my favourite adaptations ever.....GO SEE THIS FILM 9/10,Aquaman
855,StuDeb2,Jason Mamoa was excellent,7,7 April 2019,Jason Mamoa is superb. He quite literally takes your breath away. He also brings great humour to the role. The visuals are stunning. Fast paced with a lot of action and highly enjoyable. The only thing for me was Amber Heard. I would have liked an actress to compliment Jason. I felt not a strong enough actress and she didn't look quite right. She looked like an older Ariel from the Disney film The little Mermaid.,Aquaman
856,sefrafer,"Aquaman good movie, the fans will finally be able to sleep peacefully",9,13 December 2018,"Dc comics has had a few and unfortunate setbacks when trying to make movies, but this is not one of those stumbles the movie, Aquaman gives us a story based on one of the best comics of the character Throne of Atlantis and in this adaptation gives us a pretty solid story full of emotion that immerses us in a world not seen the film is an amalgam of perfectly well combined genres of moments is an action movie, others is adventure, science fiction and even romantic and horror, director James Wan undoubtedly knows very well how to get into the plot of a film, contains a message of environmental awareness quite good, but that could see was still better exploited even so James Wan perfectly well leads the actors under his charge Jason Momoa we It gives a stunning and totally incredible Aquaman that makes the jokes towards the character disappear,Amber Heard is wonderful as Mera who proves not to be a damsel in danger and rather a rough heroine, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II gives us a rather intimidating Black Manta and Patrick Wilson gives us an imposing Ocean Master, also acts Willem Dafoe , Dolph Lundgreen and Nicole Kidman who do it quite well, on the other hand the CGI effects are mostly impressive, except for some moments that are too noticeable, but the scenes in combat are sublime and the handling of the camera in those scenes is spectacular , the music of Rupert Gregson-Williams is quite good and according to the scenes that keeps you entertained, in Conclusion Aquaman is the best movie in the universe of Dc? Well definitely, it has bad things in it I do not deny it, but in my opinion details that can be done aside, if something makes clear is that when Warner allows his directors to work on their stories something good comes out of it, to my personal taste Aquaman seemed infinitely superior to that seen in Wonder woman, which is highly recommended not to lose it",Aquaman

859,cncsurf,Soggy Stormtroopers???,1,21 November 2019,"What was this mess? Of course Hollywood keeps pumping this garbage out because 'we' still want to see if this comic book movie is better than then last. And not in a good way. So many of the comic book movies are CGI abominations and Aquaman is no exception. I took 4 days to finally finish. It was so uninteresting, boring, and predictable I could stay focused more then 20 minutes at a time. And it's a 2 1/2 hour movie. This movie has convinced me that Willem Defoe is NOT a good actor. I always thought he was a good actor because of very memorable roles. But looking back his good roles are the exception to the rule. Jason Mamoa was given ridiculous lines and action sequences that show he is a bad actor despite his awesome character depiction in ""Frontier."" Amber Heard??? She's terrible in Aquaman. Even our beloved Dolph Lundgren, who made a career in bad movies, is particularly bad in this flopping fish of a movie. It is a mess from start to finish. The sequences are laborious and dull. The dialogue wouldn't impress 13 year old boys. 1 Star for CGI, zero stars fro everything else.
The plot....
1) Woman beats up soggy storm troopers and we have no idea why.
2) Boy goes on school field trip to Aquarium and that is the extent of the introduction to Aquaman. We have know idea who he is, what shaped his life, his beliefs, how he discovered his powers, etc....
3) Black guys beat up Russians
4) Polynesian guy beats up more soggy storm troopers.
5) Polynesian guy and hot chick end up in the Sahara.
6) Polynesian guy and hot chick magically appear in Sicily and beat up the robot from Rocky 3.
5) FIsh people, beat up crab people, beat up shark people, beat up seahorse people.
6) Polynesian guys beats up more people.
7) The end.",Aquaman
860,Megamovies,Better graphics than plot and/or writing,5,17 January 2019,"Disclosure: I have been on the record for many years that I'm not a big fan of the superhero genre. People have explained to me DC and Marvel, blah blah, but it's just not my thing. I usually just catch a superhero movie on tv when I'm in the mood, which isn't often.I like marine wildlife so a movie about under-the-sea critters has an appeal. The mood struck so seeing Aquaman in the theatre seemed worthy of my time.I found the movie to be of very average acting, minus the antagonist (Aquaman's step-brother). I found the computer graphics to be the best part of the film.Momoa was fine but they made his role a bit hokey with the way he stared at the camera and also some of his lines. A few times he blurted out a curse word in his one-liner. I thought to myself here's a movie made for kids, why are we trying so hard here to fit in the ""S"" word or something similar?? It just didn't fit the movie vibe and was unnecessary.
I also felt like the movie producers were trying awful hard for future cash-grabbing. How many characters can you introduce that look completely different so we can put a bunch of these toys out on shelves. Haha. I sound like a hater but just being honest.It was an okay flick. A decent time.",Aquaman

Aquaman and Mera were great characters with great chemistry together. The Visuals of the movie were fantastic. The city of Atlantis and this underwater world looks amazing, I'd go as far and say it looks way better than anything Avatar gave us.

863,thorx89,"Cheesy, contrived, cliché mess",4,25 January 2019,"What a underwhelming experience this was. Great material completely wasted by poor writing, leading to mediocre acting in a movie that feels rushes from start to finish.The Aquaman backstory is quite rich in emotionally poising element which are never really exploited. A great example is the honorable relationship between the hero and ocean life in the comics. In the movie, the animals of the sea are reduced to expendable weapons, which Atlanteans do not hesitate to destroy by the hundreds.Compelling visuals: the CGI is quite good in some aspects and creates an engaging atmosphere but the film relies way too much on it, losing touch with any kind of realism.Entirely predictable: the script holds no surprise or twist and the dramatic moments are poorly executed, leaving you wishing for a special moment that never comes.Horrific dialogue: cheesy, contrived and often cringe-worthy. Several scenes deserve heavy skipping.Zero character development: apparently we're supposed to accept characters as they are introduced to the screen with no backstory or arch whatsoever.",Aquaman
864,elale-573-971300,"nonstop fun, and hey it's Jason Momoa, what more do you want?",10,29 December 2018,"I went to see this with another lady and of course you know we would have gone to see it even if everybody said it sucked, because how could we resist Jason Momoa in a bathing suit? lol. But fortunately it totally didn't suck.The main character:The character Arthur Curry is basically King Arthur, but underwater. So it's got that whole ""based on mythology"" thing going for it, like the original Star Wars movie did.The visuals:The fx are great. That's fortunate because there are a ton of them. Since so much of this movie is set underwater, and both the underwater and non underwater scenes have a lot of action and fighting, this is really a big cgi fest. If you don't like looking at cgi you won't like it. But this is the new cgi, not that older stuff that will make you seasick because it flickers like older animation. This stuff is seamless, so give it a try.The story:There's a lot going on, but basically the two intertwined plots are about a bad guy who is against Aquaman for personal revenge, and a bad guy who is against Aquaman because Game of Thrones and sea Nazis who hate genetic impurity. Oh and a love story. Nicely handled, too. Not the one with Arthur's love interest, that's way too ""defeat big bad and get the girl,"" I mean the one about his parents. I liked it.The worldbuilding:Inevitably, because this is a story about a hidden kingdom where the main character has to fight in personal combat in front of a crowd to win the throne, it will be compared to Black Panther, and it's going to fall short in the worldbuilding dept. Black Panther was a fantasy of Africa in an alternate universe in which it had never been colonized; the language, dress, customs, etc. were all based on real African cultures. Aquaman is not like that. This story borrows the popular culture myth of Atlantis, which is not a real place. (OK, I know there is probably an archeologist out there who is going to make an argument for a Greek island, but seriously, pop culture Atlantis is a fairy tale.) It can't possibly measure up, and it wasn't intended to.Conclusion:Plus, it has sharks. Oh yeah, and some great actors, too. And Russian language, which is always a cool plus for me. And dinosaurs, a cool plus for Betty. It's definitely not just for us ladies. There's more than sex appeal going on here. It's fun, see it.",Aquaman

That'd be great to see epic fights and diplomacy rather than ""hey, let's fight"" type of scenesI'd focus on past events. What happened to the queen? How does she manage to get another child? Did she make it with the king on the way to her execution?I'd leave that pirate out of the scenario and bring him back on another movie rather than portraying him that wayI'd shape the score around a theme like Icelandic folk as they used in the beginningI gave that 5 for the one who chose Jason as an Aquaman",Aquaman

He gets an A for effort as he tries to pull DC out of its slump but Aquaman was way too heavily reliant on CGI and there was no true emotion embedded into the story. Most characters were wooden and poorly executed which was unfortunate as I was really hopeful that Aquaman would go against the grain and be a good DC movie.

The whole ""treasure hunt"" was really nice little subplot that made everyone more relatable.Costumes are just amazing, they are almost exact duplicates from comics and they do not look silly at all! How they did it!? Maybe it's the environment that makes them blend in and seem ""realistic"".Some single shots are little cringe worthy, like those that emphasizes how badass Jason Momoa is.

Lack of a reasonable and logical screenplay destroyed the big budget and wasted the ambitions of this movie.

I hope so...because that's really the only explanation I can understand. Who would give this a 10?The movie isn't bad. You'll be entertained if your expectations aren't too high. But there's some bad acting and really cringe worthy lines. Some of the plot doesn't make sense, and the parts that do are 100% predictable.Ordinarily I would give this movie a 6 or even a 5, but there are two redeeming graces that make it stand out.First, the visuals. Yes, about 80% of what you seen on screen is CGI, but it blends very well and does not look out of place. If you don't notice it, who cares?In the age of Marvel, Star Wars, and other spectacles, it's not easy to impress me with visuals alone. What really pushes this one over the edge is the art direction. It's creative, beautiful, and sometimes frightening.The second redeeming aspect of this movie is a very heart warming love story. It's not even close to the focus of the movie. A second love story gets much more time, and falls completely flat.But the first love story is a surprising spot of tenderness in a blow um ups blockbuster.This movie is a solid 7. The people giving it 10s are raising your expectations way too high.

I very rarely watch them anymore because over the years I just can't get along with them at all. Batman, Superman, even Green Lantern which wasn't all that bad.
I'm definitely a Marvel guy.However. After watching this I felt really pleased! Don't get me wrong it's not the best film in the world but it was so enjoyable.The story wasn't too bad, the cast were impressive and the graphics were brilliant.
The action sequences were also fantastic and the little elements of comedy were just right.I can't really think of anything genuinely negative to say about it. It does what it says on the tin, if you know what I mean.Overall I generally judge films on whether I'd watch them again and I would definitely watch this again in a heartbeat.
I recommend that anyone who is in two minds about watching this simply because it's DC to reconsider.
It's well worth a watch!",Aquaman

But the acting is good for the most part, Momoa evolved and knows how to create an interesting character and Amber could be better. Daffoe and Patrick could apear more and black mantha to. The action and direction are wonderfull and the cgi is perfect and really of quality.

There is a scene where one of the bad guys shoots a laser into a giant rock cliff and completely explodes it into little pieces...that same laser hits Aquaman and he gets knocked down and is fighting 2 seconds later.D.C. - We need a scale of powers, what is their limit, how did they get them, what can/can't they survive...SOMETHING, ANYTHING!!!!!

However, the lack of script development was unfortunate. I also have to note that some of the musical selections were glaringly out of place. Bright spots were scenes between Aquaman and his father, because I actually felt history and deep connection between the characters that resonated in me. Momoa has a way with improvisational speech that works to anchor the bad script but everyone else seemed to be reading sparsely populated cue cards. Lots of eye-rolling cliches all over the place. Meanwhile, the action and visuals were spectacular, including one breath-taking scene of extreme peril near the end of the second act of the film. There was plenty of fun and funny moments and even the cartoony stuff was on the good side of ridiculous. So yeah, 7/10 because the movie does its job in the superhero sphere, bringing some camp, some heart, and some awesome visuals. But can we sprinkle some ""Whedon dust"" on the next installment please?!? I have a feeling he can craft the more complicated dialogue that should have been explored in this origin story.I saw this on IMAX. I highly recommend watching this film on IMAX.",Aquaman

Any every possible psychedelic colour who could imagine.Its was like the director was on a bad acid trip. Myself and the family who are by the way big fans of the marvel franchise could only watch this for about 40 minutes. Its a shame because Jason Momoa who I think is a very decend actor was let down by this very poor script. This character was much better portrayed in Justice League but then Zack Snyder directed that where Aquaman was directed by James Wan who would be better known for directing Horror movies and I think this is where he went off the rails. Aquaman 2 has been announced and I fear when James Wan gets his hands on it, it will be more of the same. One to avoid!!!",Aquaman

Enjoy!",Aquaman
884,s-maniatopoulos,Very entertaining,8,6 March 2019,"DC has finally decided not to take its filmmaking endeavors too seriously. Though the film does not follow the successful Marvel recipe of laughs and explosions, it still manages to entertain by combining different genres: the Atlantis scenes remind a Space Opera. The plot (a quest for the King's trident) is a successful combinations of Lord of the Rings and (on occasion) Indiana Jones movies. How can these different genres be combined? All one needs is an inventive and intelligent director.Overall, this is a very entertaining movie and compared to all other DC titles, it clearly stands out as their finest yet, up there with Wonder Woman, and in my opinion, this one is even better. Mr Wan proves he is a top tier director, as he successfully combines different cinematic elements with seamless grace.In his extremely apt hands, Aquaman is a long and fun journey, that has nothing to do with the terrible and gloomy DC Universe, as captured in the Snyder movies.I had given up in DC; I thought Wonder Woman was the fortunate mistake. Aquaman changes the expectations. It seems there may be some hope for DC's cinematic future, after all.On a final note, the cast is generally good. Momoa carries the movie successfully, which to me was a surprise after his abysmal performance in Conan. The only big mistake of the movie is that it lacks a convincing villain. Wilson was clearly miscast, I imagine under the misapprehension that the actor playing the part should slightly remind us of his mother. A bulkier and meaner looking actor would make the rivalry between him and Momoa more interesting.But at the end of the day, does it really matter that much? Nobody expects Aquaman to lose. Still, next time please try not to have Momoa trade punches with Remi Malek.In conclusion: Even if you are not thrilled, you will be entertained. DC's Aquaman is a nicely structured action/sci-fi/fantasy/adventure (!) with impressive visuals, excellent direction, and a sense of originality.",Aquaman

887,Reelnerd,Aquaman Makes Waves in the DCEU,8,17 December 2018,"Reel Nerd Review: Aquaman
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Directed by James Wan
Starring: Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Temuera Morrison
Being an Amazon prime member I was one of the lucky viewers who had the opportunity to see an advanced screening of the film Aquaman from The Conjuring director James Wan. Aquaman is a jam packed high fantasy adventure that has call backs to films like Indiana Jones, Clash of the Titans, 80's/90's action flicks and the Harryhausen films of old except substitute claymation with CGI.
James Wan had a lot of heavy lifting to do with this film due to the fact that the DCEU or whatever they're calling themselves these days is in pretty dire straits after the box office and critical disaster that was Justice League. In my humble opinion James Wan did exactly what he needed to do in giving the audience an entertaining thrillride of a comic book film that looks and feels different than most comic book movies out there. Wan infused a lot of color and humor and action in his film which is something critics have complained was missing in previous installments in this shared cinematic universe.
You can tell Momoa is having a good time on screen and because of it we as the audience have a great time along with him. Mera (Heard) tracks down Arthur aka Aquaman to help her take down his half brother Orm as he wants to launch a full scale war against the surface world for the atrocities they have committed upon the sea dwelling populace via pollution and war and only Arthur can stop him as he by birthright should be the true King of Atlantis. Think of Orm as an environmental extremist if you will who will at any cost exact his revenge upon the world.
Of course it's not as easy as all that and Arthur must go on a quest to find an object that will help him in his bid to become the new King of Atlantis. Momoa is a force of nature who brings charm, wit and vulnerability to his role as Arthur Curry. Amber Heard is enchanting as Mera the daughter of King Nereus (Lundgren) one of the heads of the seven kingdoms of Atlantis who joins Orm in his bid to take on the surface world.
Let me say how happy I am to see a renaissance in Lundgren's career giving stellar performances in two back to back films this year Creed II and now Aquaman. The whole cast was just stellar form Temuera Morrison as Tom Curry Arthur's dad and Nicole Kidman as his mother Queen Atlanna. It's this love story that helps drive the film forward and I like how they bring everything back full circle by film's end I won't spoil it as officially the film doesn't open until next week and many of you have yet to see it.
Yahya was so awesome as Black Manta and from certain events that take place very early on in the film you can at least partially empathize with why he has such a searing hatred for Arthur and he is hot on the heels of Arthur and Mera as they are out and about on the surface world. The action sequences that many of us saw in the trailers where Manta and his men are chasing down Aquaman and Mera throughout Italy was even more amazing to behold on the big screen.
I attended the Hall H panel for Aquaman at San Diego Comic-Con and the excitement and enthusiasm from the cast about the making of this film was contagious. Wan jam packed this film with iconic Aquaman villains, friends and lore and some may even find the film overstuffed and to a degree it is with varying tones and sub plots and stories but I feel Wan successfully merged everything together for the most part. Some of the character arcs could have used some fine tuning but that's what future films in this potential franchise are for.
I loved the action sequences in the film and the epic battle that takes place in the third act was a spectacle to behold. I think this is the film that the DCEU has been desperately needing that will help solidify this universe as a worthy competitor to the Disney/Marvel universe. I am so happy that I had the opportunity to see this film early. I absolutely loved it and I highly recommend it to all of you reading this blog.",Aquaman
888,StephenIsADumb,Absolutely Fantastic,10,23 December 2018,"If you are having any doubts about this, stop right now. I am a Marvel stan but movies like this show me that DC is capable of producing incredible movies. Wonder Woman blew my mind and this did just the same. Of course there is some cheese (Patrick Wilson I am looking at you) but it didn't tarnish anything. When the movie ended I wanted more...so thank god for that mid-credits scene. Considering how well this is reviewed I am positive there will be a sequel. So to make it simple...if you like attractive leading roles with fantastic personalities, non-stop action (and I really mean non-stop), and beautiful CGI with equally beautiful camerawork, this is the movie for you.",Aquaman

892,darkguardian-99861,"The ""Worst DC hero"" has the best DCEU film...so far",8,29 December 2018,"Before I start, know that I know nothing about Aquaman, aside from the many jokes about how he can talk to fish.
So, I went to see the movie and frankly, I enjoyed it a lot. The visuals are excellent with vibrant intense colors (but I will have to give you a SEIZURE WARNING if you have an issue), humour and nice action. The characters were written decently and the pacing was nice enough, so that no point in the movie became boring.
I had my doubts about the director, since all I could see were horror movies, but the guy knew just what the movie needed and props to the guy to know just when the movie had to be dark and when it had to be light.I hope I don't trigger a lot of you but my ranking of the DCEU films so far is Aquaman>Wonder Woman>Justice League>BatmanVSuperman>Suicide Squad.
The reason I put Aquaman above is that Wonder Woman reminds me a bit of Captain America: The First Avenger.To conclude, Aquaman resparked my interest in DC movies, since the director knew the proper style he had to use and I'm hopeful that the new DCEU movies will have directors that know their stuff and we don't have another dark DC movie, unless the hero fits it.",Aquaman
893,vinothdharma,Stunning Visuals,7,14 December 2018,"Firstly things I liked the Action sequence, Cinematography.
I have to say the CGI works and graphics were too good which makes the empire of atlantis and the unimaginable sea life into reality.
Some of the music choices were weird. Some of the jokes didn't land and didn't even need to be there.The story-line would have better if made for an animated viewing.I didn't feel a connection to Aquaman.",Aquaman
894,loewleon,It's OK,6,27 December 2018,"Jason Momoa literally is the movie. He carries it like previous Actionstars a la Schwarzenegger.
He owns the funny, badass and emotional (well, his father too) scenes. Beside of that the CGI is well, somehow it looks amazing and totally childish at the same time. It's better than Batman v. Superman or Justice League. It also can hold up to some MCU flicks like Ant-Man or Thor.
If you are looking for entertainment you may be pleased. If you're looking for a great Superhero-movie you'll be disappointed.Oh and to all of us who were introduced to Dolph Lundgren through this film, do yourself a favour an go watch Creed II...6/10",Aquaman
895,levinsonianj,Better than every mcu movie except for iron man and winter soldier,8,18 December 2018,"Before you call me a dceu fanboy you should know that I hate suicide squad and found justice league incredibly disappointing. A dceu fanboy would think that all six dceu movies are masterpieces. That being said I have loved the other dceu movies and I am not a fan of the mcu. I find most of their movies bland, obnoxious, superficial and soulless. On the other hand, aquaman is none of those things. It has heart, a good arc for the main character, its villains have a little more depth than most mcu villains, its vfx/music and cinematography are easily superior to every mcu movie. The soundtrack is easily one of the best of the year. Amber Heard and Jason Momoa have great chemistry and the supporting cast are all memorable. The best part about this movie is that while it does have humor, it never cuts into the emotional moments. Aquaman like wonder woman before it is sincere and allows its drama and action scenes to play out without every character cracking jokes every five seconds. Another thing aquaman does well is that it gives its villains plenty of screen time. The movie isn't perfect, its pacing is a little messy and its story is predictable, but it commits to its tone and because of that it works. I think that the anti dceu bias is obvious considering that it has far worse reviews than most mcu movies. The vfx alone would make this a better movie than black panther but the likable characters, good acting,production design, music, directing, and tone make this the second best live action superhero movie of 2018 behind deadpool 2. In a fair world aquaman would receive oscar nominations for vfx, score, production design, sound mixing and sound editing. In reality it will receive none of these things while black panther which had horrible vfx and sound design will receive tons of technical nominations and even a best picture nomination. Oh and my review will receive tons of down votes because mcu fanboys can;t handle the idea of dc even trying to compete",Aquaman

It's a James Wan movie) Nice use of comedy though it's only worth a chuckle. The story is safe but solid, nothing unexpected but nothing horrible and quite touching to be honest. The effects are great, if you'd seen the first trailer, the effects were only tolerable, but now with the effects all done, it is enchanting!

899,ssnake_z,At least it's pretty,6,25 August 2019,"Aquaman
RATING: 3.2/5This movie has no business being 2 hours and 22 minutes long for being as dumb as it is. I really don't get how Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse can have more characters and tell a more cohesive story in less than 2 hours, and look way better doing it, while Aquaman trips all over itself. People try to excuse the stupidity of this movie by saying it embraces it's comic book goofiness, except that's a lie. The movie is a mess and it never fully commits to itself. Some characters play it super straight, but their dialogue is so bad that it comes off as generic, over the top, and just dumb.The movie gives you two villains, Ocean Master and Black Manta. The problem is that they're two of Aquaman's biggest villains and they could each hold their own movies as the main antagonist. Black Manta's intro is something that could have been very powerful and character building for both Aquaman and Black Manta, but the garbage dialogue deflates the entire scene. As the movie continues, Black Manta just fades into the background as Ocean Master takes center stage. However, it makes no sense because Black Manta gets the origin setup and Ocean Master doesn't. Mera and Aquaman have zero chemistry, so when they get this epic kiss, it's practically meaningless. And there's a lot of moments like that where something will be presented as a big deal, visually, but will have piss poor setup and thus have little to no meaning behind it. For example, they literally show you dinosaurs in the background of somewhere they go to, with no explanation whatsoever, and no reaction from the actors. It's just poorly thought out. This is Aquaman's first real venture into this world of Atlantis and the 7 Kingdoms, but you wouldn't know it by the way he acts. This whole movie is really about distraction. They hit you with something shiny and pretty to distract from the fact that the story doesn't add up, and the dialogue is downright stupid most of the time. Character development be damned. Jason Mamoa does his best, but there's only so much he can do with the charisma he has.As for the positive stuff, the special effects are fantastic. There's one underwater scene that looks really cool, mainly because Wan gets to go all horror movie director with it, and it works to great effect. And then the story starts happening again, and you remember how dumb everything is. Smh.
Atlantis looks gorgeous, better than Wakanda in Black Panther, that's for sure. However, you're not there long enough to get any sense of what Atlantis is, or the people, which Aquaman constantly repeats he has no allegiance to. In fact, they just have Mera beat you over the head with exposition which you can take or leave with her generic acting. The action scenes are solid, nothing super memorable but solid. The big fight between armies at the end is all but forgettable, just a big CGI mess. Not as bad as Wonder Woman's 3rd Act though, Aquaman's still looked gorgeous, but despite the stakes, you just don't really care because you know how everything's gonna turn out. There's no mystery or anything because of how generic and predictable it is.In the end, yeah it's a gorgeous film but it's story is borderline asinine and it's almost 2 and half hours long, which I will admit, you don't really feel because everything moves so fast. If the movie didn't look as good as it did, and move as fast as it does, this would be an average film, maybe even less. As is, the craftsmanship manages to drag it into above average territory, but just barely... note, this is nowhere near close to the Aquaman in the current comics, but you might have fun with this Aquaman movie, if you don't think about it too much.",Aquaman

It is not an easy feat to make a film where half of the action takes place underwater, but here Aquaman excels. Gorgeous visuals, incredible underwater battle sequences, and well-choreographed fights make this film impossible to look away from.That said, the plot is fairly basic. Reluctant hero, doomed mentor, unexpected love interest, bad guy who wants to take over the world, etc. Aquaman is surprisingly likable, much different from his closed-off Justice League persona, but he's not particularly clever. He kind of just goes with the flow, punching bad guys as he goes. There are various attempts at injecting humor into the script, but its not very smart - especially compared with the witty comic brilliance of the recent Deadpool, Guardians and Ant-Man films.One aspect of the film that was done surprisingly well was Black Manta's origin story.

The plot is incoherent and even for a film that handles radical concepts such as this, a lot of it was totally ludicrous.It wasted the talents of many great actors. Willem Defoe was reduced to a bumbling idiot, Patrick Wilson was a one dimensional villain. Dolph Lundgren was a tired old man.

Like many superhero fans, I just keep hoping some DC characters will get the treatment they deserve. This one is not even close. Horrible, nonsensical dialogue, no real characters at all and a lot of bad acting. Momoa is ok, Amber Heard is laughable and the truly seasoned actors (Wilson, Dafoe, Kidman, Lundgren) carry almost all of the acting weight. Stunning CGI, though! But nothing more.",Aquaman

Would Aquaman bring DC to justice and save their new live-action library? Well, I'm glad to say that this definitely delivers. I saw this in theatres with my dad, and I didn't look away. It had a lot of action scenes that were put together really well and the water was someof the best effects in years. The two main leads are wonderful, though I do think they could have given Aquaman himself more brains than brawn. I do love the actress who plays Mera, and she does give a really convincing performance, but I do feel like they were a bit pushy with her action scenes.

The story doesn't meander too much, and everything stays on point. All the flashbacks are done with great effectiveness, especially when Aquaman speaks to the big bad ass Kraken guarding the trident of all tridents. And how could you miss with a unbelievable supporting cast comprising Dolph Lundgren , Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe. Also, I didn't know the Kraken's voice belonged to, of all people, Mary Poppins herself, Julie Andrews. The visuals were amazing, but did not overload the senses, unlike Batman v Superman or Justice League. I hope the people at DC/WB now realise you can't replace good storytelling (and good acting) with outrageous and overwhelming special effects. It doesn't work that way. It was indeed appropriate that our hero announced his arrival in our superhero consciousness with a commanding tone at the end of the show with ""I am....Aquaman"".p/s With all this momentum going for Aquaman, Wonder Woman 1984 has a lot to live up to.

943,The_Man_XX7,Is this the start to the Rise of DC,7,2 January 2019,"I liked Aquamam it was big,colorful, fun and overall an enjoyable DC superhero movie however it did have some significant flaws.I can say that Aquamam was DC's most ambitious movie to date and they nailed most.The first act of the movie is pretty solid you get some backstory on Author Curry, some nice foundation for the plot and interesting interactions between Aquamam and the villain Black Manta earlier on which the movie does a good job of making you understand his motivations for hating Aquamam and wanting to kill him and Makes Aquamam reconsider some of his actions regarding Black Manta which was some nice writing.The second act of the movie was surprisingly the weakest just when the story was about to kick into gear the movie gets goofy I mean characters like Mera and Aquaman become cartoony and silly as the movie's attempts to make you laugh becomes forced and awkward I mean there is literally toilet humor in this movie.It looked like two different people were directing the movie compared to the first half of the movie. Even characters like Black Manta became campy with him saying some weird dialogue. I wouldn't say the second act is terrible but compared to the first act of the movie it's just not as good.Luckily the movie comes into focus in the last third of the movie with some very good action, compelling story and surprisingly great CGI throughout the movie and some of the best I've seen in a long while.The best characters in the movie were undoubtedly Aquaman and Mera. Jason Mamoa and Amber Heard had nice chemistry with each other even in the goofy scenes, Aquaman's journey to becoming King was well done as the movie made you understand why he reluctant to be King and how Aquaman's character grew throughout the movie especially with the help of Mera who also has a good mini arc in the movie and she had some badass scenes in the movie and again her best moments was with Aquaman as they went well together.The villain Ocean Master played by Patrick Wilson was bland, I mean they could have done much more with him but as the movie went on he became just another generic bad guy. Earlier in the movie he had some decent reasons for wanting to have War with the surface and had some good interactions between him and Aquaman since their brothers but you never got to see more of that. Patrick Wilson's performance wasn't even bad it was actually decent but the story involving him didn't have anything significant to do besides being evil because he is a bad guy.Like I said earlier the visuals were incredible and very colorful especially with the scenes under water and the sea creatures i never knew James Wan was capable of directing a movie with such incredible visuals and great CGI so one thing you could say about Aquaman is that it was truly a spectacle at times. Atlantis and other sea kingdoms looked pretty good and contributed to the story well however sometimes these under water kingdoms like Atlantis felt empty at times I mean it looked interesting but you never got to see more of it besides action scenes and water battles which was kind of disappointing.The action was also very good again the visuals helped make the action good at times especially the final battle it wasn't the best thing ever but it was very nice.The story is pretty solid and Aquaman's journey is interesting as he deals with responsibilities he doesn't want to have but he grows over time into a hero and despite being campy at times the movie has some pretty funny scenes so that's another plus.So I enjoyed Aquaman it's DC best movie since Wonder Woman not as great but still a pretty good movie with a solid story, great CGI and visuals and characters despite a bland villain and silly second act. Hope this continues for DC movies.",Aquaman

The tone itself was quite different and fun to watch.*The only reason I gave it a nine out of ten is that the dialogue is fairly predictable and sometimes, it sounds like they are reciting a play*There are so many characters and the movie worked.

949,bibingraj,Below average...,5,19 March 2019,"All these comes to point out that no matter how much money you put in a film and how much interesting character you can use from a beloved universe, if you don't set the story straight, you will KILL its potential.
DC had already messed up its film and Wonder Woman being just AVERAGE, Aquaman was seen with lot of hope. And without a doubt compared to previous DC films, it may be a better film,, but we don't lower our standards.At start, though Nicole Kidman acted well and the other guy tried his best, the connection was just not there. Their reunion was like blah. Nobody cares.Joke attempts were pathetic. You could pinpoint the joke long before the joke is delivered. They even added some joke sounds or something. Just pitiful.And the MUSIC! Totally out of place. Just didn't feel right at all. Soundtracks accompanying many a things were just bad, pulled you out of the experience.Villian generic. The sub villian whose dad died, just total waste. Could have scrapped him and developed the story well.
The chemistry between the leads Jason Mamoa and Amber Heard - NON EXISTENT. Totally forced, out of place.
You can't blame the actors because the dialogue and script was crap. They can do nothing with the crap dialogue.
You could just predict, yes this is the joke part, yes this is the caring part, romance part and all feels so stupid and manipulated.
Most unintentional hilarious scene - Goes to some place in Italy (Here the aspect ratio changes to 'bring in the romance or whatever'). She looks around in wonder and some guy gives her a bunch of roses for NO REASON (maybe he got enticed by the red hair and just blatantly obvious distracting dress) , makes some water dolphins and the kid watching it gives her a Pinocchio book. WHAT?
Everything feels plastic. No amount of light and CGI effects can mask the blandness of the whole movie. Trying to suck out emotions from audience unsuccessfully.
Just different styles mixed here and there. At times felt cinematic, other times like a badly made romcom tv, other times like a video game!
There's a scene when its nighttime and they are in the boat towards the place with the trident, and some creature things jump the ship to attack them. That whole 1-2 minutes feels like that out of a video game! The camera movement, closeups, the whole thing.Ultimately the plot as a whole was not the best. But it could have been salvagable.Forgettable watch.
But its not without its positives. Had some pretty cool action scenes.
Atlantis was very colourful! And thats it.",Aquaman

952,mjbset,Critics are Right,4,23 December 2018,This was a good DCEU movie. But a medicore movie. I would expect more from to get some of the audience rating I have seen. The acting is medicore sadly and the jokes weren't evenly paced and seemed forced. The action sequences were really good. However the characters were not compelling. At best for even DC fans this could maximum be 7 out of 10. Anything higher I would question the reviewers judgement and honesty.,Aquaman
953,mjbset,Question everyone rating this over a 6,4,17 February 2019,"While this is arguably the second best DCEU film any reviewer giving this over a 6 has very low expectations for cinema. Furthermore I warn anyone with limited entertainment budget to watching future entries in the DCEU at the cinema until you hear from reviewers you usually agree with.The movie was ""fun"" but I found the developement of the characters lacking. The villian wasn't intriguing in anyway. Some of the visual were jarringly bad also.Aquaman's mother, father, and Altantian mentor saved the movie from being just a campy kids movie. It also did a great job of delivering the back story of the history of the underwater kingdoms.For something you are going to fork other cinema money for it is 4. For home watching I would give a 6. Anything 5 and below you should avoid at the cinema in the opening 2 week or altogether at cinema.

Amazing camera shots and Awsome battle scenes. The final battle is the one biggest and most visually amazing battles in the history of the superhero genre. Characters mix with each other well, pretty good soundtrack, beautiful visuals, and great cast.

A somewhat messy plot at points and some few cheesy lines.Conclusion: Aquaman is a visually breathtaking movie that stands with the likes of avatar and ends with a huge satisfying climatic battle, although there is somewhat a disorderly plot but it just gets forgotten in a wave of DCEU refreshment.",Aquaman

A great coming together cast, an engaging young director plus a skilled producer on a budget.The cinematography is indulging the senses throughout, especially with aspect ratio changing IMAX action sequences which create an immense boost of endorphine for any spectator even as the story of 'Arthur Curry', finding his trident, uniting the seven seas under one king, keeps no surprises.In the end 'Aquaman' stands the test of time mainly by the fitting chemistry of leading duo Jason Momoa & Amber Heard, which will surely do not stop to amaze in the upcoming 2022 sequel under returning James Wan directions.",Aquaman

961,dvoon-missy-mcmuffin,Look...He's talking to fish...,7,13 December 2018,"...That shark scene in the aquarium is just the best.Aquaman...he used to be a joke, way before mainstream comic book movies became the norm. But to make his comic book suit work on film, is just an astounding feat. Those orange scales and green leggings, fit perfectly and does not look cheesy at all. For that - I applaud the team for not shying away from the character's roots.As to the movie itself. I admittedly enjoyed the second half, way way more than the first half. First half (after the linear introduction of his origin to that of present day - which was great) was well...full of expositions that was somewhat weirdly edited to intertwine both present and past. It happens kinda often that it really took me out of the storytelling. Being able to mentally recall the last time it did that, it just felt repetitive and overuse.And speaking of repetitiveness - that Michael Bay 360 camera rotation technique is just er...not good at all. If I recall correctly - it is used like three times for first half of the movie. And then there are those character building time scenes that was suddenly disrupted to lead into the action scenes - that got very repetitive too. Basically - it feels like the rhythm of the edit was very jarring.Even the sounds got abruptly cut off, as the camera pans up from the drumming octopus to those in the ""lobby deck"" - was a very weird choice, instead of having it naturally fade out. And there is that one scene with Black Manta and a song playing full on, that felt so out of pace and out of place.Besides all the technicalities above, after all the setups, once Arthur and Mera finally went on their expedition - that was when the movie kicked into another gear. It became a story that I found interest in. That was more enjoyable. Both Jason Momoa and Amber Heard exudes a believable chemistry. And Black Manta was comic book perfection - to make his look work on-screen too. And I felt the heart of the movie - when he met with his mom, his brother meeting his mom, and lastly his dad meeting his wife - those were very nice touches.Anyways, this film makes it cool to want to talk to a fish.",Aquaman

963,twentystcenturychristian,"Painfully, laughably terrible",4,16 March 2021,"I love Jason Momoa. I so wanted this to be great, but if great is the North Pole, this is the South Pole. The only thing worse than the utterly amateurish VFX, where the fish look like shiny plastic, is the corny, clichéd script.",Aquaman
964,Harbour184,Momma carries it!,6,27 October 2019,"Only reason I wanted to see this movie was the leading man...Jason Momoa is the most gorgeous masculine male actor I've seen in a long long time in the movie business....he's right up there with Sean Connery...they both have that indefinable quality of extreme masculinity, body to die for, sexy eyes, sense of humor and the x-factor. Hollywood just doesn't have many of them any more. The plot line could certainly been better but the sfx were wonderful! And to have Nicole Kidman aboard was magical! My main gripe about the whole movie was the casting of Mera...ANYBODY, ANY FEMALE could have played that part better than Amber Heard...she is the most wooden, no talented actress I've ever seen in any role.. Any actress who doesn't have any chemistry with Jason Momoa, is a horrible actress! That was my biggest disappointment of the whole movie and the reason my review is 6 instead of 10.",Aquaman
965,whitewitchlady,Yes - a true 10,10,26 December 2018,"We saw the movie on Christmas Day and it was a pleasant present! There was a lot of action, great story, some funny lines, excellent acting, etc...Can't wait to see this again!",Aquaman
966,annisasafanta,I hope this is Marvel,7,4 January 2019,"I don't know where to begin. But first, I'd like to praise James Wan for directing this movie. It is seems more colorful and brighter than any other DC Movies. Jason Mamoa succeed in taking the role and all. This movie brings happiness to the audience thru all steps in the journey.",Aquaman
967,swapniludand24,a visually rich magnum opus (DCEU at its best),10,16 December 2018,"Being a DC fan, it was tough to see the way DCEU was going. It had ups with Man of Steel and wonder woman, and it's low with Suciede squad.
But The king of Atlantis stands apart from all the other DCEU movies to be one of the best DC movies ever made. Visually rich, with a great cinematographic experience and Vision of James Wan, Aquaman is a rebirth of DCEU.
Scenes are spectacular, Acting is at its top with this movie. Jason momoa as Aquaman was perfect in every sense, so as patrick wilson, Amber heard and Nicole kidman.
But the reason of success of movie is a wan himself. Wan's vision to show the world with a vibrant color is noteworthy and to be very frank, deserves a nomination at most of the awards show.
Altogether, VFX makes it so rich and exprerience in 3D makes the deep ocean and action sequence much more vibrant and rich.
World of DC is much more imaginative than MCU and tough to represent. To show the hope of superman, justice of wonder woman, darkness of Batman, speed of flash and brilliance of cyborg, Aquaman gave a base on which Epic mega-structure of DC is possible to be made.
King of oceans is here and you will definetely love it.",Aquaman
968,redbaronx2,What happens with king Orm haircut,7,13 December 2018,Little bit confusing with king Orm haircut at the final movie suddenly short cut?,Aquaman
969,barbaravannorde,Exhausting to watch,1,30 December 2018,"Like many other movies that involve comic characters it's a constant spill of loud noises, to much action, empty dialogues and is lacking a storyline.
This movie is visually exhausting to watch. There's so much happening at once that I couldn't bother trying to keep up with the movie and eventually fell asleep.
I honestly do not know why people bother to make movies like this. 95% of the images are animated. Might have left the people out.",Aquaman
970,wolfspohrr,Wow,10,12 July 2020,"Beautiful and amazing and nothing plain like Marvel.
Is it not time to stop arguing who's the best or better looking.
DC hast the better villains and hero's and look.
Against the happy go lucky gang from Marvel.
You think u would be quiet when it's looks the same the last good Marvel movies was iron man 1 and captain America the first Avenger so don't compare enjoy watch it not because u want to see what didn't work watch it because u are interested in the story.
The comics are the baseline not the subject of the movies Marvel also didn't get it right t so they made comics based on the movies.
Anyways let's enjoy them taste is different and so are these movies.",Aquaman
971,nothimme,Better stuff than what MCU offered us for 9 years,6,28 December 2018,"CinematographyVisualsDirectingAction scenesVilliansDevelepmentsAtmosphereChoreographyI didn't even think another human being could top Snyder's visuals in DCEU. Well, I wasn't wrong about that one. I still think his visuals are the best in DCEU but this movie had lots of moments too, those wide angle and tracking shots were a treat. The cinematography was really satisfying, so thank you to Don Burgess and James Wan for that. Underwater CGI scenes were breathtakingly beautiful to look at. Set-pieces makes you forget about the world you live in. Not on the same level as LOTR or Indiana Jones or Star Wars but It's close, and I think that's a pretty tough thing to accomplish. Dialogues were cringy now and then but, unfortunately, that's what makes a super-hero movie ''good'' nowadays, and this probably will continue for the next 10 years. Too bad the days where Nolan's TDK Trilogy gave you goosebumps with just words are gone. Now it's just you have to act weird and say something out of place to create a chemistry between the characters. I can't even believe how people buy these kinds of contrived relationships anymore. Anyways, let me say this, the movie isn't something like Thor (2011) It doesn't make you feel like you're on a movie set. It actually has high-quality different places that set the movie's atmosphere perfectly. If you guys worried about if the movie is just a copycat of MCU film, you can relax. The only similarity between this movie and MCU movies is 9 unfunny and awkward moment. The movie actually harbors multiple layers. Antagonists are actually valued, they're not just background actors or extra performers, they actually have moments to shine. This isn't something like Ant-Man. It doesn't have a stereotype, cliché, and generic film elements that created for the lowest common denominator. It actually has innovations for its genre. This isn't something like Black Panther, It doesn't have PS2 battle scenes. The CGI is actually well-crafted. This isn't something like Captain America: Civil War or most of the MCU films out there, it doesn't have a dim or bland color grading. The movie actually looks lively and vibrant. This isn't something like Guardians of the Galaxy, the characters don't act irrational or illogical, they actually have good reasons because they have developments. This isn't something like Ant-Man and The Wasp, It's not just a filler movie. It actually has a worth-seeing climax. This isn't something like Wonder Woman, It doesn't fail or fall flat in the third act. It actually fulfills its mission at every level. This isn't something like Avengers: Age of Ultron or any other MCU movie. The tone isn't out of place. The movie doesn't have a recurring and predictable theme. The camera isn't too shaky or it doesn't change in every second when an action scene comes up. The villains don't act out of character when they're in a situation. This isn't another Justice League, it isn't trying to be something else. It actually knows its place. But still, nothing can save this universe, not even something as good as The Dark Knight. But as a standalone, this is something worth seeing in the theaters.PS. It's not better than what MCU offered us for 9 years",Aquaman
972,J-odishaw,As silly as it is fun,8,22 December 2018,"Let's be clear, Aquaman is a pretty dumb movie. But boy if it doesnt put a smile on your face then you probably shouldnt be going to a CGI laden superhero film. James Wan embraces the lunacy of the subject matter and delivers. The dialogue is truly what brings down the movie but Jason Mamoa doesnt let the poor script stop him from oozing charisma. While his chemtestry with costar Amber Heard doesnt fire on all cylinders it is still fun to watch everytime they share the screen together. For all the CGI, and there is a ton of it, the only time it's hard to watch is during the final battle. Other than that we get some of the best the industry has to offer. Most of the cast is working below their talents to be sure but they seem to be having fun and deliver convincing performances.",Aquaman
973,roninanton,Boring CGI abomination and waste of time,1,21 December 2018,"Wannabe so many things, such a mess. Boring CGI abomination and waste of time",Aquaman
974,hasanbolkiah-91427,Not perfect but definitely fun (not bad DC),8,10 February 2019,"This movie yells action movie/superhero movie and all the cliches you can think of but it is definitely a great addition to the DC Universe. James Wan did a great job filming this movie as it showed and created a world (Atlantis) that is just appealing. Interesting and charismatic leads, Aquaman and Mera. Even the supporting cast (villains and extras) were all great additions to the movie. the Pacing does take time as it is a 2 hour movie, but keeps the fun in it. It contains nice cinematography as it shows a world for us to embrace. The action is a definite plus to the film as it had great one shot pieces or long set pieces that are effective and appealing. It has some difficulty securing everything it has so the movie can feel quite congested but overall a fun ride! A big 8 out of 10 and a good job to DC.",Aquaman
975,sanjayasantoso,Best DCEU movie after Wonder Woman,9,12 December 2018,"AQUAMAN (2018)DC you finally did it! Another worthy movie from DCEU besides Wonder Woman. Never have I expected the movie to be turned as good as this, especially since the director James Wan is famous for mostly horror movies such as Saw, The Conjuring, and Insidious.You can also call this movie the Black Panther version of DC : the plot which is battle for the throne, the lost and advanced city of Atlantis which basically is Wakanda, and the powerful villain of King Orm which basically is Killmonger. Surely there are some point which different but those elements are the most that standout to me and basically feels Black Panther enough for me.There are some things that I must say Aquaman did better than Black Panther : the beautiful tough and badass Princess Mera portrayed by Amber Heard, a badass mother Queen Atlanna portrayed by Nicole Kidman, and a better 2nd villain in the form of Black Manta rather than Ulysses Klaue. Besides that, Jason Momoa is standout as Arthur Curry and Aquaman is a truly energized fast paced action superhero movie since the beginning that will keep you amazed until the end and not realizing that the movie duration is almost 2.5 hoursSo why the 4.5 and not the perfect 5 score? Well since basically I am a Marvel fanboy and I watched Black Panther 3 times in theaters, which is a record for me, this movie cannot have a better score than Black Panther LOL. Wakanda ForeverScore : 4.5 of 5 stars",Aquaman
976,nsrporfirio,Not even with chips,4,5 March 2019,"Oh please such a waste of my precious time.
Aquaman is just a boring,utterly overrated teen targeted CGI on steroids cliche collection.
I rated it 4 for the echological (not so hidden) message, and for the cast of Jason Momoa, he is the perfect Aquaman but all the remain actors were there only on automatic pilot.
Why do you cast DaFoe if he isn´t meant to do what he does best?
I saw this with my wife and daughter, they rated it 6 only for Momo's looks, unfortunatelly is not my kind but like I said up there he is the perfect cast for this movie.
Enough said, Aquaman not even with chips",Aquaman
977,DrunkenDeGroot,It's a good and enjoyable movie but nothing more,5,29 December 2018,"Everybody says that this is the best comic book movie ever, but they kind of forget 2 things: narrative and characters. The movie has some issues with these two, some characters aren't fully developed, the story doesn't really have 1 main villain too, and the love between Mera and Aquaman feels forced.
And this movie is amazing visually, the production design is top-notch, but to be honest some of the de-aging CGI is so obvious, that it's annoying, some models aren't fully rendered here and there. The story is really full of cliches and that sometimes ruins moments, but overall the movie looks and feels amazing due to the charisma of the actors, the musical score and the overall comic-booky atmosphere of the movie. Has some issues, but overall worth the wait and worth watchingAn extra message for the hardcore DC fans giving this movie 10/10 and saying that this is better than everything the MCU could offerAquaman is a good movie. I think it's really well done, and DC is improving on their movies. Shazam I believe will be really good. But this movie is still not better than most of the MCU. I am more of a DC guy actually but Marvel movies are much more consistent with tone and quality, with the CGI, and with all characters, and they are I think overall better movies. Saying that this movie is better than most MCU movies is just too much and DC doesn't deserve it. They should work their asses off to finally give us 1 movie that everyone can say that it's great, until than, I will say that most of their movies are mediocre, because they deserve it. Good luck DC, I hope you do what we, the fans deserve. Aquaman is a good step in the right direction",Aquaman
978,ericwaldau-94911,Tacky & ridiculous but entertaining,3,14 May 2019,"Look, I have refused to watch anything DC after what God awful direction they went ins after releasing the masterpiece Dark Knight trilogy. But after i gave Suicide Squad a chance because it peaked my interest (which was okay), I decided to give Aquaman a shot simply for the fact I wanted to see what an action movie shot underwater was like..The movie is full of ridiculous scenes, cheesy writing, terrible acting & stupid one-liners. Honestly , the movie reminded me why Marvel is where it is, and why DC is the KMart version of superheroes. With every Yes-Man at DC studios that gives the thumbs up on movies like this just to rake in box office dollars is the reason why DC is slowly losing its legendary comic respect. The SFX is okay, the movie is colourful. It's entertaining if you can look past it's stupidity and put your brain on autopilot.",Aquaman
979,StevieG338,Worth a watch but not a great film,6,10 June 2019,"I watched the film with no expectations either way and to some up - it's not garbage but it's not great.There are some ridiculous elements - every characters entrance requires a slow motion taking a helmet off sequence.... hammy as hell; in the realms of nipples on the Batsuit. There is a lot of stuff thrown in to try force humour into DC that doesn't land or is just awful.There are some good elements - fight scenes with Aquaman are good, his parents relationship actually means something, Dolf Lundgren being 100% Dolf, etc.,I would rush to see it but would watch if it was on the TV.",Aquaman
980,chornby-87034,Nope,1,24 August 2019,"Too much CGI, boring, just awful really with a poor story. Make sure you've had a lot of alcohol before watching to ensure this mediocre monstrosity.",Aquaman
981,themoviedoctor,Star studded cast but overall terrible film.,5,5 October 2019,"I am a huge fan of the Marvel Comics Universe, and this DC film cal highly recommended by some of my friends. Despite their praise and the star studded cast, this film is terrible. The script writing is awful, the connection between the cast is lacking, and the CGI is overwhelming. The only redeeming thing about Aquaman is a very cool fight scene towards the end. Overall, I really wanted to like this movie but found that it was poorly done in nearly every way.",Aquaman
982,vandyslobo,Cheeseeesssssyyyy,4,20 July 2019,Super cheesey story. And Momoa was so stiff and awkward. His acting felt so forced and uncomfortable to watch. Too bad. I was really looking forward to this movie. Besides Wonder Woman.,Aquaman
983,ke_we,Dur dur double dur,3,27 June 2021,"Bad acting, silly plot , poor cgi,Silly question. At the beginning Nicole Kidman is not breathing and spits up water because she drowned - . But doesn't She live underwater?",Aquaman
984,ostlerb-02853,"Great plot, great production",10,27 July 2021,"This movie is great, don't listen to the critics. It has a great balance of action and story building. It keeps the audience excited all the way through. The motives of all parties involved are very clearly understood. And best of all, DC picked the perfect actor for this role.",Aquaman
985,FrankMize,"Pretty good, one fundamental issue",10,27 December 2018,"I honestly thought the movie was pretty good overall. First I saw the movie in 2D and as I watched it thought that it really would be great in 3D. So two days later I saw it in 3D. I was so looking forward to seeing it in 3D because I saw all the opportunities for 3D to really shine again as it did in Avatar. I'm one of those people that really want 3D to succeed and come back though I may be in the minority. It wasn't very long into the second time through, watching it in 3D, that it struck me. The whole movie is just too dark.I don't mean that in the sense that it's evil. I mean it's just too dark. There we're so many scenes that would have been so much better had we as the audience be able to see them and more light. I know the whole thing is supposed to be under water but surely they could have explained their way around that! It is my belief that are younger movie Makers just don't have the background and basic fundamentals....
How bright does a picture need to be or how long to display text so people have time to read it are just two things that popped out for me. I believe DC missed a huge opportunity here. Can anyone describe the monster at the end of the movie? I think not. Believe ratings could have been between .5-1.0 higher with more brightness and less artistic gray.",Aquaman
986,alvarhaggis,"Comics and Superheroes are my thing, but....",2,24 August 2019,"I'm 40. I grew up on comics, and as I grew up I moved Graphic Novels, before finally being given the MCU and the start of my love affair with Superheroes on film.This movies wasn't made for me. It wasn't for someone interested in superheroes for the characters, the great complicated story lines, the always in the background morality of great power and what you do with it.This movie had none of that. Aquaman is like a teenager who's being forced to clean his room. Nothing he does is because he feels he wants to, or because he should do, or because he cares about something. That may be a little unfair, I think his motivation is wanting to look cool.The script is terrible. The acting is sub par. The plot doesn't make sense. The movie jumps around, but offers no final conclusion that tie it together like most movies that jump around.Just a rush job CGI fest with no plot, that attempts to coincide money from the superhero dollar created in the last 10 years.",Aquaman

988,koendit,Not sure what the hype is about,5,3 January 2019,"Afraid I hated this movie. No script or storyline, just tons and tons of unnecessary CGI. This movie is CGI, CGI, CGI. Everything in this movie felt forced. Only redeeming factor was Amber Heard.",Aquaman

991,chmpgnrose,Suspense with a good plot and filled with action,9,21 June 2019,"As a woman I am not a big fan of comic books from either DC or Marvel. However, watching this movie at the theater without any previous knowledge or history of the leading character hero, but I actually enjoyed this film. The plot was solid which held a good story filled with action and suspense supported with good acting. I admired the relationship with Mera and Arthur working together to save Atlantis and the prevention of a war between the worlds of ocean and land. I also enamored with Nicole Kidman's motherly affection for her two sons.",Aquaman

993,foxtwc,Good action movie,7,20 January 2019,"Let's face it, most super hero movies are cheesy and consist of action sequences. This no real exception but it is entertaining.I know nothing about aquaman from the comics so I cannot say how true to the canon it is. What I will say is it's not a dark film like the rest of the DC movies.I have no idea what aquamans super powers are ... some things just don't seem to hurt him. And yet he desperately tries not to fall or get hit .... which makes no sense since some kinetic impacts are truly devastating looking ... but then he can't take a punch from a human.But let's not poke holes in the plot. Just enjoy it for what it is ... a popcorn movie with Nicole Kidman who still looks amazing and Amber Heard who would make most men want to be a merman with lots of action",Aquaman
994,panzerskraft,For children maybe,1,29 January 2019,"There can't be any adult who gives this a good review. I can understand an eleven year old child liking this though.It looks cheap, sounds ok, cheesy story and acting and the action/fighting is just not very interesting. I got sleepy and started looking at my watch after 30 minutes. And there was two more hours to go..If you're over 15, see something else. If you're under 15, see something else.",Aquaman
995,panzerskraft,Pure garbage,1,10 June 2019,I watched half of it and just couldn't stand anymore of this cringy crap. How is anybody enjoying this? Bland mushy effects. Ridiculous story and action. Totally useless actors. Yuck!!,Aquaman
996,yodaschoda,Best DC Movie of the New Era?,7,8 March 2019,"Aquaman presents a pretty fun movie experience overall. Great visuals (of course) but a decent story as well that stays trueish to the source material. What liberties they did take worked for the most part.Easily the most approachable DC movie for most people, and unlike the others in this franchise it isn't perpetually dark and grim. Jason M (whom I hate in 90% of his movies) does a GREAT job and presents a charismatic version of Arthur we don't generally get.Though it should be said, the jokes about it being ""wet Thor"" are pretty accurate. Not so much from a story front but from a stylistic and mood point of view.",Aquaman
997,neill-dunwoody-807-181790,DCU finally get it right,10,13 December 2018,"WOW this was a rip roaring adventure ride... easily the best DC Movie in years. Visuals are stunning and Jason Momoa is the perfect person for Aquaman, I definitely need to see this again, and for all the reviewers that said this was boring you must have left your humanity at home. This was brilliant",Aquaman
998,ctilly69,Enjoyable,8,15 January 2020,"Considering Aquaman is generally the back of DC jokes, Jason Mamoa has made the character into a bit of a badass. Whilst the story isn't fantastic, and some of the CGI is comical, it's a refreshingly fun film with a good cast. Justice League was ok, Batman vs Superman was aweful, this is definitely a step in the right direction for DC",Aquaman
999,Oliver-Dawson,Go watch it,8,7 February 2019,"Now im fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC's aswell.
Problem with both of those is that only few of their films are good, everything else they make is only for money.
but this, this was gold.StoryHonestly i expected this to be crap and have same old story, but no.
When tsunami came, i though Aquamans dad would die, but he didnt, so it didnt give that usual superhero story vibe, it felt better. Aswell the part that he didnt want to rule the kingdom or have anything to do with it.CharactersYou cant have better Aquaman than Jason Momoa, he literally borned for this part. He looked perfect, his acting was on point and boy, that golden aquaman suit made my day.Mera aka Amber Heard, aswell good acting and looked perfect for the part.Vulko, was 5/10 character, same old family friends who helps out the Prince.My 8 points go to good CGI,Story,Characters and for being one of the best superhero movies of this decade.",Aquaman

Then Atlantis with its multicolored bridge and I'm out. Jason was nothing but comic relief the whole time. I had to keep reminding myself Amber Heard is not Scarlett because seriously, she sounded just like her sometimes. The visuals were cool, but they felt recycled and outdated.I mean, some musclely, long haired, snarky guy fights his younger brother for control of a throne by using a magical, OP weapon he has to be worthy of.DC went for this because it was an easy win, and I can appreciate that, but that doesn't mean I have to claim I enjoyed it like everyone else who rated this movie.",Aquaman

1003,whiterose-54828,It Somehow Works,7,14 August 2021,"To put it simply Aquaman is one of those movies that while technically not that great still manages to somehow draw you in and keep you invested. Beneath all of the cheesiness and the clichés you can tell there was heart put into it and that those behind it were very passionate about the project.The underwater setting is quite unique and leads to some visually stunning scenes, the scene where Arthur and Mera enter The Trench for example is particularly aesthetically pleasing. I also quite enjoyed the scenes with young Arthur and his parents, as well as those in which he is being trained by Willem Dafoe's character Vulko.This doesn't however negate the issues the movie has. The plot is convoluted and exposition heavy, they build up Black Manta (Aquaman's answer to Joker or Lex Luthor) as a major antagonist only to have him show up for a five minute fight scene in which Arthur easily disposes of him.There are some attempts to make jokes which often fall flat, as well as strange moments that feel out of place such as a scene in which a weird cover of Toto's Africa by Pitbull is played (What was that about? Because they were in the Sahara Desert which is in Africa?).Perhaps the biggest problem is that they portray Arthur Curry at times as being a complete idiot who is incapable of working anything out by himself, this is to seemingly make Mera's character appear more intelligent and competent than he is.Overall it's a visual spectacle and a fun time but not without it's flaws.",Aquaman

My friend ended up sleeping through some of the fight scenes, but It was overall good, better than Justice League (sorry to those fans out there, but it was genuinely bad), they still kept the jokes and funny scenes at bay as well. The effects were great, though Heard didn't convince me in some of her scenes, which was a shame.

1011,john_constantine,Tedious to watch CGI demo,5,25 January 2019,"A tedious to watch movie that doesn't deserve it's hype.It's all about CGI here. It looks gorgeous. Bright colors, fantastic design of Atlantis, Subnautica-esque bioluminescence. But it feels shallow. There are a lot of underwater scenes, but they never feel like underwater, they feel like everything is floating in zero-G. Nothing in the water, no cavitation, no resistance, everything flies around in top speed like in a space opera. Nothing has weight or feels physical. The fight scenes are well done but become repetitive quite fast.The actors do very well, but are battling with a boring cliché script. The dialogue is wooden. The story is riddled with clumsy exposition and pointless McGuffins. The characters never come alive. You never feel for them. They never make any meaningful choice that is not obvious. The characters are sad fillers for an idiots adaptation of the monomyth used as an excuse to show of CGI. The villains are beyond one-dimensional.This makes the whole thing a waste of very good production quality for a forgettable boring move that feels like fast-forwarding through a B-tier video game.",Aquaman

They all seem to complain about unavoidable expected occurances for a movie primarily based under water.Overall it is a well told story with a lot packed in it without the usually feeling of a rushed and jerky scene changes like orher DC movies have in the past. Jason Momoa is perfect as Aquaman. The action sequences are extremely enjoyable. The dialogues at times feel a bit off (hence the 9 stars not 10) but apart from that id say it's one of the best superhero movies out there.,Aquaman
1018,ioshadha,"$1B Box Office, Reminds me of Black Panther",6,9 February 2019,"Aquaman movie in DC universe reminds me of Black Panther in MCU. High Box office number for a flashy movie. The issue is however if you are a true comic fan you will walk a way with mix feelings.I'm don't know DC as much as I know Marvel but I had few obvious problems with the movie.. Big one was the power ranger costumes of Atlatis and then somewhat subpar script and acting. To be honest I would rate Justice League more than Aquaman any day.. At least Justice league carried more DC essence in the movie. You can clearly see that Aquaman is made for better entertainment experience than focusing on DC attributes. Somewhat similar to recent Thor Ragnarok, Black Panter etc in MCU where they were really pop cone movies made for general audiences to talk away with a relaxed feeling.End of the day studios need to make $$ and this movie is made to do just that. DC's darker attributes didn't work so well to attract a larger audience in any recent movies. You can't achieve big box office numbers by trying to impress the comic fan base. You need everyone to watch the movie. So, for that you need a movie with good CGI, flashy story line (not necessarily a good script), good action and happy ending.I rate Aquaman 6.5. It is watchable and entertaining at most parts... But then as a comic fan I walk away little disappointed.",Aquaman
1019,jordang73,A little bit too much of mess,5,18 December 2018,"Well, another blockbuster with too much emphasis on the visuals and no much care for everything else. A somehow uneven script, trying to connect an undersea story with an on the ground plot. I had a hard time trying to feel confortable with the connection of these 2 dimensions. I enjoyed the undersea battles, though. The worst part for me was the beyond dull characters that populated this movie. Aquaman's father: sorry for that guy, but it was like the opposite of substance, as well as the bad guy with a gun that looked like extracted from a gangsta movie from the 80's. I gave this film 5 stars because the protaginist did a good job and he seems to be like a cool guy in real life. Also the visuals were good and, oh! one the best actors on the planet got a role here... Guess who?",Aquaman

Surprisingly you really connected with Aquaman's parents just as much as you connected with Aquaman and Mera, perhaps even more which was kind of strange. I would've liked to of seen a lot more depth between Aquaman and Mera with their relationship too, the way it is in the comics. The third act of the film is boring as well. It feels like you're watching a Pirates of the Caribbean type movie or a Disney made film, which probably makes comic book fans upset considering this was an origin story about a super manly dude. The villains are both great though which helps the story. Absolutely colorful and fun with great effects and very original.",Aquaman

I am being kind to give this movie a five. The dialogue was horrible, the acting was really bad and the writing (script) was a mess! I am a DC fan and was very disappointed. They destroyed Aquaman. I grew up watching and reading about Aquaman and the sea creatures that was loyal to him. This movie didn't capture the relationship Aquaman had with the sea creatures. Instead they attempted to copy Star Wars with enemy soldiers and all of the special effects. If you want to see a movie with lots of special effects, ridiculous fight scenes, stupid costumes and poor actors then this movie is for you. By the way, Amber Heard cannot act! She was absolutely horrible.",Aquaman

Also using Nicole Kidman as the mother was not a good choice. She just isn't believable as a strong underwater woman. Why are all the women in their 50's getting face lifts? She can't show any feelings with her face because it doesn't move at all not even her lips. Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were the best parts of the whole movie. Amber Heard looks great underwater, I can't think of a hotter actress I would love to be traveling around both above and below water!

DC apparently likes to take one step forward and two back with their films. Aquaman is unfunny when it attempts at humour, its dull when it tries to be exciting and rather confusing in general.I would particularly like to understand more about Atlantis. How does that work? Is it just a massive underwater authoritarian state with a mad, misguided king? Why exactly is he so obsessed with waging war? Why do some people can breathe air? Are they two species? Why exactly is his fiancé looking for Aquaman? Actually, why was Aquaman's mum on the surface in the first place?There are no answers here, just a bunch of crazy ideas tossed at the viewer with the promise we will understand everything eventually, and it never delivers those answers. Characters are shallow, unmotivated and just.. kind of.. there.Come to think of it, Aquaman is an absurd character anyway. Perhaps that's why no one made a film with him before. If he is not surrounded by water and all the creatures living in it, his only assets are being really strong and really resistant, which are his only super powers. In which case.. probably Wonder Woman and Superman would be best suited to do whatever has to be done. At least Wonder Woman can make people speak the truth and bounce bullets back. What can Aquaman do besides hit people with his trident and wrestle bad guys? Well, the film doesn't tell.Oh, the CGI is good. And there are some nice jokes and action sequences, so I rate it 3 out of 10. I wouldn't bother paying to see it, but it is worth a glimpse on the telly or some streaming service when it's available, if you like DC heroes, that is.",Aquaman

I have the same problem here as with black panther, and that is, the tech is just so far advanced that the movies rely too much on it. And laser battles under water are just ridiculous. I was actually fine with Jason's portrayal of aquaman, but the story line and cgi were just out of place. What happened to good old 1 on 1, good vs evil? Now, ever movie has to have multiple villians. The whole manta story line was unnecessary. And was aquaman indestructible in the comics? I just don't remember that part. And why would underwater beings be weighed done by such outfits? Capes on land at least made sense long ago, but make zero sense in the water.

(Dark Knight trilogy never existed shoo shoo -,-)When all hope was lost I thought they were starting to go somewhere with the release of Wonder Woman. But hey (: Seems like it will always be the never ending cycle of Marvel making their ground with each new release and DC desperately but failingly trying to catch up to them while both their equally toxic and dumb fanbases screw with the film ratings. They need to realise that just because a movie gives you goosebumps, doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good movie.About this movie however,Bad dialogue coupled with bad attempts at comedy.
Over the top CGI (Low budget video games does it better).
Extremely bad and cliché storyline.

Wilson, Dafoe, Kidman weren't enough to save this train wreck. The only likeable character was Temuera Morrison. I was surprised to see Dolph (not a fan) doing a reasonable job.

It has lovely scenery , beautiful colors and an interesting plot.Jason Momoa is a perfect casting decision to play Aquaman. I feel like he could carry this movie alone on his shoulders.Unfortunately , he cannot fix a bad script.Aquaman overall feels to me very uninspiring. There was absolutely nothing unique to his story. The plot in general was interesting enough to enjoy it but a battle for throne could have been much more.It just feels like Arthur doesn't deserve the title to be Aquaman unlike his comics. Even he says the same thing in this movie.He is not a bad guy , he is fighting for what he thinks is right but there could have been so much more to say about us humans and Atlantians ( who see us just as polluters and killers ) .In that way this movie feels like a missed opportunity.CGI is well done and there are some pretty nice looking effects but after about 45 minutes it just looks like a CGI noise. It gets to the point where you are sick of looking at Atlantis and just hope the movie changes the location.Black Manta villain was definitely interesting and a good casting choice but the movie once again missed a great opportunity to make HIM the main villain.Overall , Aquaman was a fun adventure with a light hearted humor that doesn't always land but fills the blanks , exactly like this movie in DCEU.

This dialogue came straight from The Room. People laughed harder in the cinema when the film was trying to be taken seriously than when there was intentional humour.Black Manta? Complete shoehorn. No need for him to be in the film whatsoever. Despite being a far more interesting villain, they spend all of the time, energy and budget on the stroppy and entitled brother.People will tell you that it was meant to be a silly and fun movie. Of course it is. That doesn't mean they delivered on that effectively.

It's not his fault, but the lines he's given are painfully childish and one dimensional. Although there's improvement compared to other DCEU entries, childish style writing in some scenes is still one of the main problems in the DCEU.
Manta's doing a better job as a villain, but he didn't exactly drew me in either. Still more complexity than Orm, for sure.Now, the film's a bit allover the place at times, there are a bit too many subplots that are rushed in the the final act and a couple too-obvious-cliches we didn't need (but didn't hurt us either). Still as a whole it is more consistent and definitely more enjoyable and well executed than BvS and Justice League, so it's safe to say that DCEU is finding what it needs.

I am a huge marvel fan, and to me this just seemed like a low budget, childs version of Marvel.
The storyline was predictable, the graphics were vibrant and eye catching but just not believable - especially trying to make them look younger.
I felt like there was just an action scene after an action scene with new people/villains to fight but no real character development and not enough of a back story to the main character.And I couldn't help but compare a few things to the marvel films:
1. The mother was never dead. And came back to the husband (who never moved on) in tip top condition. (Like AntMan)
2. The villains black/red suit was like a knock off version of AntMan. And his name Black Manta is like they couldn't think of anything besides Black Panther and just changed it to suit the ocean.
3. Aquaman is DC's version of Thor - very manly and muscular but funny and sarcastic with his deep voice and long hair.And for some reason when Arthur was going to collect the trident, I was expecting that singing snail in Moana to pop out haha.",Aquaman
1070,mwpowellhtx,I do not ever want to hear another dig on the GL movie,2,27 January 2019,"Really. I mean it. GL was arguable better than this one, I think. This one had a number of name actors from various tracks, from earlier Spider-Man franchise, from the Watchmen franchise, and so on. The childhood trips down memory lane felt forced and, in large part, I think, entirely unnecessary. There was a pseudo arch-villain mini-origin inside this sort-of-origin-sort-of-JL-sequel: namely, that of Black Manta. Which was, I think, kind of a funny sub-plot, dig on the old Super Friends franchise. But all we got from BM was a minor skirmish and a rather ignominious demise; we do get a teaser in the post-credits, though. If you know the reference, you know what I am talking about. But he was really just a tool in the movie, used by the political coup over tones. So many plots and subplots in this one, the film really didn't know what it wanted to be: an origin, or a sequel. It would have been interesting to see a couple of cameos of JL heroes, but with the depth of the cast, I can see why that would be difficult. Last but not least, really, this one was pretty bad, IMO, and gives the GL movie a run for its money for its stench. Just one man's opinion, FWIW.",Aquaman

1079,luannastarster,Another wasted story,5,25 December 2018,"I do not know the DC Universe very well, but most of his films are medium-sized. The best so far was Wonder Women. The story could have been better. I think it lacked more care and love for the production. Everything seems sloppy and hastily done, than being an incomplete feature film. CGI has the same problems as in previous DCEU films, in some scenes they are medium, in others they are horrible. The dialogue was cliché and without any creativity. Sometimes I rolled my eyes, imagining what was going on in the writers' heads ...
Why is it too long? Some scenes were unnecessary. It did not need so much flashback. And the Romance? Too forced. Why two villains in the movie? The performance of Black Manta was really bad. I could get him out of the movie, I was not going to miss it. Both villains are generic. I love Patrick Wilson in other roles, unfortunately in this movie it was a torturing to see his wasted talent. Jason Mamoa made the give to do with the script. The guilt in part is the script poorly written, it does not deliver us character development. That spoils the movie a lot. If had a right storyline, good dialogue and character development, I'd totally ignore the horrible CGI and give it a 7.5. But I must be honest so I give 4 + 1 (because of Nicole Kidman).",Aquaman

The biggest problem I have with this film is Black Mantis is completely and unnecessary forced into the plot. Most of the major plot holes are around this character.
First off his revenge plot is weak, could have been so much better. He and his dad murder innocent people for a living yet the story tries to make you care about his thirst for revenge. The worst though is how he is able to somehow completely (I mean completely) reengineer, reshape, and dramatically enhance technology that the Atlantians gave him and called it state of the art? Also, he must have done it near a black hole because the rest of the story progresses about a couple of days while he does it, oh and he learns how to use it to fight and fly as well. Absurd and unnecessary.
Other things that bothered me were,
That the comedy was forced, though not bad.
Aquaman tries to stop the war by attacking and killing thousands of innocent? The army that is defending their home and don't want war?
And why the ""king"" needs to go to war with the last kingdom before atracking the surface is beyond me, it's not like he follows the rules anyway.

The movie feels like it was made for DC fans only, who may have some knowledge of his back story. How exactly did Arthur become Aquaman? What's with the tattoos all over his body? Was he born with them? Did he get dragged to a tattoo parlor in a drunken stupor by his friends? How are Aquaman and the others able to breathe underwater? There seems to be no cohesive story line either, something to do with becoming king of Atlantis. Also, plenty of gratuitous explosions occurring throughout the movie, like watching a video game.

Thus setting the standard of inconsistancy that permeates the plot throughout the movie.
Nicole Kidman, as ""The Queen"" (Should that be Princess if her father is still king?), does lift the movie out of the normal, bland, macho bravado dialogue and action that takes place as our hero battles his way from one perilous incident to the next. It's a pity she is dead, oh wait, now she isn't (inconsistant again).
Our hero is a (very) predictable impervious superman who can leap thousands of feet out of an airplane whithout a parachute, but struggles on a two-storey roof in Italy. Watch as he boldly goes where almost no subaquean half-human has gone before.
Borrowed from other genres? --
A submarine seizure (James Bond); Power Rangers; Sea Monsters (Godzilla and Lord of The Rings); Domesticated sea creatures (Finding Nemo) ...

1101,Manolo2001,It's Actually Quite Good,8,17 December 2018,"I saw this film as I had to take my mother to watch because she is a huge Jason Momoa fan, she first saw him as Ronon in Stargate Atlantis, and well I guess my mom likes Fantasy and Sci-Fi, go figure. Anyway, I did not have great expectations, but as it turns out it was actually quite good.Momoa basically steals the show, he's pretty awesome as Aquaman, his portrayal as a tough but tongue in cheek super hero is really good, basically he nails it, a bit like an underwater ass kicking Ronon.Regarding Mera, all I can say is that Amber Heard's acting is at best bland, I would have loved to see Emily Blunt as Mera, she is a much, much, much, much better actress and could have easily pulled this character out of the mediocrity Heard gave it. In all honesty, has Heard managed to actually act in any movie she has had a role in ?? I think she is by far the lowest point in the movie, unfortunately it is a leading role and it does hurt the movie.Another low is, in my opinion, excessive violence. It is gratuitous, unnecessary, pointless and does not add anything to the movie. I will not let my son see it, he's 5 and way too young for this kind of violence. If there's a Lego version I will certainly let him see that.The rest of the actors do a really great job.Visuals are a mixed bag though, as they are at times quite amazing (almost on an Avatar, LOTR level), but at other moments they are not that good, specially when they modify some of the characters faces (Nicole Kidman, Willem Defoe, Temuera Morrison, etc.), as they try to make them younger and it does not work at all, but overall the visuals are really good, except for these aforementioned, lets call them minor, let downs.All in all it is a very good movie, it also leaves the door very widely open for Aquaman 2, which I will definitely watch.Go watch it, it's good fun.

*Visuals are some of the BEST I've seen in any movie maybe ever!
*Acting is spot on!
*Very comic book accurate
*Never should you feel bored
*Villans are AMAZINGCons
*Slight bit cheesy occasionally
*It's a bit of an origin story and with the 1000 Marvel origin stories some might feel like this is the exact same (But it being an origin story is really good for the future of the franchise so...)***My thoughts on Momoa and it's plot. ***
Aquaman is an incredible film with awesome visuals and really good acting. The plot is good but it felt like a origin story and I feel like I've seen a 1000 of these and I just want more (which isn't bad cause a sequel is very likely and I definitely want one too) I really enjoyed Jason Monoa's performance in this film. I'm glad they didn't cast a Blond type muscular dude that was kinda good at acting (what the OG Aquaman character looked like) and it felt like the Thor of the sea movie, instead Jason's look and his awesome acting skills make just him as a character way better than the OG comic books of the way Aquaman looked. One the other hand, they did the OG looking Aquaman Suit on Jason and it look AWESOME!!! This was not only comic book accurate but I was just overall a good looks for the movies tone.***Villains***
OceanMaster was a great villain and what was nice about him was that he had a good motive for his actions which is very unfamiliar for a DCEU movie. Often DCEU movie's villains have stupid motives and so they always aren't great. This is the opposite for OceanMaster, and let's not forget his awesome Helmet. BUT! Black Manta is the M.V.P. of this movie! Him as a villain was AWESOME! I just want more of him in the sick suit. The helmet was Crazy comic book accurate.**Visuals***
THEY ARE CRAZY GOOD!!!!
That's all I have to say***Mera***
Wow! Shes awesome! Super good acting by Amber Heard. Her powers are crazy cool and there is one scene that shows off her powers in the coolest way and I LOVED IT!***Reason of Rating***
9/10 because of the slightly cheesy moments that made me the slightest uncomfortable but it's really not that bad.My Biggest recommendation is to see it in 3D... I'm not a big fan of 3D but it made the movie 100 times better.***Overall***

1110,Noah_Biondi,Superhero swims in fresh water,8,7 January 2019,"Yup. This is a spoiler review. Sorry, guys.For those of you who have read some of my previous reviews, you'd know that I really hate the DCEU. Sure, Wonder Woman was fine and all, but all of the other films ranged from pretty bad (Man of Steel) to absolutely unbearable (Batman v Superman). Enter Aquaman- a film that actually managed to be the very first good DCEU film, and the reason why is because it's trying to be its own thing.What's the story? Once home to the most advanced civilization on Earth, the city of Atlantis is now an underwater kingdom ruled by the power-hungry King Orm. With a vast army at his disposal, Orm plans to conquer the remaining oceanic people -- and then the surface world. Standing in his way is Aquaman, Orm's half-human, half-Atlantean brother and true heir to the throne. With help from royal counselor Vulko, Aquaman must retrieve the legendary Trident of Atlan and embrace his destiny as protector of the deep.The best thing that this film has to offer is the visuals. The underwater cinematography, the designs of Atlantis, the creative and energetic action sequences, and, of course, the water effects are extremely innovative and breathtaking to look at. It's a huge step up from the visual effects in Justice League, and it manages to blow Zack Snyder's visuals for DC movies to the water (no pun intended). Another thing that works very well is the heart of the film. Believe it or not, there is actually a lot of very good and well thought-out emotion, way more than you'd expect from an Aquaman movie. There were scenes where I was almost gonna cry. It's hard to make me cry when I'm watching a movie, so that's an impressive move that this movie pulled off. For example, when Arthur's (Aquaman's) dad says that he still waits for her to come back on the dock by his beach house and when it actually happens, the tears start to fall on the floor. If I were to criticize something, it's that we don't get a very good introduction on Mera. It's like, Arthur's dad is about to die in one scene, and all of a sudden- surprise! Mera shows up. She ends up healing Arthur's dad, so it's not like he dies or anything. Also, the story not only takes elements from MCU films like Thor and Black Panther, but later on in the film it just becomes this generic fetch quest where Arthur has to retrieve a trident to become king of Atlantis, and of course, once he retrieves it, it becomes like every other film where everything goes into slow motion, there's Gregorian chanting, and as a bonus, Arthur and Mera end up loving each other. The ending of the film is a bit generic, but it's still a nice ending and the rest of the film plays on well.In conclusion, Aquaman is not just a really good movie with spectacular visual effects and many heartwarming moments, but it also got me into DC. I know there's two kinds of people who either love Marvel and hate DC or hate Marvel and love DC, but I'm gonna be an exception for this because now I love both. I hope DC continues to make some really great films in the future, because Aquaman proves that even DC can wield a golden trident.",Aquaman

1115,Gpanther67,"Momoa is worth the price of admission, but not the writing",7,16 December 2018,"Poor, poor Aquaman. Has there ever been a more maligned, ridiculed character in comic hero history? As a member of television's Super Friends, he was the least used or seen. Although he has been around since the early 40's and even spawned a more popular Marvel rip-off (Namor), he is probably been one of the least popular super heroes in comics, having canceled title after canceled title. Even Raj, one of the comic loving guys from ""The Big Bang Theory"" famously said ""Aquaman sucks!"". But in recent years, writers have taken him more seriously, making him more powerful and even gaining the public's respect. In ""Justice League"", he was one of the bright spots in the film and because of it he gets his own solo film. I never thought I would see the day when Aquaman would have his very own major motion picture but it is now out. The question is can it help the fledgling DC movie universe or (forgive the pun) sink it?
We learn that Aquaman'a parents were from different worlds; his father a lighthouse keeper from Main and his mother the princess of the underwater nation of Atlantis. He discovers her on the rocks on the seashore, badly wounded. After nursing her back to health, the two fall in love and they have a son, Arthur. When Arthur is an infant, they are attacked by soldiers from Atlantis and his mother is forced to abandon her family and return to Atlantis. As Arthur grows, he discovers he has powers to communicate with the creatures from the seas. He is taught by his mother's loyal advisor Nuidis Vulko, who trains Arthur to become a warrior, but is rejected by the people of Atlantis because he is a half-breed. After the events of ""Justice League"", Arthur has become a celebrity of sorts and considered a hero in the eyes of many on the surface. But Arthur's half-brother, Orm hails himself as Ocean Master and plans to build an army consisting of the armies of the 7 seas to destroy the surface dwellers for the harm they have caused to the oceans of the world. The daughter of one of the army's leader, Mera reaches out to Aquaman to help her stop his brother and reclaim his rightful birthright as king of Atlantis.
""Aquaman"" is a film that suffers from illusions of grandeur. It wants to be an epic superhero movie but it grinds itself down with silly and cliché scenes and characters. It often tries too hard to be an impressive, all-time great superhero movie and ends up becoming laughable and over-the-top. Director James Wan, who is best known for his horror films like ""The Conjuring"" and ""Saw"" gives us too many jump scares for a superhero movie. I counted four scenes in where a huge explosion or a monster was supposed to incite a reaction from moviegoers. But if you can get through some of the film's major weaknesses, there is a true gem in this film... Jason Momoa. The Hawaiian actor is a star in the making. Just like Gal Godot from ""Wonder Woman"" the producers found a relatively unknown actor and gave him a role that will define him for awhile and one that he brings a lot of charisma and natural screen presence to. Momoa can be funny, truly entertaining without really trying. Early in the film, he has some great fight scenes, which is what he excels at as an action star. The script is not always the strongest, but Momoa makes the best with what he is given. Amber Heard is also strong as Mera but some of the other supporting performers are oddly cast with veteran, capable actors like Willem Dafoe & Nicole Kidman seeming like they are out of sorts and maybe uncomfortable in this film. Patrick Wilson as the main villain, Orm isn't bad but he also won't go down as one of the best comic villains of film. Most exciting is Black Manta, a personal favorite of mine who also provides one of the film's best scenes with his fight against Aquaman. I really wished he was the main villain, but I have a feeling if there is a sequel, we will see him again. The art direction and special effects are also a strength, and the money they spent on those aspects were well spent. But, like so many popcorn films if they had just delivered on a stronger script, this film could have been something special.
""Aquaman"" is not the strongest film of its genre, even though it really tries. It has a great actor to build a solid series around if they can just come up with a better script instead of going with old, tired plots and ideals. I would suggest they make it simple & subtle, not loud & predictable. I had a good enough time to recommend this film for a matinee, but you may find yourself rolling your eyes from time to time. No Raj, Aquaman doesn't suck, but his writers do.",Aquaman

Everything works! Fun, easy, good looking, perfect 3D, music is beautiful... What else do you want? Gone with the wind?
Last five minutes are so so... Maybe they didn't know how to finished it all, or it was justice slopy cut at the end, but anyhow - it's one of the best hero/3D movies so far!",Aquaman

It had every cliche and cheesey line imaginable, and the acting was as stiff and unoriginal as any B movie. How this movie hold a 6.9/10 is beyond me. All I can think of is the people that gave the movie a high rating have either a) never watched the movie, or b) were lulled to sleep by the over-the-top CGI. Sadly, Aquaman smells like a rotting fish.",Aquaman
1119,VioletViolette,Cringey and Uninventive,3,31 December 2018,"This movie exists to make money.The CGI is so over the top that at many points in the movie, it looks like you're watching an animation. The waves, fire, and hair movements under water are so unrealistic, it was very disappointing.The storyline isn't much better, your typical brother vs brother drama with silly costumes and WAY too many sarcastic quips and one liners... (Aquaman getting on the submarine - ""permission to come aboard"").Watching the characters swim is also very cringey, noting flows well, it's not organic. It looks like puppets being manoeuvred with pulley strings.It just didn't work, at all. You can't immerse yourself in the movie because it's so hyper-unrealistic.",Aquaman

the film is somewhat silly (where there shark with lasers??) but the action and visuals make up for it.",Aquaman
1121,illimattic,Favorite DC movie of all time....,10,27 July 2020,"Almost all DC movies and shows suck to me but this movie was a winner!
Wonder Woman was overrated and had the worst 3rd act for any Marvel or DC movie. This is a great origin story for Aquaman which is what DC does well.The story, visuals of the underwater world, the mythology of the Atlanteans were all amazing for me to watch in the theatre. I don't even like Jason Momoa but because everything else is so strong it made me not care that they casted him as Aquaman. James Wan is also a great visual storyteller who uses great transitions and imagery. The movie was beautiful from the very beginning all the way to the end. I can't wait for all the sequels to this movie and I need Wan to be at the helm for all of it!",Aquaman
1122,jelaniwilliams305,"Aquaman was amazing!!! Great job, James Wan",9,16 December 2018,"James Wan did an excellent job with Aquaman. He he adapted the story from Geoff Johns' Throne of Atlantis and used Aquaman's bad a**ery from the New 52 run and I liken Jason's Aquaman look to Peter David's 1994 run (long hair and beard) and they didn't shy away from the ""silliness"" of the golden age Aquaman (if you can't tell, I've been reading Aquaman comics for years).At it's core, Aquaman is a love story of two people who had no business being together but through their union came a product that would bring unity between 2 worlds. Nicole Kidman absolutely kills it; she needs more action roles. I loved the dynamic of Arthur and Mera; Jason and Amber have great chemistry on screen. I love that Mera is pushing Arthur to become the King even if he doesn't take the task seriously at first. Along it with being a love story, Aquaman is also a globe trotting adventure movie, think Indiana Jones/Romancing the Stone. They go around the world trying to retrieve King Atlan's trident andalong the way, their bond grows stronger and I loved seeing it play out on screen.One thing I'm a sucker for is an empathetic villain...this film has 2. Orm's motivation was understandable. This film actually had an environmentalist's message about how we treat our oceans and Orm was not having it. Patrick Wilson did an amazing job as always but, to me, Black Manta was more compelling. It's ironic that even though he's a villain, I totally understand his motivation for wanting to kill Aquaman; when you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about. I'm mad that his role was so small but it was definitely effective; Yahya's Black Manta was a straight savage. Black Manta and Aquaman had some SERIOUS battles over the years in the comics and this film laid some real ground work for that rivalry on the big screen in the first act of the film.The action scenes in this film is incredible; Queen Atlanna fighting off the soldiers, Aquaman lifting a freaking sub out of the water and taking down the pirates, Orm vs Arthur's gladiator match in the ring of fire, the chase through Italy, the final battle, OMG THE FINAL BATTLE!!! James' use of the camera during these scenes is second to none. Also, the scene transitions are great.Visually, this is possible the best I've ever seen in a comic book movie; this movie should really be considered for an Oscar for VFX as well as SFX. Atlantis was BEAUTIFUL, the final battle was Star Wars-esque but underwater, men riding sharks with lasers, sea dragons, giant crustaceans and Arthur's entrance in the final battle is my favorite superhero entrance of the year along with Thor's entrance to Wakanda in Infinity War. James Wan leaned heavily toward his horror roots during the Trench sequence; the creatures were truly terrifying as was the depth from where they came. I love the underwater sound FX as well, they put a really cool effect on their voice when they spoke and the ""wooshing"" sound it made when during the gladiator match.This film has a little bit of everything; it has heart (I had goosebumps at some parts), the humor was handled well (it didn't overshadow the serious moments), great action. James Wan and company did an excellent job with this one. I'm definitely gonna watch it in IMAX on my next viewing.",Aquaman
1123,trgs5173-406-814019,Fun movie,9,27 July 2019,"Overall I thought this was a fun movie. The special effects were really good, Atlantis was beautiful and Jason Mamoa did an excellent job as Aquaman. I mean we all know Aquaman was one of the lamest Superfriends but who's really gonna mess with this version of Aquaman. Majority of the cast were great in their parts but Amber Heard just irked me throughout the movie. To me her ""acting"" was doing a bad impersonation of Black Widow. And her hair looked like a wig. I was waiting for it to float off of her head. The movie does have some superhero movie cliches like they stop to kiss literally in the middle of the huge final battle scene (insert eye roll). But I am looking forward to the sequel, just hopefully with a lot less Amber Heard or better yet recasting someone else in the Mera role.",Aquaman
1124,brad-eauclaire,Another DC redemption,9,22 December 2018,"I thought it was awesome. Visually cool. The fight scenes were solid. For me the music was a bit odd. I found myself going ""oh...that's an odd choice for this moment in the movie"" but still not bad.The runtime of 2.5 hours actually works in my opinion. I never sat there going ""alright let's get this over with"".It's a simple movie that explains everything to you. It gets all of the backstory stuff out if the way. Here you go, he is aquaman. Everyone already kinda knows about him, okay now to the action.",Aquaman
1125,aerynvala-979-283696,This was so much fun,9,29 September 2019,The only thing I didn't like about this was that sometimes the vfx underwater would make faces distort during close-ups and that was really weird to see on a huge IMAX screen.I loved the story and the characters. Mera and Arthur going on a short quest to find the sword was fun and exciting and I really liked their chemistry. Mera's powers are very cool.I loved this movie almost enough to want to risk my brain on Justice League.,Aquaman
1126,dailydoseofnopes,The Aquaman (Who can talk to fish),10,22 December 2018,This is literally one of the best movies of the year (this will get disliked because of fanboyism) but I liked it better than infinity war simply because not much happened in that movie (all set up and no ending) and this one was a thrill ride. I didn't realise this was a 2 and a half hour movie because it felt like barely an hour and i legit wanted more. This movie plays out like an 80s action movie and not at all a bad thing. 10/10,Aquaman

Also, Manta's helm is too stupid for live action. Beyond that, it's a great adventure movie. I love movies that take you to radically different locations (as the original Star Wars trilogy did). Jason Momoa does a really good job of lifting the mood out of the DC gutter, so there might still be hope for the DCU.",Aquaman

The colors and imagery get a 5/10. The same stale approach to comic book storytelling and the obvious DC trolling of Marvel's Namor gives it 0/10. Go for the color and beauty, that's it!",Aquaman
1131,jackransom-69832,Reclaiming The Throne,8,12 December 2018,"The best of this current series of DC movies. Visually incredible, epic set pieces and tonnes of potential for more out of this character's universe. James Wan's direction and the cinematography is brilliant during the fight scenes and the spectacle of the large battles (the final act of the film is mind-blowingly epic, with sea creatures fighting alongside armies etc.). The performances are good from everyone, Momoa has managed to make Aquaman cool, Amber Heard and Willem Dafoe are spot on as Mera and Vulko, and lastly we get two of the DC universe's coolest cinematic villains with Ocean Master and Black Manta (the latter having one of the best action sequences in the movie) and costume wise everyone is straight out the pages of the comics. Few minor issues, the humour just isn't funny at all, some of the dialogue is awkward and not well delivered. Also some of the licensed music used is dreadful (the score is good though). This is proof if DC aren't done with their universe and is one of the best comic book movies this year 👍🏻",Aquaman
1132,mcooknoe,It really is that bad!,2,7 July 2021,"I saw this when it came out and spent most of the time thinking, ""this can't be this bad..."". Now, I like all kinds of movies and even like many because they are so bad, they're good. I've also initially disliked a movie yet found things ii appreciated when I watched it again. This is the first movie I've disliked even more after a second viewing. Everything is exaggerated and over the top. The toughness comes off as cheesy, the attempted humor as obnoxious and the CGI.... I've seen stop motion claymation appear more realistic. I'm not even sure the 8 year old me would like anything about it.... It's just bad!",Aquaman
1133,raudafitriani,The King has Risen.,8,15 December 2018,"Better than any DCEU film, and some of MCU movies I think. The DC has step up their game - this is another level. Never had I expected this movie will this be good, after the Justice League and Batman V Superman because those movies are trash - and let's forget about those. This is the most ambitious comic-book movie I've ever seen so far. Finally a movie that DC fanboy deserves, this film is just beautiful within the cinematography, visuals, also the action scenes. The action scenes kinda remind me of Romanticism painting, it is visually stunning and breathtakingly beautiful. I'm not a fan of James Wan movies but he did a marvelous job for Aquaman. The cast are outstanding, badass performances. I don't think any actors can take the role of Aquaman better than Jason Momoa. The atmosphere of this film looks magnificent vibrant and has high-quality than any DCEU film. Finally we can see the light after those dark days. It has clear motivations for both heroes and villains, pretty solid.But, DCEU really need to fix their poor lines. The writing isn't the best - some dialogues are still cheesy & awkward. Nothing new for the plot, but it is simply enough - almost the same with any superhero film - save the world, family issues, etc. But it has a great message about polluting the water. Also the film scoring and soundtrack was a miss. And I don't see how and why Black Manta is the best villains, his story kinda flat and lacking for me. Black Manta has daddy issues seems not enough for me to think he is the best villain.Afterall, this is highly recommended movie for superhero movie fans. Also you have to watch it in an IMAX 3D. Worth it.",Aquaman
1134,veerleameyaw,Aquaman RULES!!!,8,30 June 2019,"Ok, so this movie is original in many ways: the underwater fights, the underwater costums, the different characters, the hair, the colored eyes, the drumming octopus, and keeping aquaman underwater captive. Don't forget they have put alot of hard work in the special effects. Also, It will have cost alot of money, time and patient. I think that some people forget that most important fact.This movie should deservere at least a 9/10 on IMDb. I don't understand how this movie could get a rating under 5/10 serious? What can you expect more from this movie??? And ofcourse the amazing actor: Jason Momoa did an amazing job. 1 of the most original movies i've ever soon so far!
So so so happy i've just seen this movie!!!",Aquaman
1135,danhoughton,"A good, not great, movie",7,8 January 2019,"It's easy to give this movie 10/10 if you compare it solely to its DC movie peers, but that's not a very high bar.It's fun, the visuals are incredible, but the humour is very obvious and therefore, unfunny, the love interest and the 'oh my, did we just hold hands?!' moments are worthy of some monstrous eye-rolls and, if I'm honest, there is just too many 'superhero pose' moments that it almost becomes irritating. Oh, and the black Manta looks like he's out of the power rangers. And I'm sorry, but if the villain has to say 'you can call me Black Manta' then they really need a kick up the backside. And there's an A-Team esque moment in there that makes you want to beat yourself to death with your own eyes.Despite all of these negatives, it's an enjoyable movie. No, it's not the best DC movie ever made, as much as I wanted it to be, but it's a fun movie. The Atlantis scenes are beautifully visualised, and the action is very well done. But the brazen attempts to copy the humour of Thor Ragnarok and combine it with the upbeat, music driven abandon of Guardians of the Galaxy just doesn't quite hit the mark. Its too cheesy, too obvious and it's been done better elsewhere. If it can't decide if it wants to be serious or light hearted, then how is the audience supposed to decide. I came out having enjoyed a visual feast that had just a little too much ham and cheese.",Aquaman

I turned it off around 10-15 minutes in.As I have grown up, so have superhero stories, developing plots that are more complex than just who wins the fistfight, characters with some depth, and dialog beyond that of Saturday morning cartoons. This movie - or at least as much of it as I watched - showed none of that. It felt more like something I might have enjoyed as a 12-year-old comic book fan than anything I'd want to watch as an adult.Maybe your kid will enjoy it, but if you're a grown up fan of the superhero genre, you can let this one pass.",Aquaman

But alas I was very, very, very much disappointed in this movie. I can forgive bad CGI; I can ignore lame acting; hell, yeah, I can even dismiss plot-holes and idiosyncrasies. But in case of Aquaman--it was silly, generic, haphazard, and really...boring.For instance, how Arthur got to know about trident fighting and whatnot comes from a flimsy backstory when Vulko (ostensibly) trained him as a kid. But this backstory appears after 1/3 of the movie without any gusto to sell its belatedness.Another thing is the mother/son dynamic between Mamoa and Nicole Kidman. It is simply not there. The first time they meet, they recognize each other on first sight even though THEY HAVE NEVER MET BEFORE (AS ADULTS)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Not to mention the ludicrous villain story involving Manta.Overall, not worth your time.",Aquaman
1146,Sabre-El,"Unexpectedly great movie, with stellar visuals",10,18 February 2019,"After the poor run of Justice League and a few other DC movies, there was little hope that this movie will do well. Add in the fact that the movie is about Aquaman, who is to many quite unpopular, and that most of the movie time is spent underwater, something that is very difficult to depict. Yet they have somehow not only pulled all of this off, they have managed to make it into arguably the best DCEU movie.The story is about Arthur (Aquaman) gaining 'King' status in the underwater Kingdom of Atlantis, and his endeavours to stop the nation wage war against land dwellers. It is packed with amazing fights, adventure and a wonderful underwater world and its creatures. There is quite a dynamic in the characters, and it is good to see that some minor characters also get their chance to shine (Without going into spoilers, there's even a scene where nobody-soldiers have a say in the outcome of a major plot decision)The area where the movie lacks is dialogue. It is sometimes quite cheesy, and it is clear that DC is trying to add a little humour to the movie. Sadly, it doesn't seem to work in this situation. In any case, it is not tooo bad.Up until now I had considered Man of Steel to be the best movie of the DCEU. But this to me is much better. That means, to me, it is a lot better than most of MCU movies as well. A very high rewatch value and recommended for everyone",Aquaman

Was not bad but definitely we expect more. And this movie is precisely that. It gives all what we were waiting in previous DC movies. The storyline is nice and have a faster pace that made the movie everything but boring. Has very nice visuals to the point that Avatar need to bring something very stunning to surpass these water scenarios. There are some very nice details in the lights the shoots and the general mood of the movie. Is lighter than previous DCEU but not shallow. The main characters the villains, the weapons the rides all of them are ensembled so nicely that is very enjoyable. And of course that red hair ... Amber looks sooo gorgeous in this movie that it almost make you feel sorry for Johnny Deep. CGI on faces are remarkable to the point you can't decide which one is more beautiful if the Nicole Kidman in this movie or the Nicole Kidman of Days of Thunder. I really think Wan has the Midas touch for action movies and this one is no exception. Totally recommended. And most important I believe this will give a good push to next installments as apparently DC found the formula. Finally.

1161,EmbraceTheGeek,A Unique Maritime Epic,7,16 December 2018,"Let me start by saying this film is a definite improvement from past DC Films. This movie felt a bit long considering it's run time of 2hrs 23 mins as the epic scope of CGI scenes battled with trying to keep a simple plot refreshing. It is a film of royalty and myth which rewards this film by giving it the grand scale other DC films lack. Sure this film does follow the typical formula, but there are a few twists which keep the film from being an absolute bore. Visually this film is looks pretty as the nearly endless CGI serves as mostly pleasurable to the eyes. The various environments of the sea vary from illuminated wonder to dreary darkness but it is satisfying to see how broad film is with creating kingdoms of the sea. There is a scene where Aquaman spins his trident with terrible CGI but I'll ignore that. As for character development, this film has had more than a lot of past DC films and as an audience we learn enough about Aquaman to understand his motivation. This could go deeper but in an already long movie it would be quite difficult and would most likely become a snooze fest. There are moments that are bound to make you smirk in the dialogue and the characters are likable enough that you don't end up hating them and might come to enjoy them during the film. However, this is an action film and deep dialogue is the last thing you'd expect. There are moments which can be a bit cheesy or over the top but it is satisfying to follow Aquaman through his journey though the sea. His relationships add a layer of richness which somewhat invests you in his motivations and endeavors. If it wasn't for his companion Momoa, his brashness and over the top nature would be unbearable and annoying, but she provides an acceptable balance. Overall, this film entertains with its adventurous feel and monumental battles but it falls victim to a lengthy run time which is unbalanced in pacing. I would recommend and I feel cinemagoers will feel some sense of satisfaction from DCs oceanic epic. It is a refreshing take on a system which is formulaic (both Marvel and DC) with a unique setting and royal grandeur which sets it apart from its predecessors.",Aquaman

1163,frobrojkt,James Wan... I'm sorry.,4,3 January 2019,"First I would like to preface this review by stating that I am a big James wan fan!! His directing style and talent are unparalleled in the horror genre.. but even a director as talented as Wan couldn't save this train wreck of a film.I could go on and on about everything wrong with this film, but that would literally take up the complete running time of the movie. So instead to save all readers and potential viewers the trouble I will include the aspects that were .. ok.The trench creatures!! Awesome !! Best scene of the movie visually, acted and directed!! (Don't worry, No spoilers here because this scene is in the trailers) this is the only scene where I felt James Wan's talent and horror flare showed through!! The creature design was incredible!!But aside from that one scene (literally 5 min of the entire movie) there was nothing that could save this disaster.Please, if you value your time or the time of others.. DO NOT go see this film!! Wait for the movie to go to Redbox and rent it for $1.75 so you can skip forward to the trench scene. Honestly $1.75 is a steep price to pay considering the trash you are about to wade through.. but hey, it's your time spent.. I have already wasted mine.",Aquaman
1164,gingerlead-1,Excellent movie even for young children,10,2 January 2019,This is a clean movie I found it to be worth watching and even worth buying on Blu-ray when available. I noticed a few glitches but that's okay And that says a lot for me about a movie if I would buy it and watch it again. Great going guys we could use some more movies like this that do not have foul language or sex scenes in it,Aquaman
1165,inofaith,"I liked it, except the cringe humor & music, overuse of orbital camera moves.",6,18 August 2021,"Ok so it's clear that this is not a Snyder movie. I do have to say the story makes sense, it's visually stunning, audio is good. But did they have to try and imitate marvel badly?I enjoyed it, but 3 things took me completely out of the movie at times:1. The excessive use of orbital camera movement in any type of scene: calm down man, just show us the action or dialog scenes and don't make us motion sick.2. Cringe humor in the 2nd and 3rd act. Some subtle jokes were okay, but the blatant ones, trying to be a funny action hero blockbuster flick just didn't work and detracted from the experience. Just don't and stick to the epic story.3. Cringe music choices. Like a remix of Toto's ""Africa"" when entering the desert. It's so disruptive to the rest of the experience and uncalled for.So I wanted to give this a 7 or even consider an 8. But it's getting a 6 for all those cringy moments.",Aquaman

1167,talizen,Absolutely Glorious,9,26 December 2018,"Aquaman is so glorious, I got literal chills every second of it. Jason Mamoa is too good as Arthur Curry, Amber Heard is so amazing and perfect as Mera. Black Manta stole the entire movie for me for being the most dopest character ever. And Ocean Master is one of the best DC villain since General Zod from Man of Steel. Watching Aquaman in 4DX is the perfect movie to watch if you love to get sprayed/splashed with water. Overall, I have made my conclusion for making this movie as best of the year.",Aquaman
1168,laurenschung,Could have a better story...great graphics thou!,6,18 December 2018,"Ok, I'm not well verse in the DCU, so this first story of Aquaman would be very intriguing for me.
However, that was not the case.
If i were to write this story, i would write it such that it brings out the part why Arthur deserves to be the King. I would imagine he stole the Golden Trident, with the Trident rejecting him by burning his hands. I would imagine the evil brother declaring war with Earth people, both ready to destroy each other, and then Aquaman stood between the two worlds to stop the war! He sacrificed his own life to shield Atlantis from the attacks of Earth's leaders. His Trident would then be the magical weapon it deserves, and stop the rising gigantic tidal waves in suspension, leaving the homo-sapiens in awe. Hence learning a very important lesson: don't screw with Mother Nature! No more pollution! The Atlantis people would recognize him as their true King, the Earth people developed trust with this half-breed, and the Trident accepted him as it's rightful owner...
Nope...none of that.
However, the CGIs are great, the fighting scenes are quite intense, and all the characters used for this movie are beautiful.
DCU's Aquaman got a chance to shine in this holiday season, since MCU is hanging in suspension...well most of it's characters are half dead...",Aquaman
1169,iagardner,Mankind needs a wake up call,9,16 February 2019,"I think something that goes missed in this film is the simple truth that humans are a threat to the seas. As we speak an island twice the size of Texas lingers in the Pacific made completely of plastic. Over 1.7 million tons of plastic. We all can do our part. Illegal fishing practices in Japan and China go unwatered. This movie, although only spending maybe 3-4 scenes talking about this, did a great job in my eyes of letting people know what's going on.

1171,svenfuhrmann,Oh dear...,3,24 June 2021,"After man of steel, batman v superman and wonder woman I expected something different from this film than what I unfortunately had to see for the most part. Wonder Woman, at least the first part, was partly funnier than Snyder's works, but WW never crossed a line. Aquaman is just, how should I put it, so absurd. It feels like a parody of a superhero movie at times. I like humor, but Aquaman with its exaggerated ridiculousness is completely out of the scope of previous DC films. It's a shame about the potential, a lot more would have been possible.",Aquaman
1172,MaxGMason,what's going on!,4,24 March 2019,"It started with a good rhythm and an interesting story but there is so much change of scenery has so many different tones and rhythms... sometimes it looks like the treasure hunt others a romcom then Jurassic park and a little horror like Pitch Black... like what? how? I do not like this combination of so many tones, it gives me a feeling of confusion proving that I can not adapt to the storyline to enjoy it. I think it has the most spectacular and beautiful scenes but they are only because they are aesthetically pleasing? It does not fulfill any function for me.This movie completely disorients me half of the time I did not know what was happening, I find ridiculous both the humor and the combenience of the story, the same resource is used to interrupt scenes is so abused that you expect it... I have the tones so separate in my head that I feel like I've watched different movies with the same characters.",Aquaman

1174,Harbsa,Blew me out of the water!! (No spoilers.),10,28 January 2019,"I was not expecting this movie to be a patch on the what it delivered.It literally has everything. And is VERY close to the comic book, and animated canon. (apart from Aquaman's hair.) Which like Sam Jackson Nick Fury, and Supes not have red underpants on his costume, is actually much better than the source material.Apart from that pretty much everything is on there, from Mera being able to control water, to-- to-- to-- So many things fans will so.. ""Oh thats awesome!"" ... (I dont want to give stuff away.)
Its ridiculously action packed, with insane CGI effects, funny, tender, and just goes from strength to strength.
IMO its one of THE BEST super hero movies by any studio so far.I'm not even a big fan of Kidman or Heard, and even I have to admit they were both superb in their roles.There are also hardly any expletives, either religious, or cussing. And its not gory, even though it has many... many fight scenes.Superbly directed, with incredible set pieces, costumes score, etc.Utterly brilliant.
Highly recommended to young and old.",Aquaman

1180,paulblawrence,Everyone calm down. Its not that great.,6,11 December 2018,"Saying that this movie is the best DC movie is rediculous since The Justice League, and Batman vs Sup are terrible. And clearly theyre not counting Nolan's movies, which put this one to shame as well. That being said, Aquaman has Ang Lee, a compliment director, as well as a few good actors(just a few), and plenty of action to keep the viewers from dozing off.This movie's biggest flaw is its completely unoriginal. Its in-your-face-obvious that the writers all got together and took their ideas from Thor, Black Panther, Iron Man(specifically pt 2), Indiana Jones, Star Wars and Tron: Legacy. Its all on the screen and so many times I found myself saying, ""That's right out of...""The visuals are definitely good, and the action was fun...sometimes. I love action, but these felt forced.This movie's second biggest flaw are the villains. And DC clearly tried really, really hard to make these villains good. Sorry, you failed. Again. The main villain is the hero's half brother who wants the thrown. (Sound familiar?). And though he's played by Patrick Wilson, and well, his story is just too cliche'd. In other words, we've seen it before. The second villain, was downright terrible! With an awful story line, an awful costume(which is supposed to be an upgrade), and such a stupid name. ""You can call me, Black Manta!"". WHAT??! Everyone in the room groan at that line. At least Black Panther looked like a black panther, and was badass! This guy looks like a cross between a black-metallic Iron Man(again, ripoff) and Robbie the Robot. Its a waste of time, and he gives that line just moments before he dies.The fights between Aquaman and the main villain...who's name I never caught, were fun, but again, I've seen it before. The story was very predictable, there was no suspense, and the near-ending's twist was not a surprise at all.Oh and the cherry on the sunday of lame is the NEVER ENDING preaching of how mankind is killing the oceans, and the environment. Leave politics at home, dammit.Overall, its definitely much better than the last few DC movies we've seen. But its still a DC film, and that says a lot about the films quality. The money is definitely spent on screen, and it looks great, but I don't see what all the hype is about, looking at some of these reviews.This movie is not bad, but its nothing compared to Avengers: End Games's trailer. Just the trailer of that is better than this!",Aquaman

Dolph Lundgren, who I often find to be a weak link in a cast, was outstanding in his role as King Nereus.The plot was a bit predictable but not so much that it hurt the movie overall. Lots of action scenes which were well done. And plenty of humor throughout. The CGI effects were well done, but a bit too much of a ""neon"" effect in places. Atlantis was lit up like Las Vegas.Whatever shortcomings the plot had, the ending made up for it.

1191,aweynand96,Progress in the right direction - as long as you're hoping for fun and grandeur,7,4 January 2019,"They've finally done it: DC has embraced the cheese and abandoned their attempts to make superhero movies with both the dark, serious atmosphere of the Dark Knight trilogy and the light comedy of Marvel movies. It didn't work with Batman vs. Superman and it certainly didn't work with Suicide Squad, but they came much closer with Wonder Woman.What we have here is a movie which doesn't try to be grounded and gloomy like before, yet doesn't aim to be clever. Aquaman is proud of its corniness, with all the lame jokes, unexplained phenomena (do none of the underwater folks need gills?), and impressively epic deep sea battles. This last part is where the film soars. I have seen few movies with such a beautiful and grand scale of action that works in spite of its flaws. There are hordes of creative ocean monsters, ancient and colossal predators, Lovecraftian horrors, and jaw-dropping sceneries which make the boring, gray-scale landscape of Justice League almost forgivable.By no means is this a perfect movie. You can expect the usual plot holes and details that don't make much sense. There is little emotional connection due to pacing during dialogue that at times feels choppy and second-handed. The characters are fun and refreshing, but mostly predictable and, except for a couple, one-dimensional. The performances are good but nobody in the cast will be expecting nominations during awards season. I would point to both Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson as having the most interesting chemistry simply because of their obviously clashing personalities. Nicole Kidman had some bright scenes with real life in them. Willem Dafoe seemed suppressed in his role. In general, most of the other characters were just ""okay"". One of the main villains (Manta), in all his high-tech glory, is afforded a brief half-assed origin story to make him more relatable.But in spite of this, Aquaman seeks to be FUN, and it does a much better job than any of DCEU's previous endeavors. The change in scenery is even more perplexing than the first half of Wonderwoman. There are so many intricately-designed creatures and characters that I'm shocked the film's budget wasn't significantly higher. Also importantly, Jason Momoa plays a hero who just doesn't really care about behaving like one, which works - at least until a certain very specific turning point in the film. After the first half-hour or so, we are shown scene after scene of gorgeous visuals and battles to rival the most ambitious Marvel projects. It is a comic book movie, after all.There are some not-so-subtle critiques on mankind's treatment of the environment, and though it's a good message, it doesn't strive to go much deeper than ""humans bad, but not all bad"". Don't see Aquaman to have your life changed, but if you want an ultra-fun time at the movies with some significant progress in setting, buy yourself a ticket.6.5/10",Aquaman

He's the best selling point I can make for this.The cast in general is solid, albeit with some odd choices, most noticeably with Patrick Wilson playing Mamoa's younger brother. Wilson is a good actor but maybe mid-cast in his role.The biggest problem with this movie is that it's 30 minutes too long and the CGI is overwhelming. Completely overwhelming. The CGI is used in lieu of plot, writing, directing and emotion. Whatever movie was in the screenplay it's completely buried by director James Wan with CGI.Less is more with CGI.

The most beautiful cgi that I have ever seen in a movie. I mean everything looks real.When you compare Zack footage of Arthur, Mera and Vulko, you will notice that it is cheap compared to the great costumes James has given us (Sorry Zack, I love you.. but your Mera looked ridiculous).The characters are strong in this one, not a single character was bad. The actors did an amazing job especially Jason Momoa, Amber Heard and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.A lazy director would cut some of the fight scenes but James is not lazy. Almoat every few minutes there is an epic scene. He also added some of the elements he used in his previous movies. The Horror element and the use of song made me feel that I am watching Fast and Furious.The score is wonderful, especially Black Manta's theme and the Kingdom of Atlantis theme...I don't usually say this, but Aquaman is the best comic book movie in 2018 and it is better than Avengers: Infinity War.",Aquaman

Nothing else works.",4,31 December 2018,"By now, I think everyone knows DC can't make a decent superhero movie without Chris Nolan or a woman in charge. It is the Batman trilogy, Wonder Woman, and then we have to travel back in time decades to Tim Burton's Batman films and Richard Donner's Superman.What is the difference between DC and Marvel? How come there is such a gap in their movies as far as writing? The SFX make Aquaman a tolerable film to watch, and that is basically it. Jason Momoa has charisma, but the dialogue is so expositional, so on the nose, so boring and irritating, for every character.And where is the character development? Jason Momoa's Arthur/Aquaman has an arc, but everyone else is one-dimensional. In Wonder Woman, we saw what could be added to the story when the supporting cast have backstories: the Arab with Hollywood dreams but he is the wrong color, the Native American who has had everything stolen from him by people who look like the leads, the PTSD sniper who can't shoot anymore.A saving grace for this film, I think, would have been a little more focus on the pollution affecting ocean life, the damage to the environment. What is wrong with raising the IQ level of a blockbuster film, so it isn't just popcorn entertainment?Yet Aquaman is almost all visual effects (and I guess it has to be since it mostly happens in a fictional underwater world). There is barely a coherent story: a special trident, the surface world is evil, war must be waged. The mythology doesn't work for me, and once again the dialogue is painful.",Aquaman

Yes it's great going to my weekly CINEMA FIX and coming out feeling happy and fulfilled, many times of which are rare these days, especially with the well over 50 Flicks I see YEARLY in CINEWORLD. From the very beginning till the end I was glued to those OUT OF THIS WORLD FX. I said to my pal Tam "" How the hell do they do it "", well actually I kinda know the effects are created using back engineering from the crashed UFO in ROSSWELL in 1947. ONLY KIDDIN, a great hand to all envolved in creating those mind blowing FX.
At many times throughout the film ,I was reminded of many moments from and including great films I grew up watching, namely that romantic boxing from IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT 1934 with Claudette Colbert & Clark Gable, Sean Connery's wittly comedic one liners from the 60's BOND movies and all those exciting moments from Indiana Jones.
I like to think of myself as a wannnabee casting agent and after seeing the brilliant inventive SAW 2004 I knew there and then we had a maestro of a movie maker by the name of JAMES WAN on our hands. More from this Terrific Director please. I loved everything about this movie, the wonderful narrative, powerhouse acting, FX, and so on. It was also nice seeing the New Zealand actor Temura Morrison who you may or not remember gave a powerhouse performance in ONCE WERE WARRIORS 1994. Patrick Wilson who was in the unsettling Superb movie LITTLE CHILDREN 2006 and HARD CANDY 2005, more than most plays the charismatic good guy, so it's interesting seeing playing the Not So Bad Guy.

Some scenes even goes beyond that meanwhile others tips it's toes on being too much CGI/green screen heavy. But for a movie like this it doesn't matter as it's ment to be a bit over the top and fun.
The cast did an amazing job and was really well put together. I didn't know before the movie that stars like Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson, Williem Dafoe, Temuera Morrison and Dolph Lundgren was in it. So i was amazed just by that. And to see Dolph Lundgren in a movie like this again was great. Jason Momoa as Aquaman really works. Played by anyone else i think it would have just felt silly. This movie is action packed and fun in the same time. This time around DC really made a great movie that i think the whole family really enjoyed.",Aquaman
1211,robert-b-norby,Pretty decent. Just a little tacky.,7,7 January 2019,"Aquaman has more going for it than most of the latest contributions from DC.I'd say Wonder Woman has a clear upper hand on Aquaman, and I do not for the life of me understand anyone saying otherwise. But Aquaman is a well litt hope for the DC universe, and I definately want to see more of him! The good:Arthus/Aquaman is a cool guy. Straight out, and hands down. His character also has a great backstory, and great development in this movie. In my opinion. And I must say that DC did him justice (no pun intended) by the way they presented this backstory. I believe Batman Vs Superman went a little too deep, and too far back with a lot of backstory/buildup - but Aquaman did it just right for me. Deep, emotional, thorough, but not wasting anyone's time. Just the important stuff that hits you in the heart.Then there is action, cinematography, CGI, colors and all of the above - and the movie is pure eye candy. Maybe not the coolest fighting scenes, but definitely cool fighting scenes. Some original camera handling/rotations made for a nice little twist to certain close combat scenes. When it is not close combat, it's underwater Star Wars. I... think I can dig that.The bad:
I'm sure this is all very true to the original material and all, but I'm not all that into having 2 bad guys in one movie. Not like this anyhow. One of them was great, the other was not (hint: it's Black Manta). A massive cliche if you ask me, and (and watch this get down voted by the comic book nerds! :O). For the record, I do recognize that he did play a significant role in the plot development. But I still didn't like him - so there!
To me, Black Manta got the same effect on this movie as Team Rockets gets in every pokemon episode (if you get that reference).Furthermore, while the plot is good ""per se"", it is utterly without plot TWISTS, so you will probably never go ""Whaaaaaat?!"" anytime during this movie. You'll predict most of the movie plot development and ending by the time 20 minutes have passed, and you'll most likely be correct in all your major predictions. But this stuff is totally possible to roll along with and enjoy despite of, and most movies these days are just like this. So, I'm not pulling too many points because of it.If there is one more tiny setback I feel the need to mention mention, is that I find some of the humor misplaced. The movie has good humor, and strong emotional scenes, both frequent, and well done. Separately. But sometimes the movie just missed my emotional state - which itself is responsible for putting me in. I'm brought half way to tears, then served a joke that feels inappropriate. And visa versa. It's not like this the whole movie, but enough times to for me to make note of it.All in all: 7 / 10 is GOOD. It's Aquaman, he's cool, and its all pretty. Many good actors btw - I forgot the mention that. It's worth the watch, but no minds will be blown out of the park.",Aquaman

Jason Momoa in Aquaman did not do justice to the character in JL. A light hearted character was destroyed. Visuals were amazing. 3D element was on pars. Dialogues did miss the element of surprise and turned out to be too predictable. William Dafoe's return to superhero genre was well potrayed.

1219,jc-29071,Justice League 2 tie in has made a big splash and is riding high,8,31 January 2019,"The king of the 7 seas proved his point, however I would have loved to see one or two members of the Justice League at the end of the film most notably the Green Lantern whom I know has to be in Justice League 2 since he is a founding member. I want to say that one of the best parts of the film besides Jason who is just the best Aquaman there has ever been, in fact he's even better than the rest of the Justice League members! You guys may have to recast the rest of the team and just start over, begin with a real well don Green Lantern and the whole green lantern corps and color ring wars which is just a mind blowing storyline and the parallax story line as part of the trilogy must not be left out, and we want the real Hal Jordan as green lantern, this time none of that riding in a rollercoaster as in the last movie, which I liked, but there are better and more visually striking ways to use his powers like powerful green cyber armors, giant robot suits, powerful blast and feats of superhuman strength with the green energy etc. Ultimately Green Lantern must join the group and have his movie, just put it in the right director's hands and it will go well. Back to Aquaman I love the whole ocean philosophy and raising awareness about very real issues this is very important and should remain a theme for the next two films. I love the oceanography and many of the CGI were great especially some of the encounters he has, they are really great, except for the octopus scene, you know the one come on stop that. Aquaman's suit , the chainmail should be smaller, it looks plastic as it is and plastic. Also the scene at the end of the film the CGI looks fake, I hope the CGI will look much better in the other films. Merma was great and must remain throughout the film, Nicole Kidman was also great and likewise must remain, in fact all the cast members did a wonderful job. I would love to see the costumes look better, more convincing and the strange races are fantastic and should be looked into more in the coming films, as should the monsters and all the strange history, artifacts and the action scenes all add to the intrigue keep it coming you had everyone eating out of your hands that's why this film grossed so much and is on the top 25 of all time grossing films . Final word when they face Darkseid it should all lead up to it after we get to know everyone and seen their movies and there should be cameos from group members to show cohesion and the CGI has to be top notch.",Aquaman
1220,briangeorgi,Disappointing,5,29 December 2018,"The DC movies have, in my opinion, gotten a consistently bad rap from the critics. I thought Man of Steel, Dawn of Justice, and The Justice League were all better films than was reflected in the ratings and I enjoyed each of them. So the ""55"" metacritic rating wasn't going to deter me when it came to Aquaman. I was prepared to like it. I wanted to like it... I didn't like it.It seemed not to know if was dark (Batman v. Superman) or light (Justice League) and it was pretty clear after the first 30 minutes that it wasn't going to be aspiring to Wonder Woman-level heights (overrated though that movie was). I've seen every featured actor be solid-to-excellent in other things but the performances were stilted in almost every case. Momoa, in particular, had some painfully awkward dialogue with Amber Heard. It seemed as if they were trying - hard - to force a Hemsworth/Portman-like chemistry that just wasn't there. And above all, it was silly. The theater I was in heard at least a dozen people, myself included, laughing aloud at moments that weren't supposed to be funny.My 11-year old liked it. To that end, it's perfectly fine. But Marvel and DC have happily raised expectations over the last decade and Aquaman just doesn't make the grade.",Aquaman

Not only is a mythological sword released in Aquaman but a variety of ""Crackins,"" aka Liam Neesom style. The movie could have buckled under the weight of trying to be all things to all fictions, but instead, was all the better for it. Add to that, a decent storyline, solid acting, incredible special effects, and a few important messages from the ecology.See Aquaman but see it on the big screen.",Aquaman
1224,dmbelafan,Empty eye candy,7,23 January 2019,"First things first - this movie is gorgeous. Aside from a few fleeting (and forgivable) moments, the visuals in this movie are lovely. Objects feel like they have the scale and ""weight"" that they should, which can be difficult to get right from a CGI perspective. I found the movie's humor hit-or-miss, but mostly enjoyable. Some lines felt forced, but Mera's first ventures onto land included numerous clever moments.Dialogue was sadly predictable, but generally delivered well. Amber Heard's performance was at times engaging, and at times distracting. She didn't seem particularly well suited for moments of powerful monologue.As other reviewers have noted, character development was rushed, but they certainly made an effort to add a bit of depth to at least a couple characters. I wanted to like Black Manta, but came out disappointed. Maybe they'll do something more clever with him in the future.Numerous plot elements just sort of happened for no real reason, other than to tie up the loose end of a joke left hanging from a setup ten minutes prior (Pinocchio, for example). The ""National Treasure"" sequence on the quest for Atlan's trident seemed out of place within the scope of the rest of the movie.Overall, this is a great popcorn movie. It'll end up in my collection, no doubt, but likely won't merit another viewing until its sequel is released.",Aquaman

Jason Mamoa is the embodiment of the best spin on this character and entertaining in every scene. Unnecessary to be familiar with DC Universe or to have picked up a comicbook to be (pun intended) ""immersed"" in the story. But director James Wan takes many comic tropes and turns them on end.

Overall the script and the storyline were so cliched that it was cringeworthy at times. Every plot twist was predictable and obvious from the outset which made the film boring.The lack of character development meant I wasn't invested and didn't care how things turned out - I was just waiting for it to end for the last 45 minutes of the movie. The main villains - Black Manta and Orm were one-dimensional cliches and lacked any depth or personality.The CGI was overused and at times the fight scenes got a bit silly - a few fish swimming through and destroying metal craft . . . erm, sure, that's totally believable. Ditto a man gets trapped under rubble (which would have crushed his legs) but when it's moved he gets up and walks away.Jason Momoa was the best thing about this film - he played his role well, but didn't have much to work with, script/plot wise.",Aquaman
1234,Doeh,It's decent,6,16 December 2018,"Aquaman is directed by James Wan and is the 6th movie in the controversial DCEU.Let's start with the positives. The acting all around is excellent. Jason Momoa is an excellent Aquaman, and the action scenes are some of the best I've seen from a comic book movie in a long time. Another good thing going for this movie is that it's very self-contained. It's no Batman v. Superman or Suicide Squad. It doesn't try to set up 2-3 spinoff movies, which DC movies are sometimes known for. The villains weren't half bad. You could understand them, and they weren't evil for the sake of being evil. Finally, James Wan creates a fantastic world, which for me was
breathtaking at times.But that doesn't mean there aren't negatives. The movie is clocking around 2 hours and 23 minutes, and you can feel it. There were so many scenes that were unnecessary, and so many of the jokes just fell flat and didn't land with me or the audience that I was with. Besides the action scenes, everything was lackluster. The Arthur and Mera relationship was cringy at times, but that's not something that's going to ruin the movie for you. Aquaman is also very predictable; which takes the fun and suspense out during certain moments of the film.A film with great acting, excellent fights, and a fantastic setting are ultimately brought down by its dragged on runtime, bad jokes, and uneventful/unnecessary scenes.Aquaman gets a 6/10.",Aquaman

1240,bl-11,So they told James Wan it was a comic. He hears 'comical',5,15 December 2018,"First, everything that is OK about this film happened underwater...The CGI seemed pretty good, nice style. Good world-building. Most of the acting was decent enough (better from the more seasoned actors). Comedic moments sit a little awkwardly and were pretty flat for me, but are probably not too bad. The story was pretty simple, but that's fine, especially when executed by decent acting.The rest though.. everything out of the water.. it's like someone completely different was in charge. And it's not good.There's a long scene that looks like it came out of the old Power Rangers TV show, with the same cheap look, and a clunky villain who had suddenly become a technological genius... just pathetic.The soundtrack was mostly unnoticeable which I find is usually good, except for horrible double use of the 'signature' refrain during the first appearance, but much worse, two crude scene transitions into overbearing songs, one of which starts a laughable scene that looks like the start of a Disney fairytale musical number.The CGI is bad, including a scene on a boat that looks like they borrowed a backdrop from a film from the 1950s, along with a camera stuck on maximum zoom for some reason.There are other bits too; when Mera makes a 'speech', all moving about for no reason but to clash with the tone of the moment, or the wildly variable displays of Aquaman's strength, or one underwater bit that was so silly, ill-fitting and cheesy that our audience laughed out loud *at* it.Overall the good bits are pretty decent, but good grief, I just don't get it, you're watching then the next scene and you're wondering if they swapped the reels to another film.This is not good film-making.",Aquaman
1241,MaxwellFury,"Good actor, bad movie.",2,23 September 2019,"Having Jason and people riding sharks have been a good addition. The CGI is beautiful, but the plot is boring. This movie is also disconnected from the DC verse. The choice of actor and amazing CGI don't make up for the poor story. Turns out the mother survived the thousands of trench fishes for like 20 years I think. Supposed to be a plot twist, yet ends up nothing special. The main characters romance? Easy to see. There's also zero logic in land people being able to walk and talk underwater like they do. They're basically humans in fake fish suits.",Aquaman

I have to say, this movie is amazing in terms of its CGI, and how the inside of Atlantis looked. All of the fight scenes were also pretty good, no shaky camera, though it was a bit jittery. The music score during these action sequences was phenomenal, sounds like your typical hero music with some added twists. Although what this film makes in CGI and action, lacks in writing and common sense.Many unnecessary scenes like where Mera kisses Aquaman, which somehow doesn't get interrupted by the enemy's shooting them is just terrible. This movie is not special, contains many clichés from other movies. How King Orm talked to Manta by somehow casting a hologram in water is just dumb, and could have been done better. The scene where Manta upgrades his suit is also unneeded, I felt as though he wasn't too serious and motivated to kill Aquaman, told by the inexperience (or of the many things gone wrong that may just be an attempt at humor)Casting was OK, nothing too special. Isn't worth watching.",Aquaman

1247,saraswat-dhoom2,Best of DC Comics till date .,8,16 December 2018,AQUAMAN :Aquaman is the best of the DC movies after Christopher Nolan has left us with amazing The Dark Knight series. DC has always tried to copy Marvel and this fight will always continue between DC & Marvel fans that who is the best among two. Talking about this movie it is a visual treat to the audiences in 3D (specially recommended) as one starts feeling itself to be a part of sea.For those who has done scuba diving and for those who hasn't its a must watch in 3D .Talking about the story Atlanna( Nicole Kidman) is from Atlantis an empire under the sea gets married to a man on earth & gives birth to Arthur( Jason Momoa) whose becomes Aquaman and is destined to be the Ocean Master. Now army from Atlantis empire comes to arrest Atlanna as she has gone against rules of sea world. Later on the story is about ending the war between sea world & earth by Aquaman by acquiring Trident of Atlan which was owned by the first king of Atlantis and now who will acquire this will be the master of ocean. Movie proceeds with run and chase on earth and sea and then war of sea world empires .The movie gives us a visual treat which we will love to watch on big screen . It is a must watch for evry Super hero lover. But one thing is definitely there that every Marvel fan will compare it with marvel movies as the fight between brothers for kingdom with a lot of audience around may be compared between fight shown in Black Panther. The search for Atlan in various empires and the sea world with gadgets may be compared to Guardians of Galaxy and a lot more.

1251,ianb330-112-344579,Saved by the sfx.......,4,4 February 2019,"As the title of my review suggests, Aquaman is saved from being a 2 star film by the effects, which while sometimes being a bit OTT, are the best I've seen in a DC movie - not in the same league as Marvel of course, but a step on from previous DC offerings. The real problems lie with the hackneyed story (hero returns to his people, overthrows evil brother, takes his rightful place on the throne, blah, blah, blah), and the daytime-soap acting - yes, Amber Heard, I'm looking at you. (A tip for you Ms Heard, don't ever share a screen with Nicole Kidman again - you've done it once now and it did you no favours). Against these two deal-breakers the mediocre script and odd soundtrack somehow fade into insignificance, leaving the viewer feeling decidedly 'meh', which is arguably the cruellest indictment of all.Despite my opinion though, I'm sure a sequel will appear, and having seen the post-credits scene I'm pretty certain what the storyline will be - I just won't be watching it.",Aquaman

Flashbacks are thrown in seemingly at random and practically give you whiplash. Character motivations are never quite explained. The movie plays out like a bunch of different cut-scenes from an Aquaman video game played out in random order. The cheese level at some points surpasses Power Rangers (the TV show!) levels and the dialogue drops down to the level of the bad guys yelling ""RRAARRR!!"".While still entertaining, there are some awesome scenes, it definitely drops down a cog from the Aquaman we were introduced to in Justice League and left me disappointed. Whoever was responsible for Wonder Woman should have got final cut on this movie.",Aquaman

1260,trismale,Absolute nonsense.,2,30 September 2019,"Headline says it all. The flick tried too hard with the result being a complete mess. It deviated from a tried and tested formula and simply lost its identity. The humour was sporadic at best and only worth a chuckle. The biggest disappointment was the waste of talent available. Dafoe, Lundgren and Heard are capable of much more and the lead bloke from GoT days actually appeared very capable also. But the script and screenplay for this flick stunk to high heaven.",Aquaman

It is beautiful from the scene, song, story, pace and the imagination, the performance - everything.

So it fulfilled expectations.",Aquaman
1263,davebartle,I thought I would like this.,1,17 April 2019,"I thought Jason Momoa was extremely bad casting, but then I saw the preview and it looked amazing. So I went in with high hopes. Unfortunately I was right. Momoa doesn't look the part and doesn't have the acting ability to sell himself despite this. He is stiff and awkward.
But it is not just Momoa. Nicole Kidman, who has previously turned in decent performances, makes no effort, even stumbling over her words at times.
Tamuera Morrison does okay, but the horrible makeup and CG on him makes his parts difficult to watch.
But the director has to be the worst offender... what the hell is with the CSI styles stings? and the cringeworthy hair flip as Momoa walks through steam?
The one star is because I couldn't motivate myself to finish watching the movie.",Aquaman
1264,amerikasend,Geez,3,10 May 2019,"I don't see why people say this is good. I can see it as being considered good compared to something like Justice League or Batman v Superman, but that's a pretty low bar to set for a movie.The cgi and backgrounds when they're on land look horrendous. It's like they ran out of money from the giant water battles that didn't serve a purpose, so they couldn't be bothered to maybe film some of the land scenes, I don't know, on a location next to an ocean. This movie is an hour too long. The giant water battles don't serve a purpose other than giant water battles look spiffy.The scenes with Black Manta should've been cut and saved for another movie. He doesn't add anything and promptly loses to Aquaman in a fight. They could've at least made the Aquaman & Black Manta fight take place underwater instead of land. One of the main purposes of his suit is so he can dive to deep distances that he'd otherwise not be able to do.The acting in this movie is wooden. The woman that played Mera can't really act. Jason Momoa seemed like he was just playing a frat boy. Ocean Master was impossible for me to take seriously. He reminds me of Bibleman.The movie references Justice League and Steppenwolf in the beginning. I was hoping they've not done that and just pretended Justice League never existed. Since they did mention it, what was Atlantis up to during those events?The rest of the movie was just blah and cgi overload. I've always found Aquaman to be a ridiculous character",Aquaman

Aquamans trailer gave me hope. This is a very good thought out movie but the execution was horrendous. No chemistry whatsoever between the leads. Granted great cast, but thats all that this movie has.And to think, such a cast was subjected to this . I just dont get where it went wrong. They all just seemed like it was their 1st gig.

It seemed there was too much happening at once, and after seeing the movie, that's exactly the case.The main storyline is clear and easy to understand. It promises a good movie for sure. But the main storyline gets clouded with unnecessary side-plots, which aren't thought out very well. This wouldn't have been a problem, hadn't there been as man plot-holes.
I get that DCEU wanted to make it about pollution of the Earth's oceans, but it felt forced. The wannabe Ocean-master just seems like he wants to rule.The movie was very one-dimensional. The dialogue is the worst I've ever heard in a fiction-flick. Too much CGI. The soundtrack was beautiful though, sometimes a bit misplaced maybe.Momoa's performance was great, he is very well suited for this role. The cinematography was breathtakingly beautiful as well, true eye-candy.It isn't a superb movie, but it's a lot better than Justice League, and it's certainly a step into the right direction for the DCEU.

The worst dialogue, every movie trope evar, feeble acting and massive plot holes.Yeah yeah, the visuals are amazing but the story requires a bigger suspension of disbelief than we should be asked to provide. Everyone wears bulky, metal armor - underwater. Atlantis is near enough the surface to get sunlight AND emits crazy tons of self-generated light & energy but human scientists haven't found them and every big-to-little thing the movie doesn't want to explain is chalked up to being caused by the Atlanteans' secret also-not-explained proprietary energy source... but seriously, most of all, it's the lines. ""You are the bridge between land and sea! I can see that now."" GAH.I haven't read the comic books but I trust those guys wrote a more plausible story, right?Still Jason Momoa grunts, leers, smirks and fights his way through scenes to seem realistic as a superhero and he has some unpolished qualities that work in his favor, even on the bad dialogue. He's obviously been practicing since GOT.I submit that his level of hotness and his hard work deserve better. For the love of all that is good in the universe, someone please write him a better movie.
Momoa hotness gets 15 stars from me; I deduct 12 for how crap the movie is overall.*Also, Julie Andrews can be the voice of the Kraken because she was already Mary Poppins AND Fraulein Maria. Djimon Hounsou & Willem Dafoe should know better. And Roy Orbison must be turning in his grave.",Aquaman

It presents the depth of Kingdom of Atlantis in a very fascinating way.The direction and screenplay is what makes this movie exceptionally decent. The performances are fine, Momoa playing Arthur seems active and heavy, Amber playing Princess Mera is beautiful as well as bad-ass and supporting cast is satisfactory, despite having cast including Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman etc.Overall its a Visual Effects treat and Superhero Action Adventure equally toppled.It deserves 7.5/10",Aquaman

The characters are very well writen, they all go through complex story archs and are not the same by the time the movie ends. The actors are all great - even Amber Heard, who is not the best actor in the world (far from it) comes off as a believable and likable character (and she looks stunning in that outfit!) -, specially Jason Momoa who absolutely rocks as Aquaman. I mean, the man was born to play this role, it's that simple. The visuals are amazing, the CGI is virtualy flawless, the action scenes are relentless and perfectly staged, the humor is perfectly timed to release the stress from the action scenes without feeling forced. What more can I say? It's the best film in the DCEU, pure and simple, followed very, very closely by Wonder Woman, and it rivals anything Marvel has ever made. Let's hope WB/DC have learned their lesson and hire James Wan to reboot Superman - now that would be awsome!",Aquaman

They went against everything the real Avengers stood for in the last few movies. The visual effects in this are amazing. Villains were very weak. They tried too hard with Black Manta. Orn was played well but just didnt peak my interest. Bad music choices. Still thought the action was good which is why I watched it.

After reading some reviews, I really did expect a mediocre movie and kind of delayed watching it. I don't go to the theater a lot, so I opted for Bumblebee instead of this just because of the negative reviews for Aquaman.I'm not going to go into detail about the movie, but just want to put my opinion out there that this movie is exceptional. It's hard to do an underwater world that doesn't look cheesy, so I think the filmmakers have done the best I've seen so far with the underwater scenes. The storyline is somewhat linear, as all the movies based on comic books are that I have seen. I was entertained the entire movie, thought the battle scenes were very well done, and found the characters interesting.The development of the love story between Mera and Aquaman is simple and predictable, but it's based on a comic book, what do you expect? I thought Black Manta's role in the movie was excellent, and found him more interesting than King Orm.I don't know if the low ratings are a DC or Marvel thing, but I think they are unfounded.",Aquaman

Sure there were a few scenes that were a little cheesy but that didn't bother me compared to the action of the movie, Jason's acting & visual effects as I mentioned. Amber Heard's character was a good match to Aquaman & thought Patrick Wilson pulled off being the villain! I couldn't think of another actor who could have played Aquaman any better than Jason Momoa! He definitely pulls off the fight scenes & shows the right amount of emotion during his talking parts. Of course he has the perfect body to wear those tight suits! The visual effects created beautiful colors of the sea life & makeup people did great job doing their thing on the actors who weren't human. Overall DC is back & I cant wait to see an Aquaman sequel!

Not as great as Wonder Woman and has its flaws, but that doesn't stop this movie from being a great action-packed adventure-entertainer that shouldn't be missed.
--------------------------------------------
I put off watching this movie because I have already watched Aquaman's (AQ) origin story, perhaps more than once, through DC's animated series/movies. I am glad I tried this one anyway since this movie breathes fresh air into the characters and story, and kept me captivated throughout even if it wasn't entirely perfect.The movie was generally quite well paced with the very first action scene getting me hooked into the story while also showcasing the power and glory of Atlantis. I liked Momoa's portrayal of AQ which is quite impressive and liked that the humour aspect wasn't overused unlike in some Marvel movies. I liked that Mera gets to play an important role and was with Aquaman every step of the way. I was worried if Amber Heard could handle such as important character, but she did.I also like how Atlantis was crafted so beautifully for this movie, the special effects, the fight scenes, the sheer scope of everything etc. Orm didn't get to do much this movie, but I like that there are hints of more character depth to him. I wouldn't mind seeing more of him and his motivations - how losing his mother, feeling she betrayed him and then losing both his fiance and kingdom to the firstborn she seems to prefer etc drives him.What I didn't like was Manta Ray. His scenes just didn't work, because the actor couldn't act to save his life. He came across as childish and petulant and like a joke. Hope he gets recast. The arc of AQ where he grows to regret not saving his father also fell flat - everything seemed too random. I also didn't like that a lot of the plot felt like a video-game, complete with quests for the hero - even a lot of the dialogue sounded too direct, simplistic and hollow.Overall, this is a great action-packed and fun adventure entertainer that has to be watched despite its flaws.",Aquaman

So Manta and dear old dad are pirates. Murdering pirates. Yes, murderers. Aquaman saves what remains of the submariene's crew, but does not save Manta's dad from being stuck under heavy wreckage and imminent drowning. Manta then grunts under breath ""Aquaman, bad, must die""! And now, Aquaman is supposed to be someone we think of as a villain for this character and we are supposed to care he wants ""revenge"" for the death of his, PIRATE, MURDERING dad, who tried MANY times to kill Aquaman!!
Sorry Manta, you are not a sympathetic character. Neither was your dad. What your dad got was karma. To quote Jim Carey from ""Liar, Liar"". Stop breaking the law (can't use expletives on IMDB)!. Then dear old dad would not have died.

1300,healingtoolbox,this puts James Wan in the same league as JJ Abrams.,9,3 January 2019,"I think this puts James Wan in the same league as JJ Abrams. Audience I saw it with clapped at the end. I tell you: We have not seen such a creative fantasy script and VFX since the last JJ film.While James and JJ both lack the strong moral compass of Spielberg, excepting this, Aquaman is as creative a fantasy script and VFX as you could hope for. I come from seeing close to every fantasy movie and superhero movie made. I first liked James Wan on the X-Files and have followed his horror films from a distance. James brings a great deal together here. He's working with well-worn tropes but manages again and again to make them seem fresh.Thor: Ragnarok is the appropriate comparison here, another crowd please, another comic book come to life successfully. Aquaman has more weight and depth than Thor:R due to its hero's journey arc.I see critics criticizing Aquaman for clashes of tone. When multiple critics say this and I do not, I always wonder how many were simply looking between the screen and checking their emails on their smart phone. I went to art school and have written 44 books where shadings of tone visually and verbally are crucial. Aquaman is a masterful blending of goofy and serious moods. Even an octopus playing multiple drums fits in.A lesser presence in one or more of the main roles could have sunk this effort. The plot point shuffling of trident fight one ending inconclusively leading to a whole middle section hero's journey to get to the second and final trident fight, is amazing effective to keep the narrative afloat. The drone rooftop chase footage is used to great effect. In a behind the scenes YouTube, James says at a superhero movie the audience should feel like they are learning something from the characters; and, that they inspire us to see our own capacity to do good in our own lives. Aquaman does 9/10 on both of these.",Aquaman

The only thing that can be priased about the movie is its special effects, and if someone is to get a prize it is the geeks who worked day and night to create a video game visuals which is like 85% of the content of the movie. Otherwise, excellently played by Jason Momoa although I feel like he is wasting his talent playing in cheese ""kickass"" cliche roles.",Aquaman

1310,aleksandersochan,Strong visual. Weak dialogue/acting.,6,6 January 2019,"Visually this movie was pretty great. They crafted a very unique and cool world and met my expectations for this, which was the original reason I wanted to see this movie in theaters. Sadly though, the dialogue was very painfully corny and unnatural feeling much of the time; and the acting of some of the main characters doesn't help. I loved Jason Momoa in Game of Thrones, but for some reason he did not appear to be able to naturally perform this role. I will say to be fair that the dialogue he was served to read gave him a massive disadvantage. What he does have going for him is he definitely looks the part, perhaps better than anyone else I can think, I just wish the performance felt more genuine.Another pro for this movie would be that the action scenes were pretty strong. Still I found that the corniness of the dialogue overshadowed this in my mind because it was painfully hard if not impossible to ignore at times.If you're going to see this movie, go in for cool costumes, sea animals, fantastical kingdoms, superhero action fights, and neat visuals. Leave your expectations for good dialogue and non-cringy character interactions behind.",Aquaman

Others said it had great CGI. So I went in expecting something at least entertaining. I walked in to a packed theater...Side note- there was some old guy next to me making abunch weird noises so that was distracting.Acting- some of the worst I've seen maybe ever. Literally no one is good. Sure the movie is entertaining, but in all the wrong ways. The dialogue is so horrible, I was laughing at it a lot when everybody else was silent. I couldn't contain my laughter. The movie looks like a video game. The cgi is not good. The black manta guy has a generic motivation and is very uninteresting. Also, it just rips off of black panther. They thought if they did the black panther plot with abunch of fillet, they'd get billions of dollars too. But they missed the part that actually made Black Panther popular: the black. Because all the people were African american, it gave the black community someone to root for. It's not the highest grossing movie of the year because of its fantastic script. Aqua man tries to be all that and a bag of chips. It isnt.

Getting a 7.4/10 is simply misleading to people.This film is bad in so many ways. Bad and over used CGI. (Think Star Wars Attack if the Clones levels of bad CGI usage). The story stinks as do the characters who are all high level Hollywood pen pals who look like they have been swimming in botox together. It's ok to have wrinkles Miss Kidman!!!! It try's to be funny when it's not remotely funny at all.Worst of all had to be the bad guy or one of the bad guys. He's on some kind of revenge mission which I actually forgot about until he popped up later in the film. He's really really good at pulling mean faces though.I suggest you watch Finding Nemo if you are that keen on a sea movie.

I rolled my eyes on stupid jokes and this is probably the only downside of this movie. It's like they're there to compete with Marvel...whatever.
For me Nolan's Batmans were the movies made more for adults, this one is more for children although older gen that like comic-books will be pleased.

FYI there is ONE end credit scene before the long end creditsAquaman is the latest movie from DC comics that strays away from being a setup for another movie in the future. It stands together as a solid movie, with heart, stunning visuals and actions sences that are extremely cinematic but it's not without its cheesy moments.Pros: Aquaman, himself, had a good arc and although a little underdeveloped, Mera makes an awesome debut. Same can be said for Black Manta, who is the standout character of the movie, with a good motivation for doing what he does and what he will continue to do.Cons: Ocean Master aka King Orm, the main Villian has some great scenes, and some motivation that does not really blossom into something meaningful.
The movie can get a little cheesy, especially with those close ups.All in all, as I've said it's a solid movie that stands on its own, something that cannot be said for DC's previous endeavours. Along with Wonder Women and Aquaman, DC seems to be heading in the right direction.",Aquaman

You can't beat MCU. 5/10 is most objective rating for this movie, adressing the good and bad things in this movie.
Also, i don't understand this 10/10 reviews, and that is my reason to suspect that those are paid reviews or maybe those who review does not understand how the rating system works.

Aquaman lost a lot of points when, in the middle of a pre-scheduled, public, colosseum-style showdown with the bad guy, the girl encouraged him to abandon the fight, and he accepted and ran away like a wuss?! What?!!!!!A lot of the movie was quantity over quality, cheesy, and poor effects.Jason Momoa obviously is smokin' hot, and exponentially so once he turns into Aquaman and he is a great actor and carried the movie.It is visible that he has difficulty doing love scenes since he is so loyal to his real-life wife which is precious in its own way.",Aquaman

That's because I don't consider it a movie as to do so would be an insult to truly poor movies.The special effects are so poor that this could pass for a cartoon. Plus, I'm all for stretching the laws of physics in science fiction, but human bodies (even if they can breathe underwater) don't fly backward into walls with such force as to break the wall.I felt like I was watching an underwater equivalent of the ""Thor"" trilogy crammed into about 2-1/2 hours. The humor was more than flat - it was dead. Worst of all, this whole film was predictable. I say it a lot that I've seen this story under different titles. That's due to the dearth of imagination in corporate Hollywood.The kiddies will be impressed. Their mommies and daddies will approve of the non-sexual nature of the relationship between the two main characters.It can almost be said that there's too much story to tell and the writers had no idea of how to tell it - a DC movie trademark.Miss this title at all cost.",Aquaman

James Wan directs this beautifully, and brings this world alive..! The casting was perfect, in my opinion everyone involved brought this world alive and truly delivered. This film came after the backlash of the Justice Leagues failure to deliver to a lot of the fans and filmgoers alike which was never going to be an easy task but they did it and did it with style.I was doubting this film walking into the cinema although I personally loved the Man of Steel and Batman Vs Superman but when I watched Aquaman it made me think, this is what the Justice League could've been. The cinematography was stunning and it really does pull you into the world, the CGI used was brilliant and captivating and really does give a feel that this world could be real. Amber Heards best performance to date and the chemistry between her and Jason Mamoa seems natural and not forced but I also loved the connection between Mamoa and Defoe...!If the DCEU follow suit Then i can't see why they can't get back on track with the world that they've been trying to create. In no way was this film rushed, it's pacing was perfect, I really can't pick fault with this film it's exactly what, (as a lifetime comic fan) I wanted.

Anyone know who the grunter in film is? Well he's the perfect example. The star whose built, so you take their shirts off and make grunts. I think the message behind the film should have been more prominent. Keep our oceans clean folks, it's another world in it's self. One last thing, why was Harry Osborne even in this movie? None the less, actually a core actor. The guy has the opportunity to do anything he wants now, from ANTICHRIST to AQUAMAN, making great career choices.

1344,jacman2084,Wonderful.,8,16 December 2018,"Only minor spoilers ahead.I agree that I was sceptical when I heard that James Wan is going to direct Aquaman. The guy who was famous for - Saw, Insidious, Conjuring, Annabelle, Lights Out - all out dark horror movies. I mean, if you take out Furious 7 from the list, the guy is almost completely dealing with horror stuff. The only plus point that I saw there was that all of them were 'dark' and the DC verse is supposedly 'dark'. Things got worse when I saw the trailer and saw some 'altered' old school scuba divers as villains. I mean it did look like Black Manta from the comics but to cast something that dramatic from a comic into a movie usually calls for disaster. And in the trailer there were underwater shots of Atlanta that reminded us of 'Avatar' and a Gigantic crab that reminded me of 'Wrath of the Titans' - So now you see my dilemma before watching the movie - it could be an Avatar or a Wrath in the waiting!But my oh my, this fellow blew my mind completely. Right now I believe this movie can bring back the DC movie verse from close to death.After watching Aquaman (due to early release in India) the one word that is still ringing in my head is - MAGNITUDE.The sheer magnitude of the sets, the stunts and the visuals got my jaw dropped. There were a lot of wow moments and more than once did I think about the 'scale' of the underwater world that he is trying to show to us. For instance, there's one scene where a giant blue whale looking like a fish when it swims past one of those fallen Atlantan statues under the sea. At that moment you will invariably compare the sizes in your mind.I would say James Wan has successfully compiled Avatar, the Titan movies, Pacific Rim, Godzilla, a bit of TinTin, Indiana Jones stuff, a pinch of Harry Potter (LOL) - all into one short fun packed movie. There is fantasy, future tech (in its own way), adventure, creature stuff, scary stuff and breathtaking visuals. And thankfully you won't feel that they have made it all too sweet for a PG-13 rating. It is just the right amount of action.Oh thanks for reading that much - As a DC fan, now you are probably thinking like - I know all that from the trailer but what about the Superhero stuff? What about Aquaman? Did he pull it off?My simple answer is a firm Yes.For a start, this was the one of those films where I waited to see who the casting directors were in the end credit (applauds to Anne McCarthy & Kellie Roy). Personally I felt all the actors were spot on for their roles - Nicole Kidman back in the DC world as Atlanna and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta steals the show in the opening moments, Amber Heard as Mera was convincing, Patrick Wilson as the rogue brother was a decent choice. And for a change you will get to see Willem Defoe (a.k.a Norman Osborne from MCU) and Dolph Lundgren, Drago from Rocky, in different roles (though it's hard to spot Dolph in his new looks).The towering Dothraki, Khal Drogo - Jason Momoa - to top it off. He is literally like a character walking out of a comic book with those chiselled muscles and the looks along with some pretty decent acting skills (he has a few comic one-liners too). He seems to have understood the depth of the character well and we will see him switching from the ignorant meta-human to the King of Atlantis along the way. There's a pretty decent back story (similar to WonderWoman) and a 'Save the World from Pollution' theme to hold on to. So overall the movie has a pretty solid base.There are some minor flaws like too many things going on in the final fight (but certainly not as bad as Man of Steel or BvS, here it is simply because of the same magnitude that I mentioned earlier) and there are some space-game like action sequences (even the BGM at that time seems odd but I think it might have been intentional) - but those are very trivial ones.Overall it is an entertaining DC movie and we feel like we are watching a true comic adaptation.So now you see DC's dilemma now - In the next JL movie - WonderWoman and Aquaman will be running the show unless the Bat and the Man of Steel proves us wrong.I rate it 4 out of 5. Watch it on a big screen to feel the magnitude.
PS: Just one advice to all of you - PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILERS for DC movies. They simply reveal too much every single time.",Aquaman

i went to watch this movie as a neutral fan and honestly i was so disappointed.
first of all the cliched plot line? the whole movie is about aquaman finding the trident and they streched it for 2:30 hours,it felt bloated this movie would have been bearable if it was an hour and 45 long.Then the way he obtained the trident in 2 microseconds just like that? you kidding ? it just fell off completely rather than being a satisfying moment in the film.
Then there are huge character plotholes!! they are literally sea creatures so why on earth they would need a boat to travel through the sea? or why would they need those underwater-crafts when they simply can swim like a literal sea-flash.
also it is mentioned that aquaman has special eyes which helps him see underwater even when its dark then why the heck he would need flairs in the climax sequence ? and there are many more silly character development mistakes in the movie
also what exactly are aquaman's powers? is he wolverine? is he Thor(wannabee wet-thor more likely). he gets beaten like crazy and yet he sorta is healed in the same scene and also there are no signs of injury whatsoever.
The whole story and dialouges seems like you are watching a teen rom-com! with childish dailouges and poor writing.
The only Good thing about this movie is Jason Momoa ! they nailed it in the casting of him as aquaman but the rest is pretty much mediocre at best.",Aquaman

A lot of fun, a lot of entertainment and a lot of water! Totally worth it.",Aquaman
1358,bignut,"Cheesy and very, very underwhelming",5,14 April 2019,"From the ridiculous guitar riffs when ever momoa does anything in the first 5 minutes to the awful costumes, this film is just not upto much.
Has a very power rangers style approach to the wardrobe, the cg is crude in parts, the plot is basic and predictable. It's a joke that DC are putting things like this out after some of the recent marvel films- they should be embarrassed with themselves.Watchable but nothing more.",Aquaman
1359,krapriv,Fantastic film.,9,31 December 2018,"Disclaimer: I am an MCU fan through and through.I feel like DC got their groove with this film. Coupled with Wonder Woman, I feel like I won't have mixed emotions on any more of their films if they can keep the juju going.The colors. The visuals. The imagination. Even the story. Plot wasn't complicated, even if there were deviations from what might be Canon, and there was just enough of everything to make me love this film. Jason Mamoa seemed to enjoy his role. Nothing like an actor who is having fun.They should not have rushed Justice League. I feel like a movie like this for each hero would have helped audiences connect more with what otherwise seemed like a last minute build-a-team movie.",Aquaman

1361,pchasejr,Soundtrack is Terrible.,5,12 March 2021,"In Justice League Aquaman is introduced with The White Stripes song ""Icky Thump."" That not only sets the stage and tone for Aquaman but also embodies every character Jason Momoa's known for. This movie should have been filled with raw rock songs from bands like Black Sabbath, Ac/Dc, Rage against the Machine, Tool etc... instead it's a bunch of garbage music pushed on to us by industry execs. At least that's my feel. Loved the movie but the soundtrack should be redone.",Aquaman
1362,MMOO7,'Aquaman' has a different theme!,8,24 March 2019,"It is almost kind of a new scenario, under water! There are many movies that themed underwater but not with a massive empire at the bottom of the sea. Many viewers are hating this movie based on their personal opinions like bad story, few superstars, Jason Momoa's bad acting, slow SFX etc. It is true that just like tipical Marvel or DC movies, the count of superstars are very less in this movie and that didn't made this movie bad in my view.
Jason Momoa is a big guy, and his size perfectly fitting with his character. But he couldn't 100% blend with that character in terms of acting, some tweaks are required.
About the movie, I like the underwater empire. It supposed to be huge and massive. But throughout the movie play, we won't get a feel like that. That is the main flaw of the movie. More of a budget empire 😅 I think. I enjoyed to watch the water creatures that the soldiers are used to ride. The Trench Monsters, Sea Dragons, Battle Lobsters, Tylosaurus. Especially the Karathen, wow! That gigantic creature is almost a nightmare. The director had every possible chance to make this movie great but the limitation of time and may be budget made the move average I guess!
One of the things I more like about this movie is less cracking jokes and more of a serious attitude of all characters throughout the movie, mainly the main actors. In the Thor movie sequels, we can see, the first movie is the best of all. Thor the son of Odin, is really mighty! His talking, attire, actions are exactly resembles a true son of god. But after that movie, every characters are making things less important and making jokes. Thor and Loki didn't seem that concentrated on their respective characters behaviour. This is happening with all the superhero movies nowadays. Cracking jokes irrespective or their characters. Especially in fantasy and mythological movies. But Aquaman is better than that. All the actors are serious in their corresponding roles.
I had great expectation on the coronation at end for new king, but nothing was there. Another flaw in my view. I am not going to be a complete critic about this movie. To be honest, it is better than Spiderman movies (not the old ones), some Avengers and DC movies with too much hype.",Aquaman
1363,johnnghome,All action but no brawn,5,11 November 2019,"For a movie that is so well promoted and with some big names, it doesn't have much to offer. The CGI is rather poor in comparison to CGI's of today. During the action sequences, the figures are made to race at ridiculously fast and physically impossible speed (I wonder why the movie makers didn't just synchronise it to a fast shark instead). Also, the thick soup of monsters is just laughably incredible. It also seems to me that, as the story drifts along, that there are just too many coincidences to patch up the glitches of the storyline. This is a movie all about action and no brawn.",Aquaman
1364,princeadofo,Never Trust Anyone Who Call Aquaman A Boring Movie,10,8 December 2018,"Finally, DC seems to be moving towards the right direction. I a big fan of superhero movies, not caring whether it Marvel or DC. The movie is very straightforward and you quickly get excited to know what's to come next after the first act. And oh please, the songs used are really good plus the visuals are really good. There are lots of surprisingly good underwater battle scenes and oh my that battle with Black Manta kills it. The main characters are very well explored. The ending could have been done better but it seems that would have made the movie's runtime longer. It's really worth the 2 hours of watching it as the pacing is really good.",Aquaman
1365,elliot-75668,Stays afloat despite time lost at sea,6,24 December 2018,"Slowly the DC Cinematic Universe (DCCU) is building its own world to match the colossus built by the MCU. The next Justice Legend to get his own origins story is Aquaman, but quite when this origins story is set is massively unclear apart from a line of throw away dialogue. However, a quick search online informs me that events in Aquaman take place after the events of Justice League but it would be difficult to tell because events of Justice League seemed to have very little bearing.Anyway, the underwater realm of Atlantis is being pushed to its limits by the surface world's endless polluting of Earth's oceans. This leads to a political discourse where Atlantians decide whether to launch an assault on the surface world. When the surface world (debatable) attacks both Om/Ocean Master (Patrick Wilson) and Nereus (Doplh Lundgren) the tribes of Xebel and Om join forces to destroy the surface world.The only man who can stop them is Arthur Curry, half man, half Atlantian who harbors a strong resentment towards Atlantis for the execution of his mother as punishment falling in love and having a child with a human. The only way for Arthur to stop Om's destruction of the surface world is to find the Trident of Atlan which is will give command over all ocean life.Such is the legendary and mythological status of these superhero characters in their own universes it is not perhaps surprising that the story is Aquaman is inspired by some of the most famous mythological tales in literature. The most notable being the Legend of King Arthur (the two even share names) where King Arthur is the only one who can pull the sword of Excalibur from the rock much like how only Arthur Curry can wield the trident of Atlan.Other inspirations include Jason and the Argonauts as our heroes face deadly monsters in their quest to retrieve the legendary item - be it the Golden Fleece or the Trident of Atlan. It's here that fault in the movie can be found as the various epic set pieces don't feel tired together by a strong script which, in fact, is as weak as soggy paper. It feels too unconnected as the movie bounds to from epic set piece to epic set piece with the only breaks from the action used as exposition so that we can keep up with everything going on (even if some of it was painfully obvious).The script's jumpy narrative makes the film the bloated mess that it is. However, helping us through it is director James Wan whose experience at helming massive franchises has been of great benefit to him. Working with a massive $200,000,000 budget, Wan has helped create some stunning underworld citadels that retain an element of awe even in his GCI dominated movie universe.Jason Momoa (less said his teenage counterpart the better) is charming and engaging enough in the lead role, but much of the actors' performances are lost in the tidal wave of GCI which, whilst impressive, just leads the actors (and some great ones too) to be swallowed up by the oceans of GCI. With nothing to anchor the film with a strong identity it just gets cast adrift in the vast ocean of superhero movies",Aquaman
1366,nateahoey,"Good story, Well executed",9,26 December 2018,"I had read the reviews on this movie. I had seen the good and the bad. Let me say that I was entertained and intrigued. The intense battle scenes made the movie entertaining and has AMAZING special effects. I could tell that the director had thought a lot about this movie and how it would fit together. The storyline, acting, effects, all of it, great.
Jason Mamoa did a great job at playing the aquatic, funny hero. Other acting was great, especially Willem Defoe and Dolph Lundgren. Part of the amazing pieces of this film was how you saw what every party, or group, was fighting for. You saw Orin forming the seven kingdoms together to cause war among the land. You saw Black Mantis seeking revenge for his father. And of course, there was Arthur seeking the Trident. And I'll say this once more, the visual effects made it all the more stunning. I feel like a good behind plot that was concluded at the end of the film was that they were not separate, and that led to the Atlanteans discovering that the land and sea were indeed not separate, and Atlantis was one. Good movie, I recommend seeing it.",Aquaman

1368,DreamBliss,This movie is so much better than Fresh Tomatoes and critics would lead you to believe!,8,2 January 2019,"For some reason Fresh Tomatoes and I believe many critics are leaving reviews of this film that lead you to believe that it is not very good. This is not true. This movie is almost as good as Wonder Woman. It stands head to shoulders in quality with Wonder Woman, the recent Batman movies, and the recent Superman movies. It is truly that good.The way James Wan (the guy behind Dead Silence and other horror movies) and crew have brought Atlantis to life is simply amazing and epic in scope. It reminds me of the depth and quality of Valerian. I felt the same way, watching this, as I did when I watched the first Iron Man movie. I enjoyed this as much as I have enjoyed Iron Man, the Batman movies and Wonder Woman.It is not perfect by any means, and both my parents thought it was slightly cheesy in parts. I did not. I was thoroughly caught up the scope of the adventure here. I enjoyed this even more than Mortal Engines, yet another gem. I am not a fan of Momoa, and Lundgren is not much better as an actor. Neither of them could act their way out of a wet paper bag. But both were at the top of their game here. Did you even recognize Dolphie in this?Sadly this movie is being railroaded in my area. They tell me it is brand new, yet they have only one 3D showing, at around 11am -12pm at Regal Cinemas and Cinetopia. Look it up for yourself. Writing this on 1-2-2019, and am in the Vancouver, WA. area. There is some sort of concerted effort between local theaters and the folks at Fresh Tomatoes to destroy this film, to sabotage it, and I have no idea why.If you have been hesitating you better go and see it in 3D for yourself right now. avoid IMAX if you can, Real 3D has the most comfortable glasses. If you are stuck with IMAX swallow the price tag and uncomfortable glasses. You will not regret it. Trust me. If you loved Wonder Woman, if you enjoyed Valerian, then you will certainly love this movie! It is backed by a number of excellent actors and actresses, and everyone is doing their best in their various roles. This movie is an absolutely stunning epic you do not want to miss.And if the theaters in your area are not providing afternoon and evening 3D showings, or even 2D showings, you need to speak up. The only way to stop them is to break the silence. Check the disparity in user reviews to the Fresh Tomato score. You will see something is fishy here, no pun intended.I wish they had let James Wan handle Justice League. That movie truly was a flop. But this one just about makes up for it.",Aquaman

1372,leobbiagi,Hilarious,6,28 December 2018,"This movie is so ridiculous and dumb that it actual makes for a fun time. However, Aquaman contains three major flaws.
1) This movie falls victim to the common virus in every day movies and that is the over use of CGI. This film is layered with CGI to the point were every single scene in this movie contains large amounts CGI. The filims over the top graphics makes everything look fake, making it hard for you connect to the characters or story. The battle scenes are just CGI monsters crashing into each other and turning the intense scenes into something out of a Michael Bay film. Ever fight or intense scene I was laughing my head off because of the fake and chessy CGI.
2) In the comics Aquaman is a ridiculous character and I respect how hard they tried to make this movie not as dumb and corny. However, the movies plot is unoriginal and the script is laughable. The plot of Aruther try to stop the war of two different worlds by claiming his right to the throne has been seen many times in movies, most recently Black Panther which came out earlier in 2018. They tried their best to make a good script but everything they said was laughable and corny. For example their is a scene in which the villain is confronting a CGI crab, the crab says that he will not call the villain ""your Highness"" the villain responds that he does not want to be called Highness but Oceanmaster. This is supposed to be an intense and chilling speech but I found my self once again laughing out loud.
3) Aquaman is play very well as Jason Momoa, he brings a charming and charismatic personality that is fun and enjoyable to watch. However all the characters are god like people with super human strength and stamina. While this provides the characters with awesome moments it also adds very little stakes Aquaman is constantly stabed, shot or falling from great heights. Every time he comes out without a scratch providing little to no stakes because the characters are nearly invincible.
Even though Aquaman has many flaws it still is a fun and enjoyable movie.",Aquaman

I was grinning most of the way through it's sweeping 2hr 22min runtime.

1374,danielzelenakzex,BEST DC MOVIE!! MASTERPIECE,10,19 August 2021,"Oh where do I start. I think that this movie uprose the DC franchise. It is easely one of my favorite movies. The visuals are breathtaking. Story is such classic, and the acting is on point. Wasn't cringing at all. Personal life of Amber on a side. You can't judge a movie based on that. Like it or not, Mera is important element to the story. Watched the movie like 5 times already since it came out (and usually I don't watch movies that I watched), and regret that I didn't see it in cinema. The only DC movie I rated with 10. Can't believe there are people that are trashing it just because of Amber. Aquaman is the DC classic. Wonder Woman would be too, if they didn't trashed it with CGI and storyline. Still I think DC is at it's best here. Don't think they are gonna outdone themselves. Maybe with Aquaman 2, if they don't ruin it. Fingers crossed. But hey, still didn't watch Justice League the Snyder's cut. So maybe it will beat this. But I doubted.",Aquaman

From piranha men to Jurassic park to a dessert with nice new clothes on to an octopus beating drums I just don't know what I'm missing here. I wish Monma never agreed with corny jokes and just awkward moments. I saw this movie for free and wasted 2 hours and some changed. This movie is truly all over the map and as you continue to watch it feels like the director is hearing you down with a bag of organges very very very slow and methodical with out any reason why....Blavk Mantas voice was not over exaggerated like Batman but was more annoying...just like justice league there was no attempt to allow the movie to build a suspense as you know what was coming.

1376,kmchahine,A resurrection for the DCEU,9,18 March 2019,"This review was written on Dec. 22, 2018.
*******I got home and turned on my laptop specifically to write this. In one word, this movie is beautiful.Hands down, it is the best thing that happened to the DC universe since Nolan's Batman trilogy. The story is very well robust, the actors are perfectly chosen (thanks Zneyder), and the graphics magnificent.Let me start by saying I am a big geek of ancient history and mythology. Atlantis and its legends instill in me a feeling of mystery and an intrigue that always make me contemplate the fantasies of its existence. This movie simply stirs up those feelings and takes you to the lost throne, explaining its majesty, its rise, its demise and now, its renaissance.The story has a beautiful path. Every sequence is well justified and so well connected that Aquaman's universe is well established.
The chemistry between the characters also flows so naturally that nothing seems forced or unexplained.Without adding any spoilers, despite my reservation of its ""completely"" happy ending, I will end by saying that indeed, Aquaman appears to be the hero who has lifted the DCEU from its years in the abyss, the movie that holds the DC universe to its rightful place among the legends.Also, ""Everything I Need"" by Skylar Grey is truly a masterpiece. A beautiful ending to a great movie.Bravo James Wan!",Aquaman
1377,mm-45710,Very Disappointing,4,6 September 2019,"This has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with Aquaman. This is just hollow cheap entertainment fit to satisfy the masses.

I think this is supposed to be a loose adaptation of the New 52 run on Aquaman but the result is only a disappointing mix of elements from the comics, screwed and wasted. The Trench? Wasted. Mera? Screwed. Black Manta? Wasted. Aquaman? Completely screwed. Jason Momoa as an actor for Aquaman? Completely wasted, although I believe
with the right script and production he would have been great.And please be aware that I write this as a true fan of DC graphic novels and movies.I think this is a perfect example of what happens when cinema is made to make hundreds of millions and not to be art.",Aquaman

1386,diegojosmer,Probably the only one,3,14 December 2018,"So yesterday I got the chance to see Aquaman, and I truly did not know what to expect. I had only seen the first trailer, but went into the theatre since I really enjoy DC/Marvel/Superheroe movies. Unfortunately this movie just wasn't it for me.
The main driving factor is the screenplay, or mainly the way the plot was taken care of. The beginning of the movie really threw me off since there was almost no exposition of the characters. I'm aware Aquaman and Mera were technically introduced in Justice League, but that doesn't change the fact that I think a couple of minutes to further present the character interactions would've helped.
Then there's the fact that I felt that some of the action sequences just threw too much into the situation. The film is a great achievement of CGI and Visual Effects, but sometimes less is best. And I'm not talking about the Atlantian effects, because those were perfect and stunning, I mostly refer to the last action sequence where the writers mostly knew the studio would give them millions of dollars, so they decided to go all in.
I applaud James Wan for presenting the underwater scenes in such an amazing way but the ""real-world"" scenes needed to showcase the same amount of quality as the underwater ones, which left the movie feeling really unbalanced.
Something that had never happened to me is being irritated by the score/soundtrack. I think the score did not know exactly what it wanted to do with the movie, and there was no real consistency with the way it wanted to musicalize the film. What was truly absurd was how in the middle of the movie after an intense and big action sequence they decided to throw in an upbeat Pitbull song. I started laughing out loud because I couldn't believe they decided to include that.This movie just didn't work to me as a whole and I got tired in the middle of the movie because of how much was happening. If you're a fan of superheroe movies and love those big budget all in action sequences, then you probably will leave the theatre really satisfied.",Aquaman

How great is that. To make anybody feel like he can be like a king, a hero, and somebody who would steal another woman from another guy, doesn't that make you feel good? And of course, blah blah blah, he is just so good. The important people such as the wife-to-be and the counselor betray their king to help this guy. And of course, the younger brother who is opposing him, is made to look like evil. There is also a bad guy, who, after killing random people, actually said that Aquaman should have mercy and save his father when his father was trapped by a fallen object... that was really fair... and Aquaman actually kind of thought maybe he should have saved his father too... When Aquaman and the betraying woman both fall and can get killed by the thousands of sea creatures, for some reason they have the flame light to keep these creatures away... so it was just a coincidence that they were able to see those flaming light device... so what if they didn't see it, then they are dead? In Silicon Valley, I see these wild crazy guys who thought they are like a hero all the time, when they don't even test their software code and push to the web server and crash everything, and then they backstab other coworkers... it is guys like him that are made to look like a hero and a king, and somebody who could steel woman from another man... what kind of movie is this?

Really cringy dialogue throughout, bad cgi to the point that it just looks like they are standing in front of a green screen most of the time and just overall a really boring slow movie. I think the non stop superhero movies are starting to take their toll and this is what we get. Skip this movie at all costs",Aquaman

The only character that is interesting is King Orm, who is a fine king of the ocean. I wouldn't have minded if Aquaman and Mera eventually died, I wouldn't miss them anyway. And Atlanna should have stayed dead, she's just an unnecessary character. Anyway, I often have the idea that with series & movies from D.C., D.C. stands for Disney Channel because this is a movie for children up to 7 years.",Aquaman

Imagine being a casting director and having your pick of the Hollywood talent who would jump at the chance of starring in a blockbuster superhero movie and choosing AMBER HEARD! It's almost comical! Why? Why was this done?? Choosing absolutely anyone else would have made this watchable, but alas, it is not. I do like Jason Momoa though, and though he did a respectable job given who he had to work with.",Aquaman
1402,DaddioMax,A Solid Entry in the Superhero Genre,8,6 January 2019,"Possible Spoilers:I enjoyed this film immensely. Much more ""whimsical"" (not unlike Marvel's- Black Panther) than previous DC entries. The story was very much the ""hero's journey/quest"" with really intense battles saved for Act 3. Although pollution of the oceans was admonished, it was not overly ""preached"" to get in the way of the story. James Wan's direction managed to bring Arthur Curry/Aquaman to vivid reality and Jason Momoa was delightful in the part. With a good ""back-story"", it explains his modern colloquial speech in Justice League perfectly. Happy to see Willem Defoe as a good-guy and Amber Heard was a thoughtful and dryly funny Mera. Patrick Wilson brought his ""A-game"" as the co-villain with an intense turn by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as the bookend villain, Manta. The villains carried ""dimension"" and were not just ""cookie-cutter"". Beautiful filming and well executed CGI along with many bows to the comic and the Saturday Morning cartoon, Super Friends as far as the actualization of Aquaman went. I would give the film a solid B+ to A-. Hope to see more adventures with Arthur/Aquaman.",Aquaman
1403,mykzmails,Beautiful cinematography and direction ruined by the problems of poor writing.,7,16 December 2020,"James Wan rocks, he just does. He's a fantastic filmmaker and he brought in some of the only good parts of the movie.
His direction is what pieced this movie together, but what failed this movie - was Will Beal. Oh god, Will Beal, the writer of Gangster Squad and Venom.
The movies' writing is horrendous, terrible, just plain bad.
And I sort of could see that James Wan knew it, so instead he filled the movie with beautiful visuals and spectacular acting.Ocean Master would be a terrible villain if not for the acting of Patrick Wilson, Aquaman would be a bland character if Jason Momoa wasn't there.
The direction, cinematography, stunt performances and the acting hold the movie together, and it's disappointing that DC couldn't hire a better screenwriter to make those parts shine, I mean - they kind of did. Considering the writing is so bad, those parents just pop out because it's weird that they're so good while the writing is so bad.Oh, and speaking of people that should be fired for the sequel - Amber Heard.Still, a visually striking DC movie, hope James Wan gets more work with DC and a better writer for his movies.",Aquaman

The action, the storyline, the CGI, the touching parts - I highly recommend! Not to mention the beautiful song ""Everything I need"" , it's soundtrack! (my wedding song)
For me, personally, it's in my TOP 3 action/fantasy movies! And it is the best DC movie!",Aquaman
1406,theshadow1963,Blows Black Panther out of the water!,9,24 December 2018,"When it comes to movies about superhero kings, forget Wakanda. Atlantis is the place to be. Aquaman has a richly-realized superhero fantasy world build from the ground up and full of life.
It's the story of Arthur Curry, a child of two worlds who must make peace between them when his evil half-brother seeks war. Long derided by folks unfamiliar with the comics as ""the guy whose superpower is talking to fish"", this movie should show the non-fans what comic fans have always known: that Aquaman is a certified badass.
Comparisons with Black Panther are inevitable: both are movies about superheroes who are the hereditary kings of hidden, super-advanced societies. But Aquaman is superior to Black Panther in every way. Atlantis, unlike Wakanda, is a true ""lost world"", a place hidden from outsiders by isolation, not politics. And Arthur Curry is a much more engaging hero than T'Challa. Whereas Black Panther and his sister are confident to the point of being insufferably smug and unshakably convinced of their own moral superiority, The Aquaman (like The Batman, he is no longer referred to as just Aquaman, he's THE Aquaman, now!) is conflicted and full of doubts. For all of his manly swagger, he knows it takes more to be a king than just inheriting a title, and his story is about his journey to become king. His story also tells us that there is more to him that just a title. As his mother says, ""King fights for their country. You fight for everyone."" Take, that, T'Challa!.
The special effects are top-notch. Atlantis is not merely rendered as a place, we get tantalizing glimpses of its ecosystem, with Atlanteans using trained sharks, whales, hippocampi (giant seahorses) and even Mosasaurs (which is not the only thing about this movie that will invoke Jurassic Park). There's also a sea monster that talks with the voice of Julie Andrews (I'm not making this up.).
As per any superhero origin story, this film introduces major members of the hero's Rogues' Gallery. In this case, Orm, the Ocean Master who is Aquaman's evil half-brother, and Black Manta, DC Comics' first major black supervillain.
Aside from a quick reference to Arthur's role in defeating Steppenwolf in Justice League, there are no other references to the overall continuity of the DCEU, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this a 10/10 rating. Since it takes place after the formation of the League, it would have been a nice touch to mention that Arthur and Mera were getting a little financial help from Bruce Wayne while trekking across Africa and the Mediterranean, instead of wondering how they got from the middle of the Sahara to Sicily. It also precludes that the Altanteans' greatest weakness in the comics - they can only survive out of the water for brief periods of time before risking death from dehydration - doesn't apply to Atlanteans of royal blood, like Arthur and Mera.
But small issues aside, Aquaman proves that Wonder Woman wasn't a fluke, and that Warner Brothers can produce superhero films on a par with the best of what Marvel can offer.",Aquaman
1407,ashleyfitches,Fully enjoyed this.,8,21 October 2021,Amazing movie with incredible CGI and colour schemes. The amazing underwater graphics and action along with brilliant fight scenes makes this one of my favourite DCEU movies.

1408,lamerok,Excellent superhero film,9,15 April 2019,"I don't understand all of the terrible reviews. They seem to mostly criticize the acting and the plot. I enjoyed most of the acting and the cast had some great actors (Willem Defoe, Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman) and some not so great actors that I still love (Dolph Lundgren). I enjoyed Jason Momoa's performance. The plot is standard superhero stuff. The only real weakness was the villain, Manta, I had a hard time believing or caring about his character. Fortunately, he was a relatively small part of the movie.The visuals were outstanding, the movie moved along briskly and the action scenes were always entertaining. The was as good as anything Marvel had put out.",Aquaman

1412,annezuchowicz63,Could have been so much better..,3,22 April 2019,"Twenty minutes in and I'm already bored. That doesn't happen too often. Usually, I can stick it out, but, there are things I just didn't like about this film. First of all, none of the ocean dwelling 'people' have gills to breathe under water. Secondly, talking under water (???), telepathy would have been way cooler. Thirdly, no fins?? Super muscular fins for legs would have been more understandable, then when they're out of water they develop legs and vice versa. Kind of like the Little Mermaid. Forthly, using ocean dwelling creatures that already exist in nature instead of some far fetched crazy creation would have grounded the story more and made it seem plausible. The laser weapons just have to go. Again, let's keep it traditional to what they actually have available from nature to use.
Bottom line is that this version sucks ocean water and I'd like my money back.",Aquaman

Stereotypical bad predictable writing, backed up with horrible acting by respected actors that clearly can't say no to money grabs like this. You can't even blame them at this point, easy money and back end. You would be stupid to say no. Sad for people that actually like films but yet, here we are. Im off, like a prom dress, to find better indy films to enjoy. Enjoy this ball of crap for what its worth. A laugh.",Aquaman
1418,alexpapaniko-472-358998,Why is this so highly praised?,1,13 December 2018,"So i just came back from watching this. And for once I wanted to see a DC movie and feel like it was worth my time. Here are my thoughts:-OK visuals..-The undersea world looked like it had some potential. It would be interesting to see more about daily Atlantian lifes or how the other, seemingly very different kingdoms, function. Sadly James Wan did not want to elaborate on that.that pretty much sums up all the good points of this movie. Now to the bad ones:-no character development or any attempt to make the hero resonate with the audience which is very weird, aquaman being an origin movie-very poor acting (especially Momoa.. My god.. ) and unexisting chemistry between actors which is almost funny at some points. Regarding the acting Aquaman is supposed to go from super-confident in the beginning to somewhat scared/sceptical by the middle of the movie by what's at stake. Movie tells you that's what's happening at least. Momoa never portrayed that in any way. Same dude throughout the movie saying his lines.-Music selection. Aquaman is portrayed intentionally or unintenionally being somewhat goofy/witty/smartass. And the music background playing in every one of his scenes sounds like you are watching The Dark Knight. Only darker.. But goofy.. Makes sense.. No..? Ok moving on..-Jokes were between cringy and plain bad. Some one-liners especially from Momoa made me shiver in discomfort. To me it felt like James Wan saw Thor: Ragnarok and tried the same approach but much much more poorly executed-no real story development (or even story). Felt like a videogame where your hero goes from place A to place B fights some dude that noone cares about (Im looking at you Manta), gains his XP and then onto the next scene. Seriously if Manta was not part of the movie it would have made literally no difference. Pretty much like the Joker in Suicide Squad. DC was criticized about it then but here we go again....-Again regarding the story. There is literally nothing original here that you haven't already seen in every other pop-corn movie before. If this is not your first movie then you can easily predict the lines, the story, the 'plot twists'... Pretty much everything..-And since we are at the story.. Why was that submarine bombarding Atlantis? As far as we are told noone even believed in Atlantis aside from some people who were considered 'weird' or 'conspiracy theorists' by the general public. So could the government know about Atlantis all along? And its plan was to send a lone submarine some thousand meters undersea for what purpose? Or was it an inside job? Shouldnt we be told or hinted at least? I mean that incident, again from what we are told, initiated the war underseas that would lead to the invasion of the Atlantians against the people of the surface. Either I was half asleep when they explained/implied this or the movie was laughably lazy with thisI could go on but I mostly wanted to share my rough feelings on this especially after seeing how highly this movie is praised at this point. If this was released in the early 00s where the superhero genre was still discovering itself then it would have been fine. But at this point its definitely not.Honestly if you care only for the visuals go watch it. If you expect anything more do not waste your time.Personally I think I am officially done with the DCU",Aquaman

I'm a fan of sci-fi and super hero movies but this one was a big flop in my opinion. Seems like they just focused so much on the CGI stuff they forgot to entertain you in the process.

1425,Impsman,Enjoyable hokum,7,17 December 2018,A super hero from Atlantis who can talk to fish was never going to be an easy film to make a cohesive plot with so clearly the makers of Aquaman have decided the best way to cover this is to make it big and spectacular. They succeed with this. You are never bored whilst watching this film and some of the underwater imagery is beautiful to look at. Having seen Justice League last year the small underwater segment within that film gave some considerable concern on how this film would look. What was a dogs dinner twelve months ago is startling and impressive in this film.The film itself is best viewed with your brain in neutral as several aspects don't stand up to close scrutiny and I am sure the goofs part of IMDB will get plenty of inclusions when you start to overthink the film. All I'll say is that the whole premise is ridiculous so just go with the flow. You'll enjoy it so much more if you do,Aquaman
1426,sebastianfoxworth,They Made Aquaman Interesting!,9,22 January 2019,I love the way the story was told. Lots of action way more than I thought would be in it.

When Man of Steel came out I was okay with how it turned out. Then the movies that followed in suit were a complete disaster. Wonder Woman turned out good and lifted the spirits in all of us. However, we need more than just Wonder Woman to save this franchise. Aquaman is the movie that gives the franchise a fresh new take, and the turning point that these mucky waters surely need.
Aquaman is the best DC movie in my opinion. After watching this masterpiece I can say that without a doubt that Warner Bros. is on the right track. I can only hope that they decide to make more movies like Aquaman. This is the turning point that DC needs.

DC had a hard job to make a good film out of a not so respected horoe (Speaking for myself, I didn't know much of aquaman, just the basics that everybody knows) and it worked very well.
The cast is really good, There wouldn't be any other main actor as good as Jason to play the role and James Wan managed to make one of the best super heroe movies of the year for me, only behind avengers. Also think this might the best movie from DC, maybe behind justice league.",Aquaman
1431,baqari-com,Accuracy in Spades...,10,10 December 2018,"When you adapt comic book to the big screen, mostly you just ADAPT it... There are exceptions obviously, but comic book doesn't translate from page to screen, or so we were told...And then along came James Wan! What a director! What a movie! This is one of the most accurate comic book movies, like ever(except the lead, who looks nothing like Aquaman from the comics)!So Jason Momoa is great in this role! No doubt about it! And just like Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, Zack Snyder cast people(not very good, in terms of acting abilities), who naturally fit to these characters. I mean from the first shot of him onscreen you're like: he look nothing like Aquaman, I've read, but he IS AQUAMAN!Back to comics accuracy. Every other character is authentic esthetically, and personalitywise. Black Manta really is Black Manta(they even explain, why his helmet is so damn Big, Oceanmaster has his iconic Helmet and etc...
Now the Action! James Wan gives the fight scenes in Aquaman a unique cinematic language: they always begin with wide circular shots, that help establish the geography and after we're used to surroundings, James starts cutting to the choreography. And also long take fight scenes! Quite few of them actually!Film is pretty fast paced, but still manages to deliver solid story arcs, and clear motivations for both our heroes and our villains. Performances are solid overrall. No clear standouts, at least to me.I don't even need to say that the movie is visually stunning! You already knew that from the trailers!The score: pretty good! Aquaman theme is repeated quite often, and after the credits roll, it kinda sticks to your brain on a loop. Character themes overall are very good, although Oceanmaster theme is too dark, considering the fact that he is not evil personally.In the end It's a feel good movie for the whole family, with some real heart, and genuine humor!I highly recommend it!9.5/10",Aquaman

1439,jetmoviereviews,"Not bad, DC. Not bad.",7,23 December 2018,"The DCEU, or Worlds of DC as they are now calling it, have released another standalone movie, this time with the character of Aquaman. Now, DC has been pretty good with their standalone films; the only films that I have major problems with are Batman V Superman, Suicide Squad, and Justice League. Justice League wasn't even that bad of a movie. It just felt rushed. One of the best parts about that movie was the character of Aquaman, a character that everyone thought of as weak and stupid before that movie was released. What Justice League did, however, was turn Aquaman into badass, so I was really excited to see how they would expand on his story in his standalone film. Luckily, he is still a badass.
Aquaman is not the best film in the DCEU, but it is definitely not the worst. I don't think this is James Wan's best work, either. However, I still think that is is a very enjoyable movie with a lot of stuff to love. It's weird to think that this movie belongs to the same universe as Batman V Superman, Man of Steel, and the like. It's so much brighter; so much more colorful. It is beautiful to look at. All of the CGI, makeup effects, and costumes look amazing. It is the most colorful film in the DCEU by far.
Aquaman is an awesome character, and Jason Momoa brings a lot of character and comedy to him. Mera was a very likable partner for Aquaman to have, and she also knew how to kick butt. Willem Defoe's character Vulko was fine; nothing great about him, but also nothing bad. The villains were actually quite good, and you could really reason with almost everything they were doing. Orm, played by Patrick Wilson, bounced off of Aquaman very well. The seriousness of Orm and the goofiness of Aquaman meshed together very well. Black Manta was a fun villain, too. I liked every scene he was in, and his on-screen suit didn't look half bad. I just feel that for being Aquaman's most iconic foe, he wasn't in the movie enough.
Now, this movie had some very cringy dialogue that took me out of the movie at times. There were also some shots in the film that made it seem like the movie was trying to be too mainstream. At one point in the film, Aquaman and Mera walk out of the ocean onto a beach in slow motion, like something you'd see during a swimsuit ad. While this is happening, a horrible - and I mean HORRIBLE - cover of Africa by Toto, being performed by Pitbull, was playing in the background. It was such a ridiculous shot, and it took me out of the movie. The film also had a lot going on, and I feel with a little more cutting, it could have been shortened without ruining the plot.
Overall, I think this is a very entertaining movie. It adds a lot more color and character to the DCEU, which is something it much needed. It's not better than Wonder Woman, but it definitely is better and more well put together than the other films in the DCEU. I'm excited to see where they go next with the character. If you are skeptical about seeing this movie, just give it a try. It's very entertaining, whether you like the DC films or not.",Aquaman

Whether it's Director James Wan, actress Nicole Kidmam (among other lesser known actors), filming in Queensland and New South Wales, government funding/offsets, or using Australian film and visual effects crews; Aquaman is the best of Australia on show for the world.Aussie! Aussie! Aussie!",Aquaman

1448,zero-to-HERO,AQUAMAN & WONDER WOMAN SAVE THE DCEU!,9,4 January 2019,"It looks as though the DCEU has some hope! Between the success Wonder Woman had and now Aquaman, there is some light at the end of the tunnel after all. The DCEU now has room to restructure their semi folly flicks/runs via the Justice League & Suicide Squad. Or does it? The reason why I say this is that it looks as though the DCEU movieverse does better with their standalone character driven films than it does when they're relayed as a team. Perhaps it was a matter of bad timing. I humbly think they should have introduced their primary standalone character films first before rushing in team collaborated feature films. Trying to catch up with marvel seemed to have been the plan, the folly there was marvel has been good at their movieverse craft for quite some time now. DC should have just paced themselves one character at a time.But enough of the loom and gloom, this was supposed to be a positive review and thus it shall be. To be frank I didn't expect the film to be as good as it was. And admittedly had my doubts and reservations. Don't get me wrong I thought it was going to be fun but fun in a goofy way (not that I was expecting the whole thing to be goofy, just more so than not). But to my surprise there was less goofiness and more straight up fun. Not only that, but there were dark yet mystical elements to the film as well, supplemented with a dash of wittiness and character. Albeit the style that was presented in this film wasn't over the top, nor was it lowly either, but in my humble opinion, done just right (from a comic book world perspective). From the telling tale of Arthur Curry (Aquaman) to the general creation and lore of the world around him, I really didn't want it to end and yearned for more. And it made me feel like that slightly more so than when I watched Wonder Woman (as much as I also greatly appreciated that film).Now it's no secret that to portray Atlantis properly, there would have to be some heavy CGI. And I will say it was done just right - considering current CGI technologies (plus budget allowance). The architecture presented both modern Atlantis and old sectors as well. To describe the way it was done would be harder said than seen. The rich textures and lush colors at so many turns, let alone the style of structures utilized created a mythical magic about Atlantis unlike seen before, part of which included Atlantean technological advancements. Of course I did see some areas that I thought needed more attention to detail, but my overall admiration of what was presented far outweighed my nitpickiness. The only real way to describe what Atlantis is like in this movie is to go see it yourself.The actors did an admirable job! As someone who reads Aquaman comics, I had a tough time seeing Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman. Let's face it, Arthur from the comics and Arthur in this film look very different. And although I've been a fan of Jason Momoa's roles in both Stargate Atlantis (no pun intended) and Game of Thrones - I just couldn't visualize Jason hitting the mark as Aquaman. And to my surprise he did just that, especially as a DCEU extension of the character, he did a fantastic job! Just as Arthur, Jason delivered a bold, conflicted and sometimes misunderstood Aquaman, whilst showing us a prideful 'not easy to uncover' loving side as well.The supporting cast was solid enough to do what they had to do & quite the impressive cast it was. Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master, Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, Amber Heard as Mera, and even Dolph Lungren as King Nereus and more... Sometimes it's not the actors alone who make or break a film no matter who the actor/actress is, oftentimes it's the synergy of how the characters coalesce to one another that's an integral part of the process. Hence is why I reiterate this supporting cast was solid enough to do what they had to do and delivered a successful Aquaman film.I must admit, when I see non comic book readers critique a comic book film, it makes me cringe (not always but a fair amount of times). Which is why in my humble opinion when seeing a Superhero film, don't rely on such critics too much, and sometimes this includes comic book reader critics too. Go in with an open mind and judge for yourself the world that's being presented to you. A comic book movieverse is one of those rare exceptions where relying on your own critiquing is a much better way of validating your liking or disliking of any one of these films over other critics themselves.As for me, I really relished this film. It had all the elements required to portray Aquaman and the world around him. From the storytelling and the lore presented to the characters themselves and the laid out visuals. Go see it, and lean on your own genuine open minded critiquing when you do see it.",Aquaman
1449,mikelibra-04853,Aquaman is LEGENDARY,10,7 December 2018,This movie is by far the best superhero movie of the year & honestly one of the greatest superhero movies of all time!

DC did a amazing job with this movie and showed that there's more great movies to come. Stay for ending too.,Aquaman
1450,simonanter,Great Movie,10,29 July 2019,"Since a lot has been said already: the story isn't as bad as everyone claims it is and the character development could've been improved. I personally loved the story since it told a great adventure. The visuals are one of the best I've seen and the actors are also great. The music is beautiful and fits perfectly into every scene. If you want to watch a visually stunning superhero movie with great music and a well written story, you will probably like this movie. And as I said: I don't know what issue some people here have but the movie is by far not as bad as they claim.",Aquaman
1451,malcslusby,Well at least they tried,3,23 December 2018,"Dear lord - from Amber Heard's terrible acting and wig SO obvious you can actually see the lace front hairline; through to the horrifically overacted EVERYTHING that is Nicole Kidman - this movie is any unmitigated disaster.
Yeah - we get it - Ya read the legend of King Arthur and thought you'd base the whole movie around it complete with jousting, rightful king and all that goes along with it.
Jason Mamoa is actually the very best thing about this - taking on an absolutely abysmal script and somehow still making Aquaman seem cool.
Big budget special effects - so that's kinda cool - hence the two stars - but other than that - this is definitely a kid's movie. They should have employed the writers of Shrek, Toy Story or a docen other movies to write this instead. So overall, casting was an absolute joke; script (like Inception and Batman Begins) tries WAY too hard to be clever and just fails miserably (it's like watching 5 unrelated episodes of ""Aquaman The Series"" back to back.); the badly cast actors all overact their roles and are supported by some terribly poor acting - and WTF happened to Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe's faces?!?!? Did y'all think that would look good? It's like when they colorized movies and posters back in the 1980s - NO!! it does not look realistic.
Next generation of movies people - CGI'ing real actors faces to try and make them look younger......just fail.
This would be a good movie to watch at home with the kids - but save your cinema money for something better",Aquaman
1452,nathanaelhorn,One of the better DCU movies but far from great,1,9 December 2018,"Let me start out by mentioning this movie Was visually stunning, but lacked a lot when it came to good back stories and villain motivation.First of all, the cool looks and lame jokes in the beginning of the movie are way too forcedThere are two villains frog man and the Atlantians that want to destroy the earth dwellers... The motivation of the frog men to kill aquaman is not at all explained and then they give you the simple reason that aquaman declined to save his father ... Let's take a look at why he didn't save him...1. Criminal daught in the act
2. Aquaman first showed mercy after getting blasted by an explosive bullet
3. Decided to let him die after he threw a grenade at aquaman when he was on his way out, then died because the submarine collapsed on himself...Ok, Atlantis people never even tried to negotiate the end of sea pollution or prove their presence to the earth dwellers so their motivation to attack is not at all reasonable since earth dwellers have no idea they are harming an entire civilization of humanoids...Lastly, there are so many inconsistencies and bending of logic that it all feels very forced and set up...It's an entertaining movie with stunning visuals, but it's not a good movie and it lacked an overarching score like the one in the MCU.Oh and what the hell was the Rocky training montage scene where Frog man builds his suit? That was so cringe... To be honest almost all the music in this movie was cringe..
Lastly, what did the FBI agent from ant man do in the DCU? He's even gonna be in the sequel?!",Aquaman
1453,alicekprof,Awfull,1,8 July 2020,"We took three attempts to finish the movie. Awfull. Awful everything. Chinese director took over, and we could cleraly tell that by his style.

We are from China, so I can tell a bad movie when I see one.",Aquaman
1454,shawnman-56268,Surprising,7,26 December 2018,"Aquaman is the brunt of every joke. The character has been constantly ridiculed for being really lame. ""Oh wow, he can talk to fish."" However, ""Aquaman"" 2018 is amazingly surprisingly thrilling! The story is engaging and the characters are fun and interesting. The visuals were also stimulating, what with all of the different fish, the drumming octopus, and the beautiful city of Atlantis, just to name a few.
The jokes often seemed a little out of place however, which throws off the viewer slightly. Jason Moamoa does action and drama much better than he does comedy.
All in all, this was a surprising movie. The acting was good, the story was original-ish and complimented the characters nicely, and the visuals were beautiful. 7/10 only because I can't bring myself to give Aquaman anything higher.",Aquaman

I gave this a 10 because I truly believe this movie had everything. Humour, drama, action and fantasy. The only DC films this competes with are the batman films directed by Christopher Nolan. That is how great this movie is. Again this is coming from a Marvel fan and it is very difficult for me to enjoy dc films but damn this was a great one. I am definitely getting this when it comes out on bluray and it will probably my only dc movie on bluray unless they keep making dc films like this. For anyone who has not seen this yet, definitely make time to watch it. It is a great film.",Aquaman

Nice cinematography, good acting, combined with good CGI. But as a MCU fan just want to say that don't compare with it MCU. Aquaman is good in its own realm so comparing with other universe is waste of time only. I hope DCEU released it earlier than Justice League then we can understand better this character in JL. Overall a good film to watch, you will not feel bore while watching this.",Aquaman
1466,TrackArtist8,Very entertaining first step for future DCEU,7,3 January 2019,"Aquaman is a mix of typical hero films plots and predictable issues, but does it work? Definetly yes. The result of that mix is a very entertaining adventure - superhero movie.Although the movie plot is not precisely deep, it is not necessary. The movie brings what it promises, fun and entertainment, becoming a perfect movie for holidays.It seems that DC has found an anchor in Jason Momoa, who plays an unique an honest character. Also the change to ILM for DC proves to be a good decission, because the movie is visually stunning and the CGI and special effects are incredible.Is this movie a 'redemption' for DCEU? I think not, but it could be a very good first step of a quality increasing path for it. I hope responsibles for DCEU could find in this title inspiration to bring us better and better movies of DC iconic characters.",Aquaman

Nothing original here, not even Nicole Kidman's face. Add to that the stupidest dialogues ever that try to pass as tongue in cheek, a heavy dose of frat humour, an abyssal void of substance supported but uninterrupted grandiose music that tries to make us feel something for the shell of characters and you got a 2:30, yes a 2:30 empty cheap looking CGI mess. If I ever see underwater flowy hair fx and hear another bloop bloop sound that reminds us that they actually are speaking under water (even they know it's stupid because they take time to underline how senseless it is to no other than Aquaman himself) well, I'll start throwing all my garbage directly in the ocean to show my disgust and hopefully choke Aquaman with plastic in the process.",Aquaman

1471,soulsplosion,pretty good,8,2 January 2019,"I didn't like the first trailer so I wasn't expecting much, but it was actually a pretty good movie. It's not anything astounding that'll leave you amazed, but it'll keep you occupied and interested. The visuals are amazing for the most part, but when they try to combine CGI with real-life scenes the difference can be pretty jarring. The acting is great, though I don't think the movie spends much time actually looking at or developing its characters--it focuses on the story, and kind of throws simple character archetypes into it, but the story itself is great enough to cover that. The soundtrack is often amazing but there's this one tune that they kept playing whenever something Significant happened and I started getting sick of it. There was a total of 4 times that characters were chilling when they were suddenly surprised by a fiery explosion. All in all it won't be the greatest movie you've ever seen but I'd definitely recommend it if you have time.",Aquaman

DC has had a rough time keeping their casting on track. However, I think if they can fix that problem alone, they have a franchise that can potentially top Marvel's Avengers or X-Men. Wonder Woman and Aquaman alone could carry DC I think, but with Batman and Superman cast correctly and permanently, and Cyborg and Flash getting established well enough.... this is a team to have no rivals... with an army of potential and unveiled characters and material to boot, there can and will be NO stopping this powerhouse billing.",Aquaman

Sure few cheesy moments and some CGI didn't look that good but it's what I expect out of a superhero film being set under water. All in all, almost everything else in this film worked. I was on the edge of my seat all the way through. This is Jason Mamoa and Amber Heard's real chance to shine together and all the side character's were great as well.

Wonder Woman was the starting point and Aquaman was meant to put them back in the game! Alas, they messed it up with a bad storyline, some random ""OceanMaster"" brother and a wasted Black Manta. There are some good parts in this movie, though. Jason Momoa as Aquaman is a great pick, and he does a great job as the funny beer drinker that enjoys a swim from time to time. The visuals in this movie are breathtaking, and some of the best I've seen in quite some time.

I was surprised to find a surprisly good film about a half human half Antlatian called Arthur, who challenges his half brother to his rightful place as king to stop war against the humans. Director James Wan outdoes himself by creating a great DC film that goes alongside all our favourites such as Batman and Superman. Main actor Jason Momoa does an outstanding performance by really embracing and taking on the tough character of Aquaman. The movie does however stay true it's comic book by not only introducing Arthur's brother King Orm but also introducing Aquamans Nemesis, Manta.

Let's be honest, you don't walk into Aquaman expecting award-winning acting or screenplay. However, the CGI animation in some parts was just so bad it was really off-putting for me. I didn't even know they were capable of such horrible CGI these days. I'm talking about the parts where young Aquaman was learning how to swim, and also when Aquaman was taken prisoner for the first time in that long white room. Also towards the beginning when Nicole Kidman was fighting those people in the living room. I mean, those parts looked like they were taken from a Playstation game from 20 years ago.",Aquaman

3. I had no desire to see this movie.From what I understand, if you do know the comics, you may as well stop reading this review cause you're going to hate it. I respect that.Nonetheless, I watched it and I had to express the fact that it was pretty damn okay. The acting was pretty good, the story was coherent (for the most part), and it kept me entertained.Will I watch it again? Hell no. Does it rip off countless other films? Oh yeah. Are some of the battle sequences just computer animators getting paychecks while the audience has a seizure? Absolutely.Still, it was aight. Check it out. It was as good as Wonder Woman probably.

Just like anything he stars in Jason Momoa really shines and is a perfect lead, while this is a story that has been seen before I believe the things that separate it from the rest are the villains of Patrick Wilson's 'Ocean Master' & Yahya Abdul-mateen II's 'Black Manta' which have a compelling depth of character. The interesting thing is that I feel like there are scenes that standout with great cinematography & the tone that I expected James Wan to bring with him and then there's other scenes that I believe the studio stepped in a bit more. Either way the film completed its goal in my book, I love to rewatch it, and I am very excited for the second one which I believe can be even better than this one.",Aquaman

1494,kitellu,Visually Impressive and Stunning....,7,15 December 2018,"I am not really much of a fan of comic book movies, apart from the Dark Knight trilogy by Christopher Nolan, but I really enjoyed watching Aquaman for what it is. It is not the best movie ever made but it is very entertaining and I never got bored by the running time also.Kudos to James Wan who created a mesmerizing world for Atlantis. The visuals are really spectacular, some of the best I have ever seen on screen, and you really must watch this movie in a cinema to appreciate the art behind it. As I already said, the direction never feels too slow or boring even thought there is nothing new to the plot. It is effective in it's simplicity and I was entertained throughout the whole movie. The performances by the actors are good especially by Jason Mamoa who portrays Aquaman effectively.My only minor issue with this movie is the script which I found a bit weak and cheesy. Although I do not mind some humor, in certain scenes I felt that they went a bit over the top with some dialogue and it was distracting for my liking.All in all, this is a very entertaining movie with really impeccable visuals and great action sequences. It is the perfect movie for Christmas as many generations of movie goers will surely enjoy!",Aquaman

WW is also something special, but it left us with not to satisfying with its main villain. BVS is perfect, but only for its ultimate edition. While Aquaman proved to be a solid part of DCEU with its specific tones, but with an improved refreshment in the atmosphere and visual cinematography. Yet, its not overflowed to be similar with MCU.

Cinematography, Visuals are in top notch. for 2 hours 23 minutes it was never a boring movie..and MERA ohhh she nailed the audience. personally a great movie to watch more than once.

I got exactly what I expected out of a DC movie - terrible writing (I mean you think I'm supposed to CARE about what happens to an awful person who murders innocent people ""but he killed my dad!!!1!!""), goofy CGI (although very colorful and creative), and laughable dialogue (not in a good way). I just don't understand how DC just can't quite capture the lightning and write a good story. A bad guy who wants to take over the world is just not enough anymore - DC is stuck in 1997 as far as their writing is concerned.But the biggest disappointment is the dude himself. It feels like the writers were like ""ehhh just make something up"" and he ad-libbed half of his dialogue...and it was goofy even in context. I realized...Jason Momoa seems like a great person and I like him, but dude is a mediocre actor.It's a silly movie that doesn't decide whether it's campy ridiculous or serious action, and it loses the game at both.",Aquaman

I am getting irritated however with overpowered characters such as Antlana in the beginning of the film who manages to take on 20 of Atlantis' elite soldiers without so much as a scratch or bruise to show for her victory. This is so typical of the modern feminist age we live in where men struggle for their victories, women appear untouchable.Black Manta looked like something straight out of a Power Rangers movie and the actor who played him was rather bland.The special effects and cast of fantastic creatures was truly a highlight of the film - every few minutes there were new creatures revealed which came into a might clash with each other in the final epic battle of the film. I absolutely loved it!Aurthur's character seemed believable as far as his development went throughout the film save the last line of the film when he said, ""I am Aquaman."" To this I just cringed. He did not need to refer to himself by this name. I thought the film did a great job at improving the character from the comics up until this last stupid line. I wish it was just not there.",Aquaman

2. There may be a CGI artist who also deserves an Oscar for making Nicole Kidman look ... not young, but younger.
3. Jason Momoa is a pretty good actor, and kept up with Patrick Wilson, Charles Beach, and Kidman. Dafoe was obviously the best, and Dolph Lungren was surprisingly good!Special effects were good, but while technically marvelous, the director seemed to have put little thought or effort into making the effects coherent or supportive of the story.And the story, well, that's the real problem. There were half-a-dozen stories crammed into this movie. Maybe a better writing team and director could have pulled it off, but this group of moviemakers wasn't up to the challenge. The audience was silent most of the movie. I was the only one who laughed at any of the jokes, and I laugh at anything. Well, there was one funny joke, but I won't spoil it.Basically, it was pretty lame for 85% of the time, and while Momoa, Kidman, and Dafoe did rally around the reunion story, I don't think anyone cared much about the rest of the plot. Maybe they can pull off a Justice League movie if they hire Joss Whedon or one of the good Marvel directors.",Aquaman

Arthur comes across and not only amazing to look at, but has a sense of humor and a lot of fun to watch. The villains aren't so bad they can't be redeemed, I guess.

Don't get me wrong, deeper more artistic movies are fantastic, but not every movie has to be one of those, some just need to be entertaining and take you on an action packed journey, sell you some escapism and just be fun.
This movie was cheesy, yes, but a good cheese, the Brie cheese of superhero movies. It made me laugh, cry, gasp and loose my freaking mind! Honestly it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in terms of pure entertainment value, I know I keep repeating that but here is no other way to describe it.
Jason mamoa is engaging and fun but also gave some depth, not to mention absolutely stunning. Amber herds Mera was a great character and was an absolute doer and not cliché at all. The love stories weren't forced and one was particularly beautiful. Also, for the DC and comic book nerds like me out there so many fun little Easter eggs to the comics and animated movies so that was just icing on the cake.

Jason Mamoa is one again great as Arthur curry or Aqua man and is joined by a star studded cast with actors such as Willem Dafoe, Nicole kidman, Amber Heard, and Patrick wilson. Where this movie excels Is in definitely int he action scenes. From the beginning to the end I was continuously amazed by these really well shot and choreographed action scenes and really added to my enjoyment of the movie. This movie is also visually stunning especially when we first see Atlantis for the first time. Where this movie does struggle is that their is just way too much going on in the movie, which overall leads to a messy story with no real cohesion , in addition the script at times is not the best as some lines are too cringe.

I knew that visually it would be a joy ride but everything was just awesome to watch and I do not get criticisms made about the octopus playing the drums and the comparisons to Thor.

This film is atrociously bad. I mean, they are spending millions upon millions, for cgi and actors' salaries, but have missed the basics : a decent storyline, with credible dialogue.

It opens up with a decent story about Altlanta who is discovered by a lighthouse keeper and they have a hybrid kid, Aquaman. Story goes from there to when he's older and eh it begins to fall. From the moment he is adult fighting the pirates in the submarine it's just a cliché of every superhero film you've seen before. Black Manta trying to get revenge on Aquaman to avenge his father, princess of Atlantis helps Aquaman overthrow the king,the two fall in love for having a journey together, Aquaman challenges king for throne and loses(wins later), mother turns out to be alive(even thought she was supposed to be dead), and so many many overused lines like ""I've waited for this moment"", and ""They don't need a king, they need something greater, a hero"".

Aquaman among the DC heroes has one of the most promising potential after Wonder Woman but it was a total disappointment. Did I have high expectation for it before watching? Not really. I enjoyed the first 20-30 mins of the movie but the movie quickly took me down the sewer with too many cliches, bad lines, horrible costume designs and dated choice of music.Music - If the musics were used in superheroes movies in the 90s, it's probbaly acceptable. Many scenes make you wonder if they have a music director of some sort in the production team or they just have some intern working on it. Perhaps a real intern would do a better job.Costume design - OMG!!! I laughed at it initially but it later became a pain just to watch another second of those bad designs. If batman still wears the costumes from the 60s, he would look like a clown than a superhero! You can improvise you know!!! Black mata looks like an idiot!!!Dialogues and lines - Cheesy, lame and lack of effort. ""You're not a king. You're a hero!"" Seriously? That's the best line you can think of???",Aquaman

Jason Momoa actually makes Aquaman cool and really grabs the role by the reins, the set pieces are epic and keep getting better through out and it constantly looks amazing seeing all the underwater visuals.

Aquaman has a different tone than other dc movies before it, it is more light hearted as can be told by the brigh colors in the film. The film's color grading is not dark and gloomy like Man of Steel and BvS, the film takes it self less seriously and it benefits from it, Aquaman isn't the type of character to be the lead for a dark and gritty movie. Aquaman does follow a lot of superhero movie stereo types such as losing his first fight with the main villian and having his main weapon destroyed and having to go on a journey to find a better one and then defeat the main villian the second time, but I'd Arthur losing his first battle then winning the second battle is justifiable.

1556,apagogeas,Not very bad but not good either,5,18 December 2018,"The good first, it is visually spectacular, very nice CGI, reminds me of Avatar.
Now, the bad: boring and predictable story, literally no twist or something to keep up your expectations. No real connection among the major characters. It had one-liner fun at some points but that's all about it. Battles at some points were confusing with the camera quick shaky movement.
Overall, I get the impression they spent all the budget for the CGI, no effort at the script at all. Its sort of bad overall as a story - perhaps the fault is the way they presented it.",Aquaman

The Black Panther movie is rated much higher because or that, i mean compare both movies, which one was much more breathtaking? Yet both movies have same rating!This movie was breathtakingly amazing and joy to watch, I watched all Marvel and DC movies up to date, Marvel was ahead by far but this movie returned my faith in DC since Bale's Batman.

I had low expectations and this movie slid right under them with room to spare. Characters are 2 dimensional at best and hit their hero poses ready for their slow-mo close-up to deliver their tacky one liners every time. Fight scenes have the camera swinging around it like they are on a carousel. No one gets more than a boo-boo or an ouchie and get ready for the good old ""You think they're dead?

I was a bit sceptical about the underwater sequences after seeing the same in Justice league. But here they have taken the effects and cinematography to another level.
There a lot of cliches and few forced laughs too.But they don't matter much because the very next scene it's something fresh as the editing is super fast paced.
The supporting cast is also pretty decent with good performances from the entire cast. This is a much needed boost to DCEU and Iam looking forward to the sequel.",Aquaman

1567,Alex_Traveller,"Awesome visual effects, epic underwater battles - incredibly entertaining!",10,22 January 2019,"Aquaman is an amazingly entertaining movie with breathtaking underwater battles and great visual effects. My score of the movie on IMDB is deliberately set to 10 with the hopes to increase the overall rating of the movie. Certainly, the film is not perfect having some plot holes, and some other inconsistencies with the characters. This film focuses only on showing Aquaman origin story combined with amazing battles - and it accomplished its task on a high note. Some of the other reviewers on IMDB mentioned negative aspects such as weak dialogs or rushed character development. I believe these aspects are not important for this kind of film, one of the main goals is to be entertained. And we all are highly entertained! Aquaman is definitely not a character-focused drama, it is instead a fantasy adventure based on the characters from a comic book. So taking this into consideration, just try to have fun and enjoy the movie!",Aquaman

Jason Momoa is fine, but I don't understand why people like him so much. He's just kind of scruffy and blah. Amber heard was just okay, but at least she looked hot as a redhead.

If you completely turn your brain off, it is not hard to enjoy.That having been said, the story is weak and the dialogue is absolutely abysmal. Mamoa is great in this role, but the character was so much better written in Justice League. Both Kidman and Dafoe were just wasted.I suppose that it is completely subjective, but so many of the directorial choices took me out of the movie.What the DC people don't seem to realize is that simply because a movie is based upon a comic doesn't mean that it has to be written to appeal solely to 10 year old boys. Characters are allowed to speak as though they are real people, with real emotions, and who have actually passed high school English.

Visually this might be the most impressive movie I have seen. Storywise it is maybe a tad bit cliché, but luckily it doesn't take itself overly serious and Jason Momoa has a lot of fun playing Aquaman, and gives him a lot of heart as hero and human.Patrick Wilson did a decent job, but wasn't necessarily the best villain ever.

1581,jonathanboyd2006,New direction for DC?,10,4 January 2019,"I really enjoyed this one and I kind of wish I'd have waited to watch it the first time at home in 4K. Am I the only one that feels that theater isn't as good quality anymore? Anyway I don't know much about Aquaman, so that is maybe what furthered my enjoyment. This movie was funny at times, awesome action, and looked amazing. The underwater stuff was so pretty. Aquaman might be a good one for Imax, but nearest one for me is about 45 minutes to an 1 hour away. I am a bit confused as to where the movie falls in the DCU timeline. There are 1 or 2 lines that maybe should have just been thrown out and would have solved that issue. This one feels like it should happen before Justice League, but because of those lines it has to be after. The confusing part is that if this is post Justice League, why does it feel like he has never been to Atlantis before? Black Manta was pretty cool and stay tuned for the post credits scene at the end. He didn't have much in this movie and that's ok because there is already a lot going on. It feels like they are building him up for future things too. Other than the confusing timeline stuff some of the underwater creatures brought Gears of War images to the mind. You will know what I'm talking about when you see it! Please let this be a sign to the powers that be to discontinue the use of Zack Snyder. James Wan did such a great job with a much lesser known character. Just imagine what he or someone other than Snyder could do with Batman.

Good thing is that they tried to put in comedy in the movie, which is nice but a bit stale in my liking.Overall, DC movies as always give actions that we thirst for and, as always, put a movie in a fast pace that make us put an extra effort to not lost in it.",Aquaman

It's like they took bits from our favourite underdog movies - such as the Karate Kid style ending - and pieced them all together. It's patchy and weirdly paced, with parts that have too much pointless detail while other sections rush ahead and ruin the moment or just execute it poorly.

And you need to find your local theater that has the best IMAX system to watch this movie.I watched every single MCU movie within the opening weekend, and I never found such enthusiasm for DC movies, hence why I only watched Aquaman now almost a week later, the last comic book movie that made me feel this good after first time viewing was The Avengers, that was the moment I realized my beloved Marvel characters had finally come to life, Aquaman just gave me the same feelings for DC characters since The Dark Knight.10 years ago I watched Avatar in IMAX 3 times, sure the plotline wasn't anywhere near special, but it was visually groundbreaking, since then I never truly found a movie to be its worthy visual successor, and now, such a movie finally arrived.The third act of Aquaman is beyond anything I have ever seen, the battle scale makes Infinity War looks like playing house (Yes Im kinda salty about it, Endgame better up its game), I don't know what they did to the sound system, at one point I felt like the theater was about to take off, the ground was shaking like a leaf like I was sitting on top of a Dualshock controller, stuff like this reminds me why I love going to the theater so much: it completely immerses me into another world full of imaginations.Im going to watch it again the next Tuesday morning when nobody is in the theater, Ill sneak in some homebrew Latte and enjoy the movie all by myself.",Aquaman

I understand that it's supposed to be underwater and 'futuristic but the use of neon colours makes it look like awful. The CGI shark would not look out of place in a sharknado movie and the super imposed back drops are just garbage. This is particularly evident at the end during the lighthouse keeper and Queen reunion.On a positive note, Aquaman himself is somewhat entertaining but at no point is he either funny, heroic or even slightly cool.

Just like in his previous works, calm scenes are often interrupted with loud noise that introduces action; too often, that it appears repetitive.PLOT: In summary, it's a good adventure that takes enough of its time to deliver an enjoyable story. However, more could have been done on the character development with the time that was put in.CHARACTERS/CASTS: we have a hero that offers very little apart from his seductive charm. He is very quickly on top of things even as his challenges become increasingly difficult. Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard were charming.
The villains are somewhat deplorable. We have an ever grumpy Black Manta whose role is unnecessary; working with a power hungry, warmongering King Orm whose tender looks simply do not match his malevolence.",Aquaman

(Naming the films they spoof will one day be a great drinking game). I wanted so badly for this movie to be fantastic - but other than a few glimpses of what it could have been, it's not even close.The only real way to appropriately describe this movie is like a restaurant wanting to make a signature dish and deciding that because people like burgers, steaks, pasta and pizza, oh and who doesn't love milkshakes; so for their signature dish they decide just to mix all these elements together and throw them in a blender.I really wanted this movie to be the step that DC needed to launch their cinematic universe and properly showcase their catalogue of characters, unfortunately it looks like my DC universe ended with the Dark Knight Rises.",Aquaman

1610,coldfusion9797,Enjoyable Enough,7,21 January 2019,"Full disclosure, the only other DCEU film I have seen is Suicide Squad. I am not emotionally invested in this franchise. I went to see Aquaman because it involves one of my favourite actor/director combos; Patrick Wilson and James Wan. (And the fact that Jason Momoa plays the lead didn't hurt.) Wan's horror films are elevated above the genre because of the character drama and I was hoping that would be the case with Aquaman too. The story is fairly predictable, but that's forgivable, and the characters do have some quirks outside the general tropes for this type of film. Maybe unrealistically, I wanted a little less action and a few more quieter, character driven moments. Patrick Wilson was the standout for me, a nuanced and captivating performance. Temuera Morrison was great too. (The opening sequence telling Tom and Atlanna's story was one of my favorite parts of the film.) The difficulty I had was getting on board with Arthur's journey, not because he wasn't likeable, he was, Jason Momoa does a fine job, it's the fact that Arthur's motivation is weak and selfish at times, and that I kind of agree with Orm. Humanity is destroying the world's oceans, and should be held accountable for it. I also found the final battle scene disturbing if I'm honest. The way the sea creatures were used as weapons with no regard for the fact that they are living beings. It didn't feel like the way a king, or hero, should treat them.

1611,benembry-66286,Worst DCU movie to date,3,12 January 2019,"This was such a letdown. Aquaman was the best part of Justice League, (which is an underrated comic book movie), and I expected this to be comparable to Wonder Woman in terms of quality. I was way off. The dialogue was SO bad. Momoa the only good lines. The writers just quit trying beyond that. Everyone else was very stale and uninteresting. Amber Heard was terrible. I thought Patrick Wilson was good in other stuff I've seen him in but he was bad in this. I can't believe Dafoe and Kidman took these parts after they read the script. This is the worst they've been in years.It was really incoherent in terms of style. It was Game of Thrones for a while. Then it becomes and Indiana Jones movie for the middle third of it. The end is a take on King Arthur set in Avatar world. It was a mess.I'll probably always watch DCU movies in hopes they finally get it right, but so far WB has completely whiffed on putting out a good product.",Aquaman

This is just a fun and a visual master piece. I love the movie for all that offers. I completely ignore what critics say about any movie. The people that actually pay to watch the movies are the opinions that matter. Go and enjoy this amazing fun ride.",Aquaman

Jason's acting is great. The Oceanmaster was great and Black Manta as well. Unfortunately the movie was ruined for me the theater I saw it in with kids had horrible sound, I couldn't hear the music at all. So I'm really bummed as I was so pumped for this movie but the visuals were so stunning.",Aquaman
1614,matildenunemn,Alright,6,21 December 2018,"After being recommended Aquaman, I ended up giving it a shot, even though I really wasn't too excited for it.
It was OK, and there were some underwater scenes which were simply beautiful, so CGI was pretty awesome where sea creatures etc were concerned.
However, I just wasn't feeling the whole sea queen lighthouse keeper romance, it just seemed rather forced. For some reason Nicole Kidman just looked a bit ridiculous, maybe it was the weird looking hair or the cheap-looking outfit.
The dialogue overall wasn't great, even though there were a few good jokes some ""serious"" scenes actually made me laugh. Once again, sometimes it felt pretty forced.
Also didn't see the need to have them kiss at the end, I thought we were over that cliche, it's 2018!
However, Jason Momoa was definitely a good choice for the role, and so was Amber Heard. They did great jobs despite it all. Willem Dafoe was pretty random but awesome as one would expect.Honestly, the fact that I've never really read any Aquaman comics or been interested in the character/Justice League in general probably didn't help. I'm more of a Marvel person and I enjoy the little easter eggs in the movies, whereas here I didn't connect with the characters or the story as much.

There's not really a boring scene of this movie, there are some but it didnt feel like dragging. there's something quite satisfying to see Black Manta on live action movie, but even though its arguably the coolest looking dude in the movie, his story is really shallow. He's just there to kill Aquaman. idk about comic book but it seems like he should've, i dont know, a little bit more important ( i dont know if this is the right word to use or not) to the story. Also there's some kinda romance between Aquaman and Mera that feel forced, like its kind of cringeworthy a little bit at some part. other than those things, its definitely very good movie, the final battle felt huge and amazing. Aquaman is really struggling before he have the trident. definitely recommended, i even think this should have higher rating than WW. its just my humble opinion though.

Then, their Justice League movie sucked, too, which just made me go back to hating anything in the DC Universe again. While my wife and her friends were shopping, a friend and I decided to catch a movie last minute. We decided on Aquaman because it fitted with our schedule. I sat in my chair expecting another failed attempt at a good superhero movie, wishing that this was any Marvel movie other than Ant Man. Was I ever wrong. This movie had it all; great storytelling and the CGI was breathtaking. Acting was very good all around. The movie had so much depth and didn't rely on awkward teenage humor to carry it through heavily emotional scenes.James Wan did an amazing job at directing this movie and I really hope that he gets his hands in more DC flicks.If DCEU can keep up this momentum, I really think that they can find their own in the new era of superhero movies.I have no idea how anyone who enjoys superhero movies could give this less than a 7. Also, as per usual, ignore Rotten Tomatoes and their biast reviews.Do yourself a favor and see this in theatres. The effects are made for the big screen and will leave you absolutely submerged in the underwater Universe. Well done, DCEU!",Aquaman

It has same level of action as avengers infinity war, maybe more. This movie felt really big for a solo film. Visuals and CGI are simply the best I've seen in a while. Perfect use of comedy. They didn't insert a funny scene in between a serious moment. Loved the music. The use of music was very different than other superhero movies. All characters are lovable, even aquaman's dad who didn't had much screentime. James wan gave his horror touch in this movie as well which was awesome. Atlantis is much more than shown in the trailers. 3D effects and camera movement are so good that you'll feel like you're actually in a ship taking a tour of atlantis.

Once I saw the preview I had a little hope, but it looked like a Black Panther ripoff. I went in ready to be disappointed and came out blown away. James Wan did excellent on this film. I never thought I would say I liked an Aquaman film but I did! The acting was great and there were funny moments. The fight scenes were so much more different than I had prevuiously seen in any movie. The visuals were perfect and I was in love. Black Manta proved to be an awesome villain despite looking very funny. Orm or Oceanmaster turned out to be an awesome villain as well. The ending scene is what got me. When Arthur and Orm jumped up on the ship and the slow-mo was used. I actually muttered, ""whoa."" There were surpringly a couple scenes like that. The fight in Italy, when Mera and Arthur dived into the reaf and it gave us the beautiful underwater shot of them getting swarmed by those creatures, I was in awe.

So his origin story is a joke?,4,20 December 2018,"Let me first say this, the cinematography and the lightning are great, many thanks to the director and the cinematopgrapher who created an interesting fantasy world for the audience, but..!Were they trying to make a movie or a 4D game? Mmm, because I didn't quit catch anything AT ALL that has logical meaning or sense of reality!The CGI was so weak if we are talking cinema, I don't think that the CGI crew have ever been to a cinema school and studied how to mix fiction with logic and make real fantasy, lively one! You are gonna imagine the green screen behind them, you are gonna feel you are standing between 4 green walls with the actors. Put that away from your mind, you get a beautiful picture.Acting and who to blame!.. The director of course, the guy has a good cast, and still he can't get them to perform well, Momoa can't even figure out his character's dimensions to get involved, so you find him changing depending on the situation, a new character each scene, not a character to follow; is he a leader to follow? The story should tell you.. story? Mmm...Story and the corruption of screen play writing in DC! Story line is broken, there isn't any actually, it's just a typical clichée kind of story that you can always predict its events, or atleast never get surprised with any of it because you have seen it 1000 of times before!So the plot is weak and everything you already know fron the beginning, and you are waiting for it to either happen or not, nothing new will appear after the first 15 mins! And guess what, the infamous Black Mantis, the cool guy from the trailer, could have been so easily kicked out from the movie and you wouldn't even care, him and all his scenes, but the director wanted to strech the movie!Video editing is so bad, disturbing and not meaningful, repeating some things twice as if they're legendary or something, you feel the editing, and that's why it is so bad!!!Comedy and hell those jokes were not funny! I liked the comedic ironies and actions that occured that were related to the story, but why throw jokes? What grown up superhero does this? Not even spiderman!So Aquaman's origin story is full of jokes, and I will always remember that, it's taking some of Black Panther and some of Thor: Ragnarok and that's a stupid mix!Oh yeah and one last think, people of Atlantis kneel for who ever is king, which should be the big joke but it wasn't, LOL!The movie has a beautiful image, not logical sometimes, it's a perfect popcorn-movie, and perfect for DC fans!",Aquaman

Dont get me wrong the CGI was cool and looked good, there was just too much of it. I liked Black Manta and Ocean Master both. It just seemed like Manta came out of no where and started hunting Aquaman. Mera was awesome in this movie. Her and Arthur were a good team. Knowing James Wan and the Type of Movies he specializes in, i expected to see a horror scene and it didn't disappoint. Im surprised that that scene got past a pg-13 rating.And how Orm knew Manta is still confusing, or maybe i just missed something. The runtime was a bit lengthy, but still. It was either me, the theater or the actual movie, but the underwater scenes were very hard to hear. Willem Dafoe was also cool in this type of movie. I would've liked to see more of Arthur and Mera on land. It seemed like every 5 minutes the wall got blasted in by someone. One of my favorite parts was the final fight scene between Aquaman and Orm.

1633,objectivebroadcast,AQUAMAN - Somewhat MarveLous /T²C² (tonguetocheekcelluloid ),8,9 January 2019,"AQUAMAN - T²C² (tonguetocheekcelluloid )
In this sea of the comic book heroes it's getting tough to do something different. So I guess that crazy idea got abandoned. The lead, Mamoa, delivers his lines fluidly. He perfectly personifies the smarmy, slightly vulnerable, affable, wise cracking, confident, charismatic ... and somehow critically, not arrogant, character. That's hard to do.
Willem, the foe, of immorality spits out evil faster than a Goblin shark. Dolphen Lundgren plays the wise, yet stable voice of reason to the goofy bad Prince (Patrick Wilson) I think Nicole Kidman thought she was in Benjamin Button (wth?)
In terms of plot and story line... it was Marvelous. There was a misunderstood, much more fit, kind, outcast of a prince with great morals who was trying to return to a kingdom left behind by a missing or deceased parent. And it's not like the body building demi-god like, much more charismatic brother character was looking for an almighty hammer. He was looking for a trident. Not even close. They're different shapes. And it's not like the bad power mongering cruel, impossible to like and moreover, easy to hate, sibling of a brother, turned around emotionally and became a good guy. The writers however did great with the thin plot given. They cleverly used hydrology to create some cool water related concepts, such as unique weaponry. There were some interesting original concepts in here that I won't spoil . The CGI was awesome. The only blurring was on the lines of reality. As they would say in Akronym Ohio... IMHO3DIMAX is the only way to see this movie. (ya I know;) It shows up great in this format and really accentuates the production effort",Aquaman
1634,paulmclaren,"Lighter, Better",7,31 December 2018,"As a box office success this entry for DC has almost made as much as Justice League in a week.Aimed at a much younger demographic then the dark Batman V Superman films this movie is light, comedic and sometimes quite corny. What a DC movie should be. Aquaman was my favourite character in DC and he's done justice in this version.However, it works and it is entertaining. A stellar cast including Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson do a great job with the source material. Jason Momoa is solid as the title character but far different to the Aquaman I remember as a kid back in the 80s. Amber Heard plays a pivotal role as the Princess and holds the movie together. Looks a lot like Scarlett Johansson.Directed by James Wan who specialises in horror films the styling of this films was my major concern based on it being mostly underwater but it's done well and after a while you get used to the visual aspects of the movie. Whilst watching I felt aspects of movies like TRON, Guardians of the Galaxy and Flash Gordon!As usual with superhero films the running time at 140 minutes is probably 25 minutes too long.6.9/10Couldn't quite give it 7 but good option at the cinema with the family ( probably not small children).

Also it is not a DC film that is not a 3 hours boring nothingness I would say that is enough to make it likable . All of that don't take away really from the cliche script , the terrible dialogue , the bad performances all over the place and the stinking jokes other than some it is so bad it is funny moments it didn't make me even chuckle .

1646,dereksorensen,Did I just watch a super hero movie or a live action animé?,6,2 June 2019,"Let me start off my simply putting, NO- I did not like this movie. I will get into that later. However, there is some impressive work done in this movie that does deserve credit.The visuals of the whole film are pretty well done. Most of what I am referring to takes place in the under water CGI world. Director James Wan has always liked soft blue's and strong red's in his movies. It is cool to see how that transitioned into an underwater action film. The visual world can SOMEWHAT be compared to the visual world of James Cameron's Avatar.
The action was another crowing jewel in the film. The section of the storyboard which was action did better than any other DCU movie. Everything about it was entertaining and left my attention closely tied to the screen. The fighting choreography was very impressive.
When you combine the amazing visuals with creative action- you really do find something to awe at. If you watch this movie for any reason, watch it for this....and I guess Jason Momoa is a pretty fun actor.Now for why I did not particularly love this move...
Did anybody else feel like they were watching a live action animé? This film had every cliché moment and cheesy line in the book. The whole thing is built much like an animé piece. Corny screen play, corny dialogue between characters, rushed dialogue, rushed story board, and corny movie scores that come on too often and too hard. Not to diss on animé, I just don't think it works well within live action hero movies.
Its tasking for the audience to take any serious moment honestly serious. This film was just written with too many cheese filled lines. It is easy to feel like you are watching a Disney Channel Orignal Movie.
With a cool actor like Jason Momoa, you have the opportunity to have some pretty good comic relief. Though the writers of the film did try to capitalize on this, they failed epically. To make it worse, any funny part of this movie was scored with stupid piano Disney style music.
The movies cheese and corn meter sky-rocketed as the film went down the montage check list. The ""falling in love montage"", the ""training montage"", the ""bad guy gearing up montage"" and enough surprise explosions to make a montage.Over all, I was pretty disappointed with the film.
If you ever find your self just wanting to watch a popcorn action flick, this one isn't too bad. If you ever find yourself wanting to watch a well written and creative film, avoid this one at all costs.",Aquaman

BvS (ultimate edition) is my favorite DC movie. I loved Justice League (ending needed more work), Man of Steel was far too long, but good, and Wonder Woman was indeed phenomenal.Review: C'mon guys, this movie is cheesy, silly, overly flamboyant and utterly forgettable. It's most like watching a high-budget episode of the power rangers. The main villain literally says ""Call me, Black Manta"", and wears an oversized helmet looking like a Power Rangers or old-school Godzilla villian. The dialogue is cringy in many places, the Atlantians are completely shallow, every villian is cheesy (""Call me Ocean Master!""), the plot is disjointed and aloof. This movie sucks. I struggled to get through it and I will not watch it again. It is predictable in every sense.
Oh, and I think we can see that Jason Momoa is a great secondary actor, but definitely cannot lead a feature film.Redeeming points?
i wanted to love this movie just because I love DC much more than Marvel, but I just don't. The good parts are that the CGI is much better than Superman's mustache in Justice League. In fact, the CGI/live action mix for both woman fights are nearly seemless and very enjoyable. The rooftop running sequence was also very well done. The movie is also very colorful (not always a good thing - see Ocean Master's costume).TL;DR
Anything over 7 stars is likely a paid review, or a DC super-fanboy, or a James Wan fanboy. Honest DC fans will have to admit this is a low point. Bring back Zack Snyder.",Aquaman

It's best to be seen in 3D Ultra AVX theater with recliner seat. I've almost given up going to the movie theater for the last few years. I only went because I got some free movie passes. Boy was I floored. It reminded me the magic of going to the movies from years ago. I'm not going to talk about the plot here. It's pretty much in the trailer and if you have not been living under the rock for the most of your life, you've probably know or heard something about the legend of Atlantis. Anyway, go see it now. Support this movie to show Hollywood what kind of movies we want, so they will make more of these kind of movies.",Aquaman
1662,salimpatwa,DC are finally getting it right,9,16 December 2018,"Just watched the Aquaman movie, and a really enjoyed it, not quite the movie I thought it was going to be, but it was a good solid enjoyable flick.
Jason Momoa is really good, tough as nails, and delivers lots of little bits of humour, doesn't take it self to seriously.
Different from wonder women and loads better than justice league.",Aquaman
1663,voz99,Cringeworthy,4,13 December 2018,"The opening scenes, the makup on the father... awful.
The acting of kidnan, consudering she is a oscar winner... awful.
Aquaman, very good comedic timing, i think he played it for fun.Overall, the CGI, was over the top, the evil brityer was lame.
Somehow Australia's film industry certainly know how to create a flop from a certain winner.4:5/10For true super heto fans.",Aquaman
1664,Novizio,Worse than Green Lantern,1,30 January 2019,"Cgi-overcharged, cliche-filled, appallingly-acted, Thor Ragnarok-wannabe, cheesy rom-com. Careful not to turn up the contrast on your screen cause it might melt your eyes off. Percy Jackson on steroids and acid. Pirates of the caribbean 2049. DCEU proves time and again it deserves to die for good and hope for a better planned reboot with someone at the helm with a more clear and organized vision, their own Kevin Feige; because this is just flat out embarrassing. 2 hours wasted that i'll never get back.",Aquaman

But sadly choke full of SJW Dog Whistles.The left political agenda was evident and took you out of the movie quite often.It did leave a bad taste.If it wasn't filled with this it was going to be a nice simple predictable retelling of the same story.But hey we can't just leave movies to be movies.,Aquaman

Seriously it is good!),8,9 January 2019,"Okay, I was like ""Eh!"" or ""Meh!"" before watching this movie because COME ON, we know how bad DC are about the movie adaptation of their amazing comic stories.But... BUT I SWEAR, this will make you feel like ""WHAT THA' FORK!"" as it is really, really, really AMAZING!I mean of course it has those clichés scenes, for example: The actors run and there are pew-pew gun shootings but somehow they never get shot and that kinda' stuff... Yet, it brings all the emotions during the movie and it does it very smartly. Also what we really needed was seeing different kinds of places in super-hero movies. I mean aren't you tired of seeing the characters in New York or that kind of ""popular"" places? Well, I am!So this movie really satisfied me by taking us different parts of the world and making it rain underwater! (I don't even know what I'm saying. It must be because of my happiness.) I really feel thankful for all the crew, everyone who dealt with effects and everything... GOD, it is truly A-MA-ZING!WATCH IT AND ENJOY THE 3D!",Aquaman

However, the feeling I had inside the cinemas was way different and extravagant. For a person who loves swimming and being in water, this movie will be a treat. Special effect, an addon..

Not comic book red head pale skinned Aquaman which after thinking about it made no sense... Especially since the story of Atlantis are not pale skinned gingers. I liked Manta. their fight scene could have been a little longer, but you care more about the brother rivalry. Special effects were also super good.

Aquaman has people riding giant seahorses and sharks and firing lasers. It has a Polynesian man living in Maine, a queen played by Nicole Kidman, a king played by Dolph Lundgren and a prince named Orm played by Patrick Wilson. It's packed with mythology and world building and action scenes and a hunt for a Mystical Thing and stuff going boom. It has both Pitbull and Roy Orbison on the soundtrack. And it has an octopus drum solo and Julie Andrews voicing a sea monster the size of Cthulhu.",Aquaman
1675,jyttrup1,DC Pulls a Marvel!,8,3 January 2019,"My issue with DC movies since Christopher Nolan's Batman Series has been that they've tried too hard to repackage the dramatic seriousness of those films, and have come up short multiple times. With Aquaman, DC has finally done a great job imitating the tried and true recipe for quality Marvel films... not taking itself too seriously.Aquaman isn't supposed to be an overly dramatized superhero. He represents what Batman and Superman don't; a sense of humanity in an otherwise sideways world. With witty humor and a star who you'd be stupid to not want to grab a beer with, Aquaman hits in all the right notes.James Wan brought to life a completely new vibe for DC films. From the masterful cinematography to the outstanding use of vibrant colors to bring to life the deep sea, nothing feels recycled or over the top.If I had any drawback at all, it would be that the film kind of feels like a typical superhero movie that's hard to connect with on a personal level. It didn't do an incredible job of demanding your buy-in and emotional connectivity with the characters, and the final battle takes place in a relatively meaningless location, leaving a lot to be desired here.Overall, the film was brilliantly well done and should quickly become a standard bearer for how DC films of the future should be made!",Aquaman

Zero substance or plot depth. Terribly cliche dialogue. Horrible acting. The 3 stars are merely for the visually rich C.G. That notwithstanding, I just lost 2+ hours of my life.Yet another reminder of just how remedial the general population is.

This was one of the cheesiest movies I have ever seen in my life.The movie should have been PG. I have no idea why it got the PG-13 moniker, must be because of all the OBVIOUSLY computer animated cartoon fight scenes from the movie.

I wasn't really a fan of the character in justice League so I was a little apprehenisve about this film at first by Jason Momoa's portrayal in this completely won me over. Hats off to James Wan and everyone involved. This along with Wonder Woman have really shown that DC movies and characters can be great. I've always been a DC fan, so it's nice to finally have a couple films out there that show just how amazing these characters can be and how amazing the stories surrounding them can be. It's not a matter of choosing between Marvel or DC, both are awesome in their own rights so it's nice to see DC making the movies that the fans and characters deserve.",Aquaman

1684,michaellightner,It doesn't take itself seriously for a second,7,29 December 2020,"It doesn't take itself seriously for a second, and yet it fully commits to - and loves - its characters and the world they inhabit.Loved the stunning design - I was awed, literally awed by the design of the Atlantian society and technology; the worldbuilding and visuals are so distinct and original - which caught me completely off guard, because I didn't expect that in a 200 million studio picture for the masses. When the music score went into full synthesizer mode as ""Aquabro"" and Mera arrive on the collapsed bridge leading to the underwater city, and the screen virtually explodes with the most colorful creatures and underwater vehicles imaginableI had a grin on my face out of pure joy and adoration for this stunning display of artistic vision (the stupid grin stayed on my face for the remainder of the movie). And the film didn't let up. 'Aquaman' never loses steam; there's no weak third act (at least in my opinion); the wondrous discoveries and beautiful, unexpected designs and creatures keep coming until the very end. Although it has a very different tone, I was actually reminded of watching 'LOTR: The Return of the King' for the first time.It's true, 'Aquaman' delivers the typical, clichéd, cheesy superhero tropes in spades, but those generic story beats - some of which were probably demanded by the studio - seem to be all surface; they're not what James Wan (or his characters) are really interested in. It almost seems to me that the director only used those tropes as camouflage to sneak in nods to every film of every genre he ever loved and get really creative with the worldbuilding. His biggest accomplishment, however - the film's greatest strength - is something that only few blockbusters ever achieve: he successfully combines a genuine sense of wonder and awe with complete, unabashed fun.So, to sum up this review: against my expectations, the superhero film I least expected to like managed to do what not a single superhero movie so far had done for me; it filled me with an urge to immediately see it again7 out of 10",Aquaman

It's a beautiful movie ( I mean literally) the cinamatography is fantastic , beautifully shot background score is good and the action scenes are really well made. james wan as always brings something new to the action scenes interesting camera moves and angles, the only flaw is that the emotional aspect is a hit or miss at times and felt a bit rushed, Early scenes does not give an emotional connection to the love of aquaman s parents and the love between aquaman and meera also seems a bit rushed, but those are the minor flaws.jason mamoa is great as aquaman, overall a decent movie and a real fun time in this festive season",Aquaman

If you think it won't get any worse, it constantly does.What I enjoyed with the movie was most of the land scenes, as well as Black Manta.

The only thing worse than the script was the horrendous acting, 90% of the movie is actors with poker face. The story was portrayed in the most naive way possible and the story telling was horrible. Also there were some logical errors but i won't try to bring logic in a superhero movie even though when i say logical, i mean that universe's logic.

It seems rhe movie makers have one goal: show how much CGI they can put in, it's somehow annoying, they'll start a fight out of nowhere and it's just too much.Also the lack of creativity is apparent, for example the star wars like costumes, the evil dude outfit that looks like antman meet predator and the scene where they slide on dirt ""cough cough prince of Persia""But nothing is more annoying in the whole film like the explosions tgat take place every time characters are talking I mean I literally screamed ""come on"" at the screen.Overall, the movie started well but just went downhill in my opinion, the acting is bad and the CGI get on your nerves after awhile, the only positive thing is that now am inspired to read more about Atlantis, sea creatures, and human bad affect on marine life.",Aquaman

My daughter bought us tickets to see Aquaman (she knew I was curious and wanted to see it). From beginning to end, I can say I was completely immersed in the story. Good story, too. Never a dull moment. This movie is really about family. It's about doing the right thing, for the right reasons. Aquaman (Arthur) doesn't really want to get involved with the problems of the world (on land or in the ocean), especially at first. And that's what makes it more interesting. The lead actor does a great job at portraying Aquaman. Mera is fantastic, as is Orm, and also Atlanna. All the cast does a great job in my opinion - they seem to be enjoying themselves, and that shows through the screen. The underwater world is AMAZING. They did a lot of good stuff with the story development there - and I want to know more about it!

What about he stupid uniform!Fail 2: King Orm, knew that Vulko trained Arthur since childhood, but he left him do it for long years, and wanted to surprice Vulko at the end of the movie! was this indian sense?Fail 3: the guards looks so ugly and not compatible with the ocean creatures, its robots! come on!! a little babygirl can do better imagination for such guards and customs, especially the red ray weapon!Fail 4: Arthur , the story hero, caould lift a submarine easily from the deep ocean to the surface, but it was very difficult for him to fight a metal ugly robot / Manta!Fail 5: When King Orm met the green freaking king to convince him to do war on land people, that king came to me King Orm without guards, weapons, and brings his wife and daughter with him, is this an act of a Kings!!Fail 6: If these creatures caould see underwater with supernatural powers, why they have lights in their jets, camps and everywhere!!!Fail 7: what is the purpose of Sharks riding when they can swim faster than it, its like Monkeys riding horses in planet of the apes, pathetic.Finally, remember we have to maintain the oceans cleanliness so the aqua people dont get mad and dround the lands.",Aquaman

Third - why the hell did the villain that Aquaman fought in Sicily look like a villain from the Power rangers ? That all you could come up with with $160-$200 million budget ? I quit there...I was gonna stop watching earlier, but I hoped it would get better, it never did, and the Sicily fight was it for me. Oh and during the underwater fight - what is the point of them throwing each other left and right and scraping each other against the rocks, we already know that does 0 damage to them. It's just horrible, the whole movie, everything about it...

1718,norywong,Great visuals and CGI but would rather want a legendary re-make,7,28 December 2018,"First of all please excuse me for my English. I watched this movie due to the box office ratings and reviews. The cinematography, the visuals and the CGI all that were spectacular. However I would want to see a re-make of Aquaman in a more legendary and nature setting. Where do you have the underwater kingdom under the great ocean of the earth and all those troops and the technology? This sounds ridiculous. Instead of a load of CGI and all those fighting that stuff your brain, I want to see more human elements. It could be like when the aqua kid realized he was different, how he could communicate with the marine life and how he try to fit in or stride a balance between the land and sea then evolve to the need to protect marine life by working with the humans all that. Plus do you need fins and grills to swim like that? I am a grown up and I think this movie is more for the kids. In the middle of the movie, I was like am I watching Guardians of the Galaxy and Star Wars? Come on! I like super hero but please make it more legendary for people to remember this character. That's why the movie Shape of Water is successful because the only CGI is the eyes of the amphibian man thank you.",Aquaman
1719,pethog-27673,"All eye candy, no sense",4,21 July 2020,"I can usually tolerate and sometimes even enjoy modern super hero (Wonder Woman etc.) and action movies (Transformers and the like), but this one was really painful to watch. The premise of the story (several HUGE nations of humans and various kinds of humanoids having Star Wars-like technology, hidden away at the bottom of the ocean, co-existing with present-day human civilisation without them ever having noticed) is just incredibly stupid. The whole plot is rubbish, very predictable and not even worth summarising. The aesthetics of the movie is quite similar to that of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, which some evidently like; personally I think it is too much. In addition to the premise of Atlantis being what it is, there are lots of other elements in the movie that made zero sense. For example, Aquaman and his girlfriend jump out of a flying airplane, because why not, and are unhurt when they reach the ground. Sure, they are super heroes, but this doesn't explain how their clothes survive the fall without any damage. Then in a later scene the same Aquaman is terrified of falling 5 meters from the roof of a house. Sure, makes sense. The Atlantean commandos or whatever that chase Aquaman constantly keep crashing through walls and closed doors, probably because they are as dumb as the creators of this movie and can't figure out how to open a damned door and go through it like a normal person. These are just a few examples, the whole movie is like this. You can try to suspend disbelief, but it gets tiring very fast.
To summarise, if you are a very simple person with low standards and at the intellectual level of a ten-year-old, you might want to watch this film. Also if you are a computer / console gamer who can't wait to play the newest games coming out because of the graphics. If this description fits you, you might enjoy Aquaman, it's actually a rather similar experience. For all others, stay away, it is a really, really awful film, and you will be sorry you wasted your time on it. Plus it's got Amber Heard in it.",Aquaman

I will admit I was hopeful this film might be fun, but then I saw the trailer.... & then I saw the later / longer extended trailer... & one thing I can confirm, if you've seen the last extended trailer, you've seen the film. Jason Mimosa's snarky take and one liners were not born for this character, Amber Heard still can't act & throwing Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson & Willem Defoe into this heap of garbage is frankly disrespectful to their skill set. I'm honestly at a complete loss of how to save DC? I will note I am huge Wonder Woman / DC fan & had great hopes this universe could be salvaged somehow, but honestly, I don't think it's possible anymore.

1724,Farshnoshket,A real review from a grow up,7,21 December 2018,"It does amaze me to see so many reviews that one way or another comes from the studio. They're so easy to spot, but I guess it helps to balance things out from the trolls who love to give good films a one rating.Quick review, the first half was a bit sluggish. With a super hero film who either need a bunch of super heroes which helps to move things around or you need a good number of scene changes to keep the audiences interest. Mortal Engines did a very good of moving from one scene to another, introducing new things into the mix. It did mostly fail on the story. So the first half of Aquaman was a bit weak because it didn't move well. The 2nd half did a much better job moving things around the world and introducing new scenery, above the ground, below the ground and beneath the sea. The visuals were absolutely amazing! I thought the score was a bit weak. Some of the songs were thrown into a scene and then crawled away. Felt a bit off. There were some good laughs along the way and as we find out to along the way the creatures that live beneath the sea are a lot more complicated than we might've believed. I found the scene in Italy to be the best over the seas. I thought the development of Mantra was weak and certain parts of that story were a bit confusing. Overall a very entertaining film, in the end.",Aquaman
1725,nmik2005,A well directed bland movie,6,25 January 2019,"First of all, based on the title what I'd like to praise about the movie is the direction, the VFX and the acting. I thought the direction and the acting waswere really good, and the Visuals were amazing. This is definitely one of the best looking comic book movies. It almost looks like a comic book that came to life.Now that all the positives are done, let me tell you why I didn't like this movie. First of all, I just didn't like the protagonists in the movie : Aquaman & Mera. I thought the actors did a fairly good job but I just couldn't connect with their characters and that just took me out of the movie. Secondly, the non stop barrage of action sequences which would have felt awesome if I had time to pause and take a break after each sequences. It almost felt like the director was putting on one action scene after another to make up for Aquaman and Mera. By the time the movie reached it's climax I was completely exhausted and I couldn't focus much on the the battle with the Ocean master. Thirdly, they could have done a better job with the Ocean master. The actor who plays him is such an amazing actor, and I thought they kind of wasted his potential.Aquaman IMO is not a terrible or a bad movie but just that I didn't find the central characters appealing and that just made the movie mediocre for me.",Aquaman
1726,craigkatzer,Disappointed,3,10 April 2019,"Movieland is saturated by superhero movies. Anymore, I shy away from them because the formula has pretty much been exhausted. I rented this one for a diversion on vacation. My expectations are fairly low these days. I just want an interesting story with good actors which carry the film to the degree that the special effects reinforce them, not carry them. I gave it three stars because it is shiny (not unique shininess though). But the film felt forced and rambling. I took my dog out to pee and didn't miss anything important. It is long and boring. I did think the swirly red scene was interesting visually, but that 30 seconds just seemed to fly bu. If gizmos and big stuff and characters ninja-ing each other work for you then this will be acceptable. If you yearn for semi-original, somewhat cohesive content, you may be disappointed.

I can't wait for it to come out of theaters to buy it and watch over and over. Too many of these comic book movies have long drawn out stories that I spend most my time yelling get to your point!!!! Not this one, it flowed with out boring parts or that feeling of being lost because you haven't read the comics. I could go on and on but the point is...If you are looking for a good movie that sucks you in and you spend 2 hrs forgetting all the craziness that is most of our lives this is it.

this is not a masterpiece. its a above average movie because story was fully predictable, trailer contains most of movie best parts and the main problem for this Movie was that it contains many comic movies Cliches which it should have some of them but not this much.
at all this movie is good entertaining and exciting in the level of black panther or a little lower. its not in a same place as The Avengers series or guardians of the galaxy but as I said befor its a good Movie.",Aquaman

Lots of color pallette as well. I was genuinely surprised this movie didn't got an Oscar nomination for VFX.Octupus on drums being hype man for the fight? Asian Jim? OG Mary Poppins as Krathen? Hell yea!Those wide angel and tracking shots were stunning. This movie in general had some great action sequences with fluid camera shots which were a delight to watch.Score was pretty decent actually (not soundtrack), pretty reminiscent to that of Daft Punk's Tron: LegacyComic accurate costumes (Take that Bryan Singer)Although Black Manta scenes were limited, he was a badass and owned every scene he was in.The 3rd act was simply incredible. One of best 3rd act in comic book movie probably.NegativesSimply one of the worst music choices. Ugh, Pitbull doing Africa by Toto.DCEU really need to fix their poor dialogues and writing. Some of the lines were really cheesy and they tried to cram too many storylines and the plot was predictable.If I had a nickle for every time a conversation got interrupted by an explosion....Orm performance could have been way better without the over the top dialogues.Overall, a really solid family friendly flick with some flaws but offers a great visual experience, action sequences.

The movie is populated by stock characters that are neither likeable nor interesting. However, the movie's biggest failure is its cheesiness. Unfortunately, it isn't the good, funny kind of cheesiness, but the utterly annoying one. Not a scene went by that didn't make me cringe, either because of bad acting, bad writing, or bad directing.

The narrative was disjointed, and the costumes looked ridiculous.It was like it was aimed at the under 10s, or written by one.Jason Momoa is easy on the eye, for sure, but he lacks any of the charisma or panache that might have elevated this movie to watchable levels. Perhaps it was the script. Perhaps it was the odd story. Perhaps they relied too heavily on prior knowledge through reading the comics. There was no believability.

The story is almost non-existent, predictable and filled with cliches. There is no chemistry between Arthur and Meta at all. None.
The film mostly consists of special effects. Maybe it a movie theater this is cool, that could be why it managed to get a 7, but on a TV screen it's too detailed and even chaotic at times.
The fight scenes are not exiting at all and even the jokes don't cause a smile on your face.Why then a 3 not a 1? Jason Momoa looks great.

1783,c_a_simone,Pleasantly Surprised and Very Entertained,8,23 March 2019,"I am not what you would call a DC movie fan, but this one has thoroughly impressed me.
First I will point out what kept me from giving this a full-blown 10: the depth of the characters of the main characters could have dived in deeper. Next, though the action was well done and didn't hinder the flow of story, I wouldn't have mind them skipping a couple of the scenes and allow the story to be carried forward with more dialog/depth.
That said, I knew what I was getting into was going to be a full-blown action, and where that is concerned, it did not disappoint. There were no laggy, over-drawn out sequences, it was interesting visuals and effects. I am ever so grateful I did not have to watch some form of a car chase.
NOW, the good stuff, the creativity of Atlantis, was stupendously beautiful and supreme eye candy. I was ever so delighted, and my eyes feasted on the dazzling colors, coupled with architectural imagery. Bravo!
Nicole Kidman, ability to bring emotional depth, thus was perfectly paired with the fun-loving nature of Jason Momoa, and resulted with injecting a lot of heart into the film.

It's visually impressive and Jason Momoa manages to make it believable. However, that is not enough. The storyline feels mindlessly lightweight with it's cliché violence and predictable romance. In spite of the excellent CGI and the environmental message it tries to convey, it just doesn't resonate enough. It's certainly not as terrible as Tom Cruise's ""Mummy"" (what is?) but it's not that great either. The dialogue is pathetic at times and a lot of the action scenes feel way too long and only made to fill out time and mask a lack of substance.

I laughed at all the wrong things when they were in Italy (look for a quick shot of a guy biting fruit and going cross eyed-it's hilarious).

* Thor
* Thor 2
* Thor: Ragnarok
* Spiderman: homecoming
* Doctor strange
* Ant-Man
.. yet some of the above mentioned MCU movies have better Metacritic score ..
... bias against DC , that's it ..
... Anyway , imo this was the best DC movie , even better than WW tho I didn't like last few minutes of both movies. Too much CGI .
... Aquaman vs Black manta & Meera vs atlantian soldiers scene was the best scene of the movie ..
... Jason Momoa and Amber Heard are BADASS combo
... Better villian than black panther but I loved panther fighting scenes more because those looked more real ... This movie on the other hand is 95 percent CGI and I just hated that fighting sequence against that monster ...
Was going to give 8/10 but Nicole Kidman stole the show at the end .. Her 3-4 scenes are perhaps the best part of the movie .. 1 extra mark for her ..
... Background score was ok-ish but better than justice league but comes no way close to WW and BvS.
Overall , a solid comeback from DC .. 100 times better movie than justice league .. well done DC ..

Aquaman told an excellent story, the pace was perfect and flowed well, it was action packed and yet it had a nice mix of humor and family values. My favorite part of the movie was the reaction of the underwater life at the aquarium when Arthur was threatened, it was heartwarming and showed the great power that he was capable of.

Derivative, and not in a good way. I lost track of all the ripoffs of other movies. I don't mind a nod here and there, but this was ridiculous. I notice other reviewers were impressed with the underwater scenes, which I would describe as Avatar meets Bladerunner, mostly. I personally enjoyed the above-the-water shots much more, and looked forward to them. Not a good sign for an underwater hero movie.
Movies ripped off : Alien(s), Attack of the Clones, Harry Potter, Avatar, The Matrix, Bladerunner, The Perfect Storm. Others, I can't recall.
Things I learned:
Aquaman is a former pro wrestler. Totally unbelievable until he gets his suit later. The original King would of been much better.
Underwater princesses have augmentation. Distracting, even for the star. That doesn't make up for horrible dialogue.
When I forget the main villan is even in the movie, something is wrong.
Dialogue, that is dumb on a level that would make Roadhouse look like Shakespeare.

Seriously, let's leave the non existent plot aside. The editing is so awfully off. The sound design is just ridiculous. In one of the first scenes when the pirates enter the vessel they have a assault rifle firing with a muffled sound but no silencer. The lasers attached to the guns were BUZZING? Have YOU EVER HEARD A LASER POINTER BUZZING? This movie is so incredibly lazy. The visual style were clearly copied from Tron and Avatar. The soundtrack is literally a mix from a low pitched ""sad trombone"" and clone of Daft Punk's award winning Tron Soundtrack done by someone that really hates music.

Stunning visuals carry the box office giant, but parts of the movie fall flat, gasping for air (**SPOILERS**).The character of Black Manta (Mateen) disappointingly draws the short-end of the stick. Having the bravado of Wesley Snipes, Mateen's character felt out of place; an awkward origin storyline with misplaced dialogue and notoriously bad humor.For example, Mateen revealing himself as ""Black Manta"" sounded an awful like ""Black Panther."" Or when Mateen smolders at the camera. It's just bad cheese.On the other hand, there were so many failed opportunities to take jabs at the title ""Ocean Master.""If one thing is clear, Momoa does fit the bill of Aquaman, despite being surrounded by terrible dialogue and rushed CGI; for instance an epic underground water battle that felt like a blur.)Lastly, the soundtrack: it's clear the studio took a page out of Thor Ragnarok: refreshed retro 80's nostalgia.

1839,keiran-38232,"Pretty fun and awesome movie. not quite as good as MoS, BVS or WW but close",9,14 February 2020,"It was fun, with high energy decent storytelling and a fairly strong villian. I got worried about halfway through with the cringy MCU style joke, as the soldier sticks his head into a toilet to breathe water :/ I was worried we might have a descent into a lokiesc (ultronesc, roninesc ect) themed ""comical"" beat em up for the villian after that point but the movie got quickly back on track and delivered a rather emotional finale. I never really had that emotional reaction to the characters at any point though such as when you see ZOD attacking Clarks mother and then he flys in and drags ZOD miles across the land punching him and shouting ""YOU THINK, YOU CAN, THREATEN MY MOTHER!!"" driven to rage at the thought of his mothers murder in the first movie. Or when ZOD forces him to take his life knowing that his final act is to chip away a piece of Clarks soul forever, then watching as clark falls to his knees at the action and shouts in agony, That is some powerful raw emotion that most superhero movies never manage to achieve. Knowing what Ocean Master is capable of i expected a bit more loss in the finale but the fight ending with Aquamans outright victory and Ocean Master acknowledging it was infinitely better than say a banana peel slip or poorly timed out of character sigh into camera like Jim from ""The Office"" after being playfully ragdolled around as you would have seen if disney were in charge of this movie.Overall it wasn't quite as impressive or emotionally deep as Man of Steel, Batman vs Superman or Wonder Woman but still a pleasure to watch and highly recommended. A fantastic addition to the franchise. They do need to be careful as not to fall into that trope of comedy before quality like we see out of the mcu and its slap stick silly child murdering heros and comical robot overlords cracking one liners as they are punched into the distance like wile e coyote falling off a cliff ""well with the benefit of hindsight""..... hiring wheedon for JL was beyond moronic. oh and shooting a speedster to death is a big no no bud xD.",Aquaman

I may be judging hard since I watched Mandalorian in which the effects were amazing.Just the first part with Kidman: man the lighting was bad. It screemed blue screen.

So I can normally accept some shortcuts and just enjoy the universe.",Aquaman

1843,h-93074,A children fairytale with Hollywood effects,6,14 March 2019,"Clearly WB hasn't done a great job planing DCEU's movies and Marvel is better on the big picture, laying out the whole plan for the grand world view. I think maybe this is why lots of people think Aquaman is the best DCEU moive. Personally, I don't think Aquaman is a great movie, definitely far from the best, except the VFX.If you compare Aquaman with BVS or Watchmen, you'll find that this story is like a children's fairytale. It has no reflection on our reality. It just tells a hero becomes the hero, defeats the villain and finds the love one. It has no ""soul"".Of course the VFX is epic. But we already have an Avatar. What we need now is a great story, not over-productions.",Aquaman

Must give 10/10",Aquaman
1848,johanshieh,"10/10 visually, 7/10 narrative",8,19 December 2018,"An entertaining movie with amazing visual effects, epic shots, and fight scenes. But the story is really fast paced, it pretty feels like what will happened if we combine all Hobbits movies into one.
It follows a compacted linear storyline with multiple character origins. I felt pushed through the movie rather than lead through the plot. Dialogue seems rushed just to get to another panorama or fight scenes. Basically ""travel- talk- boom!- fight- travel- talk- boom!- fight"". There are no space between scenes or conversations to take in what happened.
Plus the treasure hunting in the movie is a bit forced, They get to a place, spend minimal time searching, and instantly found the next clue, and repeat.
In comparison to other DCEU movies, fight sequences and visuals are on par or even better, but the writing is just not that good.",Aquaman

Plot that is too horrible to describe, incredibly cliched in every way, and the dialogue- oh, please! Jason Momoa is passable, and mostly if the other actors try their best not to smirk as they deliver their lines. The special effects are good despite being totally unbelievable. But it's a eminently forgettable movie that never needed to get made.",Aquaman
1855,johnsage,Masters of the fish Universe,2,3 January 2019,"I don't get why this film is so popular, It reminded me of a bad 80's fantasy film with okay special effects. A shame because Aquaman was the coolest character in the Justice League, which brings me to my next point, why the hell doesn't the rest of justice league turn up when there's massive sea monsters coming out of the ocean. Where is Superman when war ships are washing up on the coast? This film is a cliched, plot holed mess, with some terrible performance's. Avoid!!",Aquaman

Firstly after the disappointment that was Justice League (that I still enjoyed considering it's flaws) I was super hyped up for this. This was my most hyped movie for year because of director James Wan. That's the only reason I was even remotely looking forward to it.Then all the great marketing came out that I rewatched multiple times because the trailers were so good and didn't spoil anything.This film was absolutely breathtaking and I put it up there with Christopher Nolan's the dark knight",Aquaman

Dialogue clunky, the underwater effect on everyone's face was off-putting, and laser sharks... Best bits were Jason Momoa in a bar. He's got good comedy acting chops.

Are they referring to the chunky physique of the main actor? He sure could lose a few stones. I am also not sure why they imagined a wise and just character has to be ""urban"" and rude and crude. Part of my problem is that I have read the Aquaman comics and liked them. Compare those with this rubbish. This guy is getting ready to go underwater and fight and he takes off his shirt and trains on a sandy beach. His trainer on the beach? Some guy who lives underwater!? Just silly.",Aquaman

1861,peypsk,Just give all dc rights over to marvel,2,25 January 2019,"What a waste of great actors. Marvel have a knack for bringing humour, action, great visuals and good story lines into their movies. Why can't dc comics ? Just seem to churn out garbage every time. Watched it until I seen people riding seahorses , switched off and continued watching the punisher series ! Absolutely horrendous. Dc movies are the Nintendo switch of the genre and marvel are Xbox one x. Both good at what they do but marvel are for grown ups and dc for children !",Aquaman
1862,alljesus88,Up there at least to Wonder Woman's level,9,26 December 2018,"I thought it was entertaining and had an interesting plot. The visual effects were amazing. I kept thinking, oh my gosh, how much did that one shot cost? But for being a mostly CGI movie, it worked, and it made me think a live action version of The Little Mermaid may be possible after all. And the action sequences actually held my interest! What I think a lot of people will not like about this movie is that it had more of a comic book-y feeling than the others, but that's probably why I liked it! With that being said, it meant that the costumes were laughably over-the-top. I would say the weakest aspect of the movie is the acting, which is pretty sub par, especially from the 2 leads and Aquaman's teenage self (that acting was cringe-worthy!) Overall, between this film and Wonder Woman, I think DC may have a chance of catching up to Marvel!",Aquaman
1863,formationlc,A feast for the eyes... but an indigestion for the mind,4,6 January 2019,"With everything I had heard and previews I had seen of this movie beforehand, I was expecting something that was truly worth my time. But in the first thirty minutes, I knew this was to be a huge disappointment. As some reviewers explained before, the acting is soo cheesy and cocky that it takes away all the interest. Except from okay performances from Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren (yes sadly...if Dolph is among the good performers of this movie, try to imagine the rest!) and a so-so presence from Jason Momoa the rest of the acting is really, really lame. Lines are delivered with a visibly forced attitude, body language is not congruent and exaggerated poses and looks that last too long made me want to stop watching. Even Nicole Kidman is not up to the task here or is playing way below her conventional high standards which made her such a famous and sought after actress. Amber Heard probably gives one of the worst perfomances I've seen on screen after Kristen Stewart in Twilight and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is for sure not helping either.This being said, the movie is visually amazing even if many computerized graphics are way too obvious . But since when can a movie be qualified as excellent or get such high ratings simply based on this? If the visual cannot be supported with strong and believable acting, it is simply like a beautiful postcard with nothing written on it, so it becomes meaningless. And that is what this movie is for me.",Aquaman
1864,hawkerjacob,It's a (kind of) better DC film,6,9 March 2019,"This is another attempt for DC to rise and shine. It sort of rises, but doesn't go far enough to keep DC afloat, no pun intended. It has a lot of flash and flare, but it doesn't have the strongest story, and the CGI is still very offputting like every other DC movie from Man of Steel and onward. I like Jason Mamoa, I kind of like Amber Heard, but that's about it. The humor is actually kind of good, but again doesn't keep the movie on its feet. It's a fun-ish experience to see once, but once is definitely enough.",Aquaman

We attended a V-Max (big screen) cinema and there was no 3D even though the trailers said it was?!?

1867,thomasrakewell,Cheesy dude-bro humour and a boring plot,4,13 January 2019,"I thought after Wonder Woman, which was fantastic, these DC films had turned a corner. But no. Aquaman, for any good points it has, is legit a bad film. I spent most of it hoping it would be over soon. It's all endless, over-long CGI and boring, protracted dialogue. Literally everything a character says is either dull, tedious, flat exposition or some cheesy, CHEESY joke. The script is terrible and the plot is meaningless and the whole thing looks like it's straight out of 1994. The costumes deserve a particular mention because they look exactly like a 1990s TV sci-fi show. Some of the costumes, notably Nicole Kidman's, got a laugh in the cinema I was in. And I don't think that was intentional. The only saving grace for me is Jason Momoa. He seems likeable and made the best of some genuinely bad lines. He looks the part too. And I suppose it is MARGINALLY better than Justice League, though not by much.Personally, if I'd known what it's like I wouldn't have gone to see it. I seriously considered leaving the cinema halfway (which I've never done) out of boredom. There's plenty of other stuff at the cinema right now so save your time for those better films instead.",Aquaman

After the movie my wife was in love with Aquaman and my son who was skeptic before the movie was amazed and enjoyed the film. There are many haters out there that want DC Extended Universe to fail. I just have an answer to them: Keep hatting guys, but DC Extended Universe is getting better and better. Just stop hatting and enjoy the movies. Don't read the crap everyone writes, go see the movie and have your own opinion. watch the movie and enjoy it as I and my family did.",Aquaman
1869,averyoda,One of the Funniest Movies of the Year,3,28 December 2018,"Aquaman is a bad movie. Let's get that straight. From the costuming, to the score (except Sigur Ros, I love me some Sigur Ros), to the plot, to the acting it's all pretty awful. Jason Momoa shows no emotion throughout the entire film. I would, however, HIGHLY recommend to everyone that they see Aquaman as soon as possible. It is unintentionally comedic genius. From Aquaman literally murdering a hiding cowering henchmen to challenging the BBEG to a fair fight in front of a live audience, then proceeding to get his *** kicked and run away from the duel after cheating and tagteaming the villain before he had the chance to win, Aquaman ends up feeling more like a villain himself than a hero. It doesn't help of course that the villain's main motivation to attack the human world is that THEY ATTACKED HIM FIRST. The villain's not even a villain. Also, this movie is oddly fascist. Like, the whole time the script makes sure that you know that only the blood elite have the ability to rule, and that's not challenged by Aquaman, that stays the status quo the entire movie. Not to mention the INCREDIBLE amount of plot holes and inconsistencies and OMG the costumes. Seriously, if you are into so-bad-it's-good films, give this one a watch, you won't be disappointed.",Aquaman
1870,bkleemeier-24647,Heavily surprised!,8,20 December 2018,"I have to say, this movie thoroughly surprised me. Considering it is a DC film, I was not expecting much. James Wan does an incredible job with this film! The action sequences are phenomenal. The dialogue is good enough and this film does a great job of staying in its element. What I mean by this is that it mostly focuses on Aquaman alone and doesn't have too many subplots. Is it enough to save the DC universe? Probably not. But as a stand alone film, it is highly entertaining. If you are on the verge of seeing this film, do yourself a favor and give it a chance.",Aquaman

Example: when Aquaman's Dad got revived and he spits out CGI Water. To use this technology this way ruins the mood and ruins the movie for me.

-- special commando guy scared behind a door after fighting a submarine full of russians successfully (thats just stupid)
-- the 40mm grenade explodes in a enclosed environment and the two bad black guys are just fine its like not a chance in hell that happens
-- throwing half a torpedo on the ground and nothing happensThere have been many other mistakes in just a few minutes but i tried to keep a my observation count at 3 , and all this mistakes takes you out of the movie as there is to much fantasy in the movie and any law of physics are just nonexistent .
A good movie will anchor it self to a type of reality but here they decided to go with fantasy and i understand its a superhero movie but superhero or not there are things that just do not work.",Aquaman

Mimicking scene from fifth element and even at one point it felt like I was watching Power-Rangers.
Some liked this i guess, but it came across to me desperate to impress, more cringe then classy in its cheesy oneliners and just over complicated.

Sorry,its copyright still belongs to Sony instead of Disney. D wanna characters related to Spider-man back to complete MCU,probably it's the one that ordered critics to make terrible comments on Venom so it could find a good and proper reason to take that back.

Be sure to watch this amazing movie in the cinemas. To sum up it is a worth watching movie with epic cinematography. Every frame feels like a painting worth sitting in. Must see movie.

Wowwwww Aquaman was amazinggg. For a movie that's 60% underwater and 90% ""about life"" underwater, they did an amazing job creating a coming-to-light story for Aquaman and the depths of the other 70% of Earth. Highly mythical with echoes of Lord of the Rings (Game of Thrones?) and Polynesian culture, DC's Aquaman was an action-packed, breathtaking movie you have to see. You actually forget you're watching a superhero movie for a moment.
I admit I intially had doubts about the actor, but now I think he fits the role well for a modern version of Aquman: a brute persona with an amazing costume that's improved from the original. Plus, it's good to see an ethnic minority as a strong protagonist in 2018. I love you DC",Aquaman

1896,SahilSehdev1997,"If nothing else, at least watch it for the action! And performances!",10,11 January 2019,"Aquaman is such a blast from start to finish, and an epic ride that feels like its on the same level of ambition and scale as 'Avatar'. I am so happy that James Wan got to direct this film, because if you've seen Furious 7 where the action sequences in that film were extremely well-shot and impressive, you won't be disappointed by the fight scenes here.
Yes, the CGI is impressive, especially towards the end of the film. But I feel that special praise should be given to the in-camera fight scenes i.e. the hand-to-hand combat sequences that involved very minimal to no CGI. This is some of the best action in the DC Universe, on par with Zack Snyder's Batman fight and Patty Jenkins' No Man Land sequence.Jason Momoa is absolutely fantastic and is a lot reserved and sincere in his performance, contrary to his real-life persona where he's always wacky and energetic and a bit crazy. But here he's fantastic. Patrick Wilson is also great as the villain, Ocean Master and he has a very thrilling and menacing presence in a lot of the film's scenes. Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard were amazing as well in their performances, as well as Dolph Lundgren, for heaven's sake! He's not in it much, but he gave a surprisingly good performance. And the same can be said for Willem Dafoe who, ever since 'Spiderman' I've been a big fan of him as an actor.This feels like an epic fantasy picture and should definitely not be missed.

1900,sfrostman,Refreshing Nuance,8,30 December 2018,"I've been a fan of Jason Momoa since his days as Ronon Dex on Stargate Atlantis. He has come a long way from those days.After the DC disappointment that was Batman vs Superman this was refreshing! Momoa has made Aquaman his own. I enjoyed all the chemistry between the actors. Momoa especially used his signature humor to add that extra charm to Arthur Curry. I was blown away by performance of Patrick Wilson as Orm Marius. Patrick I've always found to have a great range as a performer.The movie from beginning to end had great flow. I walked in with no expectations I found the movie to have excellent direction from James Wan right down to the music by Rupert Gregson- Williams. Your in for a real treat with this movie.As far as flaws go it had some slow points that are to be expected. However the character building was quite excellent. I even really enjoyed a lot of the supporting characters as well. The film had a nuance a lot of super hero movies seem to lack.If DC keeps to this kind of quality I look forward to many more great films. Hopefully they can translate this into a new Batman and Superman as far as I'm concerned those movies were garbage. As fans we deserve better films, like Aquaman!",Aquaman
1901,pra-14072,More of a *Watershed*man,5,27 December 2018,"Torn between two worlds, between two styles, between two plots. Aquaman is more soggy than a *Pizza in a salad bowl*. The Screen and the sound were beyond the capability of my senses. The ammo is the movies were more like *Nerfguns*. The color of the costumes seems inspired from *TANGLED* and *FROZEN*. The tongue in cheek we get to see in Marvel is being tried half heartedly, that it belongs nowhere.",Aquaman
1902,theeroos,clichés,3,29 December 2018,"Despite the fact that I am a big Momoa fan and I loved to see hem play aquaman, I think this movie doesn't have one original angle. It is a non creative mix of elements we already know from other movies like Temple of Doom, Da Vinci Code, Superman. The 'ironic' jokes are funny neither intelligent, a missed chance. There are some fantastic effects, so it is worth the long sit, but over all I expected a more intelligent movie.",Aquaman
1903,craigperry-57455,Half Decent Directing,5,4 January 2019,"Okay, so I've JUST watched this film.James Wan directed this well. The scenes where just the characters are fighting are wonderful, but the rest is OK.The writing is poor, and the characters are quite boring. However, this is one of the better DC films after Wonder Woman and Justice League.I'd watch this if you're invested in DC or if you're a fan. But, if you aren't, don't worry about it.Now, the story is very cliché. Black Manta is very under used and boring. Also, the love hint toward Arthur and Mara is awkward and rushed -- it feels like Wan wanted to get through this films and go straight into the fights.The music is very weird and out of place.",Aquaman

A few cheesy moments, but it's a superhero movie...those are kind of expected. Was disappointed they changed his eye color though, as it was ice blue in the Justice League. A storyline based on more Icelandic culture would've been interesting.
I did like that he was down to earth (no pun intended).",Aquaman
1906,anbarimasoud,How was it?,2,8 March 2019,"I watched #aquaman the other day & it shocked me; so I watched it again yesterday to make sure it was a #bad movie & not just in my head or because of my mood. It was bad, really.
Throwing in a beautiful girl & a couple of cheap jokes does not make for a good film. No matter how hard the crew tries or how good a job does the CGI team, they don't compensate for a miserable #screenplay. Take this dialogue for example: -aquaman: ""how did you find me?"" -black manta: ""your lady friend has people who like to keep tabs on her."" Are you serious? The infamous fearsome pirate gives away such advantage just like that?! When the #villain is dumbed down, the #protagonist gets dumbed down as well. It was a great opportunity to make #Mira look smart, but the #writers were not clever enough to seize it. And this dumb person can take apart a ""prototype"" Atlantian weapon & turn it into a helmet. That very much sums up the consistency in the story.
And if the goal was to surprise the audience by revealing that his mother, the queen of Atlanta, was alive & struggling all these years, you shouldn't have mentioned her being ""sacrificed"" three times prior to her reappearance.
Additionally, whoever said the gaps in the story could be filled with #music, is gravely mistaken. The music is so loud & varied that it sometimes over-shadows even the actors & actresses performance.
Finally, the worst issue, what made me see red, is the callous use of the #Ocean'sPollution issue. The makers of this flawed film have had the audacity to take advantage of such dire problem of our time just to make more money. They have cheapened the serious concerns regarding this phenomenon.
It is better to make no film at all, than to make a wretched one based on beloved characters. The sooner you learn this, the less credibility & profits you loose. Think of all the resources wasted in the process.",Aquaman
1907,captainkotaku,Less would have been more,3,30 June 2019,"Easily the most likeable and relatable character in the DCU, Aquaman seemed like a sure bet as a great movie and origin story. He stole the show in Justice League, so I was so excited at the chance for his character to be given the justice of an entire movie.
That lasted about 20 mins.
That plot for this movie is about as watertight as a pasta strainer, despite the generous liberties we take with regards to plausibility in superhero movies. From the distracting and unnecessary ""underwater"" vocal effects to the complete and utter assault on your senses due to the visual overkill with the final big battle, this movie quickly became a gigantic parody of itself. The plot ""twists"" of the creature protecting the trident and ending up being ridden by Aquaman into the final battle and his mother still being alive were things even my young children called out way before it happened.
All in all, this was just a jumbled, forgetable and garbled mess, yet somehow it filled seats. I'm still looking forward to the sequel though.",Aquaman

1913,wertyce,"Generic, embarrassingly bad jokes, cliche but in the end still very entertaining movie",7,5 February 2020,"Aquaman has all the generic features of films of its type. It has fully predictable plot, full of cliches and bad jokes that don't fit in. Acting is also situationally awkward and many things feel so forced that it is already cringey. However, soundtrack is good, visual image of the film is great and action flows at so high speed that your focus is granted and you keep watching the film. Good sounds with astonishing graphics are what make this film good to watch. Undersea world looks stunning and there are a lots of details. You always find some new cool details from the undersea world.5/10 plot and dialogue
9/10 music and undersea world graphics

I felt like my eyes were being assaulted the entire time with the over exposed and over saturated colors.On top of that most of the acting falls forced and just the worst soundtrack... Just... What?!

1921,wildkas-83554,Two words......AMBER HEARD!,5,21 August 2020,"To start things off I really LOVE DC (I despise new marvel films) and I really enjoyed going to the theaters and seeing the fill with my dad, we made a great memory. I love Jason Manoa as Aquaman! He is kick-butt awesome and my favorite Aquaman so far, much better than that early Aquaman who was clean shaven and wore spandex. I much prefer Manoa's fresh take on the character. I also really like William Defoe in the film as well, I loved him as the Green Goblin in the Sam Rami Spiderman films and I think superhero films really suit him. Now lets get to the part I ABSOLUTELY HATE WITH EVERY MEANING OF THE WORD!! AMBER FREAKING HEARD!!!!! I really really hate her, not only did I hate her in the film but I hate her as a person, just search her name and you'll see why. I love Johnny Depp VERY much. Not so long ago in my life I went through a very rough time, pretty much everything and anything I had interest in someone was taking it away for one reason or another. I was told what I could like and not like, and if my folks found out that I liked something they deemed ""bad"" I would be severely punished. They even told me I could not be my own person, so for a while I didn't know who I was. One day I happened upon POTC and I LOVED it, finally I had something just for me! Soon I found other Johnny Depp films and Tim Burton films and grew quite an affection for them. They made me feel good about my self and taught me that its good to be different and its good to be your own person. Yes my folks found out about it a little bit and yes I was punished severely (but that's a story for another day). After I found Johnny I didn't feel like an outcast anymore, I finally found my place. Of course lots of people make fun of me for loving Johnny and people make fun of him and say mean things about him to me to make me feel bad. It dose hurt me when ever people say or do hurtful things to people I love. So when I heard about what Amber Heard did to Johnny I was LIVID!!! She is probably one of the only people I have ever felt true hatred for! I can't see the character Mera anymore, now I can only see the vile hell spawn who viciously hurt an innocent man who I deeply care for. She is wicked creature who I hope gets what she deserves!",Aquaman

I held off on watching ""Aquaman"" for a few years...a couple of friends told me it was great but a whisper in my mind cautioned me to stay away. I should have listened to my brain. The computer-generated special effects are so prevalent and overwhelming that you feel like you're watching a combo animated movie/video game...an underwater ""Transformers"" mess. I really wanted to like Jason Mamoa as Arthur but the 'surfer dude' dialogue he spews is just too childish and idiotic for me to tolerate. If a worthless effort like this can make over $300 million at the domestic box office, we're all doomed to suffer through dozens and dozens of similar big-budget immature spectacles in the future...",Aquaman

1932,jesse-jmart,GREAT MOVIE!,9,16 December 2018,"DC Films comes in with a tidal wave sized splash with Aquaman! Things are still rocky in terms of the DCEU, however Marvel still has competition for solo outings and Aquaman is that strong contender that was needed.James Wan takes the metaphorical throne for this one and this movie has his finger prints all over it. I am such a fan of his work. The movie's story played out so well, and the camera shots from the way the angles are used, to the panning around action scenes, when they choose to spiral around or stay steady. The CGI, I might add, is amazing. There is no mountain of mustache mayhem to be found here. The colors are so vibrant and unique but blend together to create truly magical scenery.This movie makes quick mention of Arthur's involvement in Justice League, but is barely attached to the previous batch of DC Films. We are treated to the origin of Aquaman via short flashback moments that tie in with the present day plot that give you a deep connection to our underwater hero. It's very similar to the first season of CW's Arrow, but only in the sense of two stories intertwining to support the overall story-arch. But Aquaman doesn't keep going back to the past for the entire duration of the film.This movie has action every where you look but also tells a great, impactful tale of a loner more or less needing convincing to go from rags to riches in order to save not only Atlantis, but Earth from Arthur's younger brother, King Orm who plans on uniting the kingdoms of the sea, and taking a battle to us surface dwellers for the murders and poisonings of the oceans creatures.Not a single character felt insignificant or out of place and absolutely everything that was done had tremendous purpose. Each actor brought their characters out of the water and into life where you could truly feel connection to everyone. Jason Momoa really turns the charisma on and keeps the wit and charm Aquaman showed off in Justice League and became a completely lovable leading man, and Amber Heard is right up there with him in a constant back and forth battle for leading standout of the film. Both deliver perhaps their own respective performances of their careers, and Heard fully keeps Mera as a strong willed bad ass and Momoa oozes machismo as the film continues on. I could go on for days and describe the outstanding performances of Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman, Dolph Lungren, Willem Dafoe, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II but just trust me, and see for yourselves how great they are.I truly feel that this is a knock out of the ballpark for DC & WB. If you like giant battle scenes, swords (or in this case trident 🔱) fight scenes, or just bad ass combat, this ones for you!",Aquaman
1933,hatrack24,Another Great brought to life comic hero!!,8,27 March 2019,"Honestly, the story/the plot all very well done. Really enjoyed the movie overall, very well done.

A little too Ariel guys!!If you like your comic hero coming to life and escaping reality you will enjoy this movie!!",Aquaman
1934,darthyagi,A Comic Book on a Screen,10,2 January 2019,"It's over-the-top. It's full of superhero movie tropes. Because it's a comic-bookey movie brought to life about one of the most over-the-top superheroes out there. And I'm sure that's exactly what the creators were trying for, which is why it gets a perfect 10.To be clear: Aquaman has been my favorite superhero since I was a teenager. When I heard about this movie, I was both excited and nervous--WB has a bit of a shaky reputation when it comes to DC movies (late '90s Batman, Green Lantern, etc.). So I don't think my worries were unfounded.From the outset, I was sucked in. Visuals are great (lots of CGI, but a lot of things happen underwater. What do you expect?), and acting is solid. Although there are some disagreements with some versions of Arthur Curry's backstory, this brings a good flavor to the canon (curry? Flavor? Pun very much intended).Takeaway points: visuals are great, story is interesting and moves along at a good pace. Editing keeps things feeling natural and acting helps characters come to life. Very high score is very deserved, even if Aquaman isn't your drink of choice.",Aquaman

I would've given it a 10 but it has it's flaws from time to time, but for a DC Movie? it's a 10 for sure!I loved the Visuals, after seeing so many movies with fights on Earth or in Space it feels refreshing (no pun intended) to see a movie underwater, as a big sucker for Atlantis Stories and the idea of a Underwater Civilisation I am glad I got to see it on release date in the UK, the battles and plot were pretty good for a DC movie, again I loved Wonder Women compared to previous DC movies (Excluding the Dark Knight Trilogy as I do not consider that the same as the Cinematic Universe they created after) this is a HUGE upgrade, some people said it was funny like Thor Ragnarok from Marvel, I agree, but my oh my was the Cinematic on point, this is probably the most Marvel while still being DC that I can imagine DC going, and that is great, really hope to see more from the people involved in this Movie, as they did a great job! The villains put the Justice League and Suicide Squad to shame, seriously, I can't believe it, they actually finally got proper villains in a DC MOVIE!As I said, No spoiling the movie, so I am just going to end my review here, GO WATCH IT NOW!",Aquaman

ANYWAY:I cannot believe this has such a high rating? What on earth are people getting from this?
The dialogue was TERRIBLE. The acting was also TERRIBLE. It couldn't pick a genre. Was it a comedy? Was it a soap opera? Was it a policital piece on pollution of the seas? Was it Star Wars? (did they really need all that tech??) Was it Avatar? WHO CAN TELL.It was honestly all over the shop. I felt like each scene had a different director who was just going to completely disregard what everyone else has done before them.Positives: the underwater CGI was magnificent. Like, really beautiful. Jason Mamoa is charming. I'll give him that. The female lead didn't need saving once and didn't spend the entire movie screaming, so that was refreshing!Negatives: literally everything else.At this point, Wonder Woman is carrying the entire DCEU on her shoulders (in my opinion).",Aquaman

The action scene are so hard hitting that you start feeling bad for the characters. The action sequence with Manta and then with the Treachers is one of the best I have seen this year.
3D is done very well so it does not feel unnecessary. The story is not something that will blow your heads off and I was not expecting anything unusual as well.

Some scenes are ridiculous, like Momoa and Amber emerging from the waves to the sound of rap music or Momoa fighting a bunch of Power Rangers monsters in an italian village. On the positive side, all shots ""underwater "" are quite cool to watch and the scenary is beautiful and colorful.

1954,MarioSync,One of the greatest movie in 2018,9,7 January 2019,"Before watching this movie I got impression from netizen that this movie will be sux, like one of the quote ""Even aquaman get a movie"" from deadpool, which I found deadpool 2 is pretty dead.While watching this movie I found its actually a good movie, I like the whole setting, action, story, and dialogs between jason and amber.Just that when jason gets the trident, its anticlimactic, thought there is something more than just whats in the movie, also amber red hair is a bit distracting in some scene, I got into more focus on the hair rather than the acting.",Aquaman

1958,allyoyens,Best DC movie,9,22 December 2018,I am not a comic book fan. I've seen basically all of the comic movies and this is by far the most visually stunning of them all. I liken it to a new Avatar.The story is not life altering but the sheer technical and visual insanity is breathtaking. The movie speaks for itself as to why production was so long.,Aquaman

But, too many clichés, too many scenes that reminded me of other scenes in other movies (it became a game of 'name that movie' with my nephews and I), and a totally predictable plot basically ruined it for me. It was beautiful to look at (especially Jason Momoa) but the totally 80s music that worked in Thor but threw me off here.
So, unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed by this installment",Aquaman

1964,mark-guthrie-460-88353,Very disappointing,4,1 January 2019,"I so wanted this film to be good, because I really like the main actor. Unfortunately it was worse than I thought. Full of pretty CGI with a very weak script.

1965,turalizz,"Good for children who likes fish, maybe??",1,31 January 2019,"IMDB really has to find a system to weed out the fake reviews somehow. Any score above 5/10 is a child or fake.
There's no story, no real conflict just lots of special effects. You might watch a computer game for a hours as well. I suspect 90% of what you see in the movie is CGI.
And what was the conflict again? See dwellers vs. surface people. Good one DC, MCU sucks when it comes to villains, but you even know how to top that!",Aquaman
1966,markr_smith,Visually OK but plot was weak and movie was full of holes,3,16 December 2018,"So yeh, visually I thought the movie wasn't that bad. The problem (for me) was the plot and script.In terms of plot, the movie was dumb. Let's put this into a stripped down summary:At some point in history ('when people thought the world was flat') Atlantis was an all powerful mecca that had advanced technology. However, they overreached and ended up blowing the place up and sinking it below the sea. >>> Ok, sure... I guess.... how did a bunch of people get so much more advance than the rest of the world exactly? But anyway...Then, the King went into exile because he was all upset about what he'd done.. >>> OK, fine.. seems like a pretty poor ruler.But wait, he's a good guy really because he wanted the 'one true king' or something, to one day come and get his trident 'to unite the surface and land people'. Wait... there wasn't any issues with the land people before... why was the king bothered about that? Why didn't he just fix it himself?I digress... So, the king sets up this stupid elaborate treasure hunt. First he, puts a message in a bottle.. why a bottle - do sea people drink out of bottles?... and hid it in a place under the Sahara desert - apparently when you fall under the sand in the sahara desert you end up in a deep cavern THAT HAS SUNLIGHT. Oh, and did I mention that this place is some kind of forge where the trident was made - and it's been there since the Sahara was actually under water... wait... that was around 7 million years ago... really?? So, yeh... then they have to find the message in a bottle in this ancient forge place (that can only be accessed with a drop of water... dumb) and this bottle needs to be placed in the hands of a statue of a roman king to show where the trench is.Then the king wanted the treasure hunter to sail to the Trench (which, can I just point out is an area in the sea filled with big ugly monsters... how has nobody sailed through this place before and been attacked? - how does the world not know about this place that has millions of monsters in it??), go through it to the 'Center of the Earth' (which is apparently some kind of portal into another dimension... why call it the center of the Earth I don't know... it has sunlight) and get past an enormous monster.All of this gets you a shiny golden trident. Did the King not take his medication or something? What's his deal? Surely anyone that found that place was going in to certain death if they weren't Aquaman.I was just sat there laughing at this dumb elaborate treasure hunt the whole time. My wife, on the other hand, was laughing at the jokes (at them, not with them).On top of stupid plot line, there were numerous gaffs.When fighting the dude with the big bug head, Aquaman got blasted pretty badly.. he came out without a mark on him.. fine.. but his clothes shouldn't haveSpeaking of clothes... there were a few iffy random wardrobe changes there when there really shouldn't have been. AND there weren't wardrobe changes when there should have been. Like when they got to the Sahara and flew across it in their outfits, which they then apparently continued to wear all the way to SicilySpeaking of random travel... they went from a whale's mouth in the middle of the ocean to the coast of Africa - got some clothes and apparently chartered a plane across the desert. They try to con us that they had a bag full of sea gold.. but no, no they didn't have that. They literally just escaped from the Ring of Fire battle and swam into a whale. There were no bags of gold involved.Then, how did they get to Sicily?? They had fallen deep underground.. in the middle of the desert. Did they walk to Europe??? Seriously.. DC??I understand it must have been difficult with all the water/land changes, but there were plenty of times hair was swaying around when they were in air pockets.The fish boy whose father got killed... why are you helping the man that killed him? Literally, when Aquaman shows up at the end and is clearly there to kick his stop his brother... why is that little boy helping the bad guy? He killed your father for no reason... right in front of you... stop helping him!!I could go on.. but come on DC. You think you can just make a movie with action and CGI and expect to rival Marvel. Marvel make compelling plots and have people on set that actually check that their movies make a shred of sense. For a movie that cost around $160 mil to make, you would think someone on the set would be like 'But they're underground.. in Africa... how do they get to Sicily? Also, why is there sunlight in here?'....",Aquaman

It is not worth the money.",Aquaman
1977,saikrishnaklu,Aquaman - A billion dollar spectacle,10,10 April 2019,"The fact that DC pulled this movie after Justice League debacle is a dismay to many. In my opinion, they have always made better solo movies compared to marvel at this stage. Mos and BvS may be a critical failure but they were true classics which only an ardent DC lover can understand. Not to disrespect others opinions, but the criticism received by these movies was just unfair and whats more appalling is the common complaint of movie being too dark. These movies are made and meant to be dark which most of the critics berated and lost the whole plot.Aquaman made over a billion dollar and is the DC's highest grossing movie which shattered many other records during its leggy run. The fact that movie was such a huge box office success after JL is a huge relief to the fans and the production house. This success is imperative to DCEU and it's future installments.Coming to the movie, Aquaman has right amalgamation of story, visuals and action sequences. Out of these departments, VFX has been top notch that one would feel wet after coming out of the 3D Imax screens. It is synonymous to Avatar in terms of the graphics and one of the mainstay for the film's success. Furthermore, the trench sequence under the sea is a visual spectacle and major highlight of the movie.Story wise movie is well balanced and predictable at times but overall it is decent story line that sets up perfectly for the sequel which is expected to start soon. The actors played their part well, especially Jason Mamoa charisma is a huge benefactor for the film's wide reach across the globe that later turned into box office numbers.Finally, Aquaman is legitimate movie which can't be juxtaposed to any other superhero movie as there no such similar made till now. Although, the movie won't blow your mind but gives a refreshing feeling with astonishing visuals which can't be missed in theatres.Comic Book Wise - 10/10
Normal Movie - 8/10",Aquaman

The charm of the film is Jason Momoa and he has this gigantic personality and manly voice. But the voice in dubbed version is really no match for this superhero guy. I mean take a look at Marvel franchise! It's not hit due to its graphics and cool action sequences but the dubbed version had that impact over the mind of audience. I strongly suggest to redub the voice of Arthur and everything else is just fine. Scenes and sound is great. It has potential to uplift a new franchise. No more darkness and DC likes colors as well. 👍",Aquaman

There were countless times where I thought to myself ""if you took a still shot of the screen right now, it'd be a beautiful wallpaper or poster."" Though with all the work that went into the visuals, almost none went into the story. The plot was as straight forward as it comes which dragged in a 2.5 hour long movie.

This movie contains Star wars city experience, Avatar type world exploring, Uncharted type of adventure, Final Fantasy type of technology (you got advanced tech and mythical tech), Fast Furious type of scoring and new type of fighting and choreography. The cinematography also is the best point of this movie. Experiencing this movie in IMAX or 3D is a must!The story is kinda simple, since this is an adventure movie. And that's for me is a safe game from Wan, since DCEU needs to be enjoyed by everyone.In the end, its not the best DC Movie, not the worst, not the plain one, not popcorn type one too.

Can't even walk right damn. I've seen a lot of people on here putting the blame on Amber Heard but I actually enjoyed her character and acting. Momoa and her jived well together. Then there's the CGI. I get it. It's an underwater movie. You have to have CGI. But please, just wait. We're not there yet with the technology. It looks so bad and unrealistic.

1991,CaptainFluffyCuddles,Disappointing and cheesy,5,16 December 2018,"I felt like this film had potential. Based on the other films so far you try to keep an open mind because this time it might be different.
Ultimately, the movie gets bogged down in far too much distracting CGI, including Hollywood's penchant for making its stars look younger in flashback segments. Particular CGI and effects that bothered me were the shimmer to make it look like they were underwater and a filter on their voices to make it sound like talking with a mouth full of water.
At times this film felt like a cross between National Treasure and the Sword in the Stone while Jason Momoa's Aquaman stumbles around with a brah attitude.
I thought this film had the potential to break away from the earlier DC movies, be a bit different and set its own bar but it has ended up another longwinded disappointing chapter in the DC franchise.",Aquaman
1992,jawadmohaiuddin,Ps Aquaman was already cool.,6,23 December 2018,"Under water world was great, acting was fine. All the best jokes were in trailers rest of it was cringe. Movie was a drag at times but my main problem is that they misused Black Manta. Either use him properly or don't have him in the movie. Because we spent alot of time in the beginning to see Black Manta's story to only have a half arsed end(but his suit was awesome ). People are saying that Aquaman didn't focus on setting up sequels or anything, all the scenes with Black Manta were shit and a setup. Movie could have been great If you cut Black Manta out, make Ocean Master's intentions true to his cause, the only way to survive is to finish surface dwellers instead of using the fu**ing inside job villian again.
Best fight sequence was the first fight in the light house. It was the best directed sequence of the movie along with Trench dive scene.

There has been a lot of cgi finales in previous DC films and Aquaman does the same, admittedly Atlantis needed to be heavy cgi.

Wonder Women was an above average action movie with casting choices working phenomenally but beyond that it fell short of the competition and personal expectations . Aquaman however, really brings many things I love about movies together well. While in my opinion Wonder Women would be a better action hero like movie than Aquaman, Aquaman does a good job job with this still but also bringing elements the other films, including Wonder Women, simply lacked. It has great and cheesy humor, brings the science fiction to the screen more than just a comic book Esq way but with an expanded hint of mythology and tech, and it takes itself less seriously while still bringing the notion that everything is on the line in a more marvel fashion. Huge fan of Jason Momoa too and thought he did a fantastic job portraying the underrated superhero and Amber Heard took my skepticism that she would just be a tacked on side kick and threw that notion pleasantly out the window too.

I'm not even 20 yet. This film is extremely cheesy and it has some horrendous acting from the teenage version of Arthur Curry and the villain(s) were a bit strange, but oh my god this movie was so damn fun. When was the last time you saw a superhero movie and saw the main character say a one liner looking directly into the camera? Or saw a villain being called (I kid you not) ""Ocean-Master"" wearing this really strange helmet? Or saw an octupus playing the drums, while a trident fight in an underwater coliseum happened? Or saw Willem Dafoe? Because I can't remember the last time I saw a superhero film come out since 2010 that was this strange and cheesy and had Willem Dafoe. It's got the DNA of the og spiderman movies with Tobey Maguire, and I'm so happy it does. While the world seems to be falling apart by the seams, I'm glad a movie like this exists: one that exists for the purpose of fun and doesn't take its crazy premise seriously.

I grew up on comics and Aquaman was never an easy character or world. And thus was never really popular or interesting on his own. Usually coming to life when in a role with another character or big story.
But somehow they managed to pull of something amazing, that actually made me really see the character and world in a way I had never thought.
I can absolutely see how critics and those that are so into dissecting and criticizing movies and forgetting that its movie goers who matter. And if they want escapism and fun then who cares what your checklists and technicalities are.
The visuals are awe dropping and I did not even see it in IMAX. They did an amazing job in creating the whole Ocean World, and easily the best SFX so far in the DC World.
The Black Manta character was a bit off and I im not sold on him, found myself more irritated by him than anything. But I think they were trying to must seed him into the future story lines.
If your put off by the critics, ignore them and go and see it. Apart from the real sticklers you will all love it. Just sit back and prepare to be awed and go on an emotional roller coaster.
Its so not like a conventional Super Hero movie, and that is great as why have the same things over and over. It felt more like a Clash Of The Titans journey with an Avatar world of escapism mixed in.",Aquaman

2015,tyatwood,"It's so bad, it's funny",1,26 January 2019,"Cheesy from start to finish. I would be upset for paying to see it, except it was so bad I actually enjoyed laughing at it.",Aquaman
2016,dsallen-65984,Really good pace and story,10,27 December 2018,The overall movie left you always on the edge of your seat waiting for the next moment. Really smooth transition! A must see. Best DC movie to date,Aquaman
2017,sorana-08544,Justice for Johnny Depp,1,8 November 2020,"As long as Amber Heard is still part of this film, there will be no profit for it! Justice will always be served even if it is just karma.
Amber Heard deserves to be fired from the production of this film and have another actress portray Mera! It is unbelieveable how she could het away with it and live her life as if nothing happened!",Aquaman
2018,starlord-84597,Simply a spectacle!,9,14 December 2018,"The movie introduces the character in a perfect way, the storytelling and transition between scenes are superb, and exactly in style that a superhero movie needs. The main villain, Orm, was written straight from the source material and brought to screen by stellar performance by Patrick Wilson. Orm is that kind of villain, that you want to hate, but you just can't, he is a major badass and you can see that shred of goodness in him. Supporting villain who completely takes the screen in every scene he is in, Black Manta sets the foundation for his very bright future in this franchise, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II truly does justice to the character. Amber Heard does very well as Mera, you can really see that chemistry between her and Momoa, which results in a great relationship on screen. Willem Dafoe makes a surprisingly good Vulko and Dolph Lundgren is playing a typical Dolph Lundgren character, and of course, he does it just right. Nicole Kidman was good, but missed something, the scenes seemed a little bit too much, or other times too little, not that she didn't do a good job, but the rest of the cast did brilliant, so at least to me, she was a little bit underwhelming. Momoa is definitely the man for the role, he plays Aquaman that you wouldn't want to mess with, but also the one who you'd share a drink with. Throughout the film he transforms, and shows us that he can be much more than a tough, beer loving dude. Can't give it a perfect 10 because of some cheesy scenes , which were put just for the sakes of humor, but even those scenes seem to fill the movie in a good way, so you don't feel bored for a single moment. In the end it's a really fun ride, that will take you through an amazing world, with astonishing visuals, and a great story to hear. The movie sets up the stage for the next instalment in a great way, and takes Arthur to a whole new level, which will be interesting to see in next JL movie.",Aquaman

2020,iwasspock,Less than expected,1,16 July 2021,"I didn't expect much , but it was even worse than expected.Though it started ok , it went from bad to worse to extremely laughable.Nothing original about the script . That script must have been a 1 page :
queen escapes , son is born , other son is angry , queen is abducted , son is asked for justice and wins.And the reference to other scenes in movies is over the top :
1. Arthur has to take the trident vs Arthur in Excalibur
2. The fight between the 2 sons vs the endfight in Man of Steel
3. The trench reminded me of the Orcs in LOTR.There were even a few other movies that came about , but can't remember them.The acting was not really that good , even from someone of the likes of Willem Dafoe who generally is pretty alright .Most certainly that bad acting is to blame on the focus on special effects. Those effects are about the sole positive in this movie and for which it gets 1 star. But movies are more than special effects . If you can't relate to a character in terms of ' i feel for him/her ' , then the movie is worthless.And this one is worthless.",Aquaman
2021,lahejarishabh,The best DCEU movie so far!,10,15 December 2018,"Yes I truly mean it. Aquaman is not just the best DCEU film but also the best origin story or solo film in both the Marvel and DCEU universe.I last thoroughly enjoyed myself in a DCEU film when I watched Wonder Woman's ""no man's land"" scene. But in this film one can't seem to pick any specific action sequence that is so brilliantly crafted that it stands out, infact each action sequence is as brilliant as the previous one. The camera movements and lighting effects especially for under water scenes were stupifying i.e. cinematography on the whole was breathtaking.The third act of this DCEU film was a jaw dropping climax. The last time I experienced utter silence was during the third act of Avengers Infinity War. This time the theatre was filled with mind-numbing silence creeping upon every unsuspecting viewer slowly but surely making them move to the edge of their seats due to the burdening weights of anticipation, nervousness and excitement. The film ended with astonishment on people's faces and a huge round of applause.The visual effects were a treat for the eye, mesmerizing and charismatic. Being an aspiring animator myself, I could notice and appreciate the efforts taken in animating the Atlantians, making them float, swim as if they are fishes and not humans and make it all feel realistic. From the mosaic underwater architectures, the finely detailed character costumes, the enchanting visuals, to captivating and horrifying monsters and unforgettable marvelous action sequences, this film offers everything we need and more.Surely it does have the feels of Thor Ragnarok, Star Wars, Avatar and Game of Thrones - All packaged in one. One may think that the story is predictable. But then get ready, for James wann is about to turn your ship sailing event into a voyage far exceeding beyond your expectations.Personally I believe James Wann for the DCEU is propitious and I wish he directs Man of Steel 2 or even more DC films. Aquaman is tenacious, invigorating and a must see film for not only all DC fans but for anyone looking for a good movie for the weekends. Watch it in IMAX 3D on the biggest screen possible and feel the imersive experience of an underwater adventure. In the end it will be worth it.",Aquaman
2022,zaidinajam,The only review that matters!,8,25 December 2018,"Movie is solid 8.5! Good character development. There is a pace to the story and it builts up nicely. For the first time I would say I for one liked both the protagonist and the antagonist (partially bias to patrick wilson). By the end of it, you really are cheering for the Aquaman! His costume is on point. Amber is a total babe and ofcourse the eye candy, her character requires her to be. Surprisingly, Nicole kidman has a small screen time but her character is quite awesome.",Aquaman

2025,momanjra-53141,A really fun watch,7,29 December 2018,"The stand out element of this movie are the special effects... I mean WOW! The visuals are top notch from the underwater kingdoms to the fight scene in Sicily, you won't see better CGI this year.The plot is pretty straightforward, acting is good, with a tinge of emotion put in to add the depth, but all in all this is a great action 'popcorn' movie and one the DCEU should be very proud of.Go and watch it.",Aquaman
2026,bladsgaard,One of the very best superhero movies so far!,9,7 March 2019,"I rarely review movies, but when I do, it is because they made an impression - either for worse or better.
I am happy to say report that this movie was of the latter category.The avalanche of superhero movies being thrown at audiences in recent years has left me somewhat numb and hard to impress - a CGI spectacle alone no longer impresses the way it used to. But applied as it was here - to show us an entire new world in explicit detail - was a feat to take note of. Just wow!Yes, the movie has all the clichés, but it also has humor and charm in spades - and it cares about its story and characters - without taking itself too seriously.Gotta hand it to Jason Momoa - I think he nailed it about as well as Robert Downey/Ironman. Most enjoyable character in a long time. Congratulations!As for the director - I certainly hope James Wan will be back for the sequel (which should be a certainty now that the movie has done appropriately well at the box office). Outstanding job, sir!The only thing that I can point my finger at, would be that the chemistry between Momoa and Heard didn't exactly throw sparks - but was merely adequate.For me this was a GREAT movie - if you are looking for entertainment, look no further...",Aquaman
2027,jcapitals,Everything I was hoping for and some!,9,27 December 2018,"This movie blew me out of the water (no pun intended). After Justice League, I was seriously concerned about the future of the DCEU, especially Aquaman. Jason Momoa's portrayal of the aquatic hero is amazing so it would've been a shame had the movie been bad.Thankfully, my concerns were put to rest. This movie was stunning, enjoyable, and exciting. I was glued to the screen the entire time. I didn't want to blink in case I missed something. James Wan created a masterpiece. Every actor and actress killed it. I would've given this movie a 10 but I thought the plot was a little to predictable.See this movie now!!",Aquaman

2030,blueprintchris,Boring and a total cheesefest.,2,15 February 2019,I enjoy superhero movies but this one is just riddled with cheesy one-liners and forced humour. It feels like the dialogue was written by someone who was paid to write a film they had no passion about. There's a particular scene toward the end which is just so weak and awkward that I just had to laugh at it. The visuals were stunning but that isn't enough for me to have a positive experience of this film. I would not go see this again. Generic and boring.,Aquaman

2032,ancharms,This was a great movie and it's for sure !!!Marvel fans please don't be so loyal and at least be fair,8,13 June 2019,I will say a little but it will describe it all. Over all it was entertaining and no boring momens! I was a bit distracted with the robot type people just felt it was Star Wars in the water . I must give the biggest credit to the director James wan with an amazing job. Fight scenes were not cliche and not too long And overlydone. Great execution to every detail of action scenes and surprise factor. Perfect visuals although the script is a bit cheesy for me. The 2 hour movie never felt so long I was entertained till the end and good flow of movie with the climax very well executed . Some movies don't have climax because everything is in climax and it just is overlydone and felt too much but this movie has a perfect timing . Definitely a Must watch movie !!! and don't believe the negative reviews which are mostly marvel fans . I'm not a marvel or dc loyalist fan . I basically love super hero movies!!! This is one I can say bravo!!!,Aquaman

There's a few cases where some plot choices are a little annoying. Theres a few ""why can't they just do that move they did earlier to fix this problem?!"" moments. Again though, it doesnt heavily disrupt the enjoyment of the movie overall.
Then theres some dialogue contradictions. The good old ""theres no time to waste!"" *proceeds to waste a bunch of time* cases.If you can get over these relatively minor inconveniences, you will absolutely enjoy this movie.

2040,aikenkatie,Very enjoyable overall,7,26 January 2019,"Had no expectations whatsoever coming in to this movie- hadn't even seen a trailer. So I was delightfully surprised to be completely entertained for most of the movie. The underwater CGI was MUCH better than I expected, cinematography was gorgeous and hallelujah for a female lead capable of taking care of herself, kicking a** like the queen she is. Enjoyed most of the main character portrayals too. Momoa was charming and smoldering, Heard was gorgeous and acted her part very well- maybe Willem Defoe was a bit of the odd man out but still did his job like a pro, and everyone else was solid as well. Sure the dialogue was spotty in places and some of the scenes ludicrous, but no worse than many if not most of the superhero movies dominating the screens lately. But for the love of mike, would someone please tell them to quit making these movies so lengthy?? (Although also gotta say that I was surprised how short it actually felt, as opposed to the last marvel offering that I squirmed through most of ...jmo though) Lighten up, don't expect oscar worthy material and enjoy the ride.

2041,SomeOtherBloke,Depictive colours emerged from what was before me.,7,11 December 2018,"A friend of mine persuaded me to watch Aquaman in China. I didn't really want to, to be honest. But I went along, nontheless.3D vibrating seats IMAX stuff.The movie started and I was preparing myself for a Hollywood meh.
Whoa!
This movie gives me the Storm Troopers I've been waiting to see since seeing the first scene in 1977 Star Wars. The scene when the Storm Troopers had burst into the Tantive IV and annihilated the rebels. The Atlantian Commandoes are such as we have been waiting to see, I believe.
This movie also provides awesome technology. In so many ways, surprisingly enough, it filled that hole in my enthusiasm that had resulted from watching Star W...w....wrrsss. I can't even type it. Lol.Anyway, this movie is a massive buzz in a 3D vibrating seat IMAX. Quite frankly, it blew me away here and there. I will have to see it again because all I can remember right now is how much of a buzz it was and how many buzzes I got from this movie. And there were quite a few.
The Black Mamber guy is awesome, behaving exactly how Anakin should have been behaving, as a hard man a quarter of the way through The Phantom Menance, two crazy movies before the Emperor enleashes him. Awesome. I loved that guy.I have no idea about Aquaman, and only recogised Khal Drogo about twentiy minutes into the movie! Lol. I thought the part suited him really well. Him and that red headed Duchessy lady, Mera or some such, engaged me and I was mostly happy watching them banter n' that. When they did things I didn't like, something would happen and they stop that and instead find themselves in a pickle. Which was good.The visual effects range from up ""wow amazing"" and down to weird shark faces, which in a way were still alright once I'd gotted used to them remarkably quickly.I liked the music, funnily enough. It was deep oceany.Platoon and Spidey's ""Elias"" Green Goblin was in it too. His role is kind of interesting. The stuff he did n' that. Some of it was pretty nice to watch.Aquaman's mam was alright too. I liked her. It's nice to see a movie with characters I like. It's a good thing, I think.Who didn't I like? Hmmm... I don't know.Some say it is like Avatar or LOTR. And in a way, bits of it are you know, aggregated together with bits of Tron2, Star Wars, and delivered them very well here.Of course it's not perfect, but these imperfections give it personality. Few complain that the original South Park drawings were not Da Vinci perfect.This film can tug at your heart strings, and not only in a poignant way, if you are so inclined. And that's nice, too.For me, this movie was a good experience in that IMAX place. I walked out happily, after the extra credit bit.
Yeah, watch that after the first credit roll.",Aquaman

Seeing Queen Atlanna laying down unconscious was so emotional!The whole movie kept an consistent flow!The laughter in the movie was not overused like Mcu!

I dont do reviews but I want these precious minites of my life back.Don't get me wrong I love sci-fi fantasy, but this is beyond comprehension.

We have a real superhero that saves people from dying but also let's the villains die, he is like a human and not like Marvel heroes that are portrayed as Disney Princesses all good and rosie.The visuals are amazing. Making a movie under water is very challenging and kudos to Wan and his team for creating a brilliant world underwater with CGI technology.Storyline was decent and despite what many critics said the movie is too long, I could not feel the time pass since the movie is packed with action.The only thing I would change is perhaps adding less elements to the movie.

However, in this standalone origins film this all changed. With a stellar cast including dolph lundgren, Julie Andrews, William Dafoe and many more. It is a visual effects marvel with some of the best battle scenes rivalling Star Wars. You are continually blown away by the effects and the fact none of this was actually filmed underwater. The film equally matches avatar for the effects. The movie is long and over two hours plus the usual extra bit after the main titles so don't miss this. Jason M needs to be careful of not becoming too flippant in movies and be a little more serious. In one scene where he talks to his half brother the first line is quite good and delivering and then he ends it by saying ""but I now know your a dick"" It's not keeping with the rest of the film. Amber is stunning in her various outfits and probably puts down the best acting delivery of her career. I didn't realise just how tall Nicole Kidman is standing taller than Jason! All in all this is fab movie and definitely sets up for a sequel. Marvel now need to look more closely at what DC is doing. Another superman movie with the fab Henry Cahill and DC will have overtaken Marvel. I highly recommend seeing this film. Enjoy",Aquaman

It has some fun action sequences, beautiful cinematography, and two likable main characters. That's about it. Aside from those positives this movie is still very flawed. It has a weak villian that feels to much like Loki from the first Thor film(you know, the movie before he became an interesting character) the romance is incredibly cliched, the plot is all over the place, some of the acting(mostly during the flashbacks) is laughably bad, and most of the creature effects really aren't anything to go crazy over. I would say that the effects are much better than all the other recent DC films, but the compitition between those two is non-existent because the effects in those movies have been awful.
Now don't get me wrong, this movie is a blast, and that's what I want from a superhero movie, but the superhero movies I love give me more than just fun, they give me great characters, great effects, and even some solid stories. Personally, I didn't feel the movie gave me any of that. But hey, that's just my opinion. I would still recommend seeing this in theaters. I definitely have problems with it, but that doesn't mean I dislike it. I had a fun time seeing it and was never bored. That's something for DC I guess.",Aquaman

What a waste of time and money, undoubtedly the worst movie of the year.",Aquaman

The performance by Jason Momoa was a highlight along with an excellent final fight. At times the plot was complete nonsense (how did they get out of the desert, why does the little girl hand Mera the Pinocchio book, etc) the action scenes felt ripped off (the roof chase had been done in many, many better films) and at times I felt I was watching an animated movie due to the amount of CGI.
Underwhelming and very poor, can't believe I payed money to see this.",Aquaman

Then it went back to him as a kid training and then something happens with his trainer bringing up his mother's death and the you figure out she isn't really dead, which is just a cheap twist. My biggest gripe is Aqua-man's brother was trying to get all the sea's kingdoms together but 2/4 he just started killing people. You'd think you'd need those people, and then aqua-man somehow controls the god and then just kills a bunch of people, and then his mother tells them two to stop fighting, which is the best scene in the movie.

Now I like CGI and it can really add to a movie but in this one there was way too much and it was creepy at times. Why they need to CGI a person's face just because they are under water is beyond me, it takes you out of the movie. The fight scenes were sub-par. Why were they riding on dinosaurs with no explanation? Then the trench had Dino's too, why not explain that?! The hype around this movie is undeserved.

The same is true for people voting with a 1/10 against another group.I had a good time at the theater watching Aquaman but I did leave at the end feeling disappointed in many aspects of the film. No need to get into these now because they are described in detail in other reviews.I admit, my first impulse was to rate it a 1/10 to balance-out all the 10/10 reviews but then I realized that I would be doing the same thing as they were - providing an inaccurate review based on things other than the movie quality. So, I am rating Aquaman a 6/10 .

DC needs to do what they are doing now. Make the second tier characters (yes Wonder Woman is part of DC's trinity, but still a far third to Batman and Superman) special and save the big guys, Batman and Superman, for Justice League and team up movies.

2114,larrysez,Hollywood Tripe at Its Worst,3,7 January 2020,"I watched this movie on a flight from Oakland to Kauai, after I'd already watched a really good film (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). I was looking for something light and easy, that I wouldn't mind missing the end of if it lasted longer than the rest of the flight did. I can assure you that I did not mind missing the end of it.The two stars, Jason Momoa and Amber Heard, are pretty good eye candy, as were a couple of the second-stringers, gorgeous Patrick Wilson and still-stunning Nicole Kidman. Some, but definitely not all of the special effects are well done. Otherwise, what a waste of celluloid, or electrons, or whatever movies are made out of these days.Both Momoa and Heard are atrociously one-dimensional actors who can't even pull off the clichéd, tough-guy lines they've been given in any kind of believable cowboys-and-Indians way. They'd be the runts of the litter in any 6th-grade drama class, except for their good looks.The script is so bad that its predictability and the simple-mindedness of the dialogue are actually one of the most fun parts of watching the movie. The plot is full of lazy, dumb shortcuts that break the movie's few asinine rules about Atlantis and sea-people vs. land-people as soon as they've been laid out. E.g., our hero and heroine, ferocious Atlantan royalty who can swim better than anything in the ocean, have to steal a boat to get from the coast of Italy? Greece? (someplace on the Mediterranean) to get to an off-shore island so close that it can easily be seen with the naked eye.If you shaved down all the overly long, gratuitous fight scenes, you could probably cut the running time of this potboiler by about 50%. Which would be a blessing. Thank heavens for the fast forward button.I'd been willing to suspend disbelief, as one always must with sci-fi/fantasy films, but this thing is dumber than the crappiest 1950s horror film you could ever imagine. So, of course, it made over $160 million, and a sequel is planned. Yay, Tinseltown. It's hard to tell how much to blame the director and producers for (justifiably) holding their audience in contempt, as opposed to not being able to produce a decent product even in a lowbrow genre like comic book movies.",Aquaman

Seriously I don't understand this. ""Aquaman"" is so bad that it was actually kind of good... I mean it has no screenplay, absolutely no acting, no structure - nothing. But at the same time for some reason I can't say it was boring to watch. It was a plain circus, just a ridiculous show, a performance full of booms and baams...In the beginning there was a Russian submarine hijacked by pirates... Aquaman swam around while wearing his usual rock'n'roll jeans and boots, decided to help the Russians, killed all the pirates (without forgetting to pose heroically in between), pushed the submarine from the ocean to the surface (in reality that would kill everybody in the submarine) and the submariner were like ""It's Aquaman! Hooray! You saved us!"". So... after such an amazing start you just relax, let your sarcasm loose and try to enjoy this crappy ass show.This movie reminded me of the first ""Capitan America"". Dumb, ""serious"" (the characters try to copy Marvel heroes and joke, but without any success) and all story just falls apart. I'm really sorry for Nicole Kidman,Willem Dafoe and of course Patrick Wilson. They are great actors and now they have to be a part of this... Though it looks like this movie is an absolute top for Jason Momoa. He doesn't look like a real actor, though I seriously believed the director would surely use his natural charisma. He didn't. Literally anybody could play Aquaman in this movie. The role is so dumb and empty you could put anybody in those ""ocean king of Vegas"" clothes.

As a result, they are totally desperate. One son (Aquaman) blames Atlantis for his loss; the other son (King Orm) blames humans. He is desperate to the extent that he wants to destroy the world.At the end of the movie, both sons reunite with their mother and it seems they are going to live happily ever after. I think this is a rather superficial ending. Both Aquaman and King Orm needed their mum when they were growing up. Not only they never fully experienced a (semi)healthy family life, but, most likely, they also projected all of their frustrations on the loss of mother. In other words, for both of them, mum symbolises both 'mother figure' and also everything that they lack in their lives (e.g. I could achieve this or that only if I had a mother). We know Atlanna (the mother) can't fill these roles now.In a more realistic world, I bet after few days both Aquaman and king Orm are going to feel miserable again because ""no one ever fully recovers from the sadomasochism of their childhood""(1).(1) Adam Phillips, Psychotherapist and literary critic",Aquaman

The movie also did not stick to the comic book, as his parents were dead, or at least his mother was by the time he was King of Atlantis. The biggest mistake was casting.

Is a very likeable guy and the story makes for an entertaining movie with spme funny moments. Enjoyable but not the greatest",Aquaman
2129,nickd_x,One of the most visually stunning movies,8,12 December 2018,"Short review...Went to see the movie with zero expectations and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. The storyline by it self is not something extraordinary or particularly captivating but doesn't fall flat either, it even manages to get you emotional as well.While it has some funny or emotional bits, the dialogue in its entirety seems to me a bit blank. It is however a fast paced movie with high standard fighting choreography and what really elevates this movie it's the exceptional visual effects . For a movie that takes place underwater it reminded me a lot like a space adventure quest .Overall it's a Very good superhero movie , in my opinion the best of DCEU so far and better than a lot of MCU movies.",Aquaman
2130,playboyc,Shortly Best DC movie,10,20 December 2018,Just I never thought I will see such an amazing film from DC . For me Best DC movie yet,Aquaman
2131,darrensterland,Shame I can't give it -100,1,3 February 2019,Probably the worst super hero movie ever I and my family have ever seen. So much cheese you need a pack of crackers to watch this. I just haven't the words it's like a bad shampoo advert meets the power rangers. Do yourself a favour and go and watch a marvel movie at least they make good cgi movies unlike this over the top over budget priced cheese fest. I just can't say anything more than to ask Father Time for the hours back. What did I just see dear god....,Aquaman
2132,philworthington,"Cheesy, obvious, stupid, fun",5,21 January 2019,"Here's the short version: If I were still a 14 year old boy I would think this was great, but I'm not, so I don't. But it was still fun in a B-movie kind of way.
Bad points:1) It telegraphs every plot point, the love interest is obvious, the mother returning is obvious, the victory is obvious. There are no plot surprises in this movie, unless you have never seen a movie before.2) The plot holes are gaping wide. The Sahara desert sequence is a prime example: two primarily underwater creatures strand themselves in the middle of the world's biggest desert with no water, and no transport.. and then instantly appear in Sicily with no explanation.
Yes, it's really that bad.3) The dialogue is awful.4) It suffers from too many villains. The Black Manta would have better saved for a sequel, he is just an annoying distraction here.5) It relies a bit too heavily on CGI, which just emphasises the 'teen boy fantasy' vibe (although I suppose that's fair if it's the target audience.)
Good points:1) It's fun as a popcorn movie.2) Jason Momoa is fun as Aquaman, in the few moments he's allowed to have any character development he really shines.3) The final battle is unexpectedly great.
It's a harmless way to kill a couple of hours, but I suspect it's best watched at home where you can laugh at the bad script with your friends, talk about the crazy plot holes (do Atlatean women always have a change of clothes with them at all times?), and fast-forward the Sahara bit. Not really worth paying to see at the cinema, aside from the end battle.",Aquaman
2133,adamallstar18,It's just... really bad.,4,5 January 2019,"I am a fan of MCU & DCEU who favors DC comics (not movies) over Marvel. But let's be real: This movie is objectively bad. The visuals are pretty neat, Momoa is likeable and Manta with his suit is pretty sweet. This however cannot outweigh the ATROCIOUS writing, poor directing, bad directing and poor acting.
One thing at a time: the writing is so lazy, there is no explanation of character relationships (specifically Willem Dafoe & Momoa), the lore is hastly given, and the super hero cliches are bad. This is all on top of THE WORST written script I have ever experienced. Every line of dialogue explained everything that was going on very blatantly. That's not how dialogue works! Additionally there was absolutely zero character development.
Basically everyone outside of Momoa and Herd should be replaced in this movie. The movie was littered with actors who stood out like a sore thumb. Herd was pretty bad too but I have a little faith.
In essence the movie is reminiscent of Green Lantern: neat visuals, likeable leading actors and a cool, promising secondary villain, and an overall trainwreck.",Aquaman

Jason is cool, but it ends there. Amber Heard is just a terrible actress and it showed, especially when she gets cheesy dialogue. Nicole Kidman is amazing, but didn't have a lot to do with the overall feel of the movie. The jokes made no one in my theater laugh, literally no one.CGI is understandable to create the underwater world, but there were lots of moments when the characters where replaced with CGI and it looked terrible. There was only one moment where we actually saw Patrick Wilson, besides that he looked CGI'ed the whole time.The movie dragged way too long, after a good opening start we get no introduction to Atlantis, but we suddenly need to care for it. Even the establishing shots of Atlantis seem dull, because there is no back story or whatever. Almost to the end we get some backstory, but it's not enough to make you care about Atlantis.A big CGI battle, where the bad guy fights a not introduced opponent, who is also completely CGI, how are we supposed to feel any connection to that?Don't even get me started on Black Manta, he was pushed aside and suddenly came back during the whole National Treasure part of the film. He looked so silly in the suit and acted even worse. He has a big death beam, but after using it starts to actually fight Aquaman... It made no sense.It really had potential if they replaced Amber Heard, opened with a better explanation of Atlantis, kept Aquamans intro short and then started with the actual story. It took more then an hour to really get somewhere in this film and by that time I already knew where it was going and was already bored.",Aquaman
2139,EasyCompany1944,It's a solid 6,6,27 January 2019,"The house of Aquaman is built on a concrete slab of CGI. I actually giggled during over the top cliche script moments and that's not good. ""I'm gonna need a bigger gun"" for example. The opening scenes were good. Kidman was miscast and opportunities for screenwriting were usually abandoned in favor of stiff dialogue. Worth a look but I won't be adding this to my Blu-ray collection in 2019",Aquaman

2141,McLovin4420,Every superhero movie cliche you can imagine,2,16 December 2018,"I have no idea why somebody would give this movie a good score, let alone 10. After 20 minutes I have decided that its for the best to switch my brain off and enjoy the show. But damn this movie is way too dumb. Character development is rushed and is given in a form of cringy and weak dialogues. Jokes feel like they are just out of place, but specific moments are created just for them to happen (which makes it even more ridiculous). There are some really stunning shots, but its more of an exception rather than the rule.
But the main issue, which makes this movie unwatchable without at least 4 cans of beer, is the fact that its linear as hell, there are 0 unpredictable plot twists, from the beginning of the movie (or even from trailers) you for sure know how its going to end.
Also the mood is unbelievably inconsistent, at some points characters are dead serious, while in 2 minutes they may be cracking jokes. Its not as bad as in Justice League, but black manta just looks pathetic with his constanty frowny or angry face.
WB, u evil corporate idiots, stop ruining your movies by trying to be like Marvel and making movies based on a formula which clearly doesn't work. It just looks like a parody and not a well done one.",Aquaman

After the releases of Justice League and Batman v Superman Aquaman has done the same.Jason Mamoa and Amber Heard are captivating leads and have great chemistry on screen in my opinion. The story was engaging and didn't feel forced or dragged out like it can in some movies. The action scenes were fantastic!!! They were ""let me grab my popcorn entertaining.""The only part of the movie I thought was so so was one villian, black manta, his character just wasn't that interesting and a bit cheesy.

I cannot tell you the number of bad movies which I have watched hoping that they will improve before the movie ended. However, I knew that that would never happen with Aquaman, so I actually left with about 30 minutes to go so that my entire evening would not be a total waste of time!!!

It tells a story of global warming .
A regular guy standing up to Greatness.
It tells a story of love .I loved that the jokes weren't too much and at times ,you could feel Arthur's pain of being alone.
James Wan did an amazing Job and I loved the Peter Jackson's adventure film style usedTo me ,this is up there with Batman Begins , I also prefer it to Wonder Woman by a land mile.Overall I'd give it a very good 8+Remembering that 10 means perfect and 9 cos I wanted to see more tragedy and death.

The significance of this is that Aquaman's story gives the hero's character tremendous boost after how he was portrayed in The Justice League movie.2) The story bestows you with different characters, villains and groups of villains with just enough development time for each as required.3) When into the movie, for the most of the it, the story is nothing that you haven't seen before. But it still feels new every time, even though your anticipation might be met for many scenes in terms of the storyline.4) The final act of the movie does an unbelievable job in single-handedly lifting the already-going-great movie to new heights, in terms of cinematography, direction, visuals and much more.5) The movie doesn't hold back in showing you the amazing war visuals towards the climax, which is only comparable with that of The LOTR or Avatar. You may feel that Aquaman even surpasses those movies in this aspect.6) It is a whole new world underwater which has been meticulously created with immense diligence. Yes, this is truly something which you might not have seen before.7) Most importantly, the movie ends on a solid note followed by a lingering song from Skylar Grey, that captures the essence of the entire movie.",Aquaman
2153,kumingz,Aquaman RULES!,10,19 December 2018,"I saw a preview screening in Florida- wow loved it.
Words: beautiful to look at (visually kind of reminds me of 'Tron Legacy' but underwater), funny/fun/entertaining, cool looking characters/costumes, great art direction, cool score that reminds me of Vangelis' Bladerunner.
I'm a fan of all comic book movies but here is my take:
Marvel movies are ""safe"". They are entertaining but reminiscent of USA Network shows like Burn Notice (there are fights/weapons/guns/explosions- yet no blood/death/bad language) to me there isn't much to be surprised about yet great to watch.
DC movies are more ""crazy"" - almost like AMC network shows like Breaking Bad/Walking Dead (WITH some gore/blood/death/sexuality & nudity/foul language/etc.)
Aquaman is almost a bridge between both worlds Marvel/DC.
That being said, I LOVED Aquaman - it's my favorite comic book movie to date.
I'm in my mid-30's and I remember reading the character's comics/cartoons a little as a kid - I had the Super Friends/Super Powers(?) toys and the producers got the character perfect for current pop culture here (Jason Momoa is an actor that you'll like immediately on impact- like when I was a kid watching Schwarzenegger flicks).
The only annoying thing about this movie was the people in the theater around me kept gasping and getting very excited (in a good way) at the action/scale of what was exhilarating them -it was distracting and this movie pulls you in/engages you.
It's the first time in a long time that I remember saying to myself ""I really don't want this to end!""
That's how much I enjoyed Aquaman.",Aquaman
2154,mihajloskoric,Indifferent,7,30 December 2018,"It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. I like superhero genre in general and it makes me sad how DC keep on disappointing and failing to justify my expectations which were huge considering how hyped this movie was.DC just keep making the same mistakes:
-typical plot
-very easy to predict
-poor dialoguesNot sure how many fail movies they need to make to realize their mistakes. This movie could've been a lot better if anything unexpected happened and if they dosed those crazy fx (which were decent) properly.For example his father could've died when that garbage wave hit them. That would give him a reason to leave surface looking for culprit.
Than sneaking in Atlantis(ok) but getting attacked suddenly in some hidden place makes zero sense. They could've caught him on his way out or something.
Before fight with his brother he didn't say a word to his people...
Last fight should've been on surface because that was his brothers plan - right? Instead aquaman found him fighting crabs.
Also that antflea guy was so unnecessary. They added him just because of second part. Fight in Sicily could happen without him.",Aquaman
2155,wirestone-1,Underwelming,6,8 December 2018,"This movie did not live up the hype for me. First, yes, there are a lot of spectacular visual shots, but too many wide shots with too many little details that take away from the main protagonists, and after a while, they become stale. Second, the story is weak, the last fight is completely anti-climatic, essentially to win a fight in Atlanta, you need to get the better weapon to break the ones your opponent has. Third, the actings are subpar, Momoa and Heard cannot deliver more subtle emotions like Gadot and Pine, and Dafoe and Kidman are underused, the only memorable one is Abdul-Mateen's Black Manta (or just Manta).

2165,BatMatticamus,An imperfect but wildly enjoyable ride,7,24 December 2018,"What's it about?The latest attempt by DC to right the course of their up-and-down cinematic universe, Aquaman, directed by big-name horror director James Wan (Saw, Furious 7), tells the story of the titular character (played by Jason Momoa), mostly referred to by his human name-Arthur Curry-as he reluctantly begins to accept his destiny as the heir to the throne of Atlantis. Amber Heard co-stars as Mera, an undersea princess trying to guide Curry, while Patrick Wilson plays Orm, the main villain, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II plays Black Manta in a secondary villain role. Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren also play smaller but important roles, and Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman round out the list of stars as Curry's human father and Atlantean mother respectively.What works?Given that much of the action takes place in Atlantis and other varied undersea kingdoms, the visuals were where this movie was going to live or die. Fortunately, this is an absolutely spectacular movie to look at-there's hardly any cracks in a really impressive CGI façade, and the use of color and other visual elements to build an engaging, real-feeling setting is equally impressive. In short, this movie is game-changing in the scope and effectiveness of its visuals; for me, someone who's never read an Aquaman comic, who's never really thought about what Atlantis should look like, this was a wholly convincing depiction of the undersea world. Even the character movements, gliding and hovering through the water, felt mostly natural, and the dialogue was given just a hint of the normal distortion you'd hear underwater.While the visuals were necessary to make this movie work, there's more to making a good movie than just pretty imagery (most of the time). Especially with a superhero action movie, something trying to connect with a very wide viewer base, the movie has to check a few more boxes. Fortunately, it also does a pretty good job with its characters, especially Aquaman himself. The character is written in a slightly unusual way-he's not a classic Superman-type, saving the world because it's the right thing to do, but neither is he a broody anti-hero type. He's free-spirited and energetic but likes to maintain a lower profile in the surface world; he's goofy but motivated and confident. This, of course, makes it the perfect role for Jason Momoa, who plays the role with a perfect sort of cocky charm (he also spends a decent chunk of the movie shirtless, and he's a hunky man). He's also allowed to be a funny character, mostly played as a loose-cannon fish-out-of-water (groundhog-off-the-earth?) relative to the rigidly hierarchical, traditional, rule-bound undersea peoples. It's a line of humor that could easily grow tiresome, but one which is used sparingly and therefore effectively. It's also worth pointing out that the undersea world doesn't come off as too stilted or outdated-it gets some satisfying chances to push back on his behavior in places, which also happens to allow for some solid character development moments as Aquaman tries to learn his place as someone with powerful ties to both the undersea and surface worlds.The other characters are also mostly at least solid. Amber Heard's Mera is probably the next most important of the heroes. She plays the role well, but it's an unfortunate inevitability that a good chunk of her dialogue is just exposition, given that her role, especially in the first half, is explaining the rules of the undersea kingdoms to Aquaman. But in the latter half of the movie she gets a couple moments to shine, moments which she takes full advantage of. Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman are good in their own ways as Aquaman's parents. One standout is Willem Dafoe's Vulko, an advisor to the Atlantean throne and former mentor to the young Aquaman. His character has some interesting moments and good twists along the way.But as is the case with most superhero movies, the true test of its quality is going to be the villain(s). I was worried going in that Patrick Wilson would not be a good choice for Orm, the primary villain, but he is intensely compelling both as politician and warrior, bringing a quiet ferocity in his dialogue-heavy scenes but a vicious confidence in his action ones, building a very strong primary villain, and one who even gets some good character moments. Plus, he looks great in the full Ocean Master armor, once he breaks that out.Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is also solid as iconic Aquaman villain Black Manta, though it sometimes feels like his character isn't necessary. He has a commanding screen presence, especially in the excellent opening sequence, but when he's allowed to function as a true villain, he often comes off a bit monologuey and underwritten, though a powerful enemy. He really shines, though, when he's allowed to take off the helmet and do some real acting, giving the character more depth and weight than it needed. I'm also really glad the decision-makers behind the movie were willing to eventually go all-in on the big, comic-accurate Black Manta helmet.The plot is mostly just adequate and generic, but it hits several of its emotional beats with resounding force. The ending is of particular note-without giving anything away, it takes a cliché framework and plays it really effectively before breaking it off in an unexpected manner, one that leaves the viewer startled by some unusual but effective emotional questions.One last crucial selling point for any superhero movie is going to be the action. Here, again, Aquaman shines. The massive-scale undersea battles are impressively constructed, being sure to maintain some semblance of tactical order while keeping a character-focused perspective, but the CGI overload does tend to wear by the end. The real selling point, however, is the close-quarters combat. Even the opening's expositional setup has a beautiful long-take fight sequence, and it only gets better from there. The fighting is often done with tridents, and the choreography and execution is superb, fast-paced but feeling realistic and visceral, and it always utilizes superb camerawork. James Wan is a director who likes to play with his toys, and the sheer joy of creating some of these sequences is beautifully evident on-screen. Even the slow motion is handled with both care and obvious excitement, showing off some great moments while never becoming quite gratuitous.The music also deserves a mention. Rupert Gregson-Williams, who also scored Wonder Woman, is in solid form here. Several moments in the score are notably strong, and there are no obvious missteps. He might not be ready to supplant John Williams or Hans Zimmer quite yet, but he's definitely deserving of more attention and work.What doesn't work?As I mentioned a few paragraphs before, the plot is mostly just generic fare: find the magic item, beat the bad guy, become the chosen one you were always meant to be. Part of the problem is that this is a movie that had to do a lot of things-develop its main character, establish a massive and complex world, introduce and develop two villains, and give their villainous plots enough weight to feel like a threat to the hero. With all that going on, it's no wonder that the core plot was going to be a little simple. It's not quite Justice League-levels of simplisticity, but it probably is ultimately more of a weakness than a strength, even if it was an inevitability given the volume of other details and characters and subplots surrounding the main narrative.Another problem with a movie trying to do as much as Aquaman is that there is bound to be some tonal inconsistency. The main chunk of the movie feels like an amalgamation of a mainstream superhero movie, a Lord of the Rings-style fantasy epic with Game of Thrones-style fantasy politics, while also bringing sci-fi action and worldbuilding of the sort we should have gotten from the Star Wars prequels. That core combination, though, works surprisingly well. It's when the movie starts dropping in scenes reminiscent of Indiana Jones or Journey to the Center of the Earth that things start to feel like too much, or when it takes a brief detour into otherwise-effective moments straight out of the rom-com or horror genres. Each of the bits, taken on its own, works at least fairly well (especially the horror bit), but there are some inevitable jarring tonal shifts.With any movie of this scale and ambition, there are inevitably going to be at least a couple weak points in the visual effects. While, again, the effects are almost uniformly astounding, there are one or two odd points-an unsatisfying movement here or there, a giant CGI monster that doesn't feel entirely present. An early scene in an aquarium has some uncanny-looking sharks. But really, that's it, and that's just nitpicking.But is it any good?It is! It's not a perfect movie by any stretch, but it does a fair job with most things, and it does a couple of the big things-visuals, action, main character-exceptionally well. Even the problems are mostly inevitable byproducts of bold, exciting decisions elsewhere in the film that end up mostly outweighing the costs of the unintended consequences. On the whole it's probably not quite on par with Wonder Woman (though there might be an argument in that direction), but it's definitely in the same ballpark-another clear winner for DC and a definite step forward for a universe that finally seems to be finding its feet.",Aquaman

Im totally not a comic book nerd or with it when it comes to the theme of Marvel or DC but i enjoyed Aquaman. For us poor Mums....he's very easy on the eye 😂. CGI heavy as usual but a good story. Yeah I really like Aquaman.....he's up there with Thor!!! 🤣🤣🤣",Aquaman
2170,philday44,Huge Disappointment,5,21 December 2018,"I am a huge fan of comic book movies and while the DC universe movies are no where near as close to the Avengers movies, I still enjoyed and rate highly the majority of what DC has brought to the big screen recently. However, I was expecting big things from Jason Mamoa's character in Aquaman based on his performance in Justice League and maybe that was the problem with this movie is that my expectations were not met by a long shot. Mamoa's appeal is his raw crudeness as a character but he comes across less than sophomoric and actually quite boring. I think DC was trying to bring a Thor-like character to Aquaman, strong but humorous in nature but they missed the mark greatly. Mamoa's dialogue is weak and wasn't even slightly funny. So basically, Momoa's is more of a supporting actor in my opinion and hasn't yet risen to lead actor. Nicole Kidman's performance was fantastic and so was Amber Heard's. Even Dafoe, Wilson and Lundgren did great jobs in their character, which probably made Mamoa look even weaker. I imagine it is tough to look like a star when playing alongside movie greats like Kidman and Dafoe.
Second issue I had with the film is the writing. The story is weak and predictable. If this had been a ""pre-marvel universe"" movie such that it had come out prior the epic series by Marvel, I would have given the movie much closer to a perfect score because it was cinematically well done. But that is just it, it now competes and measures up against what Marvel is doing and it is no where close. The movie feels self-contained and focuses on delivering a jaw-dropping visual adventure while forgetting the story. The graphic visualization of Atlantis and the underwater battles are fantastic, but that is just it, it overwhelms the audience and leaves the story to just that, a battle of good against evil with nothing else. There is no Superman, or Batman, or Flash or even Wonder Woman that make an appearance to somewhat tie the movies together. So if you like the self-contained movie in a box experience, this isn't bad. But if you wanted to see a DC universe film that extends ""justice league"" concept, I am not sure you will find it here.",Aquaman

2180,sergei-229-442306,DCEU is dead. Long live DCEU!,9,19 December 2018,"Aquaman delivers the final blow to ""DCEU is dead after Zack Snyder departure"" buzz - DC Cinematic Universe is pretty much alive, at least, underwater. James Wan successfully competes with Snyder's visuals, but without offering questionable plot twists and ""Oh, Martha!"" scenes. Yep, main plot is pretty much the same as Black Panter and dozens of others about outlaw king must accept his role as a real KING with a help of a bunch of friends. Yes. even evil brother is here, a hidden, but powerful contry (or countries) and old tradition of hand-to-hand combat as a political argument.So why ""Auquaman"" makes ""Black Panther"" look pale? Answer is pretty simple - director & screenwriters successfully adapted character's canon without disturbing ""modern approaches"". Classic suits, classic names, minor race changes Yes, Orm in the movie looks way much like blonde Aquaman in comics, but it was not Wan's descision to hire Momoa as a title hero.We see a very classy old-school adventure, Wan even cited Inidiana Jones as a reference - and, yep, spitit of Indiana is indeed here in a good way.Acting is solid, without spectactular perfomances, but Patrick Wilson can be names as the most remarkable actor from enseble. His villain delivers belivable emotions and motivation is not so dumb, as like Thanos, for e.g. under similar circumstances.Jason Momoa plays a cool biker-outlaw-style guy, the only problem with him - he cannot act really good, there is a big potential, but he definitely needs to improve. Momoa made his comeback in smal roles (like Drogo). but he is not a leading man material (see his Conan, for e.g.). With Momoa, directors are facing the similar problem as with Gal Gadot: a beatutiful human being, looks incredible on posters, but impression fades once they try to act. Wonder Woman was saved by Chris Pine & his team - they delivered most of fun, but ""Aquaman"" was not able to offer something like that. Amber Heard is a bad actress, her red wig looked really cheap, zero chemistry between Mera and Arthur - nuff said. Love part of the story is a hit-and-miss, without a question.Soundtrack is ok, but Aquaman really, really delivers the exceptional underwater wold. It looks incredibly amazing, with love & care, with many details for comic geeks. A spectacular journey, with a secondary villain for sequel - yep, Black Mantha should really shine, his motivation is pretty understandable and actor definitely needs more screen time.WB, You should negotiate with James Wan immidiately.

After condemning Manta Ray's father to death at the opening of the film for ""killing innocents,"" Aquaman at the end regrets not saving him and having made an enemy.The film at point feels like it can't decide if it wants to be a super hero movie, an Indiana Jones type artifact hunt, a homage to Jason and the Argonauts or movie with a environmental message. Instead it tries to be all and misses the mark on each one.The villain is one dimensional- until he cries when reunited with his long lost mother - while the story is utterly predictable with no surprises or twists to keep the audience guessing or engaged. After half a hour I'd lost all engagement with the film and for the first time this year I found myself wishing that the movie would soon be ending.Whilst not as painful as a tooth extraction, such a visit to the dentist could arguably be more entertaining that this damp squib.",Aquaman

Atlantis looked breathtaking and the underwater scenes could not have been done any better. Being able to make a world that we have never seen although it's just under our nose, is brilliant and really makes us believe that Atlantis might exist!

She make mediocre film absolutely horrible to watch: strange grimaces follows seemingly seductive eye movements. I guess the only part came natural to her fighting scenes.

Generally speaking, a movie with a visual special effects theme can always make me look forward to it, such as Frozen, How to Train your Dragon, the ice and sky from the beginning to the end, how to do it in the same material but with a colorful change?It is a test of the skill of the production team.
One of the scenes that I felt particularly stunning was that the male and female protagonists encountered many monsters in the trench kingdom. When they jumped out of the sea and broke through the monsters, the feeling from a cross-sectional perspective was really wonderful! The people who are intensively phobia will surely feel Uncomfortable and pleasant. Anyway, this scene is the main reason why I admire the visual effect of this movie.
In addition, the female characters in this movie are very cute. Whether it is the mother of the main actor or the main actress afterwards, their interaction with the human world is really innocent and cute. You can see that they really can't hate humans, which is why there may be a way to make the land and the sea people live in peace.",Aquaman

What a shame of such good visual effects! I enjoyed every single fight although, but then the mood is killed again when Pitbulls awful version of the timeless classic «Africa» by Toto. I was again embarrassed. Not much to spoil in this movie either because it simply contains every superhero cliche ever, and not in a funny way such as in the «Deadpool» movies. Of course the movie works and excites, but not enough for me to get scared of the beloved «aquaman» and his «death».The movie also tries too make the audience laugh in some of the scenes, which for me I felt falled through. It felt so fake and scripted that i wondered who thought it was a good idea. The only actor who made me laugh at one point of the movie was the aquaman himself Jason Momoa. He handled the cheesy lines of the script okay, and he made the movie easier too watch. I felt ripped of after I left the cinema, and it was not at all worth the money!

I felt no connection between any of the characters beside one scene. When Momoa is talking to the guardian of the Trident and you never even saw the face of the monster talking.

2226,georginacroft,So bizarre,5,22 March 2021,It is like 10 films in 1 and not in a good way! One second a romcom then sci fi then gladiator style historical action then a Nicolas Cage style treasure hunt. The storytelling is unfortunately all over the place with random flash backs whenever they need to explain something. The aesthetic is also very confused and doesn't blend the ancient atlantian/Greek with the modern tech and sea mermaid vibes very well. They don't really create a believable world like e.g. Wakanda managed to do in the MCU.The casting and acting is good but the main characters don't have much depth.It's like the film was made by A.I. and just put every possible thing in that makes a 'good film'.I liked some plot points but it needed serious editing.,Aquaman

2230,CrumbsReviews,How The Tides Have Turned,8,18 March 2019,"Going into Aquaman I was pretty hyped, not only is he an overlooked superhero but it has James Wan behind it. While many of us know James Wan for horror films he definitely delivered a great movie in Aquaman. It certainly is not a flawless movie by any means but it is one hell of a good time. I still think Wonder Woman is the best DCEU film but this one is without a doubt second. The film is a beauty with great cinematography and visuals. The actions scenes are very well done especially since 90% of them are underwater. The cast is great as well with Jason Mamoa and Amber Heard being the best choices for Aquaman & Mera. Their chemistry is amazing with one another and it definitely makes them more likable. Yahya as Black Manta was also another amazing cast choice. The film is definitely over the top but it's mad so be over the top. The cheesy over the top moments just made this film more entertaining in my opinion.Like I said this movie is by no means flawless and does come with some weak aspects. The writing in the film could of been improved and some of the one liners were weak. One of the weakest aspects for me was the score. The score was very basic and forgettable. If it had a better score such as Wonder Womans it might push it over the top to be the best DCEU film. All in all this film is beyond entertaining and anyone can have a good time seeing it.",Aquaman

Some areas I was lost like wtf is that who is that why did he die so quick who was he really I thought he was going to be a strong contender. There were a lot of Greek and Egyptian references and that thing aquaman rode on the head looked like Baphomet (like seriously guys why).

2249,batuhanakcaygs,Not that good as the hype.,6,20 January 2019,"This movie has many good reviews compared to better movies, that get bad reviews.First of all, why this movie isn't as bad as the other DCEU movies:
This movie has great visuals and a good cut. This movie is a difference to the really dark DC universe. This is very refreshing.There are many actors who are very sympathetic and play well. I found Jason Momoa and Amber Heard very likable and they had good chemistry between each other. What I found sad was that Willem Dafoe did not have enough screentime or influence. He could have had many meaningful influences on the plot, but this was not realized. But that is not so tragic, because the film can convince by the sympathy of the characters. I want to see more of each character.Why that movie is not that good:
This movie copies many elements from other movies. I know that most Hollywood movies are copying, but this movie is an embarrassing combination of elements. For example, the Post Credit Scene is mimicking the Post Credit Scene of Black Panther. Or, for example, the Trident of the Trident is imitating some other beings from other franchises. I do not mind, but it was painful to see how some of the movie elements were taken in a bad way.Speaking of, Black Panther. This film has many parallels to Black Panther due to the royal theme. The difference, why Black Panther is better than Aquaman is simply that you experience many emotional scenes like important deaths at Black Panther. Black Panther shows many parallels to royal dramas like those of Shakespeare, but Aquaman has few scenes that really carry emotional weight. I had expected a superhero movie with parallels to royal dramas and elements of love, but was disappointed with a complete romance movie with CGI.I know that the comparisons with Black Panther are exaggerated. But do you still know in what point Black Panther is better than Aquaman: the music. The Marvel movie had a soundtrack, especially composed by Kendrick Lamar in collaboration with other artists, while Aquaman has songs that are not compatible with each other (like Two Steps from Hell - None Shall Live and a Pitbull cover from Toto - Africa) a female singer) and can not make a uniform sound.But what you can notice is that the dialogue between the characters is really very stupid. The producers should have allowed themselves time for production and had to revise the dialogue. Some statements from characters are sometimes exaggerated cheesy or ridiculous. Then you realize that they wanted to copy Marvel, but unfortunately failed, because most ""jokes"" have failed. With every joke, no audience laughed.Towards the end, the film was so cheesy and so predictable that I was bored and expected the end of the film. The film was usually very predictable, especially at the end of the film.Maybe some people think I'm overdoing my criticism because it's a DC movie. But that's not true. I'm a big fan of DC Comics and I grew up with DC Comics when I was a kid. One of my favorite movies is The Dark Knight. I watch every DC movie, no matter how bad it may be. I'm not saying that this movie is a disaster, but for me it was very predictable and towards the end I was very bored. I will wait and I would be happy about an Aquaman 2, but hopefully it will be better implemented.
In summary:
I think, I would give this movie user-defined 6.7 points from 10 points. There are plenty of better superhero movies, but this movie is one of the best DC Extended Universe movies. I found the movie more exciting than Wonder Woman but not so exciting. If you judge him as a very ordinary movie, he is average and nothing special.",Aquaman

2261,benv-89995,Spectacle Over Story,7,28 December 2018,"The most used word to describe ""Aquaman"" is FUN, and it most certainly delivers in this regard. From the beginning of the movie until the end the movie throws BRILLIANT action scenes at audiences that are directed masterfully and overall paced great to keep audiences ""glued to the screen"". These range from one-on-one fights to GIANT army-on-army battles against the visually diverse settings of the seven seas and the surface world. These different settings for the narrative and spectacle allow for audiences to distinguish the different cultures across the seven seas and allow the film to maintain colourful and vibrant, unlike some DCEU movies. Like stated, though, the directing is truly where the film shines. James Wan brings great impact, scale and intricacy to the way the action and other moments of the film are shot, with a memorable example being a chase scene, unfortunately revealed in trailers for those who have seen them. However, where the directing adds a layer of great spectacle which carries audiences' enjoyment from beginning to end, those critical with story will surely find faults. The narrative's biggest issue, after watching the film, is its underdeveloped and simplistic nature. Characters from the protagonists to the villains lack deep and complex motivation for their actions throughout the film, making some ""confused"" as to why the characters are so persistent in their goals. Also, the film, for some with perhaps lesser knowledge of the character and the world, appears incoherent when ""jumping"" around to different Atlantic civilisation, inter-woven with flashbacks which simply distract from the plot at hand. As for its simplistic nature, it follows a clichéd formula of a ""road trip"" of sorts, accompanied with ""fish out of water"" humour which varies in quality. Finally, there is a revelation in the final act which is predictable and irrelevant. That being said, the film does occasionally hit emotional beats and manages to encapsulate much of the character's heavy law in its run time, though it doesn't balance screen time for some characters as well as most would like. Overall, despite the MANY story problems which may frustrate critical audience members, the pure spectacle alone is a master to behold and the thin plot is overshadowed by the ""fun"" and enjoyable nature of the film which embraces its absurd routes, similar to James Wan's work on ""Fast & Furious 7"".",Aquaman
2262,ishan-37116,DC is back!!!!!!!,10,14 December 2018,"Finally DC has the sense on what they have to do. They have tried to stick close to the real Aquaman with a little with if humor. I was scared they will spoil the true charector with all the silly humor like they did with the justice league. BATMAN doesn't smile!!!!!!!.. ok I am past it. This movie is the return of DC. There is no hiding of the mustache with kindergarten animation nor there is the flash running like he has a stick up his u know what!! The animation is up to the mark and makes you want to find Atlantas and stay there. The action, the music, the cast and the story all added up. They have shown the weakness of Aquaman which is good. They could have made Aquaman skills a lil more majestic but i am guessing they are leaving it for the next one. If you don't see this in an IMAX you are an idiot!

2263,tanaynayak,"Predictable and cheesy, enjoyable nevertheless",6,16 December 2018,"Aquaman feels more like a video game than a movie. Atlantean soldiers look straight out of Halo. Although the visuals are spectacular they feel extremely out of place. Oozing magma, laser guns, and even flare torches are all seen inside the ocean.The storytelling is completely one dimensional. Black manta is a weak villain whom the audience couldn't care less about. Orm lacks any depth like most of the characters in the movie.Except Jason Momoa and William Dafoe even the acting falls flat. The dialogue is clichéd and if you've seen more than three superhero movies than you'll easily be able to complete the sentence after any dramatic pause in the movie.Aquaman even messes up the DCEU timeline. Although the movie takes place after JL, Arthur obtains his suit and trident in this movie.Despite its flaws, Aquaman is clearly a fun movie.

Wonder Woman, Suicide Squad, BvS, Justice League were all pretty bad.. However, Aquaman was great. The visuals were great, story was good and stayed on course throughout the movie. I had some doubts on underwater action scenes, but they did really well. Jason Momoa does a great job portraying Aquaman in this. My only letdown is kind of the ending, personally it felt slightly rushed, but then again the movie was already over 2 hours long. I know people are very skeptical of watching the movie given It's from DC and not Marvel (I had many friends saying this is why they won't watch the movie) however I did, and I didn't regret it.",Aquaman

2266,trevorcarpenter-28214,I'm so annoyed with the people who reviewed this movie before I saw it!,4,21 December 2018,"I checked all these reviews before seeing the movie. ""Most Beautifully visualized!!! DC movie... so far"". ""Better stuff than what MCU offered us for 9 years!"". I was SOOO excited! I love all superhero movies, MCU and DCEU. I have been hoping for a good DCEU movie for so long, and have gone to each one hopeful. Wonder Woman was a step in the right direction in my opinion. I saw the reviews for this movie and was so excited to see it. And was subsequently let down, partially because I didn't read into the feud between the two franchises's fans.Look, this movie should not be reviewed as highly as it is. It has GREAT visual effects and Jason Momoa is actually pretty good. However the rest of the acting and writing is so so so so subpar. I've been reading reviews all morning, about character development, how it is way less cheesy than MCU movies, just the right combination of funny and serious. Every scene feels forced like a formula: have at least one funny joke, one cool visual effect, and one heroic speech about the importance of what we are doing. So repetitive, the entire movie. How is that revolutionary, or better than any other films the DCEU has produced? I blame my disappointment in this movie based on the DC only fans who are just forcing good reviews on this movie based on their hatred of Marvel. Because while I definitely love DC, and I like Marvel sometimes too, I pay $15 at the theatre for a GOOD MOVIE not a BRAND.I hope my review brings down some of the hype. It is still a pretty good film and OF COURSE I love Aquaman and think that every fan should see the film. But I could have waited until it is cheaper on DVD to watch, because it simply isn't worth it. Please don't let the annoying reviews that praise this film as some above holy savior of the franchise sway you, because it is not that jewel of the DC universe they claim it to be. And if any of those reviewers read this, please, when reviewing movies, leave your anger at the MCU at home so I can not waste money on a film that is by no means, saving the DC franchise. The last thing I wanted was to associate this film with disappointment.tldr: this film really needed a poorer review because the amount of praise it is receiving is unrealistic, and causing people to get their hopes too high about a mediocre film.",Aquaman

The only worse thing is the things they made Patrick Wilson and Willem Defoe do. They are such great actors, and here they were brought to do their acctual lowest. It's sad. It's even sadder DC and WB excecitives allowed that to happen. Damage control department is off the charts with the positive reviews everywhere. They are all lies. If you go and see the movie you'll know. It's bad. It's terrible. It's WAAAY worse than even Green Lantern with Ryan Reynolds. It's just bad. Nothing redeems this movie.

First: the main character didn't even want any of this, he got pushed with the ideals of another person (Mera who should of literally be the Queen at that point)
Secondly: there was a ton of cryngy moments like when the movie was about to end Mera said there was too many casualties in the war moment later kissed Arthur while the war is going on in the background (probably between 300-400 died during that kiss like wtf)
Third: from the moment the movie started I knew not only how it's going to end but literally every detail of what will probably happen because the plot lacked twists or something interesting.Sadly what could of been an amazing movie turned out to be a one dimensional origin story of Aquaman (and in the movie he didn't even deserve to be the hero) probably all the reviews that are 10/10 or 9/10 were created by DC to gain more money on a higher rates movie",Aquaman
2273,alejandrokilei,Slightly better than MCU but still cliche,7,1 January 2019,"The new aquaman comics have been fantastic and this movie plays off of the new line of comics. That is also the downside to this movie - it feels like a string of comics smashed together; it was missing a solid overarching thread to keep everything pieced together. It also felt like they missed out on some scenes that really would have added some depth if they lingered on them a bit more, but instead they raced to the next action scene. I think they wanted to keep things moving, but they missed out on some major scenes to connect with the characters. There was a heavy use of CGI in this movie (as is common with DC movies...), but it was definitely blended better and not as much was used as has been the case in previous DC movies. It was better put together than many recent marvel movies which are beginning to just feel like cliche michael bay films (I'd rate all recent marvel movies between 4-7 out of 10 stars for perspective).",Aquaman
2274,sosamontrevor,Aquaman Review,5,2 January 2019,"This was a decent film that was over shadowed by too many mistakes. Every good scene was proceeded or followed by one that never should have made the final cut. The direction was poor with odd camera movements and dialog that ventures towards painful. It seemed James Wan, not sure how long the DC universe would be around, tried to pack the whole trilogy into this one film. Overly long with an ever shifting tone, this movie couldn't hold it together until the finale",Aquaman

2278,Chudderz,Fishy Fun with plenty of Bright CGI,7,22 January 2019,"First review so here goes.Aquaman. I am a fan of Superhero movies so thought why not catch up with this one after not seeing it at Christmas time. All in all it passed the time and I left having enjoyed the film but I won't say it's the best I have ever seen. DC tends to be a bit of a darker side of this genre but this one felt a bit more lighter and fun. Back Story is quickly sorted so you can watch as a stand alone movie and we find out it is set after Justice League during general chit chat.No real spoilers as our hero goes off on a quest to save the world and reluctantly claim his rightful thrown. The plot as you would expect can be picked through but all of the stars in the movie have a bit of fun. Jason Momoa is a bit wooden but he fills the role well. There are plenty of good CGI moments and loads of bright colours whilst not to my taste and sometimes a waste of screen time I am sure the younger people will enjoy. Fight sequences get bigger and bigger as the movie goes on as Aquaman goes on his travels.All in all a fun film certainly not the best but certainly not the worst. Shame no other DC characters didn't make a guest appearance but I guess being mostly under water kind of rules that out. Will I watch Aquaman 2, yes probably. Worth a watch if you have nothing better to do.",Aquaman

Great action, great choreography, wonderful sets, terrific battles all of the best!!!! We see how a character emerged and how he was a hero, so i think story of this movie is perfect and amazing. There are action, adventure, comedy, incredible visuals, great soundtrack, emotion in this movie. Character's explainations is done in a perfect way. DC did a amazing job with this movie and showed that there is more great movies to come. You can feel the emotion of all the characters and the villains in this movie are so passionate that you really are rooting for them just as much as the hero himself. It's an outstanding movie loved it must watch!!",Aquaman

Aquaman tries to remedy this by padding his performance with other well-known actors, but it's just not enough to fix this movie.The plot of the movie itself isn't terrible, but the script is filled with weak dialogue and most of the characters can't seem to use contractions, so that makes the dialogue seem very wooden and awkward.There are a few nods to the Aquaman from the comics and the old cartoons that fans will enjoy, but there are other parts of the movie (like a drum-playing giant octopus) that will make viewers scratch their heads.And of course DC still looks amateurish and cartoony when it comes to comparing their CGI to Marvel movies, not only in action sequences, but also when it comes to de-aging actors.Bottom line, take the kids to see it, but keep your expectations low.",Aquaman

After changing the dark style that DC has always been before, some relaxed and humorous fragments stimulate the underwater fighting. The ending song is nice and worth watching.

No huge plot holes (again, I never read the comics) or anything that stands out about the plot. Seems like a generic superhero plot in my opinion.What drew me to this movie is the ridiculously amazing visuals. From the ocean to Atlantis to the costumes, they are really amazing.

This is the type of film you go to see when you just want pure entertainment with lots of special effects and visuals. Aquaman was not so great, in my opinion, as a comic.The film's first scenes made me gag a bit at the over abundance of makeup on the actors to make them look younger. They almost looked like dolls and the acting was quite dull. It gets better once you are past that.But again, it's a blockbuster film aimed to satisfy your eyes with big colorful visuals on a big screen.

When you watch Aquaman, you are left with the newly emerging (and very real) condition of CGI-fatigue. Nothing you see before you registers as real, in your brain, because nothing that moves a certain way in water moves that way in this film. One exits the long, dizzying experience feeling like they've just watched a long video game. Nothing is scary anymore. Nothing is exciting or suspenseful, because the filmmakers use no visual restraint in their storytelling. The excess of CGI use in films like Aquaman have just made us stop caring.Jason Momoa mumbles out his words without any charisma or life; he comes across like an early and unpolished version of The Rock, and his lack of acting experience stands out in stark contrast to veterans like Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe.Where Aquaman fails in engaging the audience in a compelling story through its weak acting and visual diarrhea, it does make up for in one area - costume design.",Aquaman

While I understand a movie set in an underwater kingdom requires the use of CGI, there was still too much of it where it wasn't needed. And where CGI was needed, it was egregious and off-putting. All the scenes set in Atlantis felt like Tron under water.3. The plot was convoluted and contrived.

It's normal in any fictional universe to have different physics from real life, but it needs to be consistent, and this movie was like the writers and director didn't even think about it. So, when underwater, apparently some things move slower, but others don't. Some things fall slowly, and other things fall like they're in air. It's apparently just fine to stand on something while being propelled through the water, and the water has the same friction as air.The only way this Aquaman gets anything better than a 4 or 5 is because DC is paying reviewers.",Aquaman
2347,ranjurmohan,Thank you DCEU for giving a worthy opponent to all the MCU juggernauts...,9,15 December 2018,"My ohh my... From the trailer itself it was evident that this will be entertaining , but the only doubt was that will it have all the unwanted witty moments they tried to put on the movie likeJL. Naaah itstead James Wann had thrown me and also most of the viewers back to the childhood days of comic books. Jam packed action.. amazing visuals.... Pretty strong character development even on a movie where there is little time to develop characters. Yeahh there are few medium rare charectors . But we can forget that all just for the sheer fun the whole movie gives us. Jason Mamoa as Aquaman is my favorite super hero period. What a flawless performance my him , grace and command is just oozing from him on all frames. And MCU has to step up their game on female leads. Coz after wonder women we got 2 strong female leads on queen Atlanta and Mera . Nicole Kidman is gorgeous as well as powerful .. So is amber heart... Great visuals , strong performance.. Got more than what I had bargained for .. Long Live the King .. Aquaman Rules...",Aquaman

2349,b-fay,AquaMan = StinkyFish,4,31 December 2018,Wow. Was I disappointed with this one. Perhaps if it started with the big final fight scene at the beginning... I'm pretty sure it would have been more entertaining if Jar Jar Binks was in it. My son can't wait until we see it on MST3K.Really hoped for a good one from DC but yet another miss.

If there had been a shot of Jason's naked backside I would have given it a 10 out of 10 simply for that!!! But overall the characters & scenery deserves at least an 8. Dialog was ok, timing was good.

2352,markbuffyfan,Lost in virtual backgrounds,5,24 December 2018,"Firstly the movie was ok ... just but the overuse of cgi backgrounds ruined for me the potential to be s great movie . James wan put the CGI before the characters and that's never good . The plot was non original and was never any good in the cartoons I preferred Aquaman in Justice league as a character . Amber Heard , Nicole kidman and Jason Mamoa were great the rest of the characters frankly boring and had no meat to eat on the barebones plot . Manta ..... c'mon there has to be a better villain accessible than him so I rue the sequel. I really disliked the overuse of cgi cartoon backgrounds enormously if the film was meNt to be a cartoon make it so not this hybrid . Very very missable and not a great movie to watch into the spider verse before I'm sure the cgi on this enhanced my contempt for that",Aquaman

I'm giving 2 stars because the special effects and visuals are spectacular, but everything else was a steaming pile of fish guts that have been rotting on the pavement for days roasting in the hot sun.Aquaman is like a teenage adolescent trying to flex his tiny nut sack in front of anyone who will give him the time of day. He's so unlikable I actually wanted his brother to destroy him and all the annoying surface dwellers polluting the ocean. Darn, that would have been a welcome change of pace.

2360,crzellmer,Bad.,3,31 December 2018,"Its like the Little Mermaid meets Tron meets Power Rangers. The acting was sub par and the fights were just not believable and poorly executed (Think Cheesy Power Rangers). And if you are half fish and have ""evolved"" then why do you need a leotard with scales? And an underwater car b/c apparently Aquaman cant swim underwater? Underwater laser guns? And an octopus playing drums? I was done after that. Oh and the center of the earth with an island inhabited by dinosaurs? This could have been a really great movie if they focused on developing the characters instead of throwing everything including the kitchen sink at it. The movie was about 30 mins too long. It was really uncomfortable to watch and sit through and I was ready to leave the theaters 30 min into it which is only something I have done once before. I don't know why other people gave it a 10. Ugh. Its garbage, spend your money elsewhere... unless you like cheesy Power Rangers kind of fights and undeveloped characters.",Aquaman
2361,andrea_marie90,Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,1,27 December 2018,"Let me preface this by saying that I am normally VERY forgiving of subpar movies.However, this is easily the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. At this point, I feel as if the world is playing a joke on me with the positive reviews I've been seeing.I wouldn't say that I had high hopes of this movie being spectacular. The moment I read about Mamoa being cast a few years ago, I was ecstatic! He seems to be the perfect fit for Aquaman! However, the concept of an Aquaman movie, seems kind of silly. He talks to animals? In the water? Sure, but a movie? Just saying, no high hopes, just wanted a good time!The acting? Terrible. Character development? None! Visual effects? Seems like a beginner. If 1993 Jurassic Park could create effects like it did, why was this so bad 15 years later? Directing? Awful. So many shots were pointless, and honestly, dumb. The script? Well, let's just say there was a solid 10 minutes where the back and forth dialogue was comprised of 4 word sentences. Villains? Two half assed villains, that don't really seem that awful...which is, you know, not great for a villian! It seemed like there was an attempt made at a soundtrack, and then just quit. There were 3 heavy synth 80s songs, and then Pitbull for a bit. What was that about?I don't even want to start on Willem Dafoe's wig and costume.The plot seemed to grab aspects of other movies, and threw them together, trying to make something stick. 3 points for every moment you recognize: Aladdin, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Power Rangers.I have never cringed as much, or as consistently, as I did during this movie. I could honestly go on and on about every aspect of this movie that I found terrible, but it's doubtful that anyone will read.TLDR; DC has to be deleting negative reviews. The cast should be ashamed of this movie. Don't go see it.",Aquaman

2366,Michaelayeve,Plays it safe and avoids trying anything new,4,5 April 2019,"Aqua-man is yet another DCEU movie that manages to catch a fantastic start, but gradually declines into a messy generic movie which only exists to appeal to mainstream audiences.The same old formula has once again been used, but this time our hero is Aqua-man, and for the first time ever, we have an underwater super hero movie. I must say the way the managed to portray the underwater world exceeded my expectations as I have not seen anything like it before, but unfortunately it's one of the high points of this flick.The movie begins like your average Disney movie. Two characters fall in love, have a child, and they get separated. This child is aquaman, a boy with seemingly unique powers of being able to communicate with sea creatures.Fast forward to when he's grown up, aquaman is your generic character that is slowly transferred into a hero, one that is the last hope of stopping the war versus the Atlantans and the ""earth people"".Unfortunately I can't really go any further without spoiling the plot (there's not really that much to spoil) but let's just say you can predict everything that happens in the movie, including some of the dialogue.The movie feels one linear. One dimensional. There is no sense of wonder, no atmospheric environment, nothing. The movie has managed to bring the best cgi within the DCEU universe, but at the end of the day, it just feels like a movie.There is honestly nothing going for this movie. It just manages to succeed at not being as bad as some of DC's lowest (suicide squad, justice league). It plays everything safe, sticking to the core roots that the audience seems to enjoy and want out of a movie, regardless or not if they have seen it a thousand times.The writing is poor, the screenplay is poor, the cgi is fantastic, the acting is bland, and the movie lacks any memorable moments except for the eye candy fight near the end of the movie.Overall if you're okay with the same old movie following the same old formula, you can't really go wrong with this movie. But for someone who is sick and tired of the same stuff over and over again, I'm going to have to give this movie a 4/10.",Aquaman

Reading the reviews, I can't find any patterns to clue in to where anyone may fall. So my suggestion is to see the movie with an open mind, knowing that you'll probably either love it or hate it.

Boring story with same construction and development...the good, the bad, the winner, the loser etc...a waste of time and money, good only for long air trips and in-flight entertainment (perfect for sleeping!).

Its more than all the Batman movies, its more than all the Superman movies!!!! or any other DC movies that came out already. The best thing that this movie has are the nods to some familiar scenes that we may never realized we've grown in to it. The discovery channel documentary about mermans and how they came to be. The zombie apocalypse with that torch waving among the hordes of Trench!. The G.I. JOE scenes and the James Bond chase scenery in Italy. The Journey to the center of the earth, the jurassic park scenery. The nod to the Little Mermaid, not to obviously see the whole Ariel look of the princess but man look at that scenery in the Atlantis! The Octopus drummer, the turtles, the ring of fire, the throne!!!! Ursulas pet!!!! and who would forget Sebastian being too OP as Aquaman's grand finale!Love how they build the story without messing up with the entire concept. Love how they build him (Jason Momoa) and finally seeing him in his suite.Im excited to see his next enemy! That helmet from Black Manta at the end seems familiar!!!!",Aquaman

2373,nightelfranger,A visual spectacle of cliche,6,20 December 2018,"What do you get if you mash up every superhero cliche together and make it look good? Aquaman. The only depth the film had was that it had scenes deep in the ocean. Every character is very superficial and you can tell this was not due to bad actors, but due to the whole script itself. It lacked any kind of originality, which is great for anyone just looking to watch a classic superhero film. Its lack of depth is actually pretty surprising when you remember that it has a run time of 2 and half hours. That would be plenty to write a complex story.But if it didn't have any depth then what did it have? Visuals. Lots of action, Jason Momoa and Amber Heard. Its like the same genre as Transformers really. You just basically go to watch a huge pile of cash. All focus is on being entertained by something happening and looking good, and this it actually does pretty well. Not once was I bored when watching the film and especially the scenes when they are sailing, the ocean looks really good and Amber Heard's hair is super red and shiny.So if you want to see this then at least you are gonna know exactly what you're gonna get and Amber Heard is really hot.",Aquaman

Movie has a weak plot, and when that happens, it gets predictable
At least for me it does. I could literally foresee what was gonna happen before it happened.
And I mean everything. Movie feels like a 5/10 rated videogame and what you see its a predictable ""adventure"" mission of aquaman in search for a trident.
That my friends is the definition of a boring movie.DC disappoints again. The only DC movie i find enjoyable after Christopher Nolan's batman trilogy is Wonder Woman.On the counterpart, MCU movies I can't say there's one I disliked. DC is just bad at movie-making ;P",Aquaman
2376,nirmaljustin1,One of the best superhero movies of all time,9,20 January 2019,"Aquaman is a movie you should best watch in packed houses. Then you can really enjoy all the fun of the movie. Yes, as the critics have pointed out this is a CGI fest, but that is a great plus for the movie.The plot of the movie is simple. The real essence of the movie lies in its wonderful visuals. As you would know, the movie is set in the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. The makers have excelled at making Atlantis as beautiful as possible.Coming to the acting, William Dafoe and Patrick Wilson were outstanding. But the biggest praise goes to Jason Momoa. Oh,how cool he was! I have become his fan now. Amber Heard was a constant source of irritation with her skin-fit and cleavage-barring outfits. But Nicole Kidman was the one who disappointed me. I was hoping a good performance from her but all I got was her walking around in skimpy costumes.Overall, Aquaman was a hell of a fun ride. Go for it!!",Aquaman

The director redifine the genre, and give us more than we expect. Jason Momoa's Aquaman is viril, strong, funny and vulnerable, representing a positive male model, according to this times.

2381,gmrich94,not worth paying for,2,22 December 2018,Well Jason momoa looks amazing but the plot of the movie was terrible. This is not even looking at the inaccuracies of this movie. First off black manta and his father are pirates that already obtain high tech equipment and then it is found out that aqua mans half brother orm paid them to do so. If he is also a powerful aquaman why did he not do it himself and just become king. Anyways later black manta basically becomes ironman making his own suit without any scientific background which makes no sense. The water holograms seemed unnecessary as well. Also they are many lights seen underwater in atlantis which if you are in that depth of water where is this light coming from. Another side note would be how the color red is not visible at a depth further than 5 meters so how is mera's hair so red underwater. There are also random monsters thrown in and it seemed like there was no reasoning behind it. I love James Waan but this movie was a major disappointment. You can't just throw action scenes together and expect a great movie. DC movies are not even worth seeing anymore,Aquaman

I thought the plot was utter thin and way to predictable. There was almost no character development and all the jokes fell flat.
The dialogue consisted of oneliners and over-dramatic stuff. Like, not every dialogue needs music!This movie has also one of the worst sub-plots i have ever seen and goes nowhere. The movie would be the same without it. I laughed a few times at the many cheesy moments in this movie. And not because it was funny, but because it was so bad.To sum it up.Cgi fest without depth.DO NOT RECOMMEND!",Aquaman

Critics should not bother to try and bring down this film cause fans of the series, or the comics will go anyways and draw their own conclusion. This is the most visibly beautiful and heart warming of the DC films. In spite the leftist, NWO, UN infused propaganda I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Gorgeous cast, and scenes. The only criticism I have, making this a 9/10, is that the lead actor can't act. However, his stature, and appearance make the fight scenes, and his inheritance believable. Definitely had a similar setting as Black Panther - with its hidden world of advanced technology, a brothers' quarrel and a feminist heroine, and with Arthur's demi god status just like Thor, this film still manages to distinguish itself from the others. The battle scenes are accentuated by their magnificent color rather than a murkey, dark blur.

2391,stefano-clagna,It was better than I thought it would be and honestly 100 times better than black panther,8,2 March 2019,"The premise is simple and straightforward.
Underwater world reminds me of avatar except we have known sea creatures as pets and vehicles.
The adventure part is short but good enough to make sense and to progress the story.
For some reason I have a feeling that the black dude which father died in the submarine is added content - filler content and is really similar to black panther.
I would say that would be one of the weak points of this movie.
I wish getting that trident was a bit harder.
He was kicked around couple of times and that's it.
It would have been so much better if he and that creature fought really hard and he was injured quite a bit and as they take a break cuz of exaustion the start the chit chat and the creature has a change of heart.
Younger brother storyline was kind bland aka his motivation for wanting war was meh,something people cant relate to at all.
Sure pollution is bad,but we cant really imagine that personally since we are the polluters.Still,100 times better than black panther which is being praised by so many news outlets and biased movie critics.
Aquaman even with his very bad looking suit is still a far more interesting and better character than the black panther one.",Aquaman

2394,NightChild-792-522294,King of DCEU,10,16 December 2018,"I'll start by saying please ignore any review that is comparing Marvel movies or even mentions them. Disney couldn't hold a candle to this film and not one Marvel movie has the business or respect to be compared to Aquaman. Not one!Aquaman was outstanding! It had a great plot, great villains, awesome fight scenes and action, romance, comedy, and it was powerful. Back in the day, people would laugh at Aquaman and call him the most worthless hero. Ignorant is bliss. Those people were ignorant and I'm getting all the bliss laughing here because the joke was and still is on them. The King of Atlantis and one of the co-founders of the Justice League really took off with the visual effects and how awesome it was to see a movie take place underwater. You get to see Arthur's superpowers early on in the film so you know what Aquaman is made of and just how durable the King really is. I do hope these ""critics"" don't get paid to write reviews, because their reviews are very biased, opinionated (obviously), highly arguable, and even some are incorrect. The movie had an outstanding cast and is one for the whole family to see again and again. I believe Rotten Tomatoes gave Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse a 100 and yet, only gave Aquaman like a 70? Aquaman was a WAY better movie in every way. So, that is one example and reason why I urge EVERYONE to go see the movie and judge for yourself...and why I believe Disney/Marvel probably ghost owns RT.DC has put out great movies like V for Vendetta, Man of Steel, Batman v Superman (extended cut), Wonder Woman, Justice League, and Aquaman. All within the same Universe excluding V for Vendetta, but the films, nonetheless were REALLY, REALLY good. Yes, DC is darker and that's good. They are not Disney and I like that they don't pretend to be.10/10 Final Score",Aquaman
2395,gemgemgibs,I'd give it 0 if I could,1,23 December 2018,I'm shocked by all the high ratings this seems to have been given. I thought it was absolutely terrible! Even the soundtrack didn't work! Why on Earth Nicole Kidman would be associated with this trash I have no idea! Do yourself a favour and watch paint dry instead! Absolute shocker of a movie!,Aquaman
2396,prieshd,Really fun and entettaining,10,3 January 2019,I wasting expecting to have so much fun watching this movie. I went to see Jason who I loved in Stargate. You can tell that he is having fun with all the aspects of the movie. Fun to watch and made the long time run go very fast. I'll see it again.,Aquaman
2397,rgroenow,Better that u think,9,19 December 2018,"Really good an entertaining. Explain another point of view of this superhero,",Aquaman
2398,simongiarchi,Unbelievably dull and lacking substance,2,24 August 2019,"If you like movies this one probably isn't for you. It was a marathon to stop myself from falling asleep with a terrible script, almost no character development, tinny acting from everyone except William Dafoe (and he wasn't at his best by any means) and a complete lack of substance. All this makes the dullest film I've seen since the other DC disappointer Man of Steel.If you haven't watched this movie yet, I recommend you don't waste your time!",Aquaman
2399,kdam-850-667617,"Ok seriously, what were people watching!!??",1,15 December 2018,"Let me start with this: ""Aquaman was one of the worst films!! Yes films, not just superhero movies but films!! I've EVER seen.."" I honestly don't know how it's got so many 10* ratings. I'm starting to think there's something seriously wrong with people.The film is ridiculously cheesy, not well acted at all and so cliche it physically hurt me to watch at most points. There were too many scenes that were just stupidly unrealistic (I know I'm watching a film about a half breed, Atlantian, superhero but have a touch of consistency) like the scene where a 3 ton block of concrete lands on some guy's legs and aquaman just lifts it off and he jumps up and runs off without a scratch on him. I could go on but I'd be here all day...All in all I felt Atlantis was too over done for me, as was the CGI. The storyline was weak, cliché and rushed and considering it's the only film I've ever wanted to walk out from I think that says it all.",Aquaman
2400,raggais,Good visual effects and a good lead role,6,27 April 2019,"This could have been a great movie but it lacked a good story, it lacked an introduction and good dialogue. From the very beginning we were just thrown into a battle between the two main characters and after that we were off into war. The special effects and action were entertaining though and Jason is handsome and charming as hell but unfortunately that is not enough to save the film so I score the film 6 out of 10.P.s they should have skipped the red wig, it was too irritating to watch.",Aquaman

James Wan is a goddamn GENIUS. Everything in this movie is amazing. From the acting to the music, CGI, everything is top notch. Jason Momoa is not playing Aquaman, he IS Aquaman! Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman and the rest are amazing in their roles too. But honestly, Jason Momoa couldn't be the more perfect Aquaman. CGI is honestly breathtaking. I have never seen such good CGI. The music fits perfectly in every scene, and is badass in some moments, that you can't contain yourself from excitement. This movie and Wonder woman have saved DCEU. And it was worth the wait, and the hype around it is sooo well deserved.",Aquaman

From the first scene to the final scene you will be engaged in the movie. The movie has great comedy, action, and heart. The special effects in this movie weere breathtaking, I can't believe they made this movie for only 160 million. James Wan did an amazing job with movie and so did all of the actors espically Jason, Amber, and Patrick. There is also a good end credit scene you won't want to miss.",Aquaman
2407,jeeponthego,Overhyped and overblown.,1,19 March 2019,The dialogue has got to be some of the worst ever written which results in horribly wooden acting. Casting was seriously flawed with the exception of Jason Momoa. Manta looks like a damn ant. An altogether thoroughly ridiculous film that is far below the rest of the superhero films. Total disappointment.,Aquaman
2408,totallykiller,Blah blah blah yank yank,1,1 January 2019,"Jason Momoa is yet another hyped up actor in a big budget film, kinda similar to when Vin Diesel was in XXX and women watched it mainly just to see the star and his muscles.

2410,erictheras,"Pretty cheesy, but okay at some points...",5,13 April 2019,"The movie was pretty cheesy not gonna lie. Arthur's mom just in general for example; she had to leave to ""protect her family"" and Arthur's dad walked to the edge of the pier everyday to see if she would come back. And how everyone thought she was dead but surprise surprise she wasn't dead, and of course both she and her son both recognized each other immediately when the reunited. Now I'll give it up for some of the fight scenes because they were kind of cool, and the crab king was actually cute which I don't really say that often so that's good I guess. if I have to sum it up, DC was intimidated by the awe that is Marvel's success, panicked, and created Aquaman. The build up was really rough; with all the exposition and drama. Aquaman didn't really have too much of a personality up until a 4th of the movie, just illustrating the kind of cocky hero-Type main character the box office thinks we want to see, and then giving him more of a reckless attitude later on. I'll also give it up for DC's attempt to keep both roles equal instead of empowering just the female role, like most movies nowadays. I'll end it with this: let's just be happy it's not Justice League.",Aquaman

But I still maintain my opinion in this. Save your money and ditch this movie. Weak storyline and mediocre acting. The only reason this movie has a 2 is because of the cinenatography and the sets. Anything other than that is a big mess.,Aquaman

To be honest I didn't expect a good DC movie, although the effects were great. But the way the characters spoke to each others was so unnatural and the storyline was so predictable. I already knew I was gonna be disappointed but not this much

Aquaman is the first one that has actually done it. I will actually purchase this one to own.The graphics aren't terribly cheesy either. The story is told well without jumping too quickly or skipping over important character development. It's got good moments of humor and sufficient action scenes. Also, my 5yr old really enjoyed seeing all of the sea life visuals. Acting wasn't too bad either.Only negative noticeable thing was it seemed like Amber Heard looked incredibly uncomfortable in her costume and her scenes where she used her power were more humorous than they should've been.",Aquaman

I liked shape of water though... and I don't like the probable implication that I'm not a kid anymoreBut hang on...I still adore The Dark Knight. Infinity war wasn't bad too. So as an adult , I can still enjoy DC/Marvel movies... so what happened here? The story telling wasn't intelligent enough for me to stay invested.
I mean , the characters and their development can't be so simple.. Atleast give 'em some flaws that'll be properly exploited . The Dark Knight was painfully human, half the MCU superheroes literally bit the dust .
Just blinding visual effects, combined with an all too predictable 'good beats evil' plot won't do it for me.. anymore..Did I mention shape of water ? It holds a different level of emotion all throughout . Shouldn't have brought it up here6 points considering the VFX .",Aquaman
2417,levdodd,80s B Grade Sci-fi at its finest,8,22 January 2019,A gloriously cheesy sci-fi epic which reminds me of a hammy 80s B flick - but with some unbelievable visuals and a pace that doesn't let up. Wan has built a world that needs to be seen to be believed - men riding alligators and sea horses aren't even the most ridiculous/awesome thing this film features.Check your reality at the door and strap yourself in for the most far fetched film made in years.,Aquaman

In every superhero movie its important to shown how the character is built, how he becomes more responsible after discovering superpowers, strugle, sacrifice, relations (Black panther is great example). None of this was part of the story. It was pupil's entertainment and followed chronicle of batman vs superman and justice league.
If DC really wants to compete with Marvel then they need to focus on these aspects.

2424,armaniranpour,Good superhero movie,7,4 May 2019,"This was a good and entertaining superhero movie, but that's all there is. I prefer DC when I read comics, but I think they have a lot to work with when it comes to movies. DC are taking the right direction with their movies though. After Superman v Batman and Justice League, I think they've learned a lot and are starting to make there solo movies to maybe make something greater later in their universe.Back to this movie. I think the writing of the conversations are a bit poor. I'm no filmmaker, but I really got so little from Arthur/Aquaman in this movie. His lines was so short. I wish we could see more character development (event though this was a origin movie).I also think there was a lot of cliche moments, which I feel is typical DC to do. The bullying part and the kissing in the middle of the battle to mention some.Lastly I think the CGI was too much. I know this is under water, but if Marvel manage to make good Thor and Guardians movies with great CGI, DC can do it to. The CGI in this movie kind of reminded me of JL, which was reeaally bad.As I said, I feel like DC is on the right way, but still a lot to work with when it comes to writing and CGI. I haven't seen Shazam yet, but so far I've heard only good things about it, so maybe DC have learned!",Aquaman

The story was overall enjoyable, though nothing special",8,23 December 2018,"Some fighting scenes were truly amazing, the great imagery and choreography made you feel like you were in some fights yourself, however a lot of other scenes were the opposite. The first few scenes ALWAYS ended in some sort of explosion or chaos and it to me was pretty tiring and it was just so clear that they didn't rly dare to just end a scene ordinarily. Apart from that, the input of music was in some scenes almost laughable to me (I say that as a film student) but I guess it was nothing you'd think of that much if you don't focus on how they edited it all. I all so think the start was way to hard edited, maybe that was the point or maybe it's cause they spent a lot of time editing it down as DC seems to have to do to all of their movies nowadays, either way they should have just added some environmental shots and just shown where exactly we were at rather than just jumping into a scene.
Overall, it was a good movie, especially considering the previous ones in the DCEU, but neither cinematically nor story wise was it anything amazing. Good movie though and you should watch it :)",Aquaman

Wouldn't her ""suit"" be part of her body.. it was almost like you'd expect a zipper here. Plot was.. well it was weird.In general I felt like it was almost tipping over to be this bad-funny movie like The Room, Sharknado etc.I'm amazed they let this through the editting room, felt like some 10year old kid have approved this.

The script is wooden with characters making nonsensical decisions solely for the purpose of moving the plot along. The dialogues are terrible, like they're written by middle schoolers. And the perplexing music choices that do not match the scenes one bit!! The only saving grace is the amount of effort and creativity they put into building an underwater fantasy world, which not many movies have done before. I'll give them that.

It felt off as far as tone, as if Wan couldn't decide when it was supposed to be serious and when it was supposed to be funny. Almost all of the jokes fall flat. Only 2 old ladies in our showing laughed.My biggest complaint is all the recycled material. Orm is like Loki, just way more over the top. That final battle scene was straight out of Lord of the Rings - water Orcs and Jonathon Rhys- Davies and all. There was even a shot that looked straight out of Avengers with the Chitauri bursting out of the
Leviathan.Also, with all the CGI, you'd think they could wipe out the awful wig lines. Seriously, the worst wigs ever.And DC seriously needs to get over it's mommy issues.The good things? Some of the fight scenes were amazing. I'm so glad they kept the ""Snyder slo-mo"" to a minimum. The animals were beautifully rendered for the most part and I really love Thomas Curry.

The movie really is stunning. Some incredible visuals, truly. That being said, that's about all that's praiseworthy about Aquaman. The character and plot development is either rushed or sorely lacking. It really left me hurting for more. Not in a good way. A few of the one-liners made me chuckle, but most made me cringe or groan. The dialogue is poor and the story seems hastily patched together amidst a deluge of action scenes.Honestly I was most disappointed because of the incredible potential of this material. Wan really showed incredible imagination, he just crammed way too much into one movie. The incredible potential for Atlantis world-building is clearly there, but it's just blasted through at such a wastefully fast pace. There's enough content for three movies crammed into a span of two and a half hours...Picture this: (SPOILERS ahead) The first film could have simply introduced Aquaman and Black Manta, two origin stories, as the core of the film. This would allow more time for proper character and plot development. Glimpses of the Atlantis culture could be included, Mera's character could begin investigating this half-breed, assisting Aquaman with his battle against Black Manta, and the end of the film would tease the unrest of the seven kingdoms.Film two: the war of the seven kingdoms begins. Aquaman is not crowned king yet, but still plays a vital role in protecting the surface-dwelling world. Perhaps Orm remains prince (a minor antagonist) and his father, still alive, is the primary antagonist that stirs conflict. This allows so much more time for world-building and character development for these amazing seven kingdoms.Potential film three: Orm becomes the main antagonist after the defeat of his father (in film two) and stirs conflict again in the seven kingdoms. Aquaman journeys to the trench to discover his mother, claim the trident, and become king, ending the conflict, defeating Orm, and bringing peace to Atlantis.This is just spitballing, but my point is that this movie covered WAY too much content in one sitting. Such a waste. So much potential. So much imagination, just horribly paced. I had no TIME to really digest or appreciate anything, since it was flying by at the speed of light. Justice League suffered from the same issue: trying to accomplish too much in one film.",Aquaman

2465,analepur,Best dc movie yet,9,26 January 2019,"I just watched the movie and I am overwhelmed! The story was really nice described, everything was explained step by step and it wasn't rushed like some other dc movies. There was no boring scenes or not needed ones, everything in the movie flew like it should have. I loved Amber and how she brought us her character, I was actually very surprised how good she was and she was actually better than Jason to me.
Another good thing was that battle between brothers didn't last for half an our, it was short and sweet just like it has to be and more time was spent on other imortant stuff.
Only thing that was a bit annoying to me was that the Aquaman was introduced to us like an idiot, he doesn't seem nor smart nor very sharp, more like some cocky bully.
All in all, I loved the movie, even the villian was actually interesting which is not the case in every movie, and ofc there is also the Atlantis world that was so stunning, I just loved it, and all of the underwater world was shown brilliantly I don't remember a movie that had such pictures and imaginative scenes since Avatar.
I would definitely recommend it.",Aquaman

Jason momoa made aquaman a hero fans can love and relate to.The visuals, the storyline, the acting, the humor name is breathtaking. Ocean master is an amazing villain, black manta is badass(so much potential with this guy) and I see aquaman 2 being much better than this one. Aquaman and mera's first KISS was delayed in order to tease the audience and it's one of the captivating moments in the film that would make you smile. Also Atlantis is a beautiful place.",Aquaman

Evwry fight scene opens with the same ""suprise!"" Style explosion.
The music score is horrendous and made felt like a 90's action movie
The costume design made it feel like a reallt over budget power rangers episode
The cast overall id say was well chosen but no matter how good they were, they couldnt save the souless and predictable script from leaving us cringing every few minutes!
DC have such a wealth of characters and stoeylines to choose from but with the exception of wonderwoman, have really dropped the ball in a lot of areas

2471,allisonburgerslollol,Not bad,1,15 December 2018,"This movie falls on the tier of the better half of all DC movies and can be called the second best DCEU movie. The movie has one of the best cinematography of all time, probably falling just shortly behind Avatar. The visuals are stunning. Cinematography aside, this movie is quite dull in terms of plot. It has an extremely thin plot and story buildup. You will be left scratching your head at the sequence. One moment a character appears another moment another character appears. And the worst part is that it is highly predictable. Also character buildup is weak. The villain is a villain for the sake of being a villain. There isn't an extra motivation for why he chose the path of the aggressive. But Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were amazing, and their chemistry was magnificent. The latter will especially be benefited for that. Jason Momoa with his charm steals the show. But we can't say the same for the villain and the plot.
Not a bad movie at all, but not a movie to blow your minds either",Aquaman
2472,abbs-1202,"Avatar, but Underwater",7,1 January 2019,"With Jason Momoa as Aquaman himself and Amber Heard casted as the beautiful Mera, you already know it's going to be a good looking movie. Knowing that James Wan is more of a horror producer than an action movie director, he did a good job tackling this installment. Bringing in Patrick Wilson as Kind Orm was a good tribute to having him be familiar within Wan's work. In general, the movie was great action packed adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the idea of Atlantis and how the characters looked underwater as well as their relationships with the different characters to see how they played within the story line. However, the CGI has been getting slightly more noticeable within the last couple movies that I have seen. Some of the stunts preformed in this movie that should have either injured the character or end up in a fatality, to return a few scene later didn't feel authentic. If you have seen Avatar, directed by James Cameron there is no doubt to where Wan got his inspiration from. Aquaman's Atlantis has the same feel as if you were in the land of Pandora, but just underwater. All in all, a great addition to the DC universe and can't wait to see what comes next.",Aquaman

If you want to see real events and real emotions just watch the news. I am really surprised to see all the bad reviews movies like these are getting nowadays. Come on people we have enough tragedy and horror in real life. Going to the movies (or watching it at home on the big screen LCD) should be to get away from all your troubles and enjoying yourself and what better kind of movie than Aquaman. I watch movies for the thrill, excitement, big screen action, and of course a few tears here and there never hurt. So what I am saying is we need movies to be entertaining. AQUAMAN does exactly that.",Aquaman
2484,jbramlrj,Incredibly lackluster film,1,22 December 2018,"I seriously don't understand how this film is getting such good reviews, it's one of the worst films I have ever watched, at the same level of fantastic four. Fair enough people are entitled to their own opinions, I respect that.Good parts:
That fight scene in sicily was decent
...struggling to find anything else that was good
Some of the set pieces were good I guess.
Black Manta was okay?Bad parts:
The acting was awful, Jason Mamoa couldn't show any emotion, when there was meant to be a sense of urgency or peril, he slaughtered that sense with his overall non-chalance throughout the film. Ocean Master (awful name for a villain btw) has a laughable response when seeing his mother for the first time in decades, more comically confused then surprised or shocked.
The so-called twist with the mother returning was so predictable.
The CGI for the majority of the film is appalling, remember the complaints about the inconsistency in the CGI in Justice League? Those complaints remain with Aquaman.
Black Manta was wasted.
The fight scenes, this annoying and tedious spinning shot with all the fight scenes. The first fight scene is okay, the spin shot seems cool but is ruined by awful and simple choreography and those fights could've ended within a second if the enemies just shot. Also what kind of a hiding place is a corner? The next fight scenes have the same spinning shots and they were so tedious and frustrating.
The pacing of the film was horrendous, along with character development. It felt rushed at the start, and felt too obliged to introduce all of the characters straight away, you ended up forgetting half of them. Near the start where Black Manta's dad, I think, dies is terribly done, you have no sympathy due to a lack of development and appropriate pacing. Ocean Master's character development is awful and he is just terrible throughout the film, I mean Patrick Wilson was amazing in Fargo season 2 as Lou Solverson, but what happened here? Other character developments are lacking such as Vulko and Mera.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT AFRICA COVER. This scene made me laugh cos of how bad it was. It cuts to them walking and this awful africa cover starts playing really abruptly, and just ends like 5 seconds later, it doesn't fade in or fade out. I'm still trying to figure out if this film is supposed to be taken seriously.
The after credits scene wasn't impressive, I know marvel initially copied dc with their origins, but this film felt like it was tring to hard to be like guardians of the galaxy/thor ragnarok (which are amazing films). The ""who is aquaman"" is dumb, given that throughout the whole film, aquaman is making hinself well known and is being very public about his superhero identity, this guy is meant ti be a professional journalist, how does he not know who aquaman is?
It dragged, I asked my friend how long was left and was saddened from hearing it still had 2 hours left, some long films don't feel long, or at least are enjoyable throughout their length such as Fargo, Ballad of Buster Scruggs, Infinity War and The Matrix, but this film felt like forever.Overall, if you're looking for a film to laugh at for 2+ hours, this is a good one, not because it's intentionally funny but because of how bad the film is as a whole, and if you're a film student, most likely you will despise this film. One of the first movies that made me almost go to sleep, almost as I wanted to give it a fair chance and didn't want to miss anything that may be redeeming, however I wish I had fallen asleep.

2496,woziak,WOW!!!!!,10,9 December 2018,"Ok I saw this a month ago at a pre screening and it just blow my mind. The plot is simply enough but it's the way James Wan makes you care for the Atlanteans and ofcourse Ocean Master, brilliantly but if a little camply played by Payrick Wilson and more importantly how we the surface dwellers have poisoned the oceans with plastic materials and maybe deserve some form of retribution. My concern originally was the acting ability of Amber Heard and Jason Momoah but for me Wan gets two great performances from his leads, especially to my delight, Jason Momoah and the supporting cast are simply stellar. Black Manta is next level dope and the action, film choregraphy and fighting scenes are some of the best witnessed on the big screen. The music score has epic moments but also can have some strange choices at time but overall the score was great. The last act is worth the admission alone and I dare anyway to come out of this movie not being in simple awe at what they witnessed and beautiful the World of Atlantis is.
For the record I'm not a DC or MCU fan but I am now a James Wan fan, can't wait to go see it again on Wednesday this time in 3D Imax!Ps stay for the midcredit scene and please, please, somebody give James Wan the Keys to the DCEU universe",Aquaman

I have hoped for the same thing with DC. I have actually been a fan of most DC movies. I absolutely loved Justice League! Wonder woman was great but I could do without Professor Lupin being the villain with his jacked God body and little nerdy head. Still great though. Suicide squad was good except for the weird intros for each character and the dumb witch villain. People are going to hate me but Batman vs Superman THE EXTENDED EDITION was honestly really good. Aquaman.....lands dead last. I rarely write reviews and I only do it if I feel strongly about a film and feel other reviewers got it wrong. Everything I read was ""DC's best film,"" ""Better than Wonder Woman"" ""DCs headed in the right direction now"". They were all lies. Like I said I liked all the other DC movies. Why they got criticized so harshly and this is praised I am baffled. From beginning to the very end it was awful. I would not even recommend renting this. It was a waste of a night for me. I will say if you like Transformers then you'll probably like this. Dumb jokes, a lot of special effects, zero character development, and a poor story. Fits the Transformer mold to me.",Aquaman

Even the scene when Mera is saved by one of Trench and after that, didn't surprise me (I am sure you will understand what I mean).With the similar storyline, Black Panther did it much better.

Great special effects and lots of action with a decent predictable plot. My only true complaint was the chemistry between Jason Momoa and Amber Heard. There was no chemIstry at all and any attempts to create chemistry seemed forced. At no point did I feel like there was any connection between the two and it seems they were only tolerating each other. Overall, it was a very entertaining movie but did not break any barriers.",Aquaman

It is really a love story (a pair of them) dressed up as an action film. Consequently, I think it will do very well at the box office and will hopefully do so well that DC will commit to always funding their films properly and employing the best talent. Although this was vastly superior to other DC efforts I don't agree with those weirdos who suddenly think Marvel haven't been producing very good films over the past ten years.

Do not watch this movie!",Aquaman
2543,abbyhuot,Wait for Netflix.,4,16 December 2018,"This movie is visually stunning, don't get me wrong. The CGI is epic and gorgeous, but it's a ridiculously dumb movie. Jason Mamoa is a stunning man that does an okay job as Aquaman, but his character feels very surface. His opening sequence/fight scene is a good intro but you're left wanting more depth to the character as the movie progresses. They tried to add some toughness and snark like Tony Stark, but there's not enough to work with to actually make the personality truly click and shine through to the audience. Amber Herd was excellent as Mera and I think she was perfectly cast, and the most believable character in this film.Patrick Wilson's character was tolerable as the lead villain. I don't have much more to say on him. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was a minor ""bad guy"" character as he became Black Manta. I had to hold in giggles, as his battle armor made him look like more like a cheesy bad guy from the 90s version of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, and less like a Marvel antagonist. So much of this movie just reminded me of Avatar, only underwater. Avatar had mystery to it as it wasn't a world we knew, but this has very recognizable animals in it that are awkward to see in their presentation. For instance, sharks in battle armor. Frickin' sharks with frickin' laser beams on their heads! #austinpowers Seeing Orcas and blue whales presumably miles underneath the ocean was also something difficult to just dismiss as ""it's just movie science"" as these are real animals in our world.The underwater scenes, particularly the entry into the City of Atlantis, were beautifully done. However, the inexplicable lack of continuity between how physics works in this underwater world (falling off of cliffs underwater?) among other nonsense towards the end of the movie had all of us in the preview audience muttering, shifting in our chairs, and asking aloud many of the same questions. We wanted to much to love this movie, and everyone walking out said it was terrible but the CGI was amazing. I wish I could say I loved it. I didn't. Beautiful, but disappointing movie.",Aquaman
2544,lucozade-41304,100% honest without any expectations going in,5,15 December 2018,"I went into this movie with a open mind and I was disappointed. The first opening scene was promising and well directed but the rest of the movie fell flat with cringe moments, noticeably bad CGI, terrible jokes, silly jump scares and pacing issues. James wann the director is very good don't get me wrong but he was either not 100% sure on what he was doing here or the studio was pulling strings most of the time. The movie has all the typical cliches which usually I let pass but these ones you could see coming from a mile away and just make you sigh.The actors aren't bad but the script they are given here is awful, some of the lines are so bad they look improvised at the last second. The scene in the desert is a great example of this, every line sounds like it was written by a 10 year old with a bad sense of humour.The good points here are that the villains have motivations which are clear but mostly cliche, the actions scenes are quite badass especially the submarine scene but that's where it ends.Overall I think this movie should have been short and sweet making us want more, instead I never want to see another solo aquaman movie. The post credit scene is pointless and sparks no emotion or excitement for any future instalments.",Aquaman
2545,rossguillot,"Solid movie, a lot of DC fun",7,26 December 2018,"The first DC film I've truly enjoyed since the dark knight series. I loved the campy feel of some of the lines because any comic book fan knows, a hero has some cheesyness to him. It has non stop action, great CGI, and they did a fair job of revealing black manta. Though he wasn't the main villain. It's a great take on aquaman, though they definitely have room to grow with the acting. Not perfect by any means, but it was so fun to watch that I couldn't help but talk about it all night with my wife during the drive home. Will definitely buy when it comes out. The quest for the trident was drawn out, and the villain ended up being a hair too weakly contrasted for my taste, still. Go see the movie.",Aquaman
2546,jamiesmith-50352,AMAZING VISUALS FOR A GREAT STORY,10,3 January 2019,"I absoloutley indulged in this movie as it was probably the most entertaining and fun movie of all 2018. As I watched this in 2019, this is definately the highlight of my year so far.Beginning:
The story was amazing especially with beginning as both Nicole Kidman and Temuera Morrison completely dive into the role and put in there all as you can feel the love and connection they have in such a limited amount of screen time. Because of this they did great with what time they had to make it believable on screen. Nicole Kidman completey kicked ass in this movie and honestly didn't expect any of the amazing fight chreography from her and was really impressed and overwhelmed.The Story:
The story was really good with some amazing writing and some unique and imaginative world building especially for when we are entering the city of Atlantis and seeing the amazing under sea world. It really reminded me of avatar with the overall designs.I really enjoyed the feud and rivalry both Arthur and King Norm have for one of another but I wished that there was some brotherly love like we have with our marvel characters Loki and Thor but for reasons that are brought up I can see why James Wan didn't go in that direction. I think that Patrick Wilson didn't a phenominal job as King Norm. I didn't realise it was him from the trailers so seeing that he finally got a big role since watchmen as Owl man for me is awesome.Third Act:
The third act is the most insane thing we've had for a battle since man of steel in the DCEU in my opinion as it was a chaotic, suspenseful and visually stunning. The kiss both Mera and Arthur had in the third act was kind of a ""YEAH FINALLY"" moment as you can feel they have feelings for one another throughout the film and even in Justice League so for them to drag it out and then do that was a cool moment. Amber Heard did a phenominal job as mera and really felt like a 3 dimensions character instead of an actress doing a role. Everyone did awesomeOverall:
The film was visually stunning and the entire cast did a phenominal job. How James Wan and the design team made aquamans iconic yellow and green suit look great in a live action film I'll never understand. Perfect Story, perfect cast, perfect visuals, perfect writing and perfect direction.",Aquaman
2547,arnobzaman,Very good movie,9,25 December 2018,"As I watched the movie yesterday, it was really awesome experience! I like the way Amber Heard done the job of Atlantis Queen and she looked very hot ain't gonna lie. Jason Momoa also looking hella strong and positive about his role he finish it well in the end. I was enjoying by watching the movie. So for me my opinion it was a good movie after a long time from DC!",Aquaman

2550,lillifrazier,Baffled,4,24 December 2018,"When I scroll through all the raving reviews, I'm truly baffled. Aquaman is not the worst film, and considering the other films in the DC universe you could build a solid argument for it, however this film was not even remotely good. Going in, I had bare minimum expectations, but I was hoping to be surprised. But going out, I strongly wished for a refund and I'm not even the one who paid for my ticket.In terms of the barebones of the film, it felt confused. Obviously it was a comedy, but when it came to the levels of comedic value it gave off it was never consistent. The dessert scene made me gag with the quirky music in the background and did not fit well with the vibe the rest of the film gave.",Aquaman

2554,jakekonn,Long answer that sums up my movie experience,7,6 January 2019,"I will explain why I have the score I did after each recorded score.
Visuals-9
Most astounding cgi I have seen in a long time possibly even first right after Planet Valerian.
But I feel it was a tad by much on the cgi.
The whole battle at the end was the most beautiful cgi battle I've ever seen. I felt engaged and wondering who was going to win in all the chaos( obviously I knew Aquaman would win but bear with me.) It was chaos and I love chaos.Plot-4
Hero has to endure a treacherous journey to obtain an item that will ensure victory in the end. Honestly, aqua man should've just challenged him to a battle on land and he should've killed him. That is how the movie should've gone but I digress.Soundtrack-9Very awesome Opera at scenes of intense action and quick music during times of escape.Speech-3 Oh god this was horrible. At some points of the movie I couldn't hear Mamoa speak because of the action and music and at other times he doesn't speak clearly. They should've done a retake.Fight scenes-9Awesome fighting with the tridents but they seemed to carry on way to long. The fights should've been 60-90 seconds long. Fights don't last that long. The action was really great though.Love story-9 and 4We'll start with the 9.
Tho old man and the Queen Atlanta was so heart touching to me. The old man had such a sad look in his eyes when she didn't come back. He went down to the docks for 20 years hoping she would come back and one day she did! At the end.Now the 3The love story between the Ginger and Aquaman felt so Forced and very fake. At some points you are able to tell that the actors were disinterested in the love story and it shows on camera.Enemies-8 The enemies and the plot to start a war with us is very well executed by the director. The acting and the style that is shown made me feel that it was very well thought out.BUT the enemy that was like a buffer to fighting King Orm was horrible. Aquaman should've just killed him when they were on the submarine along with his father.ResolutionWe all knew that Aquaman would win but he should've mopped his he floor with him in the 1 v 1 which should've been on land. Aquaman is obviously stronger and more talented.My final score is 7
Average but better than average",Aquaman
2555,RynWlsn,"Entertaining, engaging and certainly extravagant.",7,4 January 2019,"Story doesn't take precedence in this world any longer. Gone are the days of DARK epics and COMPLEX anti-heroes that fall over their own motives. The DCEU has realised it's better off trying not to emulate Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy and Aquaman strikes a much finer balance because of it. As far as origin stories go (if you can call it one after Jason Momoa's equally strong performance in Justice League), it's much larger than the usual efforts that aim more precisely to establish rather than finish anything. Instead, Aquaman has loftier ambitions and though the pace can border on unrelenting at times, it's forgivable given how big this world is and how thoroughly the filmmakers immersed themselves in it. There's enjoyment to be found in simply being along for the ride, even if most of it was clearly computer generated. Aquaman knows that we aren't going to take everything it gives us with the utmost seriousness and it's refreshing that the film doesn't try to play its sillier moments with a straight face. It's definitely a fine instalment into the ever-growing panoply of superhero movies and absolutely worth watching on a Friday evening with handful after handful of popcorn.",Aquaman
2556,u-66754,Not a typical superhero film,8,7 December 2018,"The opening of this movie really captures my eyes. And the background music is excellent, the scenes are gorgeous. I would rather regarded it as an epic, not typical superhero film. The performance of Jason Momoa and Amber Heard is great. I could not understand why people think Momoa is handsome until I watch this movie. And Heard looks so awesome with redhead😍.The description of emotion is much more abundant and important than I thought, and Wan really did a great job of expressing the love of Arthur's parents. It's undoubtedly the most touching part of the film. I especially admire the way that Wan uses and presents props and scenes in this film, and the sense of destroying and grandiosity he tries to convey. My favorite part of the film is the ocean monsters part and it's really heart-shaking😝.But for me, the incongruity between sense of epic and superhero elements (or modern elements) is a little bit huge, making me feel disharmonious in some scenes. And the costumes of villains in Atlantis are a little bit disharmonious, too.",Aquaman

The cinematic experience of the movie is awesome and incomparable. And I believe that it would definitely be termed as the ""Avatar"" of comic genre.The story is good if not great(with cliches). Casting and acting are awesome. The biggest win of the movie is not only the VFX but also the right casting. I like Willem dafoe. But the ""could have been Joker"" is the pick of the lot, apart from Momoa. Mera is badass.And yeah, the battle for Atlantis is on par with LOTR. This is the main and most important draw of the movie.The credit scenes are not connecting the movie to the Worlds of DC (cinematic universe?)

In fact you would expect Dolph to be way out of his depth here in the company of such talent as Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe and Patrick Wilson but no, the Dialogue and storyline are so bad that the skill required to act in this movie brings every down to Dolph's level.

2563,jakehohnke-94259,Yet another let down for super hero movies,3,26 December 2018,"Let me start by saying that this is not the worst movie ever made, I think the people who worked on it were actually trying. However, if not for James Wans' direction, this movie would have a been a 2/10. It is a good looking movie, and it is fun, but it's just bad. The script probably being the main problem. Too many characters to introduce, too many storylines going on at once, and frankly just not very exciting. Super hero movies seem to feel the need to throw a joke into every scene but it is just distracting and not at all funny most of the time. How people are giving this a 10/10, which in my opinion should be reserved for only the best movies ever made, I really do not know. The acting is ok at best, but i still cringed at the line delivery in some of the scenes. I'm not trying to hate on this movie, just trying to make sure you don't go into this movie with high expectations like I did, becasue you will be let down. One more thing, the tones throughout the movie are very jumpy which leads to feeling like you're watching two different movies and it can be very irritating.",Aquaman

2574,adamjedynakba,Disappointing,6,30 December 2018,"After reading many highly rated reviews I had very high hopes, but sadly I was disappointed.
Visually this movie was a masterpiece. That is the only reason to see this movie. Too many flat and corny jokes, plot generic and 30mins after the film I instantly forgot about the movie.
The actor who plays aquaman is likeable and the visual effects is what kept me in my seat.
Peaople say this was the best DC movie of the past 2 years. That is wrong. People must have forgotten about Wonder Woman.",Aquaman

Aqua man is probably my favorite DC movie right now. It's different and not a movie anyone would have really expected. The budget on this movie was used perfectly on the cgi. The way the actors portrayed their characters was again, reasonable. The only tiny problem I have with the movie how ever is Nicole Kidman's Character. She in my opinion drags the story. That is all i have to say.",Aquaman

2585,jaibayley,Aquaman just dosen't make big waves,5,9 February 2019,Now don't get me wrong Aquaman was okay it just wasn't kind of film that I enjoyed rather that much I tjust felt like DC's version of an underwater Black Panther someone has to step up to be the heir of an ancient kingdom that has been technologically advanced and a vengeful person wants to be the ruler of Atlantis (Wakanda) and there is even a battle to the death between Aquaman and vulko (T'challa and Kilmonger) but that is just my perspective. Christ this movie even has an octopus (yes a bloody octopus) doing his own drum solo (Anthony doing drum solo in Ant-man?),Aquaman

2588,cdvreviews,I didn't hate it...but I wouldn't say I was overly impressed either.,6,16 February 2019,"Once home to the most advanced civilization on Earth, the city of Atlantis is now an underwater kingdom ruled by the power-hungry King Orm. With a vast army at his disposal, Orm plans to conquer the remaining oceanic people -- and then the surface world. Standing in his way is Aquaman, Orm's half-human, half-Atlantean brother and true heir to the throne. With help from royal counselor Vulko, Aquaman must retrieve the legendary Trident of Atlan and embrace his destiny as protector of the deep. (Credit: Google)I'm not a fan of DC films for the most part, but I accepted my friend's invitation to go see this in theatres. It looks great, it's visually stunning and well-acted, but it's a bit of a tedious experience. It runs about 20 minutes too long and the pacing is highly inconsistent. Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of action, but even when it's throwing all that action in your face, it's never truly exciting, I prefer Marvel films because they know how to properly balance everything. The acting definitely can't be faulted. Jason Momoa is a very good Aquaman. He's got charisma to spare and was the main reason I was able to tolerate sitting in the theatre for as long as I did. Amber Heard oozes sex appeal and does a great job as Mera, Nicole Kidman is always a treat to watch, and this time is no different. The always dependable, Willem Dafoe is excellent as Aquaman's mentor. My only gripe is Patrick Wilson's performance. He was a dull villain, in my opinion. It was also great to see Dolph Lundgren have a decent part in a major film once again.
This movie is not horrible, but it's not something I'm ever going to go out of my way to see again either. It did well at the box office, and I've read a sequel is in development. Hopefully, the sequel is more entertaining. Jason Momoa deserves it.6/10",Aquaman

2593,michaelcharles-17782,World building Awe.,8,14 March 2019,"James Wan really brings a tidal wave of action and adventure for Aquamans first solo film. The epic scale of the Seven Kingdoms to the ferocious looking Trench make you believe it's an alien world present on Earth. The cast from Jason Mamoa to Amber Heard ,Yahya Abdul-Mateen to Patrick Wilson keep you enthralled from beginning to end. It truly is a heroes journey. Definitely a recommend from me.",Aquaman
2594,maddrik,Best Superhero movie to date,10,16 March 2019,"The most impressive superhero movie so far, and I thought it was important enough to add my review given the recent senseless negative commentary which could put some off from enjoying it sooner than later. There have been good and mediocre superhero movies over the past few years but Aquaman nails is right in every category. Awesome acting, awesome story and special effects. Casting is perfect and locations and scenery that is not CGI is incredible. No one watches this movie without knowing that it's part of a superhero franchise, so I won't make absurd comments about whether it's cheesy or cliche, it plays the part it's supposed to in the movie experience perfectly.",Aquaman
2595,agferguson-43117,Great value for money,8,26 March 2019,"I've been big fan of Aquaman ever since I started reading about his adventures in DC Comics (hah, Adventure Comics) when I was a very young kid. I grew up on an island where the ocean was the centre of my universe, its all I knew, so reading stories about heroes fighting crime in these large concrete jungles in parts of the world I'd never visited was completely alien to me. You're basically telling me tales of people living on the moon, and I couldn't relate to that. But, heroes that fought crime in the ocean? That was literally my backyard and something that my young mind could wrap its head around.The other part of the story that resonated with me was Arthur's bi-racial and bi-cultural background. He had a foot in both worlds, but was treated like an outsider by each one. That was also a feature of my childhood, growing up as a minority on an island without much of a tie to the culture of the majority.So, Aquaman was my guy.The thing that impressed me the most about the film was the ambitiousness of the filmmakers. They didn't hold back at all when making this movie. Given the underperformance and tepid reception of the DCU films to date (with the exception of Wonder Woman), it's reasonable to expect that the studio would have scaled back the production budget and made a smaller film to reduce their risk and ensure that it turned a profit. But, they didn't. They fully committed to the project and it shows; this is a very expensive looking movie.The other thing that impressed me was how closely the film sticks to the source material. Based upon the rebooted DC Comics New 52 series from the creative team of Geoff Johns, Ivan Reis and Paul Pelletier, they changed very little from the book. Inculcating Jason's Hawaiian heritage into the role of Arthur Curry and changing the sequence of events around Atlanna's time spent on the surface world with Tom Curry (which is cleaner and works better than the comic book) are the only deviations, the rest is exactly like the source material.In this day and age where they're trying to generate broad appeal amongst an audience that has a casual relationship with the character and his world, that's no small feat.The filmmakers also give us the viewing audience an extensive look at Aquaman's universe, taking us from his birthplace in Amnesty Bay to Atlantis and then on to all (or most) of the remaining undersea kingdoms all while introducing us to the main characters from those places. This could have easily caused the film to feel overstuffed, but it doesn't. It really felt like world building, which is something that Marvel has done very well with the MCU, and that allows them to tell stories beyond the typical origin stories going forward. I think this is really important for the ongoing viability of the character because not a lot of people are familiar with him and his universe.All that said, it is a bit of a silly movie, but in a good way. At no point during the film did I find it hard to suspend my disbelief. It wasn't trying to be anything other than what it is; a big, bombastic summer blockbuster tentpole movie. You're not going to find Shakespeare here, but you will find a superhero fantasy film with a little Greek mythology, Lord of The Rings, Indiana Jones, Star Wars and a smattering of horror elements. It blends together seamlessly and creates something unique amongst the superhero genre, not to mention unique amongst the typical origin story we've seen many times.The bottom line is that this movie is fun and engaging, visually stunning with great action sequences supported by a compelling enough story without leaning too heavily on comic book tropes, all while staying very faithful to the source material.This is for me the best DCU movie to date and I'm eagerly looking forward to the next installment with James Wan at the helm.",Aquaman

Usually, I'll turn off the movie and watch my own tv shows and wait to finish the movie on another night but I was SO SUCKED IN and mesmerized by the acting, storyline, and the special effects that I kept on watching till the end and COULDNT WAIT FOR a sequel. Will there be a sequel? Please tell me so!Okay, all my dramatic review aside, I guess I'm kinda a nerdy woman and a lot of it reminded me of the game WoW hahaha which is probably why I really liked the movie.

The effects in the movie were good, some great even. But the plot was all over the map, and I felt the red thread disappear the further into the movie I got. If the plot isn't good, then the story isn't good. This concept ruined the entire movie for me. It's like a twelve year old said: ""I want giant fish there. Make them fight each other right there. Unrealistic? I don't care! I just want to see giant fish fight each other! Ooh, and make the couple teleport, even though there is no technical power that can make that possible.

Were my concerns unfounded well almost I'll get the worse moment out of the way right at the start: an octopus's playing the drums did make me look around for Sebastien. Please to say otherwise I found the world they created sufficiently immersive to retain my attention.Does anyone watch comic book films for a plot? I don't think so they tend to be predictable and this is no different when Aquamans Dad sat farewell to his Mer-Queen on the pier close to his home we instantly know the ending! However, I can't be bitter about this as the films blends action and humour seamlessly for the majority of its run providing you leave the higher functions of your brain disconnected ( Physics etc of jumping out of a plane etc) and its cinematic style is brighter then many of DC attempts at creating a comic book universe to rival marvel.If you out looking for something light and fluffy to pass a couple if hours and your in the mood for some under water comic book shenanigans then you can't go far wrong.",Aquaman

2621,scrardft,Aquaman triumphs at the box office!,10,23 January 2020,"Aquaman took it for the DC Comics Universe and becomes their highest-grossing movie worldwide, surpassing Wonder Woman, Superman and even Nolan's Batman trilogy individual films. Who would've thought? People always demean Aquaman so he deservedly got a Huge film! Massive production. A whole new world had to be created underwater, amazing effort. Special effects galore and the script is good enough.Apparently they made the most out of the superhero, they made the most out of Jason Momoa, treated him good and he shined at moments. However, hardcore fans might complain of his portrayal as a bar thug tattooed kinda trashy guy (that's what some reviews say?) as opposed to the comic version sophisticated and smarter.
I love Amber Heard, she is such a gorgeous woman, to me she is very charismatic. Nicole Kidman, nice special character and great presence. Patrick Wilson and Willem Dafoe delivered accordingly. Black Manta's motivation left me a little incomplete.Definitely a movie that doesn't emphasize on the acting but in the end, I liked the conclusion so much, it appealed to my taste. I was satisfied, it's a crowd pleaser, nicely written. I'm not gonna knock it down because it's not at the masterpiece level of The Dark Knight, but shall support DC because they really need to compete (after many let-downs) and they did it with Aquaman, pleasantly surprised.

Which leads me to....The CGI is ridiculous! Who on earth allowed that? I found it really tough to watch. It reminds me of one of these cheesy dragon fantasy pictures bathed in neon lights. I'd rather go in a cheap hotel bathroom and enjoy the view than watch that movie again. A lot of the movie scenes were more like a video game, with a lot of badly fully animated scenes. Certainly worth an eye cancer warning!The actors dont do a bad job (Im not a Heard fan but she was quite believable) although quite wooden at times (might be down to the CGI..).

2660,morrow2522,Don't bite,4,31 December 2018,"One thing Pixar should have taught anyone making movies is that the story comes first. Without characters and situations that engage an audience, without screenwriters who can craft meaningful dialogue, all the CGI in the universe can't save a movie. Actors that can make us believe they are the characters they portray, and directors and film editors that shape a film into a meaningful whole can make a good story into a memorable experience. Aquaman has none of those things. It has the CGI, but unless you have the critical capacity of a 10-year old, that isn't nearly enough. This isn't a movie, it's just a bunch of poorly written, badly acted set pieces that look good, but leave an audience wanting so much more.
For awhile, I thought maybe this was going for the Pacific Rim effect-laughably over the top, but no, it's just a mess of a movie, a waste of money and time. The dialogue is laughable, the story is cliched, silly and dull-witted, and the acting is about at the level of a Power Rangers episode. Save the trouble of finding out for yourself, and don't be fooled by any of these 10/10 reviews. Both of our sons (17 & 20) nearly fell asleep watching this, and my wife did.

This film has what I will call ""Venom Syndrome"" which means it switches genres every 10-20 minutes. It seems to have no clue what it wants to be and it also seems there were several writers tasked with certain types of scenes and it is...glaringly obvious.Like others have said, there are several scenes where it's like watching a live-action Little Mermaid in which the ""romance"" is more painful to watch than Hayden Christensen harass Natalie Portman into Stockholm syndrome in Attack Of the Clones.Then it tries to emulate Star Wars in many ways (even underwater space-battles), make a brief statement on man's environmental impact once in a while, turn Aquaman into a freaking water-bending prophecied one, introduce some gadgets that make Spy Kids look practical, Aquaman apparently exists within the Monster verse with kaiju, and can we please talk about the CHEESY armor the soldiers from Atlantis wear? Good god, it looks like they went to the value bin at the studio and took out the rejects for Tron and Super Mario Bros.The best things I can say about this film is the cinematography is very nicely done, and the special effects/CGI is rather excellent save for some de-aging for flashbacks. The hair effects underwater are noticeably superior to any I've personally seen and the color palate is spectacular.TL;DR: This film is a visual spectacle, but with a schizophrenic script, subpar writing, and some truly incompetent chemistry/acting it is like experiencing the fever dream of Gary Busey himself and it is not exactly easy.",Aquaman

I never laughed at the clearly intentionally placed jokes because they almost always fell flat and laughed out loud at scenes that were clearly not meant to be funny but felt so overdone that they slipped into the ridiculous and felt like a superhero spoof movie (giant black manta helmet, cliche slow motion shots with hair blowing in the wind and longing looks, eating a rose, cringy kissing scene... Really, it was hilarious and I was waiting for Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nilson to turn up at any moment)
At times it felt like a text book rundown of every stylistic means from 'introduction to movie making 101' ca. 1985.The other thing that bothered me was that they clearly 'borrowed' whole scenes and lines from other movies which I noticed a few times and it kind of ruined it for me.

That was surprising because the movie didn't have a dull moment, and was visually amazing. But maybe that was part of the reason: an overload of CGI, anti-aging, and failing to slow down long enough for us to really connect to the characters.
The pros:
Colorful visuals and unique underwater effects.
Fast pacing.
Diverse characters and creatures.
Some fan throwbacks, like the Aquaman telepathy rings.The cons:
Too much cgi, making it too unbelievable.
Acting was mediocre.
Plot was predicatable.
Time was irrelevant and not respected.
Faces looked almost animated and unrealistic (if that's what saltwater does for aging, I'm in!)
The distinction between humans and meta humans was not always respected, as humans thrown and beaten severely often get right back up and continue the fight. And the unclear rule about who can or cannot breathe above water was not well thought out (they all evolved from land, but then devolved?)Overall, it was entertaining, but nowhere close to Wonder Woman. I may have even liked Justice League more than this one. Go see it in the theater for the visuals, especially if you have passes or discounts.

I'm sure warner brothers hired aliens to do the vfx for this movie because the animation is just so so so beautiful and unbelievable! Being a 3D generalist I know how much hard work is there behind making all these scenes possible and it just made me emotional after watching this movie.

I went with a group of 13 ladies the first time (My husband didn't want to listen to the banter of that) and he and I went the following week after I promised him that I thought he would like it.

The good guys do something bad , some of them faces are covered, the good guy comes most likely the faceless guys die.
2. A ,,evil someone"" wants to do something bad that would affect everyone
3. The hero doesn't want to intervene, but it's convince either by someone or by watching something.
4. The bad guy is cocky and sent just some of his milion strong army to interfere.
5. Against all odds the good guy, defeats evil and also he gets the girl
6. He shows mercy towards the evil guy as he was weaponlessThere you have it people, sure it looks awesome but won't stand the test of time, you know why? Because the story it's not masterful written, it's alright, but I for one don't remember alright, I remember Witcher 3, and Infinity War, not Wonder Woman or BvsS .MCU has a character base that is similar to DCU but in the former the story , the feel and the guts to do something awesome it's 10 years in the future.Is this movie worth it?

I realize this is a comic book movie, but still. Maybe Marvel has set my standards too high.It's not like the movie is a complete disaster. The world building and production design are downright amazing. This has got to be one of the most visually striking films I've ever seen, and that's saying something in today's day and age.The problem is the script. The premise is great: Arthur must find the magic trident to become king of Atlantis and save the world. Classic comic book/architypal awesomeness. Where things get bad is in the execution. Bad dialogue. Bad acting. Over-the-top and unnecessary additions to the plot. Jokes that don't work... at all.I kind of felt like the pendulum has swung too far the other way for DC right now.

In this current age of overhyped superhero films this movie is a formulaic as they get. Every single occurrence from the ostentatious opening voice-over to the sun rise over dear dad's lighthouse is utterly predictable and poorly produced. I am ready for a superhero film that doesn't try to rest on the tired laurels of ""stunning"" cgi because, guess what, we've seen it all and we are at full capacity for these expensive light shows. Give us, instead, a story, some actors and a well-written screenplay. I more than understand that this movie could not have come off without some cgi but this movie relies on it and would truly be nothing without it; it exists as a 2.5 hour fireworks display with zero substance. It's got a few big names earning, hopefully, very large paychecks in order to fund their next real movie (i.e. Willem Defoe, Nicole Kidman) but overall I was embarrassed for them having to stoop to this level. In fact, I was kind of embarrassed sitting in the theatre proving I'd paid real money to see this. Now, I do have a soft spot for Jason Momoa because he was a great Khal Drogo and seems like a genuinely likable guy.

2710,anna10116,"Visually stunning, but mediocre in every other way",3,2 February 2019,"I am surprised that this movie currently has 7.4 on IMDb. This would be a good movie for a 13-year-old going to see their first PG13 movie - incredibly easy to follow and visually exciting. As an adult, I found it to be cringey and generic the whole time. When you meet a villain, evil music plays. When you meet a hero, good music plays, and their hair blows in the wind - nothing is left to the viewer to figure out. Whoever did the music for this movie...should find a new career path. There is a scene where they go to Africa, and a version of the song ""Africa"" is played...pure cringe. The characters are undeveloped, and Jason Momoa, while visually a perfect action hero, cannot deliver authentic emotion through Aquaman's dialogue (I prefer him speaking Dothraki). The fighting scenes were shot beautifully, but there was so much screen time devoted to fight scenes that they became boring...I mean, we already know who's going to win. The other annoying thing was the cheap strategy of having an extremely quiet moment followed by an incredibly loud noise to startle you - it would've been fine to employ this strategy once, but it happened about four times in the movie, as if the writers couldn't think of any other way to create excitement. This is a dumbed-down superhero movie that you could watch with your kids, but don't waste your money on it if you're expecting an Iron Man or Black Panther level of quality.",Aquaman

This felt like the story was written by a procrastinating teenager the night before. The plot is so predictable: go get this item, go beat up this guy, go beat up another guy, fall in love with the only young woman in the movie, become king.

Like all the other offerings, it's overblown, wooden, one dimensional and over reliant on over the top CGI.
As a child I was always a DC fan and I want them more than anything to bring this thing together, but Marvel have certainly laid down a tough marker for how it should be and DC still haven't met that challenge.
The main thing missing from the film is charm and simplicity, sure Momoa just about saves the day and I think he can develop Aquaman into a loved character, and the film is a step in the right direction. But 10 out of 10 it most certainly isn't.",Aquaman

The action sequences that followed were straight out of Power Rangers (90s), the acting screamed 'green screen!', the story line was for 8 year olds and it all added up to one big cliched steaming rhymes with curd.Now, I had no business watching this, no business whatsoever, because I still have a little electrical activity in my brain and I'm 42 years old, but I fancied a bit of fun and didn't get it.

Jason delivers a solid aquaman performance true to the Justice League ruffian of the previous movie. What drags it down is actually the storyline itself. You never fully get to understand Arthur's drive and even less so the supporting characters. And the middle act is slow and the indiana jones-esque hunt for clues seem out of place.An overall good popcorn movie definitely worth seeing.

It felt like it wanted to be Thor Ragnorak so badly.
To say that these comics are the ""darker"" versions it was silly, two brothers fighting and the mom telling them to stop. It lacked any decent bad guy, I was waiting for Willem Dafoes character to turn out to be the real villain, instead he was strange Mr Miyagi type character. Not good",Aquaman

There is an extra villian character who gets more personal scenes for development than the main villian character and the main female character combined and the guy gets killed immediately with no contribution to the main story. There is even a random scene of him spray painting an armor. There is so much missing in the films development but they had time to film a scene with random spray painting of a random dude who will just die.
The music sounds terrible and does not fade into each other properly, it is very very random.

Well, it's a movie guys, repeat after me: ""It is not your comic book"". As a Marvel fan I cannot count how many character they've butchered through the years. I was also uncertain by the choice of Jason Momoa, honestly after Ben Affleck as Batman I was expecting the worst. However I must admit that he is very good and convincing in the part, except for the contact lenses, those are horrible, but that's a minor thing and definitely not his fault. In general this movie is not perfect but the story makes sense, it has a good rhythm and the underwater world is astonishingly depicted. I don't understand the need of CGI to make actors younger, when they could have just chosen younger actors for that part. Despite this fact the action scenes are amazing, a crescendo of comics-like colours and composition with the apex during the end battle.

Once again Jason us perfect for this role I think they tried making it more light-hearted but instead they made it more cartoonish.

Also nothing with Jason Mamoa can ever be a complete letdown. I was also surprised by Nicole Kidman being the love interest because in my head I thought she was Lois Lane but turns out I was just remembering her as Batman's girlfriend and I was very confused as to why one supers gf was another moms for a little while.

People that give it 10 stars are hopeless and hapless neophytes. The first 15 min are especially cringeworthy as every ridiculous clichées imaginable are employed to try to get the viewers in the mood but inexorably fail to do so. The music and sound effects are particularly annoying as it made me seriously wonder if all of this was a bad joke. While I don't think Jason Momoa himself makes a bad Aquaman the rest of the cast seems to have been assembled by a random algorithms spitting out washed up stars. I remember seeing better CGI in Jurrassic Park in 1993. So many other kinds of wrong in this movie. DC comics just keeps missing the mark and it's pathetic.,Aquaman

This added a real touch to the proceedings, unlike some recent superhero movies where either you don't care about the actor or the action never really poses a thread to the hero.

2762,baibing-chen,"Good visuals, bad dialogue",6,26 December 2018,"Pros: you can tell they spent a lot of money on CGI and the visual effects, which were amazing. The action sequences were also above average (this is coming from me, a person who think almost every fight scene in Hollywood movie sucks 'cause I compared them to Jackie Chan and Jet Li movies in the 90's). The acting was good in MY opinion, but I'll get to what overshadowed the acting in the Cons section. The storyline was decent, they at least TRIED to make it relevant and that the foe had a purpose, compared to Steppenwolf in the previous movie that we should no longer speak of.Cons: The amount of cheesiness in this movie almost killed me. I mean this is pretty close to the first superman movie where I just laughed for the entirety of the movie. Given how good some of these actors were, I truly felt bad that they had to deliver some of these lines, and I honestly don't understand how they could've delivered these lines on set without bursting into crying laughter. The second con is the story. Yes it was better than justice league, but that's not saying much. Yes they gave the villains a purpose to do what they did, but they didn't explore the characters or even try to make them more unique. Too many dramatic scenes with explosions out of nowhere and people walking out of the water slowly. This is not Bay Watch or 007.Overall: I didn't go into the movie with high expectations, and I came out not surprised in any way. I am happy with the visuals and actions in this movie, but I suggest the writers put more time in making the dialogues better in the future DC movies.",Aquaman
2763,yasas_bandara,"Inconsistent storyline, plot & characters",6,21 March 2019,"I'm only focusing on the storyline and characters here. The special effects and stuff was great. Acting was bad and there was little character development.This movie suffers from the same problem common to many superhero movies these days. The hero can be regarded a hero ONLY IN THE CONTEXT of the absolutely stupid plan/purpose of the villain.1. King Orm wants to scorch the surface. OK but then what? What are they going to do with all that land? They can't possibly expect to rule it. Are they planning to sell the surface to the highest alien bidder? (it would make perfect sense if this was the case) Only the royalists can even breathe on land. 99% of their population can't. There is no resource on land that they crave. They have absolutely nothing to gain through an invasion and a lot to lose. So what's the point?
2. And just because king Orm's plan is absolutely ridiculous, the hero becomes the hero by stopping him. That's the whole story.
3. Now just for a moment, imagine a more sensible plan from the 'bad guy'. Let's say Orm only wanted to unite all the clans (and become ocean master) just so that he can prepare for any possible threat from the above. Let's say he's using the fear/hate for surface dweller only to gain support from the others. Say he never really planned on scorching the surface. If this was the case, can we totally vote for Arthur?
Basically, Arthur is the hero only because the bad guy's plan was just ridiculous.Now, take a look at the characters...4. Arthur is not really a hero for Atlantis. He had a little brother down there and he knew it. He says he wanted to visit him but this was clearly a lie as he never even tried. He finally came (only as an enemy) when he thought his loved ones were in danger.
5. Now Orm on the other hand, knows that his brother above was trained by a traitor to take his throne. He also knows that Arthur wanted to do nothing with Atlantis. Orm says he hated Arthur. However, Orm never tries to harm Arthur (or his father) in any way even though he knew Arthur could become a threat someday. Even when Arthur comes as an enemy, Orm still tries to send him back before the combat so that he doesn't have to kill him. So, which one of them is more honest & honorable?
6. Vulko is a pure traitor. He swore to serve the throne but trains the half-breed to take the throne from the pure-blood king for no logical reason. He just sits there and lies to the face of his king on a daily basis. When Orm asks ""Why?"", Vulko's reply is just laughable. How on earth can he possibly know that Arthur would have become a better king than Orm would ever be WHEN ORM WAS JUST A KID?? He started training Arthur when Orm was even younger that Arthur.
7. When Orm says he had dedicated his whole life to Atlantis, Vulko does not deny that. So there is clearly no reason why he would support Arthur (since the time Orm was just a kid) unless he wanted to make Arthur king based on the Queen's beliefs. Why can't he just say that?
8. If Vulko really served the throne (as he claimed), he could have tried to unite the brothers after the king's death. Remember that Orm had no other family except his brother above. Vulko doesn't do that but just keeps on believing that Arthur MUST be the king they're looking for.",Aquaman

A hopeful, borderline realistic, joyful and emotional tone is what everyone wants from comic book movies. Hats off to James Wan for creating visuals which are mix of Avatar, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Star Wars and pay homage to some of Zack Snyder's work as well ( look for Aquaman swimming straight up to surface - that shot is same as Man of Steel Flight sequence)",Aquaman

2768,lucasohara17,A step in the right direction.,7,8 December 2018,"This movie is pretty entertaining. That, however, doesn't mean that it has a great script. The truth is, DC played safe on this one, and it pays off, mostly.I was never bored throughout this movie, but that is not because of the clever dialogue, or the the amazing score. No, it's because everything in it is incredibly over-the-top. No kidding, be it the heroes or the villains, the action scenes or the romantic ones, every single thing in this movie is kind of exaggerated. Sometimes it worked for me, but sometimes it didn't. With that in mind, let's get to my pros and cons.First, what i liked the most: the direction, specially during the action scenes. James Wan managed to differentiate himself from that Snyder style of action pretty well (there's still one or two ""Snyder slowmo"" kind of shots, but that's it). The fight sequences were well choreographed and shot, with wide angles for most of the time. It was very pleasant to see. Now, I usually don't like when movies start looking like videogames, but it didn't really bother me here. During the gigantic CGI battlescenes you've seen in the trailers, the amount of elements on-screen can be overwhelming, but for the most part, they are well enough shot that you can differentiate what's going on, and so they eventually become quite satisfying.
The interaction between the two lead characters is too very entertaining, but then again, because Aquaman is just really extravagant most of the time, so it becomes this quirky, awkward chemestry. But that leads me into the cons.Yeah, remember when i said everything was exaggerated in here? Well, sometimes that leads to some really weird and unfitting, or just unintentionally funny scenes. For example (and I don't wanna spoil here), the movie will have this really awkward romantic song playing throughout this ""lovey dovey"" scene, but that just took me out of the film because it's so over-the-top and doesn't fit at all with the previously established tone of the film. It was weird. Not only that, but this certain character will constantly scream during battle scenes like he's a football commentator announcing a goal, like he's really badass when in reality it just comes off as ""just too much"". I won't lie, I started laughing after a while because he repeats it quite a few times during the movie. Most of these are nitpicks, but because this movie blows everything out of proportion, these small problems end up REALLY standing out.
Some bigger complaints are: characters having really flimsy convictions and changing them in the matter of seconds for weak motivations. The movie is also filled with cliches, but that's mostly because Aquaman follows the standard superhero movie formula. On top of that, i found some inconsistencies regarding character's abilities (like, it is established that inhabitants of Atlantis cannot breath outside of the water, but during certain moments they do it just fine).
The CGI is very inconsistent, from this gorgeous color filled underwater kingdom, to some pretty terrible green screen effects.
The dialogue, is mostly not very well written. Some characters don't suffer from it, including Aquaman, because it ends up fitting their personality, but some characters end up sounding really artificial.
The acting is fine. Willem Dafoe is Willem Dafoe, Jason Momoa is Jason Momoa. Temuera Morrison, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren all did fine with their respective characters. I think the worst ones are the villains, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen and specially Patrick Wilson (who's character is the embodiment of ""over-the-top""). Too bad, I don't consider him a bad actor, but goddamn was he subpar in this one.
I don't have major complaints wit the editing. It's pretty good, except once or twice where there's just too much going on on-screen and I couldn't follow it, but those were rare moments. However, the sound design has some odd choices. There's this scene where a certain character is handling a knife, and every time he gently touched it, the knife went ""KATCHING"" with that standard blade sound , but just extremely loudly and exaggerated. I just thought to myself ""what?"".Despite the fact that i nitpicked a lot, i think this movie works more than it doesn't. Yes, it's as a standard superhero movie as you can get, but it's a good one. Even with all of the odd choices and apparent problems, it's not a bad movie. The direction is quite good, some shots are fantastic and the fight sequences were very satisfying. It's pure, blown out of proportion, massive CGI fest fun, and I think that's enough for me. For an Aquaman movie, it does everything it should.",Aquaman
2769,kelvinhirst,It's flashy! That's about it....,6,18 December 2018,"There's really not much else to say about this movie. It's clear they just wanted to dazzle the audience with as much CGI as they could muster into as little time as possible, meanwhile making NONE of the terrible jokes land.The story is.... well there isn't one really. It is so all over the place and disconnected that it is not easy to follow at all. Both Amber and Mamoa are dull as dishwater, which many knew before this movie and sadly this does nothing to remedy that either.The movie is a mess, the story is a mess - and when you leave a movie thinking that the only enjoyable part was the CGI then there is something wrong.Clearly, this movie was made for the cash grab and WB once more PROVE what we have all known for a long time; They simply cannot create comic book movies. Leave it to the experts.",Aquaman
2770,Mattmag729,Laughable,2,9 July 2020,"Casting, Acting, Music, and Script are all deplorable. This ended up being a weird mix of Sons of Anarchy + Power Rangers (ie Black Manta's costume). I heard the line ""oh man"" more than once, which is not a good thing.For a movie stock full of great actors (outside of Mamoa and Heard), it's surprising how laughable every single scene is. Special effects look nice if you ever wanted to see a live action Finding Nemo.I'd say that if you're looking for a movie to 'pretend' to watch, this is a solid pick. Otherwise, throw on Joker or any MCU movie.",Aquaman
2771,hunterhikes,Terrible Writing/Directing,2,18 April 2021,"They've ruined Aquaman with some of the worst writing and directing I've ever seen in a movie with this kind of budget. Why is i that the DCU can't get a decent director other than Zac Snyder and Patty Jenkins?I get that with a movie like Aquaman, some CGI is to be expected, but the story should have been the real center of the movie.The writers tried to cram far too much into this Aquaman, ruining what should have been a more intimate exploration of his character's backstory and coming to terms with his powers. This was an absolute mess. I've changed my rating from 3 stars to two stars, but that may be too many.Aquaman is my favorite of the DC super heroes, so I resent that the same writers and director are being used for the second installment, because this one was terrible.",Aquaman

2775,hideaki1992,"A very good DCEU movie, however not the best. *SPOILER ALERT*",8,19 December 2018,"I enjoyed this movie very much. The visuals, the cast, Jason Momoa as Aquaman, you can't go wrong. The movie overall was very good. The action was amazing, no doubt about it and the plot was great too. It gave us an in-depth history of Aquaman, taught us a lot about DCEU's Atlantis and it was great.My only issue with the movie which I think ahs escaped everyone and I was the only one who noticed it. Timeline people. This movie is set after the events of Justice League. So tell me this... with all the destruction going and we are talking, ships moving into towns and bays, explosions and people dying in an Italian town and what not.. Don't you think Superman would have been there in damned seconds to save the day? Or the rest of Justice League? See what I mean by timeline? The timeline is wrong. I see why they did it that way, but it still makes no sense for Sups not to be there when all that was happening. Unless, they showed somewhere that Superman wasn't on the planet at the time. I don't know.. so for me that was the only plot hole.Otherwise, I highly recommend you go watch this at the cinema. It is a good movie, worth your money and time.",Aquaman
2776,jbswift9,Aquaman done justice! DC on the right path,8,16 December 2018,"This movie has everything you want and need in a blockbuster film. Comedy, Romance, Story, and last but certainly not least Action! Jason Momoa IS the perfect man for the job. He and all the characters worked out so well on the screen and I think that was one of the most important things to make it such an enjoyable film. Black Manta was my 2nd favorite character behind Aquaman in the film..he did such a good job and was a perfect co-villain behind Orm. I think I'm going to watch it again but on IMAX to really get the full effect of the beautiful cinematography. Only thing I would change (and I'm nitpicking right now) is the score..I feel some of the songs didn't fit. But other than that I really enjoyed the film and can't wait for part 2!",Aquaman

The acting was below average, the plot was way too predictable, the characters were underdeveloped, and the lines ... OH DEAR GOD! PUT ME OUT OF MISERY! The Power Rangers had had better lines with their scripts in the 90's!I can't say that this movie did it Justice (no pun intended) for me just because of very good CGI and Sound Editing.

Anyway, let's go straight to the point, the sfx are amazing, the plot is surprisingly good, the villains actually had character and a reason! Everyone gave their best and actually sent some emotions.

2788,evan-dahms,Most memorable DC film yet,7,11 January 2019,"I was initially hesitant about seeing aquaman since most of the other DC movies that have come out recently were just derivative, generic rubbish (with the exception of wonder woman). However I decided to give it a go and must say I quite enjoyed it. It has a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe in that it's very colorful and over the top. Action sequences are extremely well done and quite a few scenes are just stunning in terms of lighting and effects. The story is fairly basic but unpredictable enough compared to the standard superhero movie to be a bit more engaging. Some of the characters could have been fleshed out more but Jason Mamoa was a perfect casting choice and really steals the show. The pacing is ok, I was never bored but some scenes felt a bit rushed and others seemed to go on for a bit longer than was really necessary. I found myself wanting a bit more humor and a little less campiness (the costumes especially were a bit much for me) but overall I found the film to be enjoyable and refreshing compared to the rest of the DC movies. Aquaman is essentially a big 80's cartoon brought to life with truly stunning cinematography and a strong cast. Definitely worth checking out in my opinion",Aquaman
2789,thomas-schwiertz,"To much CGI, to less story",5,22 December 2018,The CGI effects where overpowering the whole movie. It was almost impossible to follow the anyway already thin storyline with all the CGI effects going round. The whole movie was very predictable. If they would have spend more time on the story and character development it could have been a good movie but this way you just see CGI effect everywhere and the story is getting lost.

The film features the two antagonists just enough to do them justice and pays it off nicely to end the movie. Relationships are established that made the film full of heart and respect for the original material. A lot of reviewers talk of abrupt scene progression, but in my opinion it was an element that added to my interest in the plot.

2798,justis-lemuel,Terrible (spoilers),1,22 December 2018,"I saw this movie in theatres with one of my good friends and let me tell you this movie was BAD. We are both Marvel fans but are also interested in DC comics and I want DC to succeed. This movie just set DC farther back from Marvel than it already was. Everything from the cgi to the score was so unbearably awful that all we could do was laugh. In the first scene when the Queen was awkwardly eating a fish out of the tank I thought ""okay I guess that could be funny if you think about it"" and then the military/guard people came to take her back to Atlantis and their costumes were so horrendous but still I thought ""I will give this the benefit of the doubt and I'm sure the movie will be better than this"". However, I was wrong. It gets so much worse than I ever would have thought. There were so many plot lines to take in at once it was just so confusing. Some people might say ""well if you read the comics you would already understand a lot of it"" but that's not how an origin story should be. I would understand if there was multiple movies before this that I needed to watch in order to understand but there wasn't. This is an origin movie. Don't even get me started on the music... what the hell were they thinking?! The ""love story"" was no LOVE story at all! They looked at each other sexually twice in the movie and at the end i guess they're in love or something i don't know! At the beginning of the movie ""Aquaman"" seems to be invincible and gets a grenade launcher shot at his chest and he's fine. But then later in the movie he gets stabbed and almost dies..... maybe i missed something??? I probably fell asleep from BOREDOM bc this movie dragged on and was so hard to follow. Do not waste your money to see this movie it is unbearably awkward. I have much more i could talk about that is wrong with this movie but I'm tired of typing. I don't know how this movie could be watched by producers and movie makers and actually be sent out to theatres. You have been warned. Unbelievable.",Aquaman

2801,randycubs,Potatoes Rating: Instant Mashed,4,22 December 2018,"Allow me to quote Raj from The Big Bang Theory. ""I don't want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.""Oh, DC. I thought you'd learned! Wonder Woman was proof, wasn't it? All of the elements of great movie storytelling were present. It was wonderfully cast, carefully scripted. The film evolved at a crisp, but comfortably artistic pace, a tribute to careful editing. And when the magnificent amazon finally revealed her power at exactly the right moment as she stepped majestically onto the battlefield? Goosebumps.So, how do you explain the obvious regression of Aquaman?The casting is...meh. Jason Momoa is a fine, physical specimen of the fish man, but his hero is startlingly flat. The rest of the cast might work fine if this was a made for television movie, but it isn't. It's a major theatrical vehicle and DC has failed to bring in a suitable stable of supporting actors to carry the weight. And even though it's unfair to continually compare the DC universe to Marvel's, the parallel is unescapable. Ant Man, who ranks in the Marvel pantheon probably even lower than where Aquaman stands in the DC hero collection, carries two stand-alone movies effortlessly. Aquaman struggles from the beginning of the film, through its tedious center, to its final cheesy conclusion to justify the film's reason to live. Storytelling is the key, and where Wonder Woman earned a well-deserved A, Aquaman receives an equally merited D. Perhaps if the writers had chosen to meditate for two hours on the character's back story and built methodically toward a big reveal, I might be submitting a very different review. But instead the writing bumps along like an old roller coaster, jerking us through rickety rails of track, always in a hurry to get us to the steep climb and the furious fall to the end. None of it is satisfying. Instead of feeling like a big budget superhero film, the movie increasingly feels like a sad mishmash of Godzilla and Finding Nemo, although Nemo did a much better job of creating an interesting undersea world.DC continues to give us heroes but can't seem to connect us to them. It's the primary flaw in the DC universe. It's characters are too cold and detached from the audience. It's a problem that will only be fixed through better movie storytelling.I rank movies like I rank potatoes, because I love potatoes. Aquaman receives my Instant Mashed Potatoes ranking which roughly translates this way. They will do if you're in a hurry, but they generally suck. And in this case, Raj was right.

But I didn't expect it to be so bad. There were a lot of other movies thrown in and the movie was all over the place as a result.I cannot understand all of the positive reviews here. People awarding 10 stars should not be allowed to watch proper movies!There are Stormtroopers (who other reviewers have actually referred to as Stormtroopers!), there are dinosaurs, there are Sword in the Stone and Pinocchio references. Not references actually like actually just thrown at the audience.Aquaman is unlikeable for me. A waster who just likes to drink (""Quickly... I'm missing happy hour ho ho""). The romance between him and Amber Heard is so obvious from the beginning. And talking of obvious - the mention of Nicole Kidman being dead - I think maybe 85 or 100 times?! Shocker - she's not dead after all! And the whole movie happened because she was dead!! Absurd.Everything was forced and everything fell flat. The scene where Arthur pulls the sword from the king or something was insane - in the bad way. A huge boring creature stops him until Aquaman tells him to deal with it or some such thing and then says ""well, no-one has pulled the trident from the king's hand yet... so when you fail, I'm super hungry."" Or something like that. I was struggling to stay awake honestly. The movie runs at around 2-3 days in length. Can't be sure. So many bad jokes thrown in.Someone should make future DC writers/directors sit down and watch 10,000 hours of Marvel movies before starting the next flop.Or actually just watch one Marvel film.

Be aware this movie shouldn't be charged...at least They could pay us to watch. There's also a very flat Villain ""BlackManta"" very forgetable...so much that I already forgot if he died or not...I'm also very sad for Nicole Kidman....this movie should have not be on her list me movies...powerful movies and then This...

2813,charlesebowman,Did everyone else see a different movie?,1,25 January 2019,"Predictable, dull, poor special effects, silly meaningless scenes, poor acting.A lot of wide feet posturing, and billowing deep voices; but it does not deliver. Packing a slap with a wet fish; this one opens being silly and gets more silly.
So I took it at face value and tongue in cheek movie for the almost cartoon superhero.
But even that was too much for this. The special effects were so poor, I tasked myself with finding the worst ones! Who morphed the faces onto the cartoons did well, but it was so OTT that you cannot take it seriously.
Bright lighting/lights take your eyes away from the scenes, but it is so poor; I swear Willem Dafoe is laughing while he says his lines.
The narrator made me laugh - how silly and far fetched - too far fetched for people, maybe in a cartoon.
The storyline was created ad-hoc during the movie, seemingly, to fit in and add something to this POS.
It really is steaming, you can taste it the smell is that bad.
It is BORING and unintentionally funny' it's that bad..
My daughters school play had lines delivered better than this - seriously.
You may find something to like about this movie; I couldn't.The sequel WILL be avoided, unless I have no arms, legs and cannot control my mouth or communicate at all. This is so bad it should get it's own category.",Aquaman

Big praise for Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson Dolph Lundgren and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II for their incredible performances in this movie.James Wan manages to deliver an amazing action film with unbelievable and beautiful visuals and leaves you wanting even more. If you saw Man Of Steel BvS and Justice League, but you thought they could be better and you loved Wonder Woman, this movie is for you.DC sets the record straight and leaves fans waiting anxious for Shazam, Wonder Woman 1984 and Birds Of Prey.Again, do yourself a favor and go see this movie (IMAX is so worth it, believe me!)",Aquaman

I haven't seen Shazam yet.",Aquaman
2823,RomulusAurelius,A redeeming film after a series of dissapointments from the DCEU.,8,17 December 2018,"Redemption, that's how to describe this film, Aquaman doesn't follow down the dark path that films like Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad did (and failed miserably) and goes on to deliver what films are supposed to be in the first place: Entertainament.Aquaman has all the ingredients to be not just the best DCEU film in the lot, but to be one of the best Superhero films in the genre.Jason Momoa plays Aquaman wonderfully, even if the script can get spicy at times with his lines, he dominates the screen and is a joy to watch.
His sidekick, Mera, played by Amber Heard, is a memorable and gracious character to go along with Aquaman, not only does Heard play as the character in such a rich and tasteful manner, making it all look natural, but Mera herself is a well written character in this film.
I can't say much for the villains, they were mostly alright, and did their part in the film, it's also nice to see Dolph Lundgren and Willem Dafoe in a Superhero Flick, being a fan of the original Spider-Man trilogy, it's great to see Willem Dafoe in this film.The cinematography is one of the highlights of Aquaman, shot in beautiful locations including Newfoundland, Canada, Sicily, Morocco and underwater itself, it's usually difficult for films to have underwater sequences and make them entertaining, one of which include James Bond's Thunderball (1965), which dragged the film, but this is Aquaman we're talking about, and he has no problem handling the waters.The script itself is good, and the cast dominates it, but it can get spicy at times, there can be scenes where they're supposed to be serious, but then Aquaman breaks a curse word or an insulting remark, something that while it might go with half-human personality, it sort of underminds many scenes, it's not enough however to become a serious problem.The music is not very memorable, while it does its job, none of it seems catchy, at least to myself, it's usually a long road when it comes to making a hell of a theme for a Superhero film, such as John William's Superman theme or Danny Elfman's Spider-Man, the score fits the film, but it's not much to brag about.The use of CGI blends in well with the film, the only times I noticed obvious CGI was at the beginning with Atlanna, the fight's stunts and such are obvious, but other than that, the CGI ushers in beautiful visuals of underwater action and scenery, which fit in well with the world and plot.All in all: Aquaman succeeds as a Superhero film, it's a great action adventure flick, and an entry you just can't miss, if the DCEU continues to produce such great films, it will be in good terms with its audience after numerous bad entries.",Aquaman

The movie flaws are huge, starting with a poor music & soundtrack choice. It's an annoying mix of every type of tacky music. Where's the Leitmotiv?
A poor screenwrite bleeds all over the scene. A lot of clichés.
The mayority of the characters were Bad and the acting was a joke.

I'm not a DCEU fanboy, but just wondering since Man of Steel (which I think is a future classic) why DC movies are such a tough act to follow. Aquaman is highly entertaining. The unterwater CGI is phenomenal. It's not about some kind of story you have never heard or watched before. But Jason Momoa is the most convincing anti-hero I have seen for a long time.And not to forget Amber Heard. She's freaking hot and was a very good joice. I would say: ""All the Fish love Mandy Lane"".And now please enjoy this movie if you haven't yet!",Aquaman

Dialogue was so cringey I was close to covering my ears. I really really wanted to like this movie but the story arc(S) were just so senseless. I couldn't wait to get out of the cinema. They tried too hard to inject humor into the dialogue that it was painful to hear how obvious they tried to copy the Marvel movies. ""Ocean Master"" ??? No. Just no. Why people rated this movie so high was likely all cause of the hype and ofcourse Jason Mamoa who we all loved in Game of Thrones. But sorry not sorry, this movie is trash and I wish they did a better job like they had with Wonder Woman. The only thing I liked about watching this movie was that it ended.",Aquaman
2835,karthicdm,Aquaman-The DC's Thor,7,15 December 2018,"Comic based superhero movies are like making a movie out of stories from epics of India-Ramayanam & Mahabaratham. Most of the people already knows the story, The movie's success will be based on the way it is presented. I noticed one key point for the success of these superhero movies- Tell the story from the beginning. Deliver it slowly. Say it like you tell to a kid during his/her bed time. Most of the successful superhero movies are falling under this line. Batman triology, MCU Avengers Universe, Man of steel, Wonder Woman all succeeded because they told the story from the start and they told it slowly. If they decided to hurry things up then the result will end up like Batman Vs Superman & Justice League. Thankfully Famous horror film director James Wan made it slow and had patience to tell the story from the start.Aquaman is not so well known character for Indian Audience unlike Ironman & Batman, atleast for me, I dont know Aquaman much. I just know he is a member of Justice league, king of underwater universe called Atlantis, he can control water and he talks to fish. What is his origin? How he became the king of Atlantis? what is his Power and weakness? His emotions, his family everything is explained clearly in this movie. As STR said in vinnaithaandi varuvaya ""Avaru epadi ithukulla vantharu, avaru epadi Don aagi Billa aguraru"" Thats what the Aquaman is all about.Visuals, Graphics and Locations gives a pleasant watching experience. This is the main plus point of this movie. Throughout the movie we can witness the eye pleasing experience specially with the 3D glasses on. Be it an isolated light house, underwater shots, Sahra desert, a village in italy, fantasy worlds beneath water everything was captured excellently. It was like seeing the dreams without even sleeping.Slow paced screenplay and telling the story from the start can be considered as both pro and con of this movie. Though we get to know the character very well, the movie feels lengthy and without much twists and turns, so most of the scenes are predictable. Background score gives life to the visuals. Bgm's are good in all scenes.Similarities between this movie and ""Thor"" are really surprising. Be it the fantasy world, the story and the characters, this movie reminds us of MCU's Thor in many scenes. The scope and screenspace given to Female characters in this movie are something what Indian directors should learn from. So summing it up Aquaman with its bed time tale kind of story is a visual experience to be enjoyed in theatre once.Rating: 3.25/5",Aquaman

2837,jfranck-52489,"So many goods, so many bads, still loved it.",8,9 January 2019,"One of the most beautiful and visually rich movies I've ever seen. Designers carried the show in almost every way. (Then there was Black Mantis who looked like he fell out of 1960s Star Trek). Aquaman's character felt likeable, honest, admirable. Mera, although not embodied with the best acting, wasn't a nuisance and became rather endearing by the end. Whenever I began to doubt her casting choice my eyes would wander and I'd quickly come to my senses. There were some pacing issues at the beginning with how much emotion they tried to cram into the backstory but the pace pretty much sorts itself out by the end. Never did I find myself bored. In fact there were probably a dozen scenes that had me absolutely enraptured. In the end, I found myself inspired by beauty, a decent hero architype, and I would be happy to watch it again.",Aquaman

The story took us on an adventure that's more Indiana Jones than it is Justice League and looked very Flash Gordon or even Star Wars with a lot of the design choices made.

The writing and directing was so bad you would swear it was done by children. If you want to make a bad superhero movie then let all the laws of physics go out the window because that's what happened here.

Gorgeous colors and interesting use of sea creatures. Cool CGI effects. Kids will love that!The not so good? Lazy dialogue, uninspired score, and most melodramatic villain we've seen, well since Justice League. Patrick Wilson is a stellar actor and even he couldn't quite elevate the character of King Orm beyond a ""dun-dun-duh"" villain. I had really hoped for some great smart aleck comedy from Arthur/Aquaman, but his character seemed too overwhelmed to deliver on that.At first, I thought it was just me, but my teen son, i.e., the fan base, was bored.

2850,tenns_app,No risk and no fun is what this movie is.,5,25 August 2020,"Where to begin..
This genre has become the cashcow everyone wants to slap, and this movie fits perfect into it.
It's no risk and no fun.The main characters aswell as the storyline are really plain, it's working, but it's really far from unique and demanding. It feels like they put their hand in a box filled with every fantasy and super hero clichee and hold tight to anything they could grab at once. The result is a highly generic story with a utter lack of depth.The dialoges work just the same way. Not as bad as for example in Thor 2 but the only upside is the ultra manly voice of Aquaman. Besides that it's just another movie where the writers have let the characters articulate the plot.Visually I find most of the ""upper world"" scenes well set, and much of the CGI looks pretty good. But there are not just a few flaws where physics look extremely off, the usage of green/bluesreens gets visible or animations don't fit(like the scepter spinning from Dafoe).
The overall lighting is definitely on the pro side.The design of the atlantean world and especially it's soldiers is probably a matter of taste, it doesn't hook me. Another key aspect of creating a fantastic world in a unusual atmosphere is the proper sound design which, in this case, is not striking at all. It's always a littler too saturated, too heavy to feel authentic and constantly flees into a conglomerate of basic dramatic fantasy sound settings and epic battle music.The fights ain't spectacular but appropriate.",Aquaman

In the middle there is a shallow adventure episode and in the end a battle which makes you feel like watching a computer game which is sadly state-of-the-art nowadays.

The the problem is the lack of directions he received while playing this role.Everything in this movie looks like Disney threw up on it. It is so colorful and bubbly. Maybe too much.Everything is just CGI so people get disconnected from what they are watching. I was paying more attention to the CGI flowing hair and not the dialogue. The music is not very good and does not suit the movie at all. Character development is minimum done through a lot of exposition at the beginning of the movie. The villain is just laughable and funny looking.I do have to give then credit when it comes to the costume design on Aquaman. I was really curious how would they translate the costume from the cartoon in real life and they did a pretty good job.It's the king a movie made more for kids rather than all age groups.

Hobbled by a messy and overstuffed screenplay, poorly developed characters, and a patchwork of unimaginative action sequences stretched across bloated running time. The film suffers through an identity crisis. It wants to embrace the campy Silver Age comics but it also wants to try to be serious and feels like a patchwork of many films. Yet ""Aquaman"" shows sparks of hope throughout, with visual finnese and one of the most fantastic openings in the genre. At times, ""Aquaman"" contains the hints of a blockbuster ready to engulf the world.
From giant sea creatures swimming around to Dafoe's Vulko riding a giant hammerhead shark, the film doesn't lack In its imaginative ways to transform the ocean .But its default mode is paint-by-the-numbers action, by the time you've reached the finale there has been over a dozen or so clashes. Instead of making one ""Aquaman"" movie, James Wan has made three or four films. Wasting away what could have been great storylines for future films. The film never takes the opportunity of get you invested in these characters.

So I say that the result is more positive than negative, the films of heroes have to be like that, embrace the exaggeration and that the wan did with mastery, do not try to put some kind of sense of reality in something that does not have, stories in comics are very exaggerated and I want to see it on the cinema screen and also have to respect the original material and try to be as faithful as possible to these characters in their respective media, now all that remains is to wait for the 2nd to come.",Aquaman

James Wan directs very well the movie, being one of the best movie in your career.
In this Movie a Dc uses the same formula that marvel uses, crianting a funny movie.

Sure, it has impressive and pretty CGI, but the acting is terrible beyond belief. Even with a decent cast, it was just bad in every regard minus the colorful underwater imagery.

DC is back in the game and this is THE best DCEU movie. It's a visual treat and is something that must be experienced by everyone whether a comic book fan or not.It is action packed and dives deep into Aquaman's origin. James Wan did full justice to Aquaman in this one and he truly has redefined Aquaman! Watch this one the biggest possible screen.,Aquaman
2888,bartellbry,One of the best superhero movies yet,10,22 December 2018,Walked into the movie thinking it was going to be another underwhelming DC superhero movie. Once the movie started I couldn't look away. The visuals were outstanding. The non stop action and fight scenes were choreographed flawlessly. This movie took me on an epic adventure below the surface! Definitely well worth the money. I wouldn't mind seeing AquaMan again in theaters. If DC makes the rest of their movies like this one Marvel won't have a chance.,Aquaman
2889,superloop-35768,Surprisingly enjoyable,7,26 December 2018,I came into the theatre expecting to hate the movie and for it to be a continuation of the disappointment I have felt for most other DC movies but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this movie was actually very entertaining and exiting to watch. It still used the tired parent problems that plague DC but somehow it didn't bother me this time.,Aquaman

The cinematography is nauseating
The CG is completely overused
The characters have little to no developmentPlease tell me how this is considered a good film. The few bits that are interesting were those that featured Black Manta, a character that I think is actually interesting and flawed in good ways in the comics, however these were completely unessasery to the plot of the film.This is the ABSOLUTE worst DCEU film that has been released, even more then that I'd say it's on par with green lantern.One thing that really pissed me off were the jokes that don't land and don't make sense for the character or tone of this message of a film.",Aquaman

2893,sargentjaycougan,The writer's strike has been over for 15 years Warner Bros.,4,5 August 2020,"By combining a roomful of writers who won't concede anything, a large vfx budget, and pre-existing IP; you get Aquaman. It looked pretty, showed us new world's, gave us several epic battles; but never managed to keep a cohesive story. At any minute there were several loose threads pulling any interest the audience too far apart to amount to fluidity. I understand you want to introduce Black Manta, but nothing would have been changed without him; so why have him? Willem Dafoe mentor scenes look good in previews, but if you only splice a few I'm as flashbacks with no laid groundwork, they are just frustrating. Glad you made fish spell Aquaman for the opening titles, but maybe don't set us down in the world of childhood only for that purpose. Again, great at confusing the audience. I mean, yeah, we can follow; but why would we want to stumble through a movie. Most would prefer to feelnornbe challenged by it. Finally if you are going to open & end on a love story, especially ""one that saves the world,"" find a male actor that shows some emotion, any. Also, I thought we were done with men seducing vulnerable women Hollywood?(And yes I know there's more to the story than her washing up on the shore & them falling in love. So show it!)",Aquaman
2894,Imposter56,Seriously?,4,11 January 2019,"I can't express or voice my disappointment in any form or fashion besides simply saying this. I expected a good movie (based off of the 10/10's on this site) but was let down after the screening. This film is essentially black panther, another fairly average movie, but killmonger and T'challa have switched roles.The first and most important thing to address is the ""romance"". Aqua man and Ariel or whatever her name is have some of the most forced development I have ever seen. They just stare at each other and hold hands/kiss to show they are falling in love. They don't have a great dynamic or anything, it just kind of happens because the movie wants it to happen.Another thing to address is the costume design. I feel like I could see these at a comic convention. Pretty solid for some random guy to design, but terrible for a movie with this budget. Everything looks like plastic with scales engraved in them. The worst part is the villains who aren't Atlantian. You would think they could've escaped the terrible costumes and they almost did. Then they come back dressed as one of the bad guys from power rangers.Something else I have to mention, the cliché of it all. I know it's a super hero film, so it's bound to have something familiar but nonetheless, I hold this to the same standard as every other film. The underdog story resembles that of something from a Cars film, A boxing movie, a super hero movie, or literally any movie with the ""Protagonist loses first major stand off and becomes better to beat the villain the next time. It's a played out way of representing character development and conveying a story. Superhero movies have done without this. Logan, The ENTIRE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY, and Watchmen to name a few.The CGI. It's a DCEU film. That's all I have to say.The action scenes are glorious (sarcasm). I kid you not, every five seconds, BOOM, an explosion from the side knocks a character off their feet. The bad guys come from either above or below, and mediocre coreography ensues. If there isn't an explosion to start, it's not an action scene. At least not to the poor saps who wrote this movie. A superhero movie should deliver on entertaining action and I was laughing, so props for that.All in all, this is a film for kids looking to see the Stars wars to hit the ocean floor. It's not average, it's fairly below average and even laughable at times, but go watch it if your into cheesy stuff. It's a fun movie and you won't be bored. At least not during the action sequences. 4/10",Aquaman

2905,Zdiac,"Aquaman: retro dreams come true, to innocence and imagination!",10,9 December 2018,"I really love this film. Everyone talks about the GCI in Aquaman,but what moves me most is its style ,so called ""old fashioned fun"" .Here I'll talk about this.(This review is translated from Chinese by google translater.And I'm the writer of it.)First of all, the story of Aquaman is classic enough (that is, the old-fashioned set of some people), which is the journey of superhero treasure hunt. In an interview with James wan in""WorldScreen""magazine, James said that this is a very classic narrative technique. The growth of Arthur is like the growth of heroes in Spielberg, Cameron and Lucas movies. When Wan was a child, he watched the works of these masters grow up and always wanted to make such a movie, so this retro style is intentional. The facts also prove that the classic story will not be outdated. However, we can also understand from another angle that Wan did not try to try the dark and deep story style, but from the direction of being good at commercial blockbusters. In short, even if you don't have interest in the retro story, the level of the plot is definitely qualified in the super-Hero movie.Second, it is the retro feel of the picture. On the one hand, many dazzling special effects brought us back to Avatar and the Lord of the Rings until the shock of the first Star Wars, and the imaginative and fascinating atmosphere of the underwater world is obviously a tribute to the classic fantasy sci-fi movies, like those of Star Wars. Just like classic fantasy operatic movie opens the window of imagination for us. On the other hand, James indicates that the film is expected to be like special effects movies in japan(like Ultraman and Godzilla in last century ). No wonder the friend who watched the movie with me shouted ""The clothes looks cheap"" when he first saw the soldiers of Atlantis. ..... I believe that it is not a problem to add more cool special effects to the soldiers, but James chose a very traditional approach , allowing the actors to fight in plastic armor and add to the film. A little bit of childlike beauty! Seeing this armor design is a little touched. We seem to be able to see james that realize the childhood special movie dreams,hiding behind the viewfinder and snickering.And......To be honest,I'm little worried about Aquaman2,which is said to have been planned by Warner bros because the first episode is too successful,but I don't believe James will direct it again(just like SAW and Fast&Furious,he did once and did the BEST)And I'm also worried about Birds of Prey because the director is too young ...looking DCU(or DCEU) movies is funny ,we must stand some boring films ,but sometimes DC gives us BIG surprise😘",Aquaman

This movie was different, everything felt off and rushed with parts being really cheesey (Manta's bug-eyed suit). Bad editing, acting and forced lines occasionally left me wanting to see the movie end sooner than it did. I'm normally a fan and enjoy these types of movies, but this movie just didn't work. The casting for the characters didn't work and there we're too many inconsistentcies that didn't add up as the director forced the movie to an ending.

I say let James Wan take over the DCEU. Bring on Justice League 2 with the original cast and Wan in the drivers seat.

But if you see carefully enough, you will find they are actually storm-troopers wearing crab shells.And finally, we who possess the most advanced technology on this planet, choose our leader by bloodline and through fistfight.

2939,ravenstealsthesun,Interesting potential but wasted,4,26 March 2019,"As I watched the movie, I quickly realized it was going to be a very bad movie. But as the movie went on, I realized it had some interesting potential that could have made it a really good movie. You have a solid foundation with Jason Mamoa and some good supporting actors such as Willem Dafoe so you have some talent to work with but the storyline and scripting were way off. The underwater dichotomy was too simplistic for a super advanced society. They have all that high end tech and are biologically advanced but had the political mindset of a Feudal System? C'mon. Even the primary weapons were medieval-- a trident? Pretty silly plot devises that just made the movie more awkward. The Black Manta, Brine, and Fishermen Kingdoms were too Power Rangerish, especially Black Manta. The fight scene between Black Manta and Aquaman totally took me back to the 90's--the over the top costume and voice over was hilarious rather than threatening or intimidating. Despite all that weirdness, what I thought had potential was the pushback from the Atlanteans due to the over harvesting and damage of sea life and pollution of the oceans. That was a footnote to the stereotypical struggle for who gets to sit on the throne. If they had focused more on the struggle between Man vs Atlantean conflict, I think that would have been a more interesting story. Dont hang this on Jason Mamoa--this is poor writing and bad directing pure and simple.",Aquaman

This movie was definitely a wild ride and renewing take on one of the most mocked comic book superheroes; thanks to James Wan and Jason Mamoa for bringing this character to life.The poor reviews, so far, read like fake news. The inconsistencies they attempt to point out (like Atlantians breathing above water) are addressed in the movie so the bad reviewers need to check their hearing aids.I can't wait to see this movie again, and again, and again.

Willem Dafoe is solid as always. Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lungren are great additions. There is a lull in the middle of the film, but story wise and visual wise, this movie delivers. Aquaman is my favorite superhero movie this year. I cannot wait to purchase this movie on 4K.

2947,brooksrichard-90550,"Gloriously, ridiculously enjoyable stupidness of the highest calibre",8,13 December 2018,"Don't get me wrong I thoroughly enjoyed the film, all bar one musical aquatic creature.
There's nothing I've seen quite like aquaman, it's daft as they come but in a way that makes you laugh. It's a stunning showpiece of special effects, dialogue akin to films like tango & cash, commando and the like, but again in a strange way fabulous.You'll rarely have a chance to be bored and just when you think it can't become more grandiosely silly, this film turns it up to 11 and then moves the speakers nearer your ears.Leave your brain at the door and revel in this cinematic fun parade.
For those that care, everybody plays their respective roles pretty well and any Hammond's only adds to the overall feel of joy.The sound in the imax cinema was thunderous, chairs shaking.... music was equal parts over the top and dramatic, again much like the rest of the film.Effects are stunning, albeit some of the de-ageing effects are great but still a little too unreal to completely sell the process.See this on the biggest screen available to you.",Aquaman
2948,jamesksteel,DC is going in the right direction,8,26 December 2018,Where are the cameos? None were needed which is what happens when a movie is well thought out. To say this movie is visually stunning is an understatement and every reason you need as to why you should go see it on the big screen. Choose your theater wisely. You could tell the theater I was at had a dated projection and sound system which hindered the overall experience. It was the equivalent of watching a movie on an old 720p TV with the built in sound instead of a state of the art OLED 4K with 7.2 surround sound or better. This movie is fun for everyone and there isn't a bunch of random characters making appearances and detracting from the story line (sorry MCU).

2954,mhhondas,Why are people praising this movie?!,4,4 March 2020,"I'm going to brutally honest and admit Aquaman is totally underwhelming. I like most of the actors and actresses of the cast individually, but almost no one besides Momoa matches their role. Despite my admiration of them, Patrick Wilson and Willem Dafoe just don't feel like they fit in this world, but I suppose that could just be because Wilson feels more like an elf the whole way through (think Thranduil from The Hobbit). I'm not going to say that I expect a superhero movie to have a lot of realism, especially when it's about a famous myth, but the visuals are far too Avatar-like. Atlantis can look however they wish, but the entire ocean looking like a glow rave is undeniably wacky. I know it's difficult to explain every detail when world-building, but very little of even the basic technical stuff makes sense (once again, I know it's fictional, but frankly some of their world is downright silly). The fight scenes tend to have shots that are overly dramatic and choppy. I think the intention was to go for a more comic book style of conflict (with severe zoom-ins, comedic smirks, and etc.) like many of the latest adaptations are doing (ie. Wayne and Deadpool), but does so unfortunately poorly (to the point of wooziness or motion sickness). Many of the backgrounds, look like very cheap and stock-quality CGI. I can't believe that most of the praise for this movie was for the visuals, for me that was the worst part. Most of the laughs are cheap and juvenile, not unlike many other movies though. The characters who get the most screen time are the best developed and most funny, so basically only Heard and Momoa. This fact alone is why Marvel continues to beat DC at the box office. After Wonder Woman, I was just expecting better than this, not the same quality as WW even, but just not as disappointing as this. The costuming looked a lot like actual Halloween costumes (the Atlantian guards look like they took the suits from Power Rangers villains and painted them white, Mera's green suit is very cheap-looking, and Black Manta looks like a squashed version of Ant-Man). Even my own mother, who knows nothing of comics and is generally easily pleased by action movies (especially with main characters played by guys she thinks are hot), had to say the music choices were far from the best (I mean an Africa cover, seriously?) and often disruptive to the scenes rather than building them up. For me the most promising thing in the DC Universe now is Ezra Miller's goofy and relatable Flash.",Aquaman

However, I lost interest after around 20 minutes, and then after about an hour I found myself skipping through entire scenes.I really don't know how people can possibly rate this movie more than a 5 or a 6 at very best.

Now I know a lot of reviewers or critics are going to say too much CGI but what do you expect most of the movie was underwater. As a comic fan I would highly recommend this movie!",Aquaman
2959,javinilo,Seriously. Why give it a 3-star review?,10,8 September 2021,The movie is over-the-top comicbook-y in a good and crazy way. James Wan delivered this fantastic visual masterpiece. Cinematography of Don Burgess so perfect especially the Trench scene. I love the sound design and the atmosphere of this world. Best action choreography in a superhero movie yet. Jason Momoa as a Aquaman is no joke. Mera's powers so badass. So epic in all corners. It's great they didn't kill the villain.,Aquaman
2960,tontang,How to train your dragon 1 and 2 live action adaptation,7,31 December 2018,"Honestly, this movie was very exciting. I loved the action sequences, the visual compositions and the cinematography.
It's worst part was that the story was very, very similar to How to train your dragon. That's not too bad though because it was noticeable to me only after the ending. It could've been unintentional too.
Another letdown was the unrealistic CGI. Even though the visuals were stunning, at some points, the CGI cancels it out.
If I were to nitpick, I'd say the villains' (the ones who attack the surface and always need some supply of water) costumes looked cheap and the music sometimes didn't match.
But overall, as I said before, it was very exciting. I was very engaged with the individual events in this film.
I'm just wondering why they casted Amber Heard. I think she's very beautiful, but she kind of ruined the moment in the end with a not so convincing announcement.",Aquaman
2961,joelshibujs,It's meant to be cringy and it's good!,8,25 February 2019,"I think we need to take a step back and look at how the comics portray Aquaman; he shown as a magical creature who can talk to fish and ride them like surfboards and whatever - and surely the people behind this film would want to make Aquaman as close to the comics as possible. However, such a character would be a joke compared to the dark brooding universe DC typically is associated with. It would be too silly to have such a character and try to somehow make him as cool as Batman, instead the filmmakers tried to make this a cheesy as possible and it works! It's has similarities to corny children's cartoons and doesn't take itself seriously. It's refreshing to see a light-hearted film like this and I really recommend it - just don't expect something as dark and deep as Batman.",Aquaman
2962,skiewalker,"God had finally given his guidance, and DC has been a faithful follower so far!",8,12 December 2018,"Okay. Gotta admit, it was pretty sick!
I'm a fan of any superheroes movies, either it is a Marvel or DC. Though, I've always had a soft spot for Batman. And I think that's why I'm a little tiny bit of a DC fan than I am to marvel. BUT, I've always knew how Marvel has the upper hand when it comes to a cool, awesome, 10 stars worthy movie. To think how most of DCEU's movies had been anything other than a disappointment these days, it's only normal when I came to the cinema without any expectation whatsoever. And damn it! How wrong I was! Turns out, It was anything but a disappointment! Although some of the scenes were too cheesy for my preference, and some were kinda boring for me, It didn't overshadow my amazement towards this particular movie. I don't know if it's just my bad sense of humor, but Jason Mamoa succeeded in making me laugh with some of his supposedly unfunny, and corny jokes. Overall, it was an overwhelming surprise coming from DC!",Aquaman
2963,jahaines-95885,No Wonder Woman and a waste if time.,1,23 December 2018,"I have never written a review but I had to let others know. If you want to go and just be entertained that is all it is. I was so excited to see it and I am a huge fan of Aquaman but sadly i was dissappointed. Weak story and no development. Yes stunning CGI but they spent millions. Fantasic actors and cast but it lacked something. If I wasn't with my family I would have walked out during my many trips to the concession stand for refills.
So ignore the high ratings its not worth it. Wait and see it on Blu-Ray. Since DC has not realized the formula for great story telling like Marvel I will wait for any other films to be released for homeviewing except Wonder Woman follow ups. Seriously DC how can you expect moviegoers to support your overblown budgets when you cannot deliver a deceit movie to watch.
Oh well......",Aquaman

2966,Something555,Well worth the wait,9,17 December 2018,"For me, Aquaman is a character which I thought was made for a feature release ever since I first heard his story (8 years ago). There was something about him that made me gravitate towards him by being born from two different worlds, but comes to be rejected by both is a brilliant starting point. And his ties to Atlantis and the various stories are intriguing. His film might not have been what I had thought it would be, but it was still excellent regardless of my initial thoughts on what an ""Aquaman"" film should be.The film does a great job setting up Arthur's worlds and the perils that he faces below and above. Blank Manta was slightly stronger for me, only because this is also his origin film. We see how he comes to hate Aquaman and why he want to make him suffer, and it comes from a natural place, neglecting to save someone. Once that happens in the opening, I was on board and could completely see why this pirate would trade in the possibility of riches, and take the revenge plot instead. Ocean Master is fine, he just comes off a little bit sillier from the whole pollution idea. I know it ties into social and environmental issues at this time, but it just didn't feel the same for me. Nothing against Patrick Wilson, who was great at conveying the unyielding want-to-be ruler.Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were just great at their respective characters. Jason was a standout to me in ""Justice League"", so to see him getting his own film was great and well deserved. While I was worried at first casting, he combines is physical presence with his fun loving side to make the character his own. Amber is a big surprise for me, I knew she would be good as Mera, but she exceeded my expectations. Her curiosity and relationship with Arthur was great and whenever she used her powers I kept wondering when her film comes out.The cinematography and visual effects are out of this world. It reminded me of ""Avatar"", seeing this world brought to life that looks like it was straight off of Pandora. All the credit goes to James Wan for putting together a film which is satisfying to enjoy as well as look at. The only nitpick I can really think off is with the quest for the Trident. While fun and giving us those fun iterations between Arthur and Mera, it does drag and feels like it belongs to a film like ""National Treasure"". I don't know if it was a leftover from a previous script, but it just felt that way to me. (That's from the plane ride to the beginning of the Blank Manta fight)Overall this film was amazing, good performances, stunning visuals and a mostly great story. For me as a fan of the character, this film was well worth the wait.",Aquaman
2967,stevemata,"Amazing camera work, concept art and interesting Atlantian lore makes for a pretty unique Aquaman movie",8,11 January 2019,"The plot is pretty straightforward, nothing wrong with it and actually features a very strong and satisfying ending after over 2 hours of film. Characters play their role and are sufficiently developed. Unfortunately I can't speak a lot about the acting, because I saw the translated version. Scenography is very good and stays true to the nature of the film.However, as the title says, camera work is one of the things that is absolute astonishing about this movie. Visuals in this film (specially the one sorrounding Atlantian culture) are breathtaking and a delight to see. Fight scenes flow ridiculously smoothly, but I do have to admit there are moments where they overdo it, but I can count those with one hand's fingers. Weakest points of the visuals are Mera's eyes and the water flow effect that ""zooms"" on certain parts of the screen momentarily, it makes serious moments a bit ridiculous.The ancient Atlantian history and folklore shown in the movie is really entertaining and grants a very entertaining trip through ancient Atlantian landmarks.Overall, it's a pretty well thought-out and executed movie and its flaws, like overly dramatic scenes and terrible use of music, in come across as pretty meaningless in the bigger picture.",Aquaman

Let me explain why....
The CGI looks good and someone thought it would be a good ideea to have a 360° view of every CGI place, so expect to be show a view of every location for now real reason... its just there so they can show off....no other reason. Secondly every woman in this movie is extraordinary clean and all the shoots focus on there hair....is like a Palmolive comercial.....I don't think they shoot on location at all.2.Now on with the plot:
The trailer shows every thing....
The story is very poor and predictible and the dialog is extremly bad.
The actors had nothing to work with.
You will see any plot twist comming from a mile away.
They try some jokes, but they don't land. Most people sitting in the cinema were watching at the time....because it was too boring.3.The music is bland end epic....every scene is treated with the same importance so the music is Epic all the time....Awsome right?

2984,WintyBlag,So lame - have your fast forward button ready.,3,22 June 2021,"Never read the comic books or seen the animations so I came to this with no expectations other than a standard superhero origin story.8 things I learnt from this movie:1. Basically there is no origin story unless you count 30s of flashback where Aquaman learns to spin his trident really really fast.2. You can have too much CGI3. Nothing can make up for a nonsense script - from Aquaman's big hero speech ending with ""Screw You"" like some sort of 70's cop movie villain, or the fact that the characters just jump from one location to the next without explanation (dessert kingdom {which you can just fall into apparently} to Sicily, centre of the earth {which is impossible to escape} but they escape - OK the trident but what happened you don't see it. In fact the whole Da Vinci Code esque search to find the trident is absurd from beginning to end.4. The best time to kiss the girl is in the middle of the main battle sequence when about to be overwhelmed by the enemy.5. Some Atlanteans need water breathing suits to walk the land but others just don't for no obvious or explained reason. Oh and they can run clean through walls in those suits but hit them in the face mask and it cracks and .. they die.6. If you have been given an Aquaman melting weapon as the villain of the piece you can only shoot it when Aquaman is zipping around and hard to hit, when he is lying stunned on the ground moping you should instead rant and sermonise and definitely not shoot him point blank.7. Yes I know he is called Manta but if your going to rip-off a Tony Stark ""building weapons in the garage"" montage try not make the end result look like Iron Man but with a giant Manta head. No-one will take your villain seriously (unless they read the comics I am guessing).8. Don't make a 2hr 20 minute movie when you only have enough good ideas for about half an hour.I could go on for hours but what would be the point, a little like this movie.",Aquaman

2993,dikzakout,"It's good, but nothing amazing.",8,29 December 2018,"Aquaman is a good movie, let's get that out of the way first. The cinematography is fresh and never feels out of place and the movie is visually stunning. I also really liked the action scenes. While this is all good, the dialogue which is good in some places, is way too corny at other times. The pacing was okay, but always just a bit too long or too short. Another thing I didn't love was king Orm, he was too over the top villainy. And a mcguffin move that is used late in act 3 is only shown very briefly but we never get to know what it is or does, and that really bothers me for some reason.",Aquaman
2994,bkvalenza,It's alright,5,8 February 2019,"This movie is really cheesy. And not necessarily in a good way. Bad humor, awful music choices and terrible implementation. Hammy acting. Forced romance. Overly simplified plot. 2 decent villains instead of one great antagonist. Nowhere near the disaster that Justice League was, not as messy as Suicide Squad was. Not as heartfelt as Wonder Woman was, and nowhere near as epic and powerful as Man of Steel or Batman v Superman(ultimate cut). The visuals at gorgeous. Momoa is just as lovable as he is in real life, but them movie is little more than just OK.",Aquaman

2996,senor_spit,Why though?,4,24 March 2019,Aquaman is a dummy who has the redhead and his mother guide his actions every step of the way. He did nothing that inspired heroism. Why should he be king? Why though?Redhead has zero chemistry with aquaman. Why is petty squabbling a form of flirtation in an eventually forced relationship where for some reason they inexplicably are in love? I suppose it is because they are ridiculously good looking.

Well, I haven't laughed as much at the movies in a long time. WE all know how sexy Jason Momoa is, but amplifying it with a rock guitar riff and slowmow hair flip plus sexy stare everytime Aquaman kicked someone's ass was pretty over the top. At the beginning I thought it might hae been involuntarily funny, but in the end I hope it was intentional. The colors, the costumes, the music, the characters, the storyline...

3010,croechance,A series of great movies meshed together into an abomination.,2,25 December 2018,"The first twenty minutes of the film are well worth its own movie. After that, the movie struggles to find its overall tone, message, story, and any original thought. The ""inventive CGI"" are just action clips from other action blockbusters that were actually worth the money. Some examples include the rooftop scene from the fast and furious franchise, pitch black, a sudden appearance of a kaiju similar to Godzilla or Pacific Rim, and journey to the center of the earth, plus many more. I'm much more a DC fan than marvel, but marvel movies are so much more worth the time and money. The income of this movie is nothing more than a marketing scheme by the movie industry. I honestly hope that DC will pull a new 52 scenario and completely restart their franchise.",Aquaman
3011,QuerubeG,"Yeah, nope",2,11 December 2018,"At times the visuals are mesmerizing, but then they are distracting or even too much (they gave me headache at one point).
Other than that, not a good movie: boring plot with little character development or depth, two villains that could've easily been just one, cheesy jokes, 0 chemistry between the lead and the love interest, in general you'd expect much more from this movie, with all the ""badass characters"" we've heard about in interviews and articles... but you get none of that",Aquaman

3015,danieloffmana,Great,7,27 December 2018,"I thought aqua man was one of the greatest superhero movies. It does have its flaws though as a movie, but as a fun action heavy superhero movie it knocks it right out of the park. Jason Mamoa takes an otherwise lame super hero and makes it his own. Also Patrick Wilson who plays Orm is very over the top which is very true to the comic book charecter. Also the whole movie is just great to look at, the cgi looks epic, overall if you like superhero movies, you'll enjoy aqua man",Aquaman
3016,basketballkelly,One of the best DC film,8,11 January 2019,"The originality of the character is super high (expect Aquaman doesn't have blond hair in this film lol). Otherwise all the characters looks almost alike with the comic! The storyline is also great, it is a pretty well done job to squeeze massive stories from the comic into a 2 hours film. However, I think it is better to read some Aquaman comic first before watch this film. It will make you have better understanding and felt the film's originality from the comic.I'm so glad that DC has finally on the right track on the film making. I hope they keep their good work for long term. Always prefer dc comic than the marvels.Plus, I found quite interestingly that in this film for some fighting scenes, I felt like I'm watching Drangon Balls character fighting scenes and doing their fatal blow or doing Kong Fu fighting. And, Nicole Kidman is so hot and wicked in the film, her fighting scenes is awesome!",Aquaman
3017,coreyv-05546,Worth Seeing in Theatres,9,17 December 2018,"I watched this with an early viewing thanks to Prime. It was well worth seeing in theaters for the visuals and camera work alone.Pros:
-Visually stunning: The world of Atlantis is so beautiful and the costumes are wonderful.
-James Wan elevated the source material. I fully expect people to take Aquaman seriously now.
-Jason Momoa is a very charismatic lead, I was concerned going into it because I didn't care for his Conan movie.
-Amber Heard does a great job as Mera, she's just like her comic book counterpart.
-Patrick Wilson is a good foil to Momoa's Aquaman
-Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe are great in their parts, but they aren't in the movie that much.
-Great environmental message
-The Second and Third Acts come together nicely.Cons:
-Black Manta felt like an afterthought (I had to mark off for that)...I feel like their saving him for a sequel or Justice League movie.
-Some of the dialogue and music choices don't work at times
-First Act feels a little bit rushed",Aquaman
3018,patrickyeck,Aquaman is a Little Waterlogged,2,30 December 2018,"Aquaman gives us what DC always has; a corny, predictable story with goofy out of place characters, spewing cheesy one liners as everyone prays to the green screen Gods that the visual effects will mask the absurd dialog and shallow acting. The Gods are somewhat merciful and give us a few eloquent visuals that make us forget, if even for a moment, that this film is just an Exxon Valdez away from a full fledged dumpster fire. Yes, it's a movie. It's supposed to be entertaining and entertaining it is. There are numerous fighting sequences (can you say overkill?) And a few good laughs at the expense of the character's (or actor's) dignity, but there is so much more at stake here. DC is drowning beneath the riptide of Marvel""s success and if they want to break the surface and breathe again, DC has got to stop spending money on sinking ships.",Aquaman

3026,ethan-33027,A very solid blockbuster movie,8,21 December 2018,"I went in to this movie with very low expectations. DC movies tend to be very inconsistent with their movies so even though I really liked the trailer, I really liked BVS's trailer as well, but we all know how that movie turned out. Wonder Woman did really well and was quite a solid movie so I'm hoping that this movie will be on par with Wonder Woman, and i must say, it was so freaking amazing. I've heard before going in that it feels like a Marvel Phase 1 movie, like Thor or something, and to some extent I agree. But, in my opinion, this movie feels like it has a very simple premise, but somehow their execution was so damm well that it turned out better than it should have been. And i'm not mad at all.I'd like to discuss about certain aspects of the movie like the plot, cgi, setting all those goodies as well as running down the character's list to check out each actor and actresses individual performance. First off, I must say the plot is actually pretty simple. The whole arc of the movie revolves around Aruther distinguishing the idea between King and Hero. He also has to learn to get over the ""hold everything responsible"" trope and learn to take on responsibility as the king. I thought that the movie did really well trying to conveys this through Mera and Aruther's first encounter, where we dive straight into the issue that Aruther must learn to overcome, as well as I think the most important scene in the movie, which is Mera and Aruther's talk on the boat, where he has to learn to accept reality and stop doubting himself.Speaking of Aruther, let's talk about the Aquaman himself. He feels very real and although, I didn't initially liked the casting of Jason Mamoa as Aquaman, he's grown on me and really like all the emotional scenes he has with Mera, his mother and everyone else. He really does sell the idea and Director James Wan makes the character seem very genuine and relatable. Mera was great. She's how I always thought she should be. Badass, hot and not a damsel in distress. Her chemistry with Aruther was really believable and they're really good couple, and that kiss though!!The CGI was really breathtaking and just, really really good. From the underwater swimming scenes, to the Atlantis structures and scenes to the fight scenes (especially the fight scenes, freaking amazing), there's so much to see in this movie. The attention to detail is just really nice to see.Now for the villains, black manta and Ocean master. I would just like to say that that their suits are one of the most comic accurate costumes I've seen in a while and its just very nice to see. Black Manta was pretty good in this movie. I liked that they were able to integrate an origin story of sorts into the movie without making too forced. Black manta was a nice addition but wasn't really needed and was just here to set up the sequel. Ocean Master on the other hand, who I thought was going to a joke in this movie, was actually not that bad of a villain. I mean he does have his own twisted motivation, it makes sense, and he is menacing while doing it. So kudos to the actor. I particularly like his and Aruther's exchange before their first fight because it showed not only his motivations, but the conflict between Aquaman and Him, and thus showing a clash in ideologies, which I love.The father and mother of Aruther storyline was quite boring and put aside. I didn't really cared for either of them and when it was revealed spoiler alert that Aruther's mother was still alive, it really wasn't that surprising and honestly the movie could probably have been the same without her showing up. Oh well...If I had one more complaint, it would be that the plot was quite predictable, and there were no twist or surprises. No cameos as well. But that's it. I can't think I anything else I didn't like.Overall, this a very solid movie, full with exciting action pieces, compelling characters and beautiful visuals. I'd say it's the perfect family movie or blockbuster movie and if you have the time, which you should have (it's Christmas), you should definitely give this movie a try.",Aquaman

The box office money will sure be racking up with this movie. BTW: Don't lost hope in this film because of the RT score or what other people are saying about it. There should be no reason why this movie's score is 70 % or lower. It should be around 80 at least. This is the best movie after the mess of Justice League. I do admit there was a lot of things going on, so much story stuffed in one Film and some of the dialogue didn't fit but either way It was a pretty good movie! James Wan is a winner.

1. Wan's take on the character/direction.
2. Momoa as Aquaman. Mera(Amber) as well.
3. Visuals better than LOTR and Infinity war. It could win the most coveted oscar award.
4. Set on the premise of Star Wars/LOTR universe; a world/universe in making.The story is also good. There are a few great actors in the movie; Dafoe and Kidman are awesome. A triology is in the line(they all love number 3:)).The world wants to see more of so called B list comic characters.

It's immersive from the beginning.The character devolopment is wonderful -- we see Black Mantis devolop as Aquaman does through the movie. The chemistry between Jason Momoa and Amber Heard is endearing.This is an adventure movie at heart. The feeling of exploration never leaves.

But the one thing that really stood out to me is the world that director James Wan created. I mean this thing is immaculate. I haven't been this captivated by a universe since the Harry Potter movies. Every single scene, whether on land or in water, is absolutely breathtaking. And don't even get me started on the sea creatures, for a second I felt like I was watching Jurassic World: Underwater. But for real do not sleep on this insanely epic movie. And if you're a fan of 3D you HAVE TO see this in 3D. You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you don't.",Aquaman
3050,yehonatanh,Great story and visuals!,7,5 January 2019,"The story was good but very predictable. The characters were a bit flat and told cringe lines to make the film funnier. The choreography of the fight scenes is great. The visuals are amazing in most of the shots but have some weird physics under the water.
In conclusion, I'm really recommend this film to watch, I saw it in Dolby atmos but I think the best experience is in IMAX (they shot some of the scenes in 70mm).",Aquaman

It seems as though this is leading DC in the right direction and without WB tampering with their movies. The movie was absolutely so fun to watch, blink and you'll miss something. Interaction between characters were truly compelling and don't be surprised if you say to side with their antagonists (BM and OM). Whether you're a die hard Marvel Fan or DC, you can't not help but enjoy the hell out of this movie.",Aquaman

WAN somehow managed to deliver a world never approached before, and the CGI and rendering was executed so incredibly. The movie itself was so exciting to watch constantly. Arthur's upbringing brings himself to come forward as King to his nation and Jason's interaction with characters like Mera and Orm was truly something marvelous to watch",Aquaman

When I had watch the trailer, from that onwards I was very excited to watch it and it has reached to my expectations....Sometime you will feel that there is some flaws in the movie but it's visual effects and action sequences, let you forget those flaws..

3055,Kane17,Aquaman's superb visuals fail to overcome terrible writing,5,1 January 2019,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it was just disappointing. The action sequences and visuals are really well done, but unfortunately they're bogged down by incredibly weak writing. I've liked Jason Momoa since Game of Thrones, and was actually excited to hear he would be playing Aquaman. He has more than enough charm to play a great superhero lead (see: any Chris from the Marvel Universe), especially compared to the lackluster leads we've seen in the other DC films - not including Gal Gadot. But Momoa, Heard, and Dafoe are sorely underutilized. The acting in Aquaman really isn't great - but that's what you get when the actors are given boring, flat dialogue.The movie never seems to stop unloading exposition at you, and it's crammed into every conversation. You never get a chance to see the characters develop because everyone is too busy trying to explain the next 'world-building' element. I mean I don't need 2 hours of exposition to understand a bunch of guys riding sharks shooting blasters at crab people. Give me the essentials and focus on making me care about the people I'm watching - let the world speak for itself.It really is a shame because (almost) everything else is great. Aquaman's saving grace is its effects and set designs. Everything - except some questionable costumes - is extremely visually appealing and there is some wonderful imagery to be found. But the thing is, all of this beautiful shiny exterior is just serving as a means to distract you from a movie that refuses to even try to give you information in a creative way.",Aquaman

Aquaman is proof that studios want to be safe, have fun, and pump out something for the masses.
The amount of green screen kept throwing me out of the experience, not because it was used but because it was consistently noticeable. The overall theme was to be aware of human pollution and how it affects parts of the world we can not see.
The cliche witty dialogue was also expected but it was the amount of dramatic pauses and slow motions that were unbearable.
Breaking bread, I will say that the choice to track the action versus cutting between shot was refreshing and there were certain visual shots that were great - a favorite being the trench dive.",Aquaman

The Visuals Effects are the BEST I ever see in my whole live!!!!!!! Are stunning. I saw it in 3D, and are beautiful. I saw many people saying that the plot was a copy. Come on!!! Even the Lord of the Rings have the same plot. Tell me when do you see a movie that use the water sequences as beautiful as this? The movie also have a lot classics elements and modern elements. It have the perfect balance. And although it have more than 2 hours you don't ever feel it. And to many people could hurt. But man, this is better than Black Panther!!!But what get me angry is that the Academy snubbed this movie in the Best Visual Effects competition. That demonstrate they don't saw it.

3064,geoffreywade,Predictable and frustrating,3,23 December 2018,"I get very frustrated with superhero movies for this very reason. Every diehard fan of DC or Marvel jumps on IMDB and rates it a 10, making the cumulative IMDB rating much higher than it should be, which yeilds optomism followed by incredible disappointment. I like some superhero movies, but not just because I like the universe or company that makes them. I think most of them are vastly overrated, and diehard superhero fans, Marvel and DC alike, become completely blinded by their love for a franchise. In my opinion, Aquaman was one of the worst of the recent superhero movies. The humor seemed incredibly forced and really not funny, there was no character arch, no plot development, and frankly very poor acting. There were so many cheesy lines that were supposed to be dramatic and awe inspiring that were cringeworthy, and I found myself feeling almost embarrassed for the actors involved. Yes the visuals were good, and the fight scenes were entertaining and well done, but it takes way more than just that and a DC or Marvell stamp to make a good movie. After seeing Aquaman, my patience for superhero movies is slowly fading, as it becomes obvious to me that if DC or Marvel makes a movie, no matter how bad it is, their respective fans will immediately rate it a 10. This is slowly delegitimizing good superhero movies. If you are a diehard DC fan you will probrably love Aquaman whether you see it or not; if you're a non-biased movie fan who just wants to see a good film, then you'll probrably think it's trash, and be very disappointed by the positive reviews.",Aquaman
3065,nevzatabdu,"Not a worthy watch, in my opinion.",1,5 January 2019,"The story line drags on a little too much, in my 32 years of age, i've never seen a film that assumes the viewer is as dumb as in this movie.I actually was offended, and so was the audience which is why the majority walked out early in the movie. It is unfortunate as I was expecting something decent, but was sorely disappointing.I will not be watching any more DC movies until they start catering to the consumer.Avoid for now.",Aquaman
3066,kieseltra,"As a Pisces, I Approve Of This Movie",9,25 December 2018,"I would actually rate this movie 8.5 out of 10 and not 9, because it's definitely better than an 8, but it isn't really a 9 due to reasons that I will get into; however I will be generous and round it up rather than down.The first two-thirds of this movie are pretty much exceptional, barring minor pacing and plot issues. The creativity is unreal, and I have to admire James Wan and the entire cast for doing such a great job and giving Aquaman such a distinctive and fresh thematic and audiovisual style that I found immensely enjoyable, and for being unafraid to actually try and tell a story.Without spoilers, these minor plot points are eventually explained, but suffice it to say that it's better to give your audience all of the necessary information BEFORE your action sequence starts rather than after it, or you risk the audience asking 'why is this happening' rather than engaging in the action.Still, it didn't really detract from the movie too much, and all cases where this happen are eventually explained properly, if you can be patient and just roll with it for a bit.However, from a logical standpoint, the movie kind of fails in the third act. Too many parts were a bit of a stretch for me or just flat out CGI nonsense (lighting flares underwater?), and is pretty much the only reason I'm not rating this 10/10.Yes it's a superhero movie, I understand that, but it doesn't mean we need to throw normal physics out of the window entirely.Overall, a very fun and engaging movie with an actual plot and surprising emotional depth (pun intended), but just roll with it when it gets too silly towards the end.",Aquaman

Just don't set your expectations too high. Yes, lack of character development and predictability we're always present which was an obvious disappointment- as far as really being able to get engrossed in the actual story and characters themselves. However, Jason Momoa delivered and yes, the special effects were amazing. Definitely one of DC's better movies. Giving Aquaman a 10 is absolutely a stretch and a1 is a bit brutal.

It was so predictable that, I am dead serious, the guy next to me in the cinema was completing the sentences in half of the scenes until he fell asleep... I almost fell asleep a couple of times but somehow I managed to survive.The acting was awful.

Cool effects, some nice battles but not many, and awfully CORNY.TLDR: This movie should not have more than 5 score but it seems there are a lot of bots and paid people in here. 2 and a half hours of wondering what is happening. 2 and a half hours of regret. I created an IMDB profile just to tell the truth. I have hated so many overrated movies and I desperately wanted to write reviews about them but it was never enough for me to create a profile.

The story is also not very engaging and doesn't give you much reason to care about the characters, so the third act's big reveal just feels like a dues ex machina to give the end of the film some kind of emotional weight.

I am not a fan of how critics write their reviews because it doesn't apply to the general audience. So as a normal movie goer this is my review. Aquaman was a fun movie with a lot of upside to it. The way Jason Momoa plays Arthur Curry is perfect. He has an attitude that no other superhero really has. He is witty, sarcastic, funny, but also has his sensitive side. I really enjoyed him as Aquaman, but as for the other actors, they were average. My one rip on this movie is the CGI. DC hasn't really produced a good movie with good CGI yet. And this movie, better than justice league when it comes to visual, still lacks the way a Marvel movie would. So as a fan, I noticed the CGI and acting wasn't very good and the dialogue was pretty poor. I also though adding Manta was just a waste of time and space in the movie. His character was a below average villain who besides his fathers death, didn't show a compelling story as a character. I did enjoy however how fun the movie was and how upbeat and also caresmatic it was. I think as a fan this movie is worth seeing because of it being a super hero movie who we haven't seen much of and how fun it is. I am giving this movie a 7.",Aquaman

3098,mightyyendys,Spectacular!,9,29 January 2019,"When I heard James Wan was going to direct, I was cautiously optimistic. DC Comic movies are dark and gloomy, the only exception being Wonder Woman.
Then I saw the trailers and knew DC had made the right choice in choosing the man who also directed Fast 7.
Aquaman is easily DC's best movie. In my opinion it bests Marvel's best (apart from Infinity War).
Jason Momoa totally nails it. He is not your everyday comic book hero. He is a beer drinking, fist slugging, rugged, foul mouthed protagonist who develops into something more.
The story is not that special but the way it was executed was what impressed me. The flashback scenes came in at the right times. The action scenes are just so cool and wonderful, hard hitting too!
The visuals just left me gaping. Just imagine Star Wars combined with Avatar and you get an idea of what I'm talking about.
The score was just out of this world! All the actors did a great job. The outstanding ones are Jason Momoa and Willem Dafoe.
The Russo Brothers had better think of a way to top this (Avengers Endgame) cos this movie is the pinnacle of superhero movies!

Critically, this movie only gets a 2/5. But in terms of enjoyment and experience, freakin' 5/5. I know that the 5/5 is subjective because it applies only to myself and nobody else. However, this is what I think of the movie. If you're looking for a well-written, and greatly structured movie, then I wouldn't recommend this to you. But, if you want to watch an entertaining and fun movie that can keep you engaged for 2 & 1/2 hours, then you may enjoy this movie. I say that it's the 3rd best DCEU film, but most of the movies that exist (besides Wonder Woman) aren't good to begin with.Now, the story was generic, the pacing was off, the dialogue was more cheesy then it needed to be. The characters don't have much personality, but rather exposition people. However, I really likeed Jason Mamoa as Aquaman. His charm kept the movie entertaining. Amber Heard actually did better than I expected, but just not anything special. Riddled with plot-holes and inconsistencies. However, thank goodness that it had the best DCEU villain so far: Ocean Master. So overall, critically, only a 2/5.Now in terms of enjoyment, a 5/5. The visuals aren't perfect but they did a pretty good job with a movie that takes place underwater most of the time. The action was good (not for the underwater battles). The action scene of them in Sicily will hold up for a long time. The colours and effects were very engaging.Ultimately, this movie was mainly about spectacle and excitement. So it really depends on what you're looking with this movie. Critically, it did not do good, which I hate. But I had a tremendously good time with it. Definitely not a 1/10 or 10/10.",Aquaman
3111,MrGray2003,Very different from the rest of the DCEU,8,7 March 2019,Going into this movie i thought it would be like the rest of the DCEU. Being Dark and ugly like BvS but i was very surprised by how great and different it was. i found that the best scene's were the ones under water. just before watching it i thought that the scene's under water were going to look werid because of how much it was going to be cgi. but i found that all of the scene's looked amazing. the actors like Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were so good in this flim. i didnt really like aquaman in Justice League but in this i felt more for the character. i also love the script in this movie. the script in Justice League felt weird and cheesy. the villains like Ocean Master and Black manta were some of the best villans since Zod in Man of steel. i just wish there was more screen time for black manta. Overall i loved this movie and would recommend it to any super hero fan.,Aquaman

3113,Legend_KRX,My personal Review,8,8 March 2019,"I feel like i will be writing good review since I am a DC fan.Visuals: The visuals and graphics works are stunning. Maintaining a good light and dark part of the movie. Specially Underwater visuals are good enough.Characters: The characters are the ones who didn't get enough rating from me.
Except the main character i really couldnt connect with other characters. All of the characters are same. Their depth wasnt brought up. The movie didnt do them justiceStory: The story seems a little bit off. But it was good enough. I mean it is more than good for me.Screenplay: The screenplay was better than other DCEU movies. I really feel that the actors gave their best, and it worked.Soundtrack: The best DCEU movie if ranked by soundtrack. At some point you can really feel the energy.Overall: A 8 from me",Aquaman

3118,mgd-59552,Aquaman review,10,28 April 2019,"Once home to the most advanced civilization on Earth, the city of Atlantis is now an underwater kingdom ruled by the power-hungry King Orm. With a vast army at his disposal, Orm plans to conquer the remaining oceanic people -- and then the surface world. Standing in his way is Aquaman, Orm's half-human, half-Atlantean brother and true heir to the throne. With help from royal counselor Vulko, Aquaman must retrieve the legendary Trident of Atlan and embrace his destiny as protector of the deep.
In a better world Aquaman would excel at delivering an ecological message to the masses. But all the fish in the sea cant
salvage a movie that refuses to go more than surface deep. for all its sporadic wackiness and wonder , on balance Aquaman still comes out a bore. But they have given it a heroic shake. I liked the mum that came out of this movie very much. I think that's a good movie.",Aquaman

But what I'm really upset about is the plot turnout. That ending was too corny for me. It seemed more like a ""walt-disney-fantasy happy"" ending for me than a superhero one.
I am a huge DC fan, well specifically the Justice League, coz you know of how they are superior both in strengths and powers compared to the Avengers. But honestly, DCEU still needs alot of work.",Aquaman

If a nerd ate Star Wars, Jurassic park, how to train your dragon, and the little mermaid, then pooped it out you would have aquaman. Actually that would probably make a better movie then this. I don't even know how people say they like the ""special effects""... I expected better than this. Wonder Woman was the last good movie they will ever make. Poor poor Jason, he did the best he could with what he had to work with. They basically explained everything you ever wanted to know in a single conversation, the movie was paced terribly you talk to someone for five seconds then boom something explodes. My favorite part is when this Italian guy who is struggling to get up after he is crushed by a building gets saved by aquaman, then the man just walks away completely unaffected. Or maybe the part where aquaman freaks out while dangling from the edge of a small building, after he literally just jumped out of an airplane. Speaking of Italy I lived there for three years and the scene in Sicily looks absolutely nothing like Italy. But I mean if you've lived in one town in America your whole life, stereotypically think that all Italians have Pinocchio books lying around, and can sit for almost three hours without using your brain which can obviously see that every scene looks painfully over rehearsed, and don't care that the main villain calls himself ""the ocean master"" you might actually like this movie.

3135,samuelakrom,Unfortunate attempt..,3,11 April 2019,"Aquaman is nothing like the other Superheros we have recently seen come from the DC Universe. Traditionally, this mighty king was known as an Aryan-looking Atlantean who wore orange and green spandex. In addition to his striking fashion he wielded an intimidating golden trident, representing power, in defence of his kingdom. However, in the most recent movie, this stalwart image is replaced with a powerful Hawaiian who is covered in tribal tattoos and shaggy hair. This change brought shock to DC fans across the world. They were expecting tradition, similarity to the comic books that they so dearly loved. This is one of the many reasons why Aquaman is receiving questionable reviews. If evaluated solely on entertainment, a story about a forbidden child who returns to claim the throne from a tyrant and saves billions of lives in the process, the movie sounds extremely interesting. However, the plot was weak, the acting was far from perfect and aside from the occasional surprise, the 2 ½ hour movie was fairly predictable.
Just years ago, the mere mention of creating an ""Aquaman"" movie was quite literally laughed upon in HBO's ""Entourage"" series as he was considered relatively useless to the DC family. However, in a year when no fewer than 10 superhero movies were created, ranging from Incredibles 2 to Black Panther, it suddenly seemed logical to give life to such a well known hero. When I initially saw the previews for this movie, I was ecstatic! I loved reading books about Aquaman as a child and I considered him an inspiring hero. However, as the movie began, I better understood why the Entourage series considered him a joke. First and foremost, there were key details and storylines that did not follow the comic books in any way, shape, or form. For example, the true Aquaman from the comics was a broken man when he was first introduced to Atlantis, yet he overcame an internal struggle and became the man we know him as. Jason Momoa on the other hand, is a boistrus lad who enjoys drinking and fighting with little to no care in the world. When we think of the DC heroes, who comes to mind? A man of matchless strength named Superman? A human vigilante known as Batman? Or how about one of the very first female superheros who is generally known as Wonder Woman? The common ground that these three have is their ability to fight for truth and right in a magnificent way due to their extraordinary gifts and talents. Aquaman is considered by many to be the ""butt of pop culture jokes"", as stated by IGN, because he simply is a man who can swim really fast, talk to fish and breathe underwater. Although this is extremely useful while underwater in his kingdom, many of his talents and gifts do not extend beyond the realm of Atlantis. His strength and instincts are quite impressive regardless of where he is, however, in the earthly realm he is not much of a ""superhero."" Because of this, many consider him quite useless, especially if the DC heroes were suddenly needed, for example, to defend the world from an alien invasion as we commonly see in modern films.
As the movie went on, I found myself bored a times and able to predict scenes fairly consistently. The events were great in theory, but there was simply too much plot and it all moved too fast to really get attached to anyone or anything. By the time you begin to appreciate something, another equally important scene happens and you quickly forget what had just taken place. Marvel, in comparison, does a phenomenal job of weaving together scenes full of action, with simple and informative scenes. Through this, we are able to understand and come to love certain characters, rather than just watching them constantly fight throughout the course of the movie.
Finally, a storyline with as much anticipation as Aquaman brings immediate interest and enthusiasm. However, throughout the movie, certain pieces do not fall into place and we begin reminiscing on the comics and the heros that we idolized all those years ago. I would recommend this movie if you are interested in the DC Universe and want to watch a movie that doesn't require much emotional investment. However, not only was the plot extremely weak, the acting was par at best. If you are interested in a memorable movie that will touch your heart or inspire you, this is far from what you would enjoy.",Aquaman
3136,Anonymous_146372,Super cliche but fun to watch,6,3 May 2019,"The title says it all. It's not very sophisticated movie but it's good for when you want to relax. Also, the visuals were amazing.",Aquaman
3137,johnmarco-61943,Better than expected,8,20 April 2019,"Aquaman is a super hero movie based in the DC comics, the production of the movie started getting in production at late November 2016. As cast members we have: Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry / Aquaman, Amber Heard as Y' Mera Xebella ""Meraa"", Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, Patrick Wilson as the Ocean Master, and Nicole Kidman as Atlanna. This is an action movie and is basically directed to ages of sixteen and on because it has strong language and scenes, but some fans are very young age and the best option is going with their parents. Some part of the audience thinks this movie was not as how it supposed to be like in the comics and some other part of the audience thinks that this movie was one of the best made about this character. This movie showed a lot of good special effects and action considered that it is a super hero movie and some type of fight scene should happen, it was well do it under water where is all about. This is a movie that at first you will think twice to watch if you are not a fan of superhero movies but when the movie begins this attached feeling to the movie will come immediately and the movie will be well enjoyed. In general, the movie was really good with good special effects, good fighting scenes, great music, and very good acting especially form the main character Aquaman who in my perspective it was the best from all the cast. The main actor, Jason Momoa made a really good job giving live to this character and I think the audience who really loves this comic will be pleased with his work. Overall the movie was really good personally I am not a big fan of super heroes movies but this one deserves a try, in my opinion I would give this movie a 8.5/10, if you have not seen it then you should watch it and enjoy the 2 hours of movie time.",Aquaman

Fortunately i was not suckered into see it in the cinema but now regret the money i spent on itunes, more over the 2+ hours i was wasted watching it across 3 sittings.The scripting and story is awful and probably where the wagon fell off the wheels. Unfortunately the wheels kept rolling and the movie was made. The general structure of the story is terrible and definitely not befitting an origin movie. The universe that Aquaman is set in was not explained just thrust upon the audience. The special effects and design were cliche to say the least, which is why one generally wants to see this type of movie. It descends to the depths of Power Rangers (the TV Series not the movie) with its design and special effects; Without the forgiving nature of the Power Rangers ""its so bad its good"". or at least funny.Randall Park is the best thing in the movie and I feel sorry for Jason Momoa who had to suffer through watching himself in this.I was and am super surprised of the rating this movie received - perhaps every watched it in the cinema and succumbed to the big screen and loud special effects sounds.

Like everyone always judge, the jokes is not that much, and its not like batman cringey joke in previous dc movies and i don't think they tried to be like MCU maybe they just trying to find their own style to fit this future generation. I actually thought some of it as funny. For haters maybe you guys are just ""oldies try hard to be edgy people"" i still rewatch it at least 3 times since its amazing and have so DC-like shots with that filter.

Then it just randomly jumps to Aquaman just knowing he's a superhero and can breath underwater somehow and attacking submarines.. ok??? Then there's random evil submarine men who just show up and start shooting at the sea people having a meeting. Why??? Did they know they were there having a meeting? WHY are they attacking them? So random. Not to mention Aquaman looks absolutely nothing like his supposed ""parents"" and he looks about 5-10 years younger than his dad. The acting, terrible. Plot, terrible. Music, terrible.

This one had great elements - directing was good, visuals pretty well done considering, and I did find the main lead actor playing Aquaman entertaining. But and this is a very very big but, aside from him, the worst acting I've seen in a long time. Amber Heard was awful. I mean I couldn't even stay in the plot when I saw her on screen - I just kept thinking about her being Elon Musk's ex. That's pretty far off from the movie's plot. Is she supposed to be a beauty?

3169,Bigjl98,"Beautiful scenery, excellent CGI, and great characters produce a DC movie that isn't anywhere as dark as most of the other DCEU movies.",8,18 December 2018,"In AQUAMAN, the movie does a beautiful job at being both a sequel to Justice League as well as an introduction of the Aquaman origin story through its use of flashbacks that didn't jar the viewer out of the tempo of the film. Hopefully the DCEU bosses can remember how to replicate the feeling of this movie and how it was done in their future stand alone character films.In most movies an actor and their character tends to steal the spotlight whenever on screen and Jason Mamoa skirting the line between hero of the common man, man who would be king, and hero of all; shows his ability to be a mixture of a man who wants to help others without recognition, doesn't want or like to take himself so serious, and finally becoming the man his mom told him about in 'Atlantian fork stories.' Momoa shows the hurt he has when thinking that he was the fault of so many peoples.
Overall the characters, and use of beautiful colors and backgrounds, the interwoven mix of the past and the present to tell the story as well as the origin story of AQUAMAN help the movie to become the second strongest film of the DCEU by a very wide margin.",Aquaman

The only saving grace is Jason Momoa who portrays Aquaman in a pretty unorthodox way, but it works and as I said saves a little bit of the movie. If I were to compare to another superhero movie it would be Black Panther. Aquaman is pretty much a really bad version of Black Panther. It lacks everything Black Panther has, even action which is probably one of the easiest things to pull off in a superhero movie.",Aquaman

Never had I expected this movie will this be good, after the Justice League and Batman V Superman because those movies are trash - and let's forget about those. This is the most ambitious comic-book movie I've ever seen so far. Finally a movie that DC fanboy deserves, this film is just beautiful within the cinematography, visuals, also the action scenes. The action scenes kinda remind me of Romanticism painting, it is visually stunning and breathtakingly beautiful. I'm not a fan of James Wan movies but he did a marvelous job for Aquaman. The cast are outstanding, badass performances. I don't think any actors can take the role of Aquaman better than Jason Momoa. The atmosphere of this film looks magnificent vibrant and has high-quality than any DCEU film. Finally we can see the light after those dark days. It has clear motivations for both heroes and villains, pretty solid.But, DCEU really need to fix their poor lines. The writing isn't the best - some dialogues are still cheesy & awkward. Nothing new for the plot, but it is simply enough - almost the same with any superhero film - save the world, family issues, etc. But it has a great message about polluting the water. Also the film scoring and soundtrack was a miss. And I don't see how and why Black Manta is the best villains, his story kinda flat and lacking for me. Black Manta has daddy issues seems not enough for me to think he is the best villain.Afterall, this is highly recommended movie for superhero movie fans. Also you have to watch it in an IMAX 3D.

She is pretty wooden and is clearly just for aesthetics rather than bringing any acting skills to the movie. Nicole Kidman brings some heart into it. Everyone else is forgettable.

3247,unityengine,An Amazing Movie,8,2 December 2020,"Aquaman is a super hero movie released on 21 december 2018. This movie was directed by James Wan, the story was written by James Wan, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, Will Beall, Geoff Johns and distributed by Warner Bros.
As the name suggests, this film tells the story of a man that has to live underwater (even though he doesn't like to) in order to fight for what he loves. Because the fight is underwater the weapon that the main character uses is a trident, this object links the movie to the Greek Mythology, as well as to the mythological creature called Kraken.
The main character (Jason Momoa) wasn't strong at the beginning, but he makes some new friends and becomes strong in no time.
Furthermore, there are astonishing effects and the costumes are very realistic.
In conclusion, Aquaman is a well worth watching movie not because there are amazing effects, nor for the characters, it is the plot that really makes it a good movie. I truly recommend this movie and if you are a fan of science fiction you should watch it.",Aquaman

3263,athisayajiratawornkul,This Film Never Gets Old,9,5 March 2021,"It has been three years since the movie came out, and now (2021), it is trending on Netflix! I have seen this movie in theaters and at home, and I'd have to say that the movie has not aged at all. The graphics is amazing! The choreography is great and the settings is just fantastic. Nothing looks old at all, and it has been three years! And by old, I mean outdated ideas, sad scenery, and under par concepts. I don't see any of it, and I've watched it twice. I am sure that a lot of creativity has been put into making the movie so kudos to James Wan.Alright, now to a short summary of the film so I can pick some points out that I love and hate. This movie is a DC based film. It is about Aquaman as the title said it, and this is post Whedon's Justice League. So the story line is along, Arthur Curry (Jason Mamoa) has already been known as a superhero named Aquman, and now, Mera (Amber Heard) - a warrior and a daughter of King Nereus - came to the surface to bear the news that Atlantis needs saving from Arthur's tyrant, half-brother, Orm Marius or Ocean Master (Patrick Wilson). The story seems cliché, but it works splendidly.The beginning of the movie, there is a narration which I was not fond of, but it was tolerable. The narration said that Arthur's mother, Atlanna (Nicole Nigman), is an Atlanteans and his father, Thomas Curry (Temuera Morrison), is a light house keeper. There is a cheesy moment about the romance of the two was bound to happen and how Arthur is born from the forbidden love. Moreover, Arthur is the link between the land and sea, and that is supposedly made him the greatest king. I did not like the beginning at all to be honest, so thank god, it was not that long.After that whole narration, there is finally a fight scene where Atlanna fought with the Atlantean soldiers who tried to take her back to Atlantis. I just wanna say Nicole Nigman is gorgeous there, and that fight scene is a blast to watch! This is also the first time I see the Atlantean soldiers too, and they are pretty cool. It was cool to an extend of being cool, but the costume is just a bit too clunky for me. The red, Atlantean soldiers that showed up later were dope though. And from there on, it is easy to say that the movie is amazing. The CGI of Atlantis is hard to be compared by any movies. It is so vivid and welcoming, and I think it fits the glow of the mysterious sunken city.I am going to jump to the end of the movie because this is the only part that I think did not do as great to me as the entire movie has led up to. It is the second fight between Orm and Arthur for the rightful throne, and it is unfortunate to say that the first fight is just way better. I have thought of three points for the reason it could have been better. The points are light, composition and setting. Though out the movie, I have been simulated with bright lights, various objects and amazing selection of location, and then the ending comes along. The fight is on top of a submarine... on the surface... at night... in the dark... with rain... and just a handful of audience. That is just a combination of disaster. Don't get me wrong, it looks cool and the fight choreography is amazing! It just falls short of the build up the entire film has initiated.All in all, I totally recommend this movie! Watch it! It's amazing and a great movie to spend two hours on. Even though the ending might be a bit of a letdown, the whole movie is just plastered with amazing creativity, vivid colors and liveliness. Watch it!",Aquaman

In the process of growth, he gradually realized that he have some difference with others, he has superpower.

As at the time it was released people talked a lot about the film and even the critics praised it I expected a little more (not so much morr), but it's so bad that it forced me to create an account and make a review.It really feels like satire, for a moment I even thought it might be. Even for a teen movie there are so many logical flaws in the script, the narrative sequence just doesn't make sense, the action scenes and new characters are placed in an absurdly forced way, the stories are without the slightest depth and shouldn't hold the attention or a child.

Secondly,the graphics were amazing.Full of color and light, the film attracted much attention on it. The characters were carefully chosen, but I think that other actors could be chosen different in some cases, that it would be a minus of the film.I think it's one of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen, being curious about the next scene in every moment.

The movie is completely self aware and actually manages to succeed with this lately overused trope. It reminded me of dumb but amazing 80s action movies and the humor honestly surpasses many Marvel movies.

3290,s11-1,"Norsemen says ""Hi""",5,26 August 2020,"So, there is on Netflix this crazy-funny little Norwegian series called ""Norsemen""/""Vikings"", which is a really good satire and a lot of fun to watch.One of the characters is Orm, the incredibly pathetic brother of the chieftain of the village, who also speaks in a kind of overly dramatic tone and is quite condescending, and also in a very wooden manner.
He does it really well!So, today I finally came around watching ""Aquaman"", and immediately I felt reminded of ""Norsemen"", with one guy called King Orm talking in this very same wooden manner.
Nearly identical.But in this movie, they are serious, they mean it!
And it is not good, not at all.The only redeeming factor of the movie is the CGI, but it feels very generic - we have seen all of that better somewhere else.Besides the looks there should be acting, and there is not. The plot is predictable, you know from the beginning on what happens to whom, and specific plot points and developments are not subtly hinted at, but are simply thrown in as if there is a list of stuff to cross off:
Ok, there is a guy with super powers. Check.
Ok, his mother was apparently killed, but its not. Check.
Ok, guy with super powers creates trauma for a bad guy, so bad guy can go on vendetta. Check.
Ok, some ruler guy of some ""tribe""/""kingdom"" is simply told about an artefact that makes him the big kahuna. Check.
Ok, the big kahuna guy feels threatened by the super guy. Check.
And so on, and so forth.The movie feels incredibly generic, and I'm happy to go back watching a cheap bit funny little series about politically active Vikings from a thousand years ago instead.

He's certainly not the same caliber of character he was in Justice League, and that alone should say a lot.Lowering the bar simply because it is a ""comic book movie"" doesn't sit well with me, so if this is more indicitive of what Zack Snyder wants to produce, then the DCEU is in more trouble than we ever realized.",Aquaman

3299,PlataVilla,Spectacular All Around,10,1 January 2019,"This movie, to me, was spectacular all around. I was pleasantly surprised at both the ""Earthy, human love"" elements and quick spots of humor that subtly permeated the movie - how Arthur came into being, incidents at various points of his childhood, and how he was trained as a warrior. You don't see that in many Superhero movies. Oh yeah, there was that Wonder Woman movie. I loved Arthur's reluctant hero attitude, smart mouth, and negative view toward his Mother's people. How would you feel about them if you knew what he knew?The story line was straightforward and clear, the bad guys weren't really without cause but still needed to be put down, and the movie did not drag along. Actually, the action was virtually non-stop throughout the movie. The casting was awesome. Momoa, Kidman, Heard, Dafoe, and Wilson seemed to be made for their roles - most of all Jason Momoa. Who but he could have done as well as Arthur?And the CGI/graphic portions of the movie were amazing. James Wan was able to let it all hang out here - I think partially because a lot of the movie takes place under water, we get a chance to see CGI in all it's three-dimensional glory. I remember thinking while watching that I had not seen such visually stunning scenes in a movie since Avatar - and, no, I'm not saying this movie in any way matches up with Avarar; just some of the amazing visual aspects.This is an outstanding movie. Go see it on the big screen!",Aquaman

3302,trex_raz,"Adventure, awe and wonder",9,22 December 2018,"Aquaman rises from the depths and brings back faith in the DCEU! After the underwhelming Justice League movie, the task of keeping the light on in the darkness of the DCEU falls on the most underestimated member of the roster: Aquaman. In the biggest surprise of the last couple of years, the new DC is movie is not only good, but probably the best of the new universe. All in all, I, for one, left the theatre in good spirits, a feeling that persists even a day later as I'm writing this review.Even the synopsis is more coherent than most of the other DCEU movies. When it comes to the story, Aquaman is inspired by Geoff Johns's New 52 story-arc that relaunched the character in critical and public acclaim. While they are not profound or thought provoking, the story and the script are simple, easy to follow and very engaging. It is inspired by the Arthurian quest, while also being a swashbuckling-adventure movie. The way the story goes always makes you excited for the next step in the hero's journey, because Aquaman finally manages to follow the classical mythic structure. I'm not saying moviemakers shouldn't take risks bending or modifying this structure, but most of the time we get convoluted and confusing stories like Batman V Superman. The third act of the movie and the fact that it embraces every element, be it silly or not, makes it better than Wonder Woman, for me.The cast is pretty solid and the characters receive a pretty balanced screen time. Jason Momoa's performance in JL was decent, but felt out of place. Here, Momoa shines. He unleashes all of his charisma and has fun playing a fun character. Aquaman in light-hearted and a little arrogant, coming to terms with his heritage and history. He isn't very changed after the events of JL, but he does understand the consequences of his actions. He grows on his arthurian journey and becomes a more responsible person. His relationships with those around him are also very important. Mera (Amber Heard) is his guide on the journey and the chemistry between Momoa and Heard plays a big part. I was very impressed with Amber's acting. Vulko (Willem Dafoe) is his mentor, the one that showed him the atlantean way and I was sad that his role was not as big as I hoped, but Dafoe makes the best out of his appearances. Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Arthur's mother, also does a very good job. Temuera Morrison's role as Tom Curry is small but brings an important emotional element.The movie has two villains, King Orm, Arthur half-brother, as the main one and Black Manta, as a secondary one. Patrick Wilson as King Orm does a terrific job! His character is constructed as a roman emperor: stern, noble and arrogant. Orm has a purpose and his motives are always clear, so no mumbo-jumbo villain here. He sees himself as the true leader of the Atlantean Empire and acts like it. His experience working with James Wan on both franchises, but also in horrors gives him an edge in playing a menacing, but powerful character. Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is Aquaman's main antagonist in the comics, but the story nedeed to focus on Arthur's rise and his battle with Orm, so Manta is merely introduced here. His origin story is very well done, as we find out about him and his hatred for the hero and seeing just enough of him to understand his story. He is clearly set up as a bigger villain the future Aquaman stories.Visually, Aquaman is breathtaking. The underwater world looks amazing. Blending elements of Sci-Fi and fantasy, Aquaman shows us an imaginary world that is the stuff of dreams. Yes, the movie is bonkers! You have sharks with laser guns on their backs, armored seahorses, warrior crabs and an octopus playing the drums! But it's the kind of stuff we used to imagine as kids, the kind of creations that made us daydream forever and it is amazing. It might seem silly, but Aquaman doesn't shy away from going full on comicbook style and for that, it deserves a golden starfish! The soundtrack is also very well crafted, composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams. The music fills every scene with that sense of wonder and heroism, making the whole journey an adventure for the viewer as well.Overall, Aquaman is a solid superhero movie! It knows what it wants to make us feel and never strays from the path it chose. When I left the cinema I felt good, I felt entertained and pleasantly surprised, as I was cautious, it being a DC movie. Aquaman made me feel that spirit of adventure, awe and wonder that I haven't felt since I was a kid and stayed up late to watch The Wizard of Oz or The Clash of Titans on TCM and that makes it one of the best comicbook movies. Because, in the end, as much as we want drama and profound lessons, we need superheroes and their stories to make us feel better, to take our minds away from our daily lives and our problems and transport us into a fantastical world brimming with adventures, heroes, monsters and the hope of a better world.",Aquaman

3314,publicinspace_patricio,Aquaman Accomplishes to be a Good Entry to the DCEU,9,18 December 2018,"I was apprehensive at first when I purchased tickets a month ago from the Amazon Prime Early Screening promotion. If you're asking why, you haven't seen the other films, or you maybe asking why the hell would I bother with the DC films at this point?Allow me to elaborate: Man of Steel (2013) set the precident for what would become the DC Extended Universe. I liked it for what it was, perhaps not as much as I enjoyed the Superman (1978) epic-but it's no mention that it surpassed the films proceeding it.Then the highly anticipated Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) hit the cinemas. I was part of that geeked crowd-until that somewhat jarring moment when Jimmy Olson was killed and that was only the tip of iceberg of what ensued the next two hours. I hated Batman v Superman-for doing something things right, specifically with Batman, but having such a chaotic storyline that had a layer of subplots in order to expand the story only to weight it down. But that's just a front, because I was fuming that Superman was killed-in his second film.We are NOT going to talk about Sucide Squad (2016) beyond the fact that Margot Robbie was the best thing in it.Then Wonder Woman (2017) came-reassuring me that there was hope for the franchise and finally gave us a superhero movie that fit the sensibilities of it's source material. So when Justice League (2017) was nearing, I thought there could be some hope. Justice League was just as well a ""mixed bag"", but not exactly the same mixture as Batman v Superman. It seemed that it's tone was everywhere-and I can go on all day about it.Aquaman (2018), however, is in fact a good film. It's performances were strong, especially Yahya Abdul's-Mateen II's Black Manta and Patrick Wilson's Ocean Master. Momoa makes Aquaman his own, and even sort of gives a ""Jack Burton"" vibe to his performance. Amber Heard is also pretty good, but the chemistry between the two seemed at moments forced, albeit brief. I have always been a fan of the Aquaman comics growing up. Granted, as good of a film this was, it had flaws-particularly with it's choice in songs for certain scenes. The cinematic score was solid, but the soundtrack for this film derailed the film's momentum at some points, and truth be told, if you're going to use a cover of a Toto song, just use Toto. The film also suffers from too much exposition in it's story-but it suffers like a a two-day cold, well, more like a ten minute cold in Aquaman's case. But the film gets things right with everything else. What was the most entrancing was the extravagant cinematography (yes, there is some heavy handed CGI that is utilized-but it doesn't hurt the film), and the scope of Atlantis and it's lore are well established. James Wan once again makes a good film, and it's refreshing to see a DC hero that we as an audience never seen before attempted on the screen (nor television for that matter) come to life, and handled well.But give this film a chance, because it is in fact good. Hopefully this well set the scene for the DCEU in the near future, but I've been fooled before.,,",Aquaman

To be clear, I didn't mind Man of Steel, but this was a ""new"" and overall more entertaining film.Hopefully this combined with Wonderwoman is enough to keep the DC Universe going, as I'm sure there still some good stories that can be told.",Aquaman

It's probably much more geared toward men who enjoy a good battle and special effects because there was plenty of that. Not enough meat in the plot for me and the whole thing just seemed to drag.

3336,chris-909-253825,(Almost) saved by the individual,6,5 April 2019,"Great: Visuals (costumes, set pieces, and sfx primarily)Good: Momoa & the final actAverage: Ocean Master & Black Manta, Sound editing, and KidmanBad: Patrick WilsonAwful: Plot (convoluted and illogical), Almost all Dialogue (simple, stereotypical, and contrived)I personally have not seen a film with such a massive gap in quality between the visuals and writing. Easily the worst dialogue of 2018 but also a contender for best artistic vision. Worth watching but only barely.
Visually excellent, Wan's direction clearly focuses on Momoa outshining the other characters, which he certaintly does, and individual artists being given liberty to amaze the audience with stunning details. With set pieces spanning multiple genres and a rather broad scope on Atlantean culture, DC almost makes this film above average but fails in almost every other category aside from these few specific areas.Part of what makes DC comics and animated features so great is their willingness to not oversimplify complex themes. Ocean Master is a phenomenal and complex character but the writers in this film made him a one-dimensional stereotype. This pattern is repeated across nearly every character as each speaks exactly what is expected and nothing more. Momoa is the slight exception to this as he brings humanity (lol pun) to the derivative atlantean dialogue. This decision was clearly taken out of fear that creating multiple complex, logical characters would overcomplicate the plot and ruin the experience for the lowest common denominator. Whether or not this is a positive is up for debate but with such depth in source material, I personally believe we should hold DC films to higher standards.Is it awful? No, but it does have very poor execution in a few areas which are highlighted by excellence in other areas. It is my sincere hope that future DCEU releases focus on character depth primarily and visual artistry secondarily. Without a change soon, the opportunity to rival marvel may be gone and the complex characters we love will be confined to the small screen permanently.",Aquaman

Jason Mamoa is the best part of Aquaman he does a fantastic job of balancing the action, drama and comedy in the film. The CGI is beautiful. James Wan's vision for this new cinematic world was ambitious and bold.
The Bad. The dialogue is just horrible in several spots. Jason Mamoa had the better part of the dialogue but Amber Hurd, Kidman and black Mantas suffered the most. Casting aside from Mamoa was weird. I felt like they sought out actors to be unique rather than fit the chemistry for Mamoa.

Most of the cast is from the Hayden Christian school for being Anakin Skywalker .Plot.

And that hijacked submarine, it shows up in the most obvious setup and attacks for no reason, and no one is even suspicious (and there never is a reveal, just ignore it ever happened). Also, let's not destroy the surface dwellers that easily, first we must have the most massive war amongst ourselves to insure that we destroy our own armies.

Having laid my hands upon a few of these comics in my time, I mostly know what they are about. They are about those alter hero egos that we have and thanks to ever evolving technology, visual effects and to see how the movie team envisioned the setting.
Because;
Well, helloooo! The stories, the character backgrounds, arch-villians were delivered long time ago, aaaand plots over plots have been worked upon already in the comic series. This is not a political thriller or mystery movie where you will find stomach churning twists around every corner that will dazzle you in ways you would not expect.
So what I liked;
I found Aquaman to deliver a good job when it is about visuals. I very much liked the technological gadgets&vehicles of the Atlanteans and specifically enjoyed the underwater scenes&visuals and the Daft Punk like music that accompanied it (which kind of pleasantly reminded me Tron).I also liked the fact that Jason Momoa was chosen to be the lead actor, him being from Hawai ascend and a few times in the movie throwing in gestures coming from his culture was neat.I also liked the scenes with the Kraken and how he gets the trident like Arthur gets the Excalibur or Conan his sword. It had similar flavours but in a pleasing way.As the villains go I have to say Patrick Wilson also does a good job as King Orm.So if you have no prejudice on DC, and realistic about what to expect from these movies I say; Aquaman nails it in a rather good way. I have to admit one of the best I have seen recently, and yes including Deadpool 2 or Avengers Infinity War 1!",Aquaman

The storyline was great, the visual effects were fantastic and I really liked the characters and the humor, the gags. Maybe Manta was a bit stupid man, but we could understand everybody's motivation and intentions. This is the movie I'll watch so many times cause every detail added something special.

And last but not least, the villains were so damn relatable, it was hard to have bad feeling for them. And I actually (small spoiler) would have thrown the damn trash back on land too if I was Orm. Anyway, go and see it. It was a good time with or without kids.",Aquaman

3391,danmurray07,A highly thrilling wet and wild ride!,10,6 January 2019,Ok I'm not gonna say it the most gripping and realistic superhero movie I've ever seen but if your like me and really enjoy lots of good fight and action sequences mixed with some comical and even touching moments then Aquaman is for you. However something about this movie and especially Jason Momoa's character just makes me wanna watch this movie again and I just left the theater. He brings a real and authentic feel to this hero that you can relate to. I hands down fully feel this is without a doubt one of if not the best film I've seen all year. Go see it now!!!!,Aquaman
3392,pnbrown2,DO. NOT. WATCH,1,30 April 2019,"The 7.1 IMDB Score was enough for this comic book movie fan to say... I'll give that a try. Do not let these ratings fool you. Worst film of all the recent DC universe (and that's saying something) and possibly the worst ""mainstream"" movie I've ever seen. TERRIBLE dialog, acting, plot, and soundtrack. Yes the visuals are Impressive but that doesn't make up for the fact that you're looking at every cheap one liner and movie cliche known to man being jammed into the movie like a 1 year old trying to fit a baby carrot into and electrical outlet.For your own good, save your time and watch something.... literally ANYTHING else",Aquaman

3396,r1vz,Aquaman: THe review,6,23 December 2018,"The movie definitely exceeded my expectations for the most part and it was really pleasant to watch, however, it was a far cry from perfect.
What I liked the most, and this is of course my personal opinion, is that the incorporated a lot of jokes. Even though at times it seemed corny, it was still funny for me so I enjoyed them. The visuals were amazing, the color selection ( for the most part ) was extremely high level, the whole concept of filming everything underwater was pure delight to watch.Now for the things that could have been improved. All the things I am about to say, I reviewed them on my way home, since I wanted to concentrate on the movie in the cinema.
Black Manta. In my opinion, the back story was somewhat weak, and the dialogue was not strong for the character. I think this was mostly an issue on the director's side, not the authors. Further, since when do pirates have the ability to dismantle atlantian tech and the reassemble it according to what they need ? Did the Black Manta have a degree in robotics/physics degree or something ?
The second submarine that attacked the meeting between Orm and King Nereus, where did it come from? Who was behind it? Not sure I understood that part. Most likely it was Orm's doing but never really explained by whom it was piloted or how.
The scene jumping from the plane into the desert. Since when do children of King's and Queens can just dive from, suppose 500 meters and above, and have no damage ? :) Of course they have super strength and all but if we were to take actual physics into account here, it did seem rather weird.
Lastly, the last fighting scene between the two armies - Orm's united forces and crab looking people ( forgot their name ) it was not done in a good manner. Absolutely, the effects were stunning, the light show display was amazing, but the camera was moving so fast that you could hardly understand what was going on. To continue, the last fighting scene between Aquaman an Orm, how did that ship get up there to the surface? It was not shown, neither did Aquaman push it to the surface so who knows..
My biggest surprise was the transition of Aquaman from this cool, confident, slightly cocky person to this timid, unworthy Kind towards the moment of obtaining the trident. Honestly, it felt somewhat strange. Of course, I do know the fact he never wanted to be king, but his whole personality of fighting for what is right, protecting the people and then suddenly changing to the sour face person, who thinks he is unworthy? I think the writing of that scene was strange.
There were other small plot holes, but for the most part, it was truly enjoyable.The acting. I definitely liked everyone in the movie, especially Jason Momoa and Amber Heard. One could say there was little chemistry between them, but in my eyes, I saw their sparkle, these little hints of something to come. It gave me this nice and warm feeling. Therefore, my compliments to the whole crew on delivering this movie to us, and on good acting. I was going for a 7, but ended up putting an 8. Despite the fact I am objective and realistic, it is Christmas after all.",Aquaman

I really want DC to get back on its feet and I was hoping Aquaman would get it there... but honestly I still feel like the franchise is in limbo. The move IS visually stunning. The colors are incredibly saturated,the camera work was really nice, the CGI was well done. However the writing was often cliched and cheesy; jokes fell flat for me(which happens in most movies) there was no money left in the budget for amber heard's wig and last but most importantly it had a horrible score. My god. They had a cover of Africa (by Toto) sung by Pitbull... why. The score wasn't background it was heavy handed and brought me out of the movie often. Very similar to the newest fast and furious movies (obviously) the score works at making moments feel badass and fails at every other emotion. All this aside the movie is simple, don't go on there expecting anything particularly poignant. If you don't think too hard you can just enjoy it.",Aquaman

3409,aman123301,Wish I could give a zero star,1,8 March 2019,"The movie is weird from every angle. Like, super advanced Atlantis kings fight with trident and these tridents are made up with steel. Half of the story is Harry Potter. Aquaman is featured in international news but no one knows him outside a bar near his hometown. A little town of Italy is raged by unusual forces, yet not a normal human dies. And the hero has no weakness, like he is violently beaten almost to death and then saved by sea weed. The mother never ages. Aquaman and the red headed heroine needed a diesel engine small ship to cross oceans in one minute. And every sunrise/sunset scenes has so poor VFX that it belongs to Atlantis age. Black Panther is much scientific and enjoyable movie.

3412,gremlyn202,Predictable and disjointed,3,6 January 2019,"I really wanted to like this movie. I'll list the things I liked first:
Nicole Kidman as a hero....she never plays characters like this and I liked her casting.
Jason Mamoa is cast well for this part.
Visuals are mostly very good.Now what I didn't like:
Amber Heard is AWFUL. She has no dimension and no chemistry between her and Momoa. She's not believable as an action star. Her line delivery is so bad it makes you cringe.
The plot...predictable and rushed. If you've seen any superhero movie you'll know the plot within the first 10 minutes.
Script. Wow. It's bad. They don't develop any character, including Momoa, and rush every cliche in the book to try and make this work. Jokes fall flat. Everything just feels halfway done. It's disjointed and relies too heavily on battles that you aren't even sure why they are really happening. It was like we have to introduce this whole world in 2.5 hours so here is as thin as we can do it.
It's way too long. I was bored about halfway through.
The visuals, although good, don't give you enough detail to get invested. And the underwater hair bothered me....sometimes it floated, sometimes it didn't.
Too many villains. Just pick one! The brother or Manta (I think that's his name but honestly I'm not even sure).
I really feel like they should have done the origin story first and only. Tell me how Momoa was taught about his two worlds. How did he decide to become this hero? How does he meet Dafoe's Character? What does he do on a daily basis? How does he find out about all these issues at sea that he needs to fix?Then next movie is finding his mom and fighting his brother.Then next movie is fighting Manta.I'm really giving this 3 stars for Momoa's abs. Other than that, save your $10 and go watch the previews and you'll know what happens.",Aquaman

No character development at all - a real lost opportunity since a lot more could have been explored about Aquaman's origin and being different, trying to adapt in the human world, his emotional struggles, etc..

Most of them are godly which makes it hard to develop them into believable and relatable characters. Yet all DC origin movies succeeds in this aspect.

3436,Jinxie_G,A Brief Review,10,16 December 2018,"Typical hero journey where the hero must face hardships and go through a trial to achieve the one thing he doesn't want-to become king. Right?Not exactly. And it isn't quite so simple. Don't worry, I don't drop spoilers.I mean, yes, we're definitely following the hero journey story line because it's a superhero movie, but there isn't much typical about this movie, much like there isn't anything typical about Jason Momoa. ""Aquaman"" is filled with comedy and drama, love, exceptional action and horror that throws some fantastic jump-scare at its audience. The backstory is well done and touching. The comedy is timed perfectly, in my opinion, and quite hilarious. We're faced with more than one bad guy but also shown consequences of our actions. And by ""our"" I mean 'we the audience' as well as the characters.We've already seen Momoa in this role in ""Justice League,"" but this film, this movie, expands on that, and he is outstanding and was meant to play Arthur Curry. Of that, I have no doubt. Kinda like Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool. Nicole Kidman as Atlanna kicks ass, Amber Heard as Mera gives a great performance, and Willem Dafoe...what can I say? The man playing Vulko has been in both Marvel and DC movies, and his acting is stellar as always. Patrick Wilson gives a fabulous performance as the entitled King Orm, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II shows us a glimpse of Manta's humanity, albeit brief, and what one will do to exact revenge. James Wan (""Insidious,"" ""Furious 7""), director, gives us visuals-holy sh!t the visuals-that are stunningly beautiful, and storytelling that is spot on and retains the momentum from Jenkins' ""Wonder Woman,"" keeping the DCU's heart beating strong.I don't know about you, but I think DC has finally figured out how to make movies. I will definitely be watching this again, and buying it.""I dig it.""",Aquaman

The acting is good, but the fight scenes and action sequences had me glued to the movie.Ok, so here's one of my remaining questions. Follow me down the rabbit hole for a second. In the opening Russian sub scene Black Manta receives his grandfathers knife. Then while battling Aquaman, Black Manga tries to uses human made steel but can not injure him. After receiving the armor and confronting Aquaman, Black Manta reveals that he now has Atlantian steel. A few frames later he tries to wield his grandfathers blade on Aquaman and cuts him deep.

Pro:-nice visuals -some gags are funny -Momoa is pretty badass
Contra: -the story is terrible you can literally guess all the of it from the begining, that on it's own makes the 2,5 hours feel way longer -the music is terrible it breakes the atmosphere constantly and you find yourself wondering why would they choose that song instead of watching the film -they are still trying to sell a superhero universe mostly made for kids as a dark and realistic space, it gets more and more tryhard with every movie, I mean if you want to look at it with a realistic eye just think for a bit about the last big battle sceene....... -Also we just needed a ""random"" love interest for a guy like this totally made sense as the bigest cliche of a cliche collectiveWhat probably hurts the most is all the wasted potential, they should finally learn to roll with the story instead of trying to make the most realistic epic fairitale of a hero ever.......",Aquaman

While this is a good popcorn superhero movie and Jason Momoa is excellent as Aquaman, I wondered what Nicole Kidman was thinking when she signed on (other than a nice pay cheque). The Black Manta subplot was completely wasted - would have been better to use in the sequel.
The visual effects, while spectacular in places, looked a bit ""more of the same"" (think The Abyss, Thor) - not as original as I would have expected.
Overall, it was good but not great. Certainly better than other entries in the DC universe so far......",Aquaman
3462,farazainarkar,"IT'S A ""JAMES WAN"" FILM.......IMAX 3D SPLASHANDOUS!!!",10,13 December 2018,"First of all James Wan.....GENIUS!
For fans of DC its obviously the best DC Film since Dark Knight Rises in terms of the overall experience!In terms of fab moments it's the best one since BvS!Pros-
VFX are better than Black Panther and Ragnarok Combined! Honestly the best since Avatar and Life of Pi! If this doesn't win the Oscar for Visual Effects I don't know what will!Pacing...Wan does not treat you like a 4 year old baby...he's to the point in every scene and treats you like a mature audience!Female characters! Honestly the way Wonder Woman was stupidly shown being a badass by deflecting bullet..I mean what!..Here Wan actually gives amazing contextual scenes to Mera and Queen Atlanna...Especially showing Mera as smart and powerful in ACTUAL BAD SITUATIONS and not for the sake of it!
And Queen Atlanna as a protective and powerful Mother and Wife!Realistic Action Sequences! I mean the sensibility of the fact that Arthur jumping from a rooftop and not landing on his feet almost all the time shows that being a hero does not mean you can do it! Also there are scenes where Arthur also gets beat up and hurt as he should...REALISTICALLY SPEAKING!CINEMATOGRAPHY IS OTHER WORLDLY!CONS-
If you have to honestly nitpick anything then I would say it would be the music in some scenes and the little backstory of Black Manta and King Orm.I felt they should have been given more stuff...but since its James Wan I believe he will unfold more about them in Aquaman 2!!Finally try and watch it in IMAX 3D if possible with your friends and family its the most entertaining movie of the year!",Aquaman

great graphics
there are all movie elements you never see them in one movie; good, evil, love, history, imagination, high tech...etc but most important is the end. i admire the end. it's happy end and no one is missed.

3468,kev0055,Many problems on many levels,1,16 December 2018,"1. Story telling is jarring no origin story gives u the huffing puffing brainless muscle tattoo guy beating people up straight away.2. Expect audiences to identify with a tattoo muscle man with zero depth drinking beer bashing skulls right at the beginning? Seriously3. A horribly stereotypical movie. 1 dimensional black guys villians, women characters whose exposed breasts speak louder than their words. This is not the 60s anymore. At least they didn't do blackface.4. The black villian subplot is a waste of screen time and can be removed with absolutely NO effects to the movie5. Problematic source material means overuse of CGI. It feels more like an Xbox / computer game than a movie.6. Insipid shallow dialog. Everyone is treated as a 5 year old. Just a step up from hulk smash.7. Costume design is hilarious. Look like star wars Storm troopers or something clobbered together in 5 minutes. Leathery fin on Nicole Kidman's back like see Halloween swimming costume? SeriouslyYou do better, hell lot better than that.8. Unnecessary plot holes. Where's the almighty BFG gifted to the black villian? Not used at all. Wasting audience time.9. Queen reunites with illegitimate hubby at the end. So there's going to be more Aquaman children running around in the future? Please, tie up all your plot holes and prevent necessary jokes.10. You remember the soundtrack of the movie inception. Aquaman? What, there is even a soundtrack? Totally nonexistent / insipid / uninspiring audio makes it difficult to connect to a movie already hard to begin with.11. There is zero character transformation of the hero from beginning to end. Still the same old beer swagging tattoo bar brute than a ""King"". What, he is perfect as he is? What sort of an origin story is this12. The jokes are not funny. Bar scene joke is more of a distraction than adding value. The toilet bowl face dunk is just plain crude and another plot hole. So what happens he is going to spend his life in that toilet?",Aquaman
3469,paulson79,One of the Best superhero movies ever!,8,20 December 2018,"Aquaman threw out of the window 90% of MCU just like that. After I went out of cinema I was really wondering, if perhaps WB were intentionally trolling themselves with previous productions to make everyone thinking, that DCEU sucks, only to make the biggest comeback ever? Im no longer pesimistic about next movies from this franchise. Im really convinced that there will not be any crappy movie after they achieved so much for a character that is not the biggest Icon in DC Universe.
And they did that in the Best possible moment, cause upcomming Captain Marvel will be sour SJW trash and if Shazzam will keep the level of Aquaman (Im trully convinced that it will) DC will catch up a lot from the distance to MCU. And this is possibly the best news for fans of comic books like myself.
Well done WB&DC! You cought your opponent of guard and served him very mean left swing.
P.S. The line that Jason Mamoa spoke in conversation with sea monster is the Best line I heard in superhero movies ever and I dont recall even one MCU production with a line that good. Those who saw the movie Im sure will agree. Those who didnt, I envy you emotions when you will witness the moment.
The movie isnt perfect, but its actually very close to be considered as such and one of the Best comic book inspired movies ever.

Seriously, I'm not exaggeratingNow I love me a bit of cheese but this was curdled milk. Nothing more, nothing less. Some people obviously like curdled milk.This could have been amazing. Let me start off by saying the casting of Jason Momoa was inspired. He visually is Aquaman. This is where the compliments end. Acting all round was shocking. Patrick Wilson as the bad guy??? COME ON!!!! My cats are more threatening!This film seemed to pay unintentional homage to Flash Gordon, He-Man the Movie, Tron (remake), Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Transformers 3, Baywatch....you get the gist. Oh and please do not get me started on the flute/recorder scene. WTAF was that??? I actually laughed out loud in the cinema and I could hear a chorus of groans around me from others.Poorly cast & poorly executed. Such a shame as this could have been a belter.

Well yeah, if you wanna go to watch a movie and have a great time laughing this is your movie. We were laughing for every super cliche escene, it really seemed it was a parody. The performance of the actors/actresses were awful!!! I can't believe it had such good actors and at the same time so terrible performances!! How did they accepted to do it?!?

The amount of action packed sequences in this movie is too much. And everyone of them is done absolutely amazing . The Vfx/Cgi is one of the best you can experience . You would definitely fall in love with the camera work that James Wan has pulled off. The script is also good , not great. I missed the amazing dialogues and one-liners from Zack Snyder movies. Also the background scores were also not as per the scene. The place where they should have put an epic score, they put a pop music. I know the taste to mucic is different for everyone , but still I thought it didn't fit right. Also sometimes the actors were doing some over-the-top acting. Once you watch the movie you can see it.That been said, the overall movie experience is just awesome. You would definitely get the value of your money. Do experience it on IMAX.",Aquaman

This movie is not Oscar worthy but it is entertaining, colorful, funny, and the story line is well developed. It deserves a score more than a 55 by the critics.

3496,xcver-1,A good to watch movie that has some flaws behind the facade,6,18 January 2019,"So first off I really enjoyed the movie, especially after some of the other horrendous DC offerings. However after the shiny front there are some things that disturb me, because they are a bit strange. I think technically the film is good although a bit too much CGI. Here are some of the quarrels I have with it:The motives of the first villain that is introduced. So first off why are the Pirates shooting the whole submarine up (to potentially reduce its ability to work?) including all the seamen inside? It would seem a lot easier to use some gas, since they are all wearing masks anyhow (except the named characters of course). Also the very valid argument Acquaman makes that they killed all these innocents and now complain that he does not help them. I feel very little compassion for this villain and it seems forced.While the underwater visuals are stunning to look it, some stuff is just over top. For instance...underwater waterfalls?Fake looking movements. Some of the CGI enhanced movements just look irritatingly fake, for instance when someone jumps in the water and accelerates mid-air. It just feels physically very wrong.So we are looking at a potential war on a global scale, yet the rest of the justice league does nothing?Wanting to prevent the deaths of millions doesn't prevent Acquaman from charging in with the Trench and killing everything in the path.Don't get me wrong, still enjoyed the movie. But how someone can give this movie a 10 out of 10 rating is beyond me. 10 should mean, that this is the best movie in this type of movies. Acquaman is enjoyable, which at least should give it a 6 or 7 but it is in no way unique or phantastically acted etc.",Aquaman

They missed the mark. Over acting, poorly written/delivered lines, red hair that wasn't necessary and underwater storm trooper wanna be soldiers.Mamoa and company I think did the best with the lines they had. The entire cast is way better than this performance. The best actor in the whole thing was the main villan.Mera's hair was ridiculously bad. Tone it down. Look natural. Look like you have lived in a place the majority of your life that doesn't get sun. The wig was bad and it made her look so out of place.Atlantis...can you make it halfway believealble that we shouldn't have discovered it? It looked bigger than Rhode Island and brighter than Vegas!The soldier's armor was terrible. It didn't fit at all with living under water or the armor that the leaders were wearing. Sea life is stealthy not bright white.All that said, the plot was good. I hope they don't get a big head with this movie's success and apply this formula to other D.C. Movies.",Aquaman

3502,jackshah7,James Wan nailed it - Not bad for underdog Director,9,22 December 2018,"Read this while listening to Everything I need by Skylar Grey on looping - 🎧Ladies and Gentlemen,""There is only one true King"" - Zack Snyder (2015)I'm really selective when reviewing a film. However, I put an exception on this one. Aquaman (2018) is a mind blown! Simple and powerful performance from the cast is enough to inspire tears or at least goosebumps. This is my third time watching in the theatre, and I rated this movie deserves 9 stars out of 10. The movie is deserved to get my money, and I think I will continue to support it until the 4th time. If u guys know me you guys know that I'm a movie aficionado aka cinephile and a film that has a good combination of cinematography and music will certainly make me enjoy it to the higher level.I love and enjoyed our Kuching-born underdog Director, Mr. James Wan. I've followed his work since Saw film, and his work in The Conjuring universe is exceptional, his skills in directing is well respected.Even though DCEU is a ""Second Class"" or B-List while MCU is a ""First Class"" or an A-List type of film, Wan, however, proves that it's possible to rebuild DCEU to a quality film on-par with MCU. Kudos to Mr. Wan because moving towards a right direction, after flops from Justice League (2017), BvS (2016) and Man of Steel (2013), I can guarantee that any DC fanboy will love Aquaman film, and possibly they will cry because of the mind blown cinematic experience. Aquaman (2018) is best rated film (soft reboot) after The Dark Knight (2008), a 10 year progression.I like the myth of Atlantis, the idea of an advanced, Utopian civilization is intriguing. Some people view Atlantis as fiction while others believed it's real. The mystery around it makes me think deeply there could be a technological advancement that was wiped in history - nothing is lasting forever.I'm not superheroes/comic fanboy, but Aquaman is a type of movie you'll never miss. Aquaman is one of the masterpiece from DCEU, an emotional ride, and a family drama. James Wan nailed it! Thank you, James Wan! I'm not interested to spoil it, so, Go watch it now!! 🔱",Aquaman

Everything in this movie is making me having goosebumps. The actors and actresses have given their best and really fit into their characters. The story is so details like exactly what I want. And the effect is superb!! Almost couldn't find a difference between reality and CGI. James Wan is a very good also talented director with his amazing idea that make underwater is beyond our minds. Very proud with DC and Warner Bros to choose him to made this movie. Can't wait for the next surprise from DC and I know they have hidden potential with their characters and just need to find a perfect director.

Like all the DC classics, Aquaman could have been good if it was darker like Batman and focused on character and story rather than special effects and cheesy one liners. Seriously, one liners should have stopped after Arnie did Commando, but here we are in 2018 with bikers taking selfies and stereotype bad guys in black, with ridiculous weapons and the worst dressed underwater royalty I've seen. The costumes in The Little Mermaid were better.Probably the worst movie I saw in 2018 (and the last one).",Aquaman

3524,sethbarden56,If I could rate this any lower I would.,1,24 April 2019,Was very hyped for this movie but let down so badly. Visually it was top notch and Jason Momoa was surprisingly decent. That said the story is atrocious! The story is so bad that when I found the Aquaman comic the film was based on I bought it to see how it compares. Let me say this if you had hope for this movie but we're let down go read the comic because it's brilliant. They tried to take the whole run on Aquaman that Geoff Johns wrote and shove it into one movie. I feel like there's to many writers on this movie. 2 people writing the screenplay and 3 writing the story seems like too many hands in the kitchen.,Aquaman

3541,Phemt666,Entertaining but with a big plot hole,6,12 January 2019,"Aquaman it's a nice action movie that completely embrace the Marvel Cinematic Universe style.
The movie is fun and entertaining, but the characters are somehow inconsistent (Nicole Kidman is a little ludicrous with her wig and acting) and there is a big plot hole: the events take place about a year after Justice League (like it's said during a scene), and here comes the question ""where is Superman""? There is no point in fearing a war with Atlantis if there is superman. The movie could end after one phone call ""Hello Clark? It's me, Arthur... Yeah, I'm fine... Listen, can you kick my brother's ass? Ok, thank you, see you later"".
Ok, maybe Arthur is too proud and doesn't want to seek help, but after the first warning from Atlantis (tsunami and so on) I think that superman could just go above Atlantis, use his heat vision and boil everyone...
If you watch Aquaman with this in mind it's hard to enjoy it, because there is no sense at all in what is happening, but if you can pretend that Superman does not exist it's a nice movie.",Aquaman

Why didn't she die when trying to get it? Clearly everyone else did
Why can some atlantean breathe on land and some can't?
When aquaman and mera and walking in the desert with no supplies, how are they not dehydrated? Especially since they are atlantean. Somehow they randomly find the entrance
Looking thru a bottle on a statue somehow points the way? How the hell does that pinpoint anything? it's a direction, they don't know how close or far they need to go.There are so many problems with the story, I can go on for a while.

Outcasted prince/king wants nothing to do with the throne, girl is engaged to Villan who she wants nothing to do with. Prince and girl go on a journey together and fall in love. Blah blah blah. Same ol' same ol'. Cheesy one liners too ""we didn't hit something. Something hit us"" (eye roll)I couldn't really feel Aquaman's development. His character was stoic and He had the same attitude the whole time, just spoke diffrent words. Why can't two characters just go on a journey together and not have to kiss. Nothing intimate or important happened between the too to make me believe they now love each other. They touch hands, he holds her a little and BAM, that's it. No chemistry between the two. No deep conversation about how they view life, or any real deep character beliefs. OH! And we please stop casting Micheal Beach as the evil guy. As soon as I saw him I knew he was the bad guy.

I was wrong.
The visuals are great, beautiful colors and I really liked the underwater scenes, but it ends there.Black manta. Seriously? Why was he in this movie? If they had removed him, it wouldn't have made a difference.The costumes. And wigs. Amber Heard as the Ariel of DC in the cheapest red wig I have ever seen.The jokes were so dry and boring. There was no chemistry between Jason Mamoa and Amber Heard. You could anticipate everything that was gonna happen. There was so many bad things about this movie.

You can tell DC is doing things differently with aquaman, they are not afraid to use the fantastical elements of Aquaman's comics.
What that means is, instead of a dark, gritty, rooted in reality movie; we have a colorful, vibrant other world under the sea movie. It is unique from other movies in its style and story elements while still maintaining familiar superhero elements.
Having said that, I personally found the movie quite predictable. Perhaps it is the way the movie plays out very similar to many video games i have played. What I mean is that the movie, while quite good, feels like it is made based off a video game story campaign.
Many scenes of dialog end with sudden violence, the main character is repeatedly told that they have only one path they can make without the world ending, even a kind of tutorial scene and well established powers.It really felt like it was written by a video game story designer, but in a good way.

And I don't even want to talk about graphics that look like video game, it's beautiful but it's unreal, and I know it's not supposed to be quite realistic but at several moments I was very disturbed by graphics. The whole story is just bad and cheap and honestly if it wasn't DC movie and if it was done with less money everyone would see that it isn't that good. Is it the worst superhero movie, nope.

3610,Tevinr93,Best DCEU Movie to date.,7,14 December 2018,"Aquaman, a character I went in only knowing very little most of which coming from DC Justice League.Going in I wasn't as hyped as I usually am for a comic book action movie but I have to say what a beautiful film it was, the scenes in Atlantis were just breathtaking and the costumes were great. first act sets up everything I need to know about Aquaman and where this story is going. Some of the comedy beats in this film just didn't work for me personally and tho his suit looked awesome Black manta just wasn't as exciting as a future villain, his hate for Aquaman is understandable but seems like a very underwhelming villain for now, I'm sure he'll improve come the sequel. The final act was just as great bar a few scenes and they all lived happily ever after.Looking forward to what DC has to offer in the future, this was a great first step in the right direction.",Aquaman

It has a scenic IMAX 3D experience. Treat to your eyes, good VFX and the icing on cake is the plot.
It has a plot, a sub plot and a sub plot.

3620,aedi-darcy,"Forgettable, at best",3,10 January 2019,"Why are people pretending this is good. It's baffling bad. It was so boringly linear, I sort of thought that at this point superhero movies had plot as well as action, not in the case of aquaman. There was no plot twist or surprises or development, the trailers showed the mom so don't make that an argument. You knew from the very start his aim and he achieved it without much hassle. In fact an hour could be taken from the middle of the movie that doesn't add anything, the first time he fights his step brother.Every time there's a new superhero movie I bring my little sister to go see it, and this was the first time I've ever seen her underwhelmed in the cinema.The acting is absolutely atrocious. Jason momoa is a bad actor he just has a great physique.The effects were goofy and bad.The 'funny' lines were really out of place and badly delivered, as well as badly writtenIt was way too long. Very bored throughout.I can't believe this was funded. I'm also surprised that the budget produced this.Overall I found this just so confusing because it's reviews aren't that bad but it's a terrible movie",Aquaman
3621,aamirsuleman,Overatted and predictable plot with amazing scenes and fights,6,22 December 2018,The movie is overrated which is understandable because it has Jason Mamoa. The plot was predictable. Though the movie has some of the amazing under water and fights secnes.,Aquaman

3623,rafiqueahmed1,Worst superhero movie ever. Watch at your own risk.,1,13 February 2019,"I was super excited for this movie after reading all the hyped up reviews and extravagant praise for the visual effects but I was totally disappointed and left flabbergasted in the most brutal way possible. After seeing Jason Momoa's dialogue delivery and terrible comic timing for that matter even serious dialogues I am glad Jason Momoa aka Khal drogo did not have any dialogues in GOT.
I mean come on DC it really is time for you guys to up the ante and become serious contenders to MCU. So far MCU is way ahead of DC.
Just after 10 mins into the movie I was feeling so bored and asleep, it was a torture chamber for me. Poor acting poor dialogues poor expressions worst comic timing from each and every single character of the movie.
Visual affects were the only positive thing about the whole movie. I highly recommend not to watch this highly over rated movie.",Aquaman
3624,travisgideon,Just Okay,5,6 January 2019,"I saw Aquaman on Christmas day and it basically lived up to my expectations...almost. I was not impressed with the CGi at all so I'm not sure why everyone is talking about how great the special effects were. I expected the corny cliches which I didn't mind but it was a lot of scenes where the music playing didn't really match what was going on. I'm not sure if that bothers anyone else but I hate it. Some of the scenes also felt a little forced, specifically all the ones that included the Black Mantis. I would say check out this movie because their is nothing else to see in the theater right now. I know there is going to be an Aquaman 2 and I will probably watch it, just not in the theater.",Aquaman
3625,toolboxcomplete2020,Aquaman 2019 - Half Breed Abomination ... and King,9,28 February 2019,"Today I will be talking about the movie Aquaman (2019)and give you my impressions about it. How Arthur Curry (Aquaman) goes on a mission to find the Trident from the first Atlantean King, Atlan; how he falls in love with Mera (Amber Heard); how he faces both Black Manta and his half-brother, Orm Marius, the Ocean Master.Before watching it, I didn't have a good impression about the movie judging by the Justice Leagues' movie that I didn't like and also because they've chosen Jason Momoa to be Aquaman. I was like ""Drogo will be Aquaman? That will never work!"". Every time an actor is cast to interpret a character that he doesn't resemble, I get bad vibes. At least in my mind, he wasn't a good choice. The movie proved me wrong.I still can't get over the fact that they chose to change Aquaman's personality dramatically. I think I have to grow used to it. Aquaman in the comic books is a very formal, serious, knowledgeable character and that's the exact opposite of how the character is portrayed in the movie. In the big screen, the character is immature, dumb, show-off.The characters felt like real people with real motivations. I didn't feel forced to swallow anything in it regarding they being who they were. Both heroes and villains were really well put together. The two main antagonists have in common the hate they feel towards Arthur. Orm Marius, the Ocean Master, Aquaman's brother who sees him as an inferior half breed and David Kane (later Black Manta) who blames Arthur for his father's death.The female heroine in this film, Mera, has all the features female characters nowadays showcase in movies. They know everything, they are extremely strong and super powerful, they have an answer for every situation. We don't get to see flashbacks of her training or anything about her growing up. This narrative, dumb, impulsive male character plus know-it-all female character is getting really old. It's the biggest cliché in the 21st century.The last scene will leave you without breath. The action sequence is just too eye candy and hypnotizing. The movie was a whole lot of fun and beautiful experience. The ticket to watch it was a good investment. I believe the movie is a complete package with all the elements you might like in a movie such as romance that seems real, the characters really look like they love one another, both couples Mera and Aquaman and Arthur's parents. The fight scenes were flawless, visual effects are amazing, everything looks so exotic and attractive. The villains were also great. The whole plot regarding Aquaman's and Ocean Master's mother, Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), was really moving.I would like also to point out the relationship between Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and Arthur. He taught young Aquaman martial arts (including how to handle the Trident he was supposed to go after to claim his throne one day) and all the history of the Atlantean people.Hopefully, we can see Aquaman in a new Justice League movie, this time with a better script and I also have my fingers crossed so they cast somebody to be the Green Lantern so we finally have a real Justice League movie, because in my humble opinion, without Green Lantern the League is not the League. It feels more like 6 characters joined together but not the real JLA.The movie does a fantastic job both giving new life to the character's legacy and being respectful to the original source material. Do not miss the chance and go watch it if you haven't yet. I didn't feel the time passing when I was watching it.",Aquaman

Negatives - where to start. The cringe one liners. Felt like a 70's bond movie.
I know it's based in atlantas, but some people ride sharks and other ride weird sea horses lol. Just doesn't work.

The dialogue was painful, the story arc was numb, the plot was predictable, characters were...*yawn*. It had such potential to be good, but instead was a $400 million mess.The acting is really poor. Jason Mamoa struggles to show any emotion. There is no crescendo for him. He's just static through the whole thing. Amber Heard is a poor mans mashup of Ariel and Scarlett Johanson's Black Widow. Willem Dafoe is generally a decent actor, but his character is written so poorly...don't get me started on Manta (honestly decent job acting but why on earth is his character in the movie?!) Oh and funniest part of the movie is when teenage Arthur says ""Does she not love me?"" In the highest pitch voice. It's just painfully bad. Like worse than Anakin Skywalker in the Phantom Menace.

Some positives... the visuals we're stunning at times. Jason looks good while shirtless for the ladies.The bad...Acting and cringe worthy dialogue. Story is weak and predictable. (Spoiler Alert) They said his mom is dead so frequently throughout the first half of the movie it was obvious they were over compensating that she was alive.

+ Nice exploration of Atlantis' background
+ Good chemistry between Arthur and Mera
+ Variety of environments
+ Easy to consume as a family movie
+ Beautiful visual styleCons:
Too longThe ending of the heroes quest didn't yield much satisfactionFelt flat in several partsAquaman's story is suit to be in either a multi-part format or as a series of comic books, instead of a single one film. It felt like a fun ride that never get your emotion high enough and flat at some points, because they tried to cram the movie too many stuff, which result in a movie that is too long for its format and heroes quest that doesn't yield satisfaction at all.Almost everything in the film was told in a very obvious way without a room for any interpretation, as it's aimed at broader audiences.Here come the good partsThe movie isn't without its merit, as Mera and Arthur's interaction are fun to watch.

3666,tylerblackevans,All Right!,8,11 January 2019,"It's very difficult to satisfy the world of comics. Especially, Aquaman! James Wan truly earned his right to join billion dollar club.
Casting was great. I was really terrified after hearing that Jason Mamoa & Amber Heard is going to lead $200 million dollars project. They both stole the show. Jason is really played Arthur character nicely. Director & Writers definitely knows what they're doing. They didn't do like comic book Arthur Curry's character. They have created their own version of Aquaman who is going to lead more future DCEU movies. Mera is beautiful queen and badass heroine. My man! Black Manta has definite character development to hate Aquaman. Dolph was a big surprise. Williem Dalfoe was perfectly casted as Vulko. At first time, I thought King Orm character was under utilised. But, Patrick Wilson stole the entire show while I watch this movie for the second time. I can see clearly what James and Writers did to this character. Origin of Ocean Master. Best thing about in this whole movie is love story between Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman.
Oh about music! Some moments took my breath away just like Blade Runner & Avatar. Awesome soundtrack. For the record, DCEU movies has awesome soundtracks till now! Except Suicide Squad which I don't remember.James Wan admires everything equally... Story, cringy comic stuffs, showing earth's 70% of underwater atmosphere as real as fantasy, Atlantis and other kingdoms and importantly global warming issues and embracing the real sea creatures. Only thing bugged me in this movie is that scoreboard showed just before their gladiator fight. Some critics complaining about plot shifting, pitbull song, flashback character's vfx... For me, those things never bugged me...Definitely I've enjoyed this movie more in my second round. We're in the era of Jason Bourne action style, Christopher Nolan's reality style of fantasy, Blockbuster fever for past 6 years of MCU & Star Wars movie which Aquaman did the job in it's own way. People have forgot about 80's adventure movies & 90's action movies. James Wan brought that back as epic action packed fantasy adventure movie.
Switch off your book mind & open your comic book mind.
You will sink inside this movie!
Aquaman is definitely worth watching with the whole family.

This movie is second best IMAX visual I've seen in Big screen.P.S. my first one is M:I Fall Out",Aquaman
3667,rick-21727,Predictable plot,4,7 January 2019,"This movie at times was cringeworthy. The dialog between actor seems to be written with 5 year olds in mind. The CGI was good but at times overdone leaving one to think,yeah right. Going into this movie one has to turn off your brain and accept it for what it is to get through it.",Aquaman
3668,alexanderglover,Delivers on promises,9,18 December 2018,James Wan has done an incredible job of creating the expansive underwater world of Atlantis. It's highly imaginative and visually stunning.Jason Momoa proves that he was the perfect choice for a 'cooler' version of Aquaman. Nicole Kidman also has a great performance as Queen Atlanna and Amber Heard's Mera grows on you as the film progresses.There is only a tiny reference made to any DC film that has come before it and the film as a whole benefits from it. This film is a true standalone and is right up there with Wonder Woman as a top tier DC film.,Aquaman
3669,CarsonSaflar,Superhero Movie: the Superhero Movie,7,25 December 2018,"I normally don't like superhero movies, but Aquaman takes itself with a grain of salt, solidifying its place as a fun, bombastic film with some new takes on superhero action from director James Wan.",Aquaman

while most DC movies are gloomy and dark in tone with heavier plots than those Marvel counterparts,this one might make you think and question if it is really in a DC universe. Story is fast paced,engaging even to those younger audience. Action sequences are well done and leave you the sense of satisfaction after exiting the cinema. I'm not saying darker tone and heavier story line is a bad thing,but this one is just different. Dont wanna spoil anything but it is one of the movie everyone should go to this month.",Aquaman

3674,charityamankwah,The Best Superhero Movie Ever,10,23 December 2018,"I went to support, and watch Jason Momoa. I ended up enjoying a movie. For a big fan of Momoa, I barely noticed him, caught up in the glory and lights of this movie. The emotion caught me, and got me involved, and as a writer for once, it didn't feel like I knew where it was going. After having watched many superhero movies, with basically the same storyline. This one felt fresh, and attention keeping. I loved how they took time to build all the characters, and didn't just give them minuscule reason for fighting. Also that the main antagonists shared moments of grat emotion, being half brothers. I was heavily entertained, and believe Jason Momoa's take on Aquaman, will forever remain, the one to beat, and the one to reach. He did a fantastic job, and I've never seen such perfect acting. He managed the impossible, drew me away from his visage, into a story.",Aquaman
3675,taha-16430,One word review 'MINDBLOWING',10,8 December 2018,Aquaman is not a typical superhero movie of marvel which comes every year. This movie is something else.

The acting was awful. The storyline was basic and linear. Dont spend any money on this movie wait for it to come on a streaming service.",Aquaman
3679,becbarltrop,Engaging cast but too much CGI,6,22 December 2018,"Jason Momoa and Amber Heard are really likeable and engaging but I found the CGI to be distracting and overwhelming in places. It should enhance reality, not be so far removed that it becomes ridiculous. Speaking of ridiculous, Amber Heard's character, Mera, is absolutely awesome... so why did they dress her up in an unspeakably old-fashioned catsuit that's all cleavage and high heels? Plus Arial hair? Who the hell goes out to fight dressed like that? Even superheroes need some self respect. This to me seemed totally outdated, particularly post me-too. Grow up, Hollywood. Women need to see cool women in films too, you know, and they don't all need to be the same 1960s stereotype. 52% of the world population is female and here we have only 2 female characters (amazing actresses, both) and thousands of men. This is so tiresome.",Aquaman

3683,anvonbank,Recycled tropes and stilted dialogue ruin a character that ruined the inspired casting of Momoa,4,25 December 2018,"Ever since he was cast as Aquaman, I was excited to see Jason Momoa make this character his own. I enjoyed his appearance in the otherwise problematic Justice League and this should have been an enjoyable thrill ride. It certainly could have been.To be specific and somewhat spoiler-y, my primary issue with this film really didn't have anything to do with Momoa's performance, nor Aquaman as a hero. There were plenty of scenes which captured the titular character well. If course there was going to be lots of underwater battles and even talking to fish. All that was there. Trouble was, for me, there were very few scenes that weren't ripped off from better films.A few of the many examples: young Arthur is bullied while admiring beautiful creatures behind glass, and then he communicates with said creatures and they assisted in not only thwarting the bully but helping to reveal his own powers. If that doesn't ring a bell, just rewatch the early scene from the first Harry Potter film and you'll see essentially the same scene play out. How to Train Your Dragon offers similar material, both in the long lost mother in the lost world, but also in befriending the big baddie (which even looks like the king sized dragon) to fight his battle. The display of the wonders of Atlantis, er...Pandora...is so very reminicent of Cameron's idyllic world they should have paid royalties. And the usurper to the throne, battle, disgrace, and redemption so closely resembled the central storyline of Black Panther, I wished that film was playing instead. Nearly every sequence immediately called forth another, better film, and for me, Aquaman played more as a supercut homage than an original film. Of course, common themes and tropes abound in big budget films such as this, but generally they reframe them into something new altogether. There was nearly nothing original in this film.That is not to say it was completely devoid of entertainment. The third act was by far the strongest, despite following standard superhero format. The sea battle was exciting, though quite similar to the land battle of Avatar. The final mano a mano includes the requisite good guy fighting bad guy throwdown, just as you might expect.In all, I felt that what promised to be a new take on a weak DC character, falls not on its vision, but in a lazy script that neither expands this character's interest, creates excitement to ever see this character again. That is a pity, because even after seeing this film, I still love Jason Momoa's Aquaman. I just wish the makers of this film did as well.",Aquaman

3691,info-69446,Wow!,1,6 March 2019,"This is as bad as it gets.. not 100% sure what's wrong with DC movies, but they seem to miss the mark from a timing and pacing point of view. The cinematography is alway great, but there's something about the way they piece these together in post that is slightly off, even the way they record the dialogue that takes away from the weight of any performance - or maybe it is simply that they don't cast well?Wonder Woman was a huge improvement for DC and I had high hopes that this would learn from those lessons, but IMHO we're back to weak story, characters I don't ever get asked to care about, terrible pacing, disjointed and jumpy transition between acts, and a terrible script.Casting wise, if i was Jason Momoa's wife i'd be overjoyed that there was zero chemistry between the incredibly boring, but pretty to look at Jason and equally lacklustre and boring Amber - the best casting here is definitely Dolph and Willem!Much like Jason and Amber, this movie is very pretty to look at, but ultimately boring and a waste of time.So many bad lines, so many holes in the plot, so much content crammed in that they forgot to mention some of it, so many pointless bit of action, and at leat 20 mins too long.skip it!",Aquaman

The Atlantis guards are Power Rangers, the underwater fighter jets are from Star Wars, the battle with other underwater kingdoms looks like a battle from the Lord of the Rings, some personages are a version of the Street Sharks, even Godzila had a resurrection moment!. Do you remember the Disney's the Sword in the Stone? even the guy name is Arthur! Did you spotted the dinosaurs at Jurasic Park? I only missed a Smeagol-like scene with the trident... my prrrrecioussss.Ah, and a very funny scene is watching Aquaman trying not to fall (and looking very scared) from the roof of one house in Sicily (two stories high) , when he'd just jumped from a plane thousand meters high with no parachute in the desert.But Nicole Kidman was beautiful as always.",Aquaman

The reason why I was even interested in the movie was the updated styling of the Aquaman character. In my opinion, Justice League could have used Momoa's Aquaman more to improve the film. So this film had to be better than Justice League, right? Not so much... I found the film highly predictable. The humor used seems forced and is more rolling-of-the-eyes cheesy than funny.

The very straightforward story and its charming characters serve one purpose: make you dive deep into their world and fall in love with it. Remember Avatar? Well, Aquaman delivers ten times more joy, awe-inspiring views and badass characters, with almost no political agendas. This movie is aware of what it is and it doesn't pretend to be anything else, because it really doesn't need to, which makes it DCEU's most honest film so far. Back to CGI and VFX, it's the most ambitious film since Avatar and even Gravity, as it makes possible what was believed to be impossible (and even unthinkable): an underwater epic, of which we only really had gotten a glimpse with James Cameron's The Abyss.

The characters in this film are very well developed, the cinematography is exceptional, the story has high stakes and a surprisingly good antagonist. Any worries had about Aquaman from 2017's ""Justice League"" are completely thrown out the window.Jason Momoa is at the top of his game in this movie, showing off both his dramatic and comedic chops.

The story line had a nice flow but lacked suspense due to the predictable scenes and dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, aweful. Half of the conversations that were in the movie were there because they had to be rather than augmenting character relationships as they should have rather than practically undermining momoas character and even his acting in the scenes where he was speaking. Not to mention the fact that 90% of the movie was drawn out fight scenes that happened so fast you couldn't figure out who the good guys or the bad guys were mixed with unrealistic scenarios with fire underwater and watching 2 people with the ability to swim fast underwater use a boat to get across the ocean. I mean REALLY, use a flare underwater to navigate through the ocean. The love story could of been built up better, and the protagonist and main character the whole movie was about didnt have anything to overcome, the movie starts with aquaman having superpowers and being this big hero and ends in the same way. He doesnt find himself in anyway and practically walks into a room for 5 minutes picks up a fork and becomes the king of the ocean or whateverHonestly the only reason i give this movie a rating of 6/10 is the amazing CGI, incorporation of music and the general storyline, but really whoever was in charge of characters needs to check themselves.",Aquaman

3747,jayadeepjoshy,"If your don't watch it in theatres, well it's your Loss !",9,7 January 2019,"It's funny the first review I saw after coming to Aquaman IMDb page was of a guy who says"" he was so annoyed for people reviewing the movie they watched before he could watch"" I'll never know what he meant by that. He repeatedly days he loves DC in his review. But any sane person can read through his review he hates on DC. I'm just citing this to tell you people please don't listen to people like him. They just want to degrade every other comic book movie that's not part of MCU. They even did that that Venom (which is a Marvel character, but not in MCU) which wasn't tied to MCU, which by the way was hugely successful despite these miscreants badmouthing the movie. People are getting the fact that even so called critics are useless, they also have a bias, that they can't just take their word for it. If you want to know how good a movie is ask around the people you know who have watched it. My honest opinion on film is I went to Aquaman without a lot of hope, because James Wan's any of previous films weren't CBMs. I wasn't sure well he be able to pull it. I wasn't much excited too. I only went and watched it because it was a DC movie. (yep I love DC more, I'm not gonna lie) . But I was really surprised by what James wan had to offer with Aquaman. It had an amazing pacing to the story. No lag or what so ever. What we saw it trailers is nothing compared to actual movie. Visuals were amazing. It's something that's unique. It's made in a grand scale. If you're gonna watch it , it better be on the biggest screen you can find. If you don't it's your LOSS. You'll know when you watch it on DVD or Blu-ray that ""Damn I should've watched it in theatres"".
My review is applicable only to general audiences who enjoys movies for their quality but their Brand.
Certain fanboys will disagree with it, because they don't like good competition.",Aquaman

Starting from the story,action,cast/acting and visually it's just so freaking awesome my god! u just need to WATCH IT!
Another big plus point for Aquaman is that story didn't suck at all & it was really addicting and little to none plot holes.Everything folds pretty smoothly with Aquman origin,Childhood and recent event is just a real treat to watch. Especially the theatrical experience of this movie is just so AWESOME with amazing sound effect, crowd reaction and if u are a big Thor Ragnarok fan than u must watch Aquaman!",Aquaman

3753,tjjh-95842,Great scenes but weak plots,5,15 December 2018,"It indeed has plenty of stunning underwater and fighting scene,and each of them are mind-blowing,but I just wounder why a superhero movie can't be scripted and produced to have a little more emphasis on the plots by DCEU ever since the ""failure"" of BVS and the ""success"" of WW. I mean, at least DCEU tried to tell stories of superheros we've never heard of in their distinct way whether or not they are liked by the public, but now it seems like they just want to play safely, and cater to most of the audience ,no unexpected plot twist, no deeper messages to deliver under the appearance. Exclusive of the superhero-like characters and the mythological background, it may just look like a Fast and Furious sequel,that is, a classic popcorn movie. But why not, only to produce this kind of movie makes them plenty of fortune.",Aquaman
3754,zacharywcole,So Bad It's Hilarious,5,26 December 2018,"Aquaman (2018) was a highly anticipated film for fans of the DCEU. With the release of Wonder Woman (2017) getting praised by critics, Warner Brothers seemed to have stepped up their game in comparison to Marvel Studios. When the trailer first dropped excitement among DC Universe fans was split. Many people were very excited for the upcoming film, whereas others thought the trailer seemed very cheesy and their excitement for the film began to die out. Then, the movie hit theaters.The beginning of the film is interesting. Aquaman's mother washes up on some rocks in Maine during a thunderstorm, when Aquaman's father sees her. He takes her into his home and she is scared at first, until she passes out on his couch. When she wakes up, she eats his goldfish right in front of him. After a little bit of conversation, she reveals that she is the Queen of Atlantis. This is one of the many very weird scenes. It is discussed that many people believe in Atlantis and the existence of Atlantians, and we can assume that Aquaman's father is one of them. This is a very funny moment in the movie. Later, they conceive Aquaman. Years later, some Atlantian soldiers come to take back their Queen, after a slow-motion fight scene with many awkward camera angles, she goes with them. It is told to the audience later that she dies. The movie spends so much time on the fact that she is dead that it is such a shock when she is revealed to be alive. Though, her character remains flat and adds little emotion. She is also used as a plot device to get Aquaman and his brother to stop fighting later.The conflict between Aquaman and his brother is forced. They both decide they mutually hate each other for stupid reasons. They both say they want to kill the other, and both reluctantly accept that the the other will have to die.Black Manta's character in this film is useless and stupid. The characters are only ever running from him and they always escape. He is provided with Atlantian armor and then he suddenly knows everything about is and is an engineer as he does work on the armor and paints it black. He makes a comment about how he will need a bigger helmet and the next time we see him he has a comically large helmet.Every time there is any important dialogue between Aquaman and his love interest there is also an explosion. It is pretty lame and ridiculous. Nobody is ever affected by the explosions and there are way too many in the film.There is also an attack on Atlantis by the surface world and it is never explained who attacked Atlantis or why. Nobody on the surface world knows about this attack. It is only ever mentioned a couple more times in the film.There are very kid-like dialogues in this film. However the movie is very visually appealing. The colors are astounding as well as the CGI. If you are looking for an action packed, very serious movie then this is not for you. If you are looking for a hilariously bad superhero movie then this is for you.",Aquaman
3755,rainmantnt,Michael Bay's Transformers explosions meets underwater Power Rangers,4,22 December 2018,"Let's be fair- was I bored? No. Were the visuals interesting? Heck yes. But unfortunately the dynamic action scenes in this were offset by the wooden dialogue, unconvincing CGI, cringe-worthy melodramatic moments, and virtually no character development- overall, this movie force fed me a choppy storyline that mirrored much of the style of Michael Bay's tranformer's series, that is, overstuffed with bombastic explosions but malnourished in actual substance. I honestly believe that this should have been a show instead of a movie.",Aquaman

3757,stefan-35929,Too much,6,14 April 2019,"There are certainly enough reasons to love (or hate) this film. The scenes are shot beautifully and the underwater world looks really stunning. The cgi is sometimes great, but at other times unrealistic for relatively simple scenes (Nicole Kidman diving off into the water). The main problem with this movie is the script. It's too bloated with concepts:Power struggleLost sonOriginsEnvironmentalLove storyArtifact huntingFamilyRevengeTwo tribesHidden worldAntiheroNatural disasterI felt like watching Troy, Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones, Wolverine, The gladiator and Godzilla all at once. Not to mention the antagonist looks and talks like a villain from the power rangers.Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but it was just too much. The epic battle in the end was great but felt forced in and didn't add anything to the story. With everything that's happening the characters feel shallow. Shame because there's a lot of potential here.",Aquaman
3758,geraa-03530,Does not deserve any more than this score,6,18 December 2018,"It looked to me like they've put up a really consistent unrealistic look, everything was told like a tale of some other world. The plot has a point, although it's still weak, like most superhero movies, sorry. Fun action, and amazing shots.The worst:
The ""side-villain"" guy with cyclops stuff: unlimited unjustified anger, engineer in whatever you need, and a really exaggerated angry face. What's more, he's too strong for a human (on some scenes, maybe it's the suit, we'll never know. Not when his father's life depends on it, for certain), not very believable.
The killings: to be a hero who wants to end a war he may have been too commited on making fishes and sharks kill atlans to do it. Seems like a justification for an epic battle.The best:
The charisma on Aquaman's father, very good character;
Aquaman's groupies, I laughed more than i should have to this;
How he got the trident, slytherin-like chat (althought its powers are not crystal clear to me, or how it allowed them to escape that place.);
The recognition of human weapon's destructive potential. You can measure the difference between an atlantean taking the hit of a granade launcher and Superman taking it;
Consciousness about contamination.I just hope that DC cyclops won't show up ever again, as the final scene suggests.",Aquaman

3765,theamazingdnivog,Insane Visuals. Insane Action Pieces. Maximum Entertainment.,10,8 December 2018,"Visuals: The visuals is mind-blowing. Wan has created a world rich in colour, vibrance, and depth. The details are astounding. Best visually insane movie since Avatar.Story: Predictable, a bit yes. But which superhero movie is not? Is it predictable from the beginning? - NO.Humor: Not cheesy as some reviews say. The humor doesn't feel forced, like with some Marvel movies. The movie will give you 2 hours of joy ride, and you'll never regret the money or time spent on it.Emotional Depth: The movie already has an emotional core(The connection of Arthur and his parents). Although it's not that much emotionally resonant, it does a good job of balancing the tone.Villain: The Villain has a real good reason. He's also right, in some ways, although not in his solution plans. All his rage can be felt with his words. I'd compare his character to MCU's Killmonger, who also lives and fights for a cause. And while in the Black Panther movie, for some people, some things feels like a racial agenda and see's the white people as the bad guys, in Aquaman, all the surface dwellers are seen as the bad guys in the view of the villain. There's no feel of any agenda or anything.
Verdict: 10/10. Everything is awesome and purely mind blowing, while still delivering a message which affects the real world.",Aquaman

There wasn't a good villian, and the minor villian was pointless. Most bothersome part for me: besides a 20 second kiss, there wasn't a genuinely romantic relationship between the two characters.

But Aquaman...wow! What a great film! The visuals are amazing, the action scenes are mindblowing and Jason Momoa is superb as Aquaman. Sure, the plot is a little thin/predictable, but that doesn't take away the fact that this movie is a bold and very enjoyable step forward for the DCEU.James Wan did an amazing job in visualizing Atlantis and finally embracing the sillier side of the DC superheroes rather that trying to cover it up with a ton of rain and broodiness.9/10",Aquaman

It has a Racy screen play and great character development ( since we saw only a little of the characters in JL).Jason and Heard are perfect in their roles and Kidman has done justice to her role... not forgetting u Dafoe ! U ARE GR8 AS WELL
The music is blended well with the sequences.
Some scenes get cheesy but overall it is a great load of fun!
I would request You to watch it in an IMAX 3D to get the most out of it.",Aquaman
3814,vidhyasagarm,AQUAMAN is greatly confused whether to make us laugh or to makes us feel!!!,4,16 December 2018,"""Call me the ocean master!"" King Orm (Patrick Wilson), the villain in James Wan's Aquaman, portentously shouts at the outset of the film's climactic scene. Warner Bros.'s latest attempt to shift its DC brand away from the dour machoism that marked (and marred) such films as Man of Steel embraces high fantasy, but for Wan and screenwriters David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall, this turns out to mostly mean having characters proclaim their silly comic book names as assertively as possible. ""I'm Black Manta!"" growls Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), the film's other supervillain. Instead of a deep, detailed world, what Wan's undersea fantasy constructs is a series of scenes, often divertingly colorful and busy to a fault, that seem to dare the viewer to mock the world of comics' most risible superhero.This defensive posture was evident in the calculated decision to cast the at once beautiful and threatening Jason Momoa as the man who talks to fish. Aquaman, whose unassuming alter ego is Arthur Curry, is introduced in the film with a fight on board a Russian submarine, a sequence in which Momoa, in close-up, practically snarls directly into the camera as he hurls pirates into bulkheads. That'll teach the audience to make fun of Aquaman.
But there's plenty more in Aquaman that will provoke unintentional laughter. It's less that the world presented here-with its fish-human hybrids, legendary kings, and coveted tridents-is inherently funny, and more that the film rushes through its story at such a breakneck pace that viewers never have a chance to settle into it, to see it as a lived-in universe. After a while, it all begins to feel arbitrary. We have little time to process the functioning of water-based laser rifles before we're introduced to fish people in brightly colored togas, or to a stone-faced Willem Defoe wearing a onesie and a top-knot.The film's origin story resembles that of mythological superheroes like Thor and Wonder Woman, in which a superpowered being awkwardly adjusts to an unfamiliar environment. (One is tempted to call Aquaman a fish-out-of-water story.) Arthur is the child of Queen Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), part of the ruling family of the fabled underwater city Atlantis, and a human man (Temuera Morrison). After his mother is forced to return to Atlantis, Arthur grows up with his father in Maine, isolated from the undersea kingdom that is his birthright, until Mera (Amber Heard) arrives on shore to convince him to return and prevent the war Orm and her father, Nereus (Dolph Lundgren), are planning against the humans on the surface. Although, and in standard hero's-journey fashion, Arthur initially refuses Mera's call for help, he's soon compelled to take up her cause after a tidal wave nearly kills his father.
A bounty of CG-heavy action scenes follow, from hand-to-hand combat in an underwater colosseum, to a chase through a Sicilian village, to a full-fledged confrontation of armies on the ocean floor. At its best, the film's underwater action, with its traveling shots that zoom through crowds of fantastical marine species and past moss-encrusted classical ruins, are vibrant, aesthetically engrossing spectacle. A few shots in particular stand out for their compositional flair, such as Mera and Arthur's climactic kiss against the chaotic backdrop of a raging undersea battle, and one which frames the couple swimming toward the bottom of the frame as a horde of Lovecraftian fish-monsters coalesce behind them and give pursuit.At its weakest moments, however, the film offers a parade of ocean-floor vistas that evoke the substanceless world-building of George Lucas's second Star Wars trilogy, a supersaturated digital landscape of smooth surfaces and expensive-looking designs. Aquaman exacerbates-almost by design-some of the worst tendencies of today's superhero movies. The weightlessness of fights rendered with CG is compounded by that of fights between people suspended in water, and the sexlessness of superhero movies is only emphasized by the perfunctory romance between two leads who seem to have been cast largely because they look good dripping wet.
The best point of comparison for Aquaman is Black Panther, another superhero movie about a king of a forgotten realm reclaiming his throne. But whereas Ryan Coogler's surprisingly affecting superhero film restored weight to both the choreography and the drama of the genre, Aquaman remains adrift, so much fantasy flotsam and jetsam floating before our eyes.",Aquaman

The show was way to long with predictable dialog and choreographed fight scenes. I felt like I had waited 2 hours for a battle the fight scene that everyone knew was coming 15 min. into the film.

The oneliners and snappy comebacks are poor and besides the point.
Was the film any good? Sure, watched through whole thing, the special effects and cgi was good, a bit over the top sometimes maybe, but hey, it's comics.If you don't mind spending a few hours of your live you'll never get back, go and watch it.

There is nothing left for your imagination to figure out.The plot is thin. There are no changes in pace. No deeper meaning. The deepest phrase in the whole movie is ""Atlantis needs more than a king..."" And that's already in the trailer.In fact, this movie is fully contained and defined by it's trailer. The best scenes are already there and the rest is filler material. You are better off just filling the gaps of the trailer with your imagination.I'm giving it 2 stars for the cgi character design, which is good. But I think this movie is just a complete waste of cgi resources trying to save a script that looks written by a 12 year old.So you know where I'm coming from: So far my favorite movies in this DC universe are Man Steel and Wonder Woman.

Acting is poor as well, mainly influenced by the lamest lines I guess.
The story is hammered by continuing meaningless action scenes sustained by B movie music score.
Willem Defoe is the only exception in the general acting disaster, he manages to build a credible if minor character. The teen versions of aquaman are also much more articulated and credible than the adult grunting hipster.
Kids cartoon level CGI completes the package of this parody of a superhero movie.

Would have given it a 4/10, but considering how many 10/10s have been handed out I felt compelled to compensate.

CGI was pretty good, the underwater effects and sounds were clever. The fight sequences were cool in wide anglesNegatives
Wooden Actors galore, a few decent perfermances but they did what they could was an appalling script. Story was predictable and the trailer gives it away. After 5 minutes I questioned everything. Extremely childish and literal toilet humour that could have been pulled from a film aimed at 4 year olds.

Let me start off where the movie itself started off, the conception of Aquaman. Tom Curry (Aquaman's father) looked like a cartoon. They were trying to make him look younger, and it looked like a similar past mistake like the horrendous ""mustache"". However, looking at all the other CGI (with minor mistakes that make it look completely awful), it looked very, very good. Just being underwater was incredible, because we really do know more about Mars than our own oceans. Therefore, it was welcoming to see how the underwater features would work, and they definitely worked well.
Now let's talk about the script. This was one of the most laziest scripts and quite predictable. A 6 year old would quite enjoy this movie cause he wouldn't have to think at all. However, a knowledgeable person would get considerably bored.",Aquaman
3871,zekopunisher,MASTERPIECE,8,16 December 2018,"SPOILER REVIEW!!This movie is entertaining begining to end!! It flowed so well the cinematography and scenes were so well done and so are the characters.Aquaman - love Jason's performance and how james wan showed Aquaman is more than just a king and has a lovely relationship with his Father, Mera and Atlanna especially when Author gets to see her when he goes to find the Trident.
Mera - Amber heard is literally born to play mera!! She is such a strong, bad ass and empowered superhero. I love how she constantly has to help Author become a King and love the beautiful kiss at the end. I enjoyed that Mera was no damsel in distress. She took care of herself. I loved that Mera and Author worked as a team not just one saves another. Overall Amber killed it and Mera is Badass!
Ocean Master - loved how Patrick Wilson protrayed orm. Orm was a great villain but even though hes the main villain black manta definitely got some rounds handed to Aquaman. But Orm all in all was great and actually has great reasoning to attack the surface because of us killing the oceans with pollution. He also had great fights with aquaman and i love the dialogue he has. Such a well read script.
Black Manta - Fantasitc! Love how comic accurate he is and i loved how they went for the New 52 storyline for him. This whole movie is pretty muched based off of New 52 which is my personal favorite version of comics. Fights scenes were amazing with him and just everything was spot on.
Atlanna - Nicole kidman was beautiful and amazing as always. So happy James kept her alive. Also every character who wasn't necessarily the main role had a good amount of scenes and overall didnt feel like they were rushed or poorly written in the movie.
Everones role had a purpose and was so well written. And this movie by far is the best cgi/vfx of this year. Most parts I total forgot that the underwater scenes were cgi because of how amazing everything was. It wasnt a cgi mess like some other movies this year that im not gonna mention.But please!!! Go watch AQUAMAN. YOU WILL BE WASHED AWAY FROM AWESOMENESS! Definitely believe the hype. This movie is worth seeing in the biggest screen possible.",Aquaman

3883,antwidyck,AQUAMAN- NEVER A DULL MOMENT,8,23 December 2018,"One word for this movie.Triumphant.James Wan reminds us how ok it is to imagine as wide as we can. And he did that by by showing us what those imaginations can do. The effects,style,CGI and acting were all great but more importantly each scene had you wondering what's going to happen next and what happened next was awesome. You relish every scene in this movie.If DC and WB carry the universe in this light they could come close to what the MCU has done so far",Aquaman
3884,kamaleshdeka,Don't believe the naysayers.,10,26 December 2018,"Remember to watch it in IMAX. The action, the cinematography, music scoring, story telling, everything's so perfectly crafted that I can't describe them in words.",Aquaman

3886,benjaminantonywyatt,DCEU at its best,8,19 December 2018,Aquaman is visually stunning with a great story. A few battle scenes where it is very hard to see what is going on but still a great story with great effects. Aquaman is probably the best DCEU movie yet,Aquaman
3887,adiojha,Messy,1,12 December 2018,"The messiest plot, overhyped, and death of logic. I actually expected more, come sidering the hype it had generated .... But there was literally no chemistry, between the actor and love interest. Pretty much, hot grabage",Aquaman
3888,ajbroch,I was expecting better after reading these reviews.,5,21 December 2018,Well - where do I start - CGI/predictable plot/CGI/what was the point of black mamba.Nice looking cgi - really good in fact - but wasn't sure if I was watching an animated film or not.Black mamba - looked more like a character out of power rangers. What was the point of him? - take him out of the plot - and it makes no difference to the film. Added nothing but a nostalgic nod at the comics.Aquamans love interest - looked like ariel the little mermaid.The plot - aren't those atlanteans stupid when they are meant to have higher intelligence etc - and where were they hiding in the previous films???? They could have helped against Zod terraforming or agains steppenwolfe - bizarre.Anyway - nice looking but boring,Aquaman
3889,deletelin,The story was boring,5,9 December 2018,"Character portrayal is unsuccessful except for the villains.First time I fell asleep in the Cinema.I don't understand why the rating so high.I realized why the AQUAMAN opening early in China.Maybe it's because Chinese audiences are only looking for the spectacular special effects.If the film had been shown in same time both of China and the United States, its rating would not have been as good as it is now.If AQUAMAN 2 is opening early in China,I would not see it early.",Aquaman

""97% people liked this movie on Google"" means the Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic ""criticus"" should retire because they don't understand what a good movie is. Shame on the fake criticus!-----
Watched it on IMAX 3D, and I couldn't ask for more. The movie is fresh and unique, not like most of the superhero movie that has a same formula and tone. Every scene of this movie took my attention.
The characters are well-casted and each have a background story. The plot is solid. The visual is STUNNING. The music is really great (Skylar Grey is so talented yet underrated!)It's been a week and I still can remember the scene and details because it was remarkable.",Aquaman

3894,alaathest,A spectacularly disappointing spectacle,4,25 December 2018,"Watched Aquaman on screenxA spectacularly disappointing spectacle movie Here is what I think:1- The dog was the best actor. Although it only appeared less than a minute in the opening 5 minutes of the 2 and half hours lengthy movie2- The dog has expressed in its 1 minute role more genuine emotions than the whole cast including the hero, the pretty face main actress and the mother reunioned with her son after 20+ years3- The visual effects (CGI) were indeed of a very high quality, it felt natural and smooth despite the plot largely runs underwater4- the script feels like it was done as a homework assignment by the writer's daughter who doesn't like writing5- The pace and compilation feels like it was done as a punishment assignment for the son of the director6- Despite the story has a great potential there was no substance in the movie. Just as an example, the hero did absolutely nothing good for the underwater to be their hero.7- Despite the mythological nature of the story should typically simplify the creative progress of situations and the great CGI quality, almost everything was illogical and incoherent. As an example the hero was near bullet proof for all kind of weapons including heavy ones that explode mountains, but surprisingly afraid of being biten and eaten by silly creatures with stupid teeth.8- Didn't feel much added value of screenx. Probably iMax would be a better option9- I have already given enough points. If you still need more then you go find out yourself",Aquaman

This movie has a great idea but too much cgi and really bad and I mean bad stiff acting just never lets it take off. They need to lay off the cgi, develop a great story and let the actors do the rest. Instead they get mediocre actors do a so so story then expect the cgi to save the day. I like the effort I like that they want to move the story along but it's getting painful. Go see it just make sure you get the morning show. It's not worth 11 dollars.",Aquaman

Second, all the music in this movie sucks.i mean the point it starts or ends is all wired.and the fighting music didn't give a feeling of that it should be .Third and the last ,the whole story was just like the soap that my grandma watched in 80's.",Aquaman

3901,riconess,"Good, but not great.",8,23 December 2018,"Don't get me wrong-super fun movie and enjoyable from beginning to end for the most part. Mamoa owns the role and water world effects were top notch.That being said, the script was a little blah and the effects were a little long in the tooth. The film seemed to drag a bit as well with that while desert sequence.My biggest peeve is that a lot of the fight sequences felt like I was watching mighty morphin power rangers. Both their weapons and costumes it was straight up MMPW and I don't mean the movie (which actually wasn't horrible)...I mean the tv series. Black Manta? C'mon dude...that scene was total throwaway. I really thought you were going to bring down a demigod with your supped up scuba gear. Good try bro.Anyway, fun movie but it stilll lags behind Wonder Woman and pretty much every DC movie except maybe Venom...but that was its own disaster.",Aquaman

3906,gabrielpaden,F$&#*%¥ Amazing,10,31 December 2018,I expected the movie to be fun but I did not expect an LOTR sized spectacle. This movie blew me away on so many different levels. It was impossible to scale this adventure from the outset. I found it to be over the top in all the best ways. This was something I would have expected out of an Avengers sized movie. Really it was to the scale you wished Justice league would have been. Phenomenal. Loved every second. People rating this 6 stars and less need to have their head examined.,Aquaman

3912,bmacampusindustry,Fish Out of Water,3,2 January 2019,"Think about this... The Dark Knight was just a few minutes longer than this movie. Though the effects and fighting choreography were much better...what the movie lacks is an interesting plot. I fell asleep halfway through it and kept checking my watch to see how much longer the movie was. The Dark Knight, though several years older, still has a better story and is still worth investing my time to watch. You feel connected to the characters and even though you know how it's going to end, you still want to see the Dark Knight all the way to its ending. Aquaman feels like a fish of water, you know what's going to happen, everything is boring and repetitive from other superhero movies. We can't compare Aquaman to Marvel, because the way they were written in the comics are very much different. But comparing this to DC movies like the Dark Knight, it clearly falls short of the water a fish out of water needs. Boring, too long, and obviously a terrible super hero movie.",Aquaman

3921,anikethb-54474,DC fights back!!!,10,13 December 2018,"Just what they would've wanted, If you liked Wonder Woman, expect this to be better. The movie is full of Visual spectacles, you need to see this one in decent quality, every scene seems like a fight to present it as better, no matter the cost. The film has a large runtime than a usual Starter Superhero flick, and that's because of the time they take to set out Atlantis, believe me you'll enjoy it. It's beautiful and fascinating at times, and the characters are well portrayed, I've been a DC fan longer, but I enjoy Marvel just as well, so this is unbiased. A critic will try to find issues in every movie, but you'll be entertained no doubt. And just as the movie reaches about an hour and a half to 2 hours spot, where other movies would be finishing off, This one kicks it up a notch. There's a Whole Lord of the Ring-eque feel to the remaining quarter, saving the best for last I suppose. I went to watch it with high hopes, being hyped at every trailer and TV spot, and the good news is, I'm not one bit disappointed, but rather wanting for more.
Definitely worth a watch.",Aquaman

James Wan, thank you. Some of the camera work is like sitting on a roller coaster ride. Just 'Bad ass'.

But after watching Aquaman i was totally spellbound with Jason's acting and VFX. Jason Mamoa, Amber Heard and James Wan's Creativity and the relationship between AQUAMAN and MERA and definitely VFX is what works with this movie. The Story is not new to me as i have been watching the DCAU which is better than the DCEU. Story is nothing new, and don't believe the ratings who gave 1-6 and 9-10.

3935,eph-21471,Waste of Time,1,2 April 2019,I am honestly incredibly disappointed in this movie and the previous ones that DC has come out with. All throughout the film I watched as my childhood was taken and turned into what appeared to be a high school film project. I wish I had not chosen to watch this movie. Complete waste of my time and a waste of money for the people who produced it or pay to see it.,Aquaman

A, is a film filled with lots of CGI which in ways can make it good but in ways can bring it down a little and even though it is an extremely long film I feel like there could split the film up into so that they give more time for characters and setting because I just felt like it was a bit rushed and there was little packed in even though it was two 2 1/2 hours roughly so in my opinion it is okay film Which will probably do well for people as it's a Marvel or DC or et cetera type of film where it fits down the storyline. I I think there should be another Aqua man which helps us understand a little bit more and involve more of the characters from justice league yes so that is what I think of Aqua man",Aquaman

3943,guyleckenby,"Exactly as expected, is that a good thing?",6,11 February 2019,"DC are finally getting back on their feet again and are starting to produce some decent titles, and the latest installment is no exception. Aquaman is the embodiment of a superhero movie, buffed up protagonist, lots of special effects, plenty of fisticuffs, and most importantly very predictable. Jason Momoa's incredible body (more shirtless scenes were needed) mostly distracted from some very cliched scenes where dialogue was so predictable I felt like I'd already seen the movie. In fact, all the original content was used in the trailer, and the rest of the film felt like obligatory filler. That being said, the filler was pretty good, and there's a reason why super hero films are so popular. However, Aquaman couldn't deliver on any of the novel elements that made Wonder Woman so good, so I was left a little wanting. But also Momoa's abs, so yeah.",Aquaman

3945,sizsohma,I think it's okay.,5,5 January 2019,"I mean, it's fun. I'm glad they made it fun, but Christ the genre changes with every new scene. I think people like this movie because it does everything - every cliche, every movie genre, every visual and audio choice possible. I'm pretty sure people are just so overwhelmed and they remember snippets of the things they like and are immediately concussed by everything else (cause there's so god damn much), so they just walk out of the cinema in a daze cause it isn't humanly possible to accept this movie in one sitting. The biggest thing was the cringey dialogue, really put me off the character development cause I couldn't accept a real human being would talk like they did in this movie. It's jarring to say the least. But Jason as Aquaman was a really great choice and I'm glad he was in it. I'm numb to everyone else. It's worth seeing if you like fun and if you can stand the romantic comedy movie genre. If not, this movie will just be cringey. I liked it, but won't be seeing it again.",Aquaman

However, the storyline was a bit confusing. For some of the dialogue they were talking about characters we haven't even met yet as if we are supposed to know who they are. I'm still kind of confused as to why not all Atlantians can breath above water, but then at the end they were all above water breathing just fine. Maybe I missed key parts, but I was very confused. Still one of the better DC movies for sure!",Aquaman
3951,aneley-52954,Favorite Super Hero Movie,10,18 December 2018,"I've been waiting for this film ever since it was announced, because I originally like Aquaman and because I was curious about what was expected to be an interesting version of him. And the film didn't let me down.
For context: my favorite modern super hero movies so far were Wonder Woman, Thor -Ragnarok and Black Panther, if that illustrates my tastes.Visually it's a treat, in every way, the cinematography, the underwater world, the action, the striking beauty of Jason and Amber, this movie is absolute eye candy.
I liked the acting, Manta was on point even if he was a bit underutilized, but I can understand because he'd be well set up for a sequel, and it doesn't get too crammed since you have Orm as the main antagonist, rather than trying to showcase both Manta and Orm and falling short or getting bogged down, Manta becomes an anticipated part of the sequel we're surely getting. Orm also was well played, although I have to disclose bias, I've had a crush on Patrick Wilson for years. That said, I think he did a good job, he had a couple lines that were kinda iffy but he pulls them off, and his scene after the final fight with Arthur is very moving.
Mera does not disappoint, she's an awesome character and she's well serviced by this film, and as a fan of the Arthur/Mera ship, I'm happy she's not sidelined in the plot and action, but also the romantic aspect is not shoved in your face.
Arthur is trapped between wanting to help people and refusing fo be king, he just wants to save he world, that's all. He's understandably reluctant to go for the crown. But his journey, being pressured by dangerous circumstances, and accepting his responsibility, was beautiful to witness.Plot wise, I was expecting the impending threat of an attack on the surface. the dead father revenge, the brothers showdown, because as much as I avoid trailers, it was kinda hard to miss completely. But I was SHOCKED when the Trench dwellers appeared, I was on the edge of my seat, because I'm a scaredy cat and the trench gives me the creeps.Is this the exact Arthur from the comics? No. But it's a damn good one, and there's room in my heart for all.",Aquaman
3952,archiedonnellyad,Best dceu is still pretty standard,4,23 December 2018,"The film was better than any other dceu movie arguably however tonaly it was inconsistent the music played a hand in that, the script pretty standard.
The fights had very little cuts due to the amount of cgi while in theory it should be better than over using cuts (see every bad action film). Personally it takes me out of the movie because at points the animation was worse than at others particularly the first fight scene. The costumes felt like a power ranger costume designer came up with them and that further added to tonal inconsistencies.
Another issue for me was the fact aquaman seemed invincible how can i care for a character who's pain tolerance I don't know.Finally while the film is dumb fun it is not worth anything at most above 6.5 this is my objective view (personally I didn't like it) and people giving this 9's are completely out there review it as a film a piece of art NOT a dceu film at the time of writing it has a 7.7 .",Aquaman

This movie falls into the latter, with stunning CGI, Great music and score, and action sequences design for the big screen (think IMAX big). and for all reviewers who complain about trivial things, Motion Pictures are the collaborated efforts of Producers, Directors, and Everyone involved. Sadly sometimes the vision isnt the same between these individuals and causes massive box office failure (Fantastic Four, Justice league) So when it works it works, like Aquaman you have an entertainment piece.",Aquaman

3985,tslipais,Nice to look at,7,1 January 2019,"I've always had a soft spot for Aquaman and this movie was pretty much what I expected it to be, stunning visuals with a mediocre script.
A lot of the dialogue between Arthur and Mera was so disconnected which made it hard to believe there was any sort of genuine connection between them. As cheesy as the rest of it was, it strangely worked and felt consistent.
The soundtrack was decent except for the random Pittbull track.. yes that's right... Pitbull, which set up the following scene to be more jovial than it should have been.
Black Manta was a great concept but Yahya's performance left me wanting more dialogue and less soap opera dramatization.
Overall the film was fun, full of stunning battle scenes and seeing Jason Momoa in the old school Aquaman getup was well worth every second.",Aquaman

3991,dylanburgin,Lover of all things nerdy...OF COURSE IT'S GREAT!,9,27 December 2018,"This review might be a little biased since I love all things nerdy, however I can say for sure that this movie was surprisingly great. I prefer DC to Marvel in terms of characters and comics, but it's obvious that Marvel is the king of superhero movies (I actually hated Justice League even though it's my favorite team of heroes comic-wise). I enjoyed Wonder Woman a lot despite it's pretty awful 3rd act and I think it is the best DCEU movie yet...until aquaman.
Aquaman is a goofy movie theres no denying. Don't go in expecting a movie like the great Infinity War that is mostly serious and dire. No, Aquaman knows that it is pretty silly and that's what makes it excel. The over-the-top visuals, fights, and overall scenes make the movie seem straight out of a comic book at times and I loved it, though I could see how hardcore MCU fans won't.
The fight scenes with the amazing directing by James Wan are the best I've seen in a superhero movie so far. They are well choreographed and have a good use of slowmo shots that make it seen very theatrical and utterly badass.
The plot is pretty straightforward but had some spots where it's not super clear what's supposed to be happening. Also, it was a little too cliche. ""The chosen one going to find an ancient artifact in order to take his place as king to unite the people"". Pretty sure we've seen or read it a thousand times, but that's why...it works.
The only flaw in my opinion is the dialogue. The acting was pretty top notch. I've never been too much of a Jason Mamoa fan bc I always thought he acted through gruff an brute strength instead of emotion but this movie proved me wrong. He did really great with this role, and it helps that it seems the role was fit around him. The beautiful Amber Heard did really great as well and I really loved her character!! I thought Orm was going to be cringy and awful going in, but I was actually convinced of his acting and motivations in the movie. Tamuera Morrison will always be Jango Fett in my book so no real complaints there. So, even though most actors did a great job delivering their lines, the dialogue could be pretty weak and VERY cheesey at times. Some were bad enough to break the immersion and make me look at my girlfriend and laugh.
Even with all of these flaws, I had more fun watching Aquaman than I have in a Suprhero movie and a long long time. CA: Civil War and Infinity War are definantly my favorite superhero movies, but they're not necessarily fun to watch...more engaging and emotional than anything (kind of like Solo being compared to Revenge of the Sith). I was never bored watching Aquaman bc there was always some action taking place.
End Notes: Black Manta was awesome and I can't wait to see him again in the next movie! And when Aquaman came out with his new suit, that scene not only gave me huge goosebumps but ranked up to the top 10 moments in cinematic history for me.",Aquaman

3998,mcnaughtonamb,Visually stunning but suffers from poor writing and execution.,4,29 December 2018,"I went to see this film with medium to high expectations after reading some stellar reviews on IMDB. I would advise checking the date more closely because DCEU are clearly using the reviews before release as a guerilla marketing campaign.Don't get me wrong. There are some saving graces. Some of the scene design in this film is wonderful. Atlantis looks stunning and some of the fight scenes are entertaining to watch. However there is inconsistency in how well underwater scenes are rendered and it does sometimes lend itself to video-game cut scene territory. Also some of the costume design looks straight out of old-school power rangers which I'm not sure is a good thing for multi-million pound production.Where the film suffers most however is in the the god-awful dialogue. If you're a fan of overblown cheesy declarations, this film is for you. If you wanted something more punchy and impactful, this film is not. I heard a couple of audible groans from the audience at a couple of points after the characters make wooden use of already cheesy lines and it really is almost laughable.Jason Mamoa does his best with the material given and he really looks the part! Nonetheless though he struggles to deliver on some of the more 'cheesy' moments where he is required to emote something more than 'cool surfer man'. I'm unsure if this is due to the bad lines given, poor direction or due to limited ability. The baddies are a bit forgettable and could have used better motivations over all. Mantis was given one but was underused and a bit ridiculous really.In summary I wouldn't pay to watch this film and I wish that I hadn't. Read the real user reviews folks, check dates and stick to the MCU I guess because apart from Wonder Woman this DCEU is simply not up to par.",Aquaman

The movie is moved from being a child friendly superhero to a more mature and serious story, where it matters who you are, and
The actor play is just phenomenal. All of the movie characters are really well developed. They have a really solid story behind them and the viewer gets attach to their story and who they are, and this is made in a really clever ways.
In the whole movie everyone grows and develops.
Another great aspect DC implemented was that heroes has also some weaknesses, and are drawn closer and closer to the average person, and that not superpowers are important, but the thing who we are. The feelings we express.
The cinematography is just stunning, and the special effects was the best i have seen in a 3D movie so far. Just amazing to watch. A lot of effort was put into the underwater world. They successfully recreated the beauty of the deep.
I have some minor complains about Mera. In some shots she was presented like an innocent explorer of the land, and in other shots she was presented like a provocative and super experienced badass girl. I dont really know what made this very rapidly change in character but who knows.
But the movie is absolutely amazing and it is a must to watch preferably in 3D.

U and the entire theatre are gonna keep cheering each time Momoa's AQUAMAN does his ""ass whooping"" .

4042,Tyrone_Prince,Refreshing,9,23 December 2018,"I was kind of skeptical coming into this movie at first mainly because of Justice League. JL was a huge flop IMO as it was simply rushed and there was simply no character growth at all! Besides Wonder Woman, Batman & Supes, I had absolutely no inkling or any form of connections to the other heroes.So lo and behold, fast forward a year later and the trailer for Aquamam came out. I have to admit, the trailer was very intriguing but even then I was kind of doubtful if Aquaman could even entertain me with a decent plot or even some half-solid action sequences. MY EXPECTATIONS WERE TOTALLY SHATTERED.The cast was great! Jason Momoa killed it as Aquaman. He brought Aquman to life perfectly with his outgoing and rambunctious personality and physically he nailed it as well. Amber Heard as Mera was perfect too as she displays a sense of pride and strength that we are all too familiar with the Mera in the comic book universe. Patrick Wilson as King Orm was convincing as well and he truly made me dislike him from the moment he appears. The supporting case (Nicole Kidman & William Dafoe) was solid too and even the antagonists were considerably interesting too. This is what truly set Aquaman apart from JL. There is a proper cause and Aquaman has a legitimate underdog journey to obtain the throne/Overall, I think all DC fans and any average moviegoer should go watch this. The CGI isnt bad at all and James Wan has perfects cuts and edits so not a single scene feels to dragged out. The action scenes are all very neatly done and u can feel a surge of adrenaline pumping through you when the musical score hits during battle scenes.Most importantly though, there is an actual plot that you can relate to and you can submerge yourself in the absolutely dreamy and surreal world of Atlantis while enjoying this roller coaster of a movie.I am definitely hoping for a sequel and I hope the DCEU can continue building on the success of this movie.",Aquaman

The dialogue is slightly better than the sounds my schnauzer makes when he sees a squirrel. The editing seems to have been the work of four drunken sailors working in different alleyways, and then just splicing each ones work together in order of who has the most teeth missing. I thought the FX were ok, but that just made the experience all the more cruel.

The costumes appeared cheap and just embarrassing (especially the bad guy!)

The pursuit of the spaceship was dazzling and fascinating, as if it had moved "" Speed and Passion"" to the bottom of the sea. The expedition to find trident is also fun and interesting, and it is also the reappearance of Indiana Jones (franchise). The core of the film returns to the exploration of family and self - affirmation, bearing growth and motherly love, self-confidence and affection. The last scene was filled with tears, just as Thomas finally waited to meet his wife, so did we wait for DC's best film in recent years.

James Wan is AMAZING,Aquaman is very imaginative and it's nothing like any other superhero movie I've seen before, he knows what we want, BEST DCEU FILM (Yes I think it's much better than SS/JL/BVS/MOS/WW)
I can't believe that Aquaman's net production cost is160m, much lower than JL(300m) BVS(250m

The Underwater scenes are those non ever seen on screen and a cinematic experience is a must for this one 😍.Plot & StoryThe begging is a slow start and somehow hints that this would be another disappointing DC film as scenes are rushed. For me Narration is just a lazy style of story telling(not a fan) and it does turn me off, but they added present day narration and flash Backs which make it kind of Unique and i would give it a pass for that. The other thing is that the story is plan simple and straight to the Origin story of Establishing the Plot.Action & HumorAction packed film with good fight scenes and well directed Camera Shoots 😱😱 There is one you already saw in the Trailer and it Is well done. After Watching this Film Aquaman ranks Just after Superman and Wonder Woman(sorry Batman but its true) Watching this film makes me Hate Justice League even more as Aquaman is very Powerful and should have been utilized in that film. In terms of Humor 11 out of 20 jokes are funny is all i will say.Where does it stand among DCEU films?Maybe some will disagree, but There is Batman The Dark Night and then AQUAMAN. Yes i said it, it second best.Conclusion.You dont need to be a comic book or Super Hero fan to enjoy this movie. Dear Parents you and your Children will never forget watching such a film, take them and yourself this coming weekend at Fresh View Cinemas I WILL REPEAT, ITS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SUPER HERO FILM EVER.",Aquaman

With that in mind don't pay attention to any 'critic' who compares this movies. Especially that family comedy movies Disney creates using the Marvel logo!
Now, Aquaman is a fresh take on a heroe that's been around for so many years that became kind of a parody.
James wan and the crew created a breathtaking word of Atlantis!

4086,eliel-calebi,A true comic book movie,10,13 December 2018,"It is easy to consider the first act of the mevie slow, but in fact, Aquaman is aware that arthur was already stablished, not in a particular good way, and now needs depth. Therefore the beginning is made to reaffirm arthur's motivations, reassuring the audience trust on the character, and to introduce new characters whose archetypes have already been seen plenty of times, wich its not a bad thing.In the second act it's clear to the audience that Aquaman is a action packed movie who tells the storie of a long gone heir to some throne that comes to save the kingdom from a mistake, slash uncontrolled tyrant. Nonetheless Aquaman delivers a visually stunning experience and, even though its hard to fear for the life of the characters, its easy to be engaged with the narrative and crave to now what comes next.The third act, at last, is amazing in so many aspects, the climax is setup with such finesse that it is hard not to be lost on your own thoughts while processing the amount of Aquaman that the movie deliversIn conclusion, Aquaman, is easily one of, if not the most comic book like movie ever made. James Wan delivers a amazing movie full of good fight scenes, heartfelt moments, realy good cinematography and inspiring art. Most importantly Aquaman seems to be made of comic pages, something that every movie who adapts a comic book should have as it ultimate goal.",Aquaman

James Wan provides exceptional quality as a director who has been directing films with horror genres, challenged to handle different genres.
The actors in the film Aquaman also gave outstanding performance and were in line with the expectations of the fans considering that for some things, films with super hero genre were very difficult to accept if those who played them did not meet the expectations of the audience.
Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II are suitable choices for acting as Orm and Black Manta.
The audio visual effects produced by this film are also very extraordinary and dialogues are given if we look as if they are talking in the water but in the appropriate tone.
What is lacking in this first film is the showtime of characters like Black Manta who are not too prominent. But I'm sure if this film has a sequel, then the showtime of characters like Black Manta can be extended.",Aquaman

* GFX
* CinematographyHowever, the overall package failed to impress due to the overly futuristic portrayal of the underwater world (seemed like an outer space setup) and the non-uniqueness of the story.Most people from my country have already seen Bahubali - The Beginning and are kinda aware of the story. I'm wondering wow is Aquaman's story line any different..No spoiler alerts, but you'l know when (if) you go and watch the movie yourself.

These DC efforts lag so far behind the MCU as they attempt to cram far too much backstory into the already excessive running time, are far to reliant on CGI (Tom's hair!) and the wild camera swings and zooms make it incredibly difficult to tell who is winning the current fight scene, especially in the ring of fire.

4104,pakkoui,Nice superhero movie but...,6,15 December 2018,"Ok i get the hype and i like the action part of the movie,cgi was great...but a lot of kliches ,fully predictable and finaly and extremly importan to me, i like superheroe movies that are connected in a universe with other superheroes to be very carefull with what they present ,especially in a universe where superman exist and you know if he gets involve things go bad for the bad guys. First of all didnt the atlantians know about the existans of superman? How would they rage war on surface if a guy can come and kill their king in 2 seconds? When the atlantians attack surface ""warning"" and obviously a couple of thousand people where kill the justice league just said ok aquaman has this no worries? Atleast in the other movies their was no justice league or superman didnt exist. I can understand if the movie didnt involve surface to contain the movie around aquaman but from the moment that the world is in danger you would expect master of the seas getting a batstar and superman wiping the floor with his face. I can't get over these plotholes in a movie like this with a budget of 160 mil and other movies to be made that are connected to that universe with similar budgets and not one person thinking ok lets not f.. the story and try to be logical here...! Finally if batman knew about the guy that came from outerspace, he knew about the fish people too...same goes for superman! Marvel did a prety good job with that and before aquaman so did dc...now you can expect darkseid coming in a batman solo movie and a lot of close ups (a lot) and with unrelatable soundtrack. :)",Aquaman

4108,ajipurwono,The Best Superhero Movie in 2018,9,15 December 2018,"Watched this last Thursday near where I lived in. Got me and my wife tickets for last show of the day (9 PM Local). And what a treat it was! Easily the best superhero movie this year. Better than any DC or even most of Marvel movies (with few exception, of course). It's hard to kind of describe it in a sentence or two, but please take it from me, whatever its worth, this is a movie worth all the appreciation. And please do not let those Disney-paid fool you!",Aquaman

4110,petermouridsen-13053,Aquaman er simply perfect!,10,15 December 2018,Really surprised over Aquaman!! Seriously one of the best superhero movies! Jason makes a good Aquaman,Aquaman
4111,masternicce,An beautiful adventure,9,16 December 2018,I just got back from a viewing of Aquaman and iam glad to say that i got really surprised. I went into it with really low expectations after the JL fiasco and now i can say that its one of the best if not the best dc movie ive seen. Got plenty of vibes of Indiana Jones and it truly felt like we went of an journey. The visuals were also top notch and reminded me a lot of Avatar with all the different colours!,Aquaman
4112,dianaradney,Visually stunning and I I'm not just talking Momoa,9,16 December 2018,"Let's face it, Mamoa is physical perfection. You could roll 2 hrs of him and have a hit. But Aquaman is Momoa and a lot more! The underwater scenes as they explore the different kingdoms and Seas are just awesome. At times the movie reminded me of the bright neon colors from Tron and Avatar... other times the creatures seemed to cross over from Pacific Rim. The story was beautiful and the characters engaging. I didn't think I'd like Mira but she stole the screen on more than one occassion and could hold her own with Momoas personality. She's a fun cross between Ariel and the Black Widow. Go see it, buy the popcorn and enjoy the eye candy. It's worth every penny.",Aquaman

4116,rickvonpfeil,Ugh,1,16 December 2018,"Ugh. The worst movie since Sharkboy and Lavagirl. From beginning to end it is ridiculous. The melodramatic script is so bad sometimes I actually sighed or groaned outloud. Other times I just stared at the seatback in front of me and considered leaving (but I was in the middle of the theater).
At times it was like combining the cool technology and weaponry of Star Wars with the cool neon world of Avatar, but trust me no amount of CGI can save you from the excessive absurdity you will experience scene after scene... after scene.

4124,singermagic,Waterlogged,3,16 December 2018,"Saw it last night, a waterlogged tale that made the 2 hour 20 minute run tine seem never ending. Overdone CGI and you find yourself paying more attention to Momoa's beard hairs floating in the invisible water than what is happening. When you start wondering why they used sequins for the Queen's gown ( is there an underwater Michaels) instead of something more sea-like such as mother of pearl or abalone shell, then you know there is something wrong with the film.",Aquaman

4127,immuneapollo,Boring and thoughtless,3,16 December 2018,"The story seems carelessly thrown together and its lack of substance is disguised by colourful but meaningless fights and special effects. The dialogue is so disjointed and over the top, a combination of clichès stuck into a sentence.

4130,strikerhunter,Horrible Acting,4,24 December 2018,Movie was very cheesy and I felt like I was watching a Power Rangers film with the unrealistic costumes. They tried to throw so many things together in one movie that it did not fit at all.,Aquaman

4132,melaninatasha,Colorful and Bright Visuals; Nothing New From the Story.,7,17 December 2018,"This reminds me of AVATAR. This movie is beautiful to look at, but its nowhere near as good as all the hype these people are creating. I don't know who these people that gives this movie 10/10 sycophantically, or if they seen any movie ever - but this movie is NOT a 10. Its really sad that today all movie makers have to do is show some bright colorful lights on the screen and people will give it instant 10/10. Here is my honest points about this movie (don't worry, pretty lights don't distract me):* Good enough acting.
* Surprisingly good cinematography.
* Good directing.
* Fight scenes look bit too choreographed.
* Story is nothing new - Its a rip off from several movies.
* CGI everywhere. (but at least this time its understandable why.)
* I don't know if it was the theater I watched this, but the music was bit too loud compared to the dialogue.As far as DCEU movies goes, this is slightly below Wonder Woman for me. I do agree this is a step towards the right direction for DCEU - but this is not exactly the right direction.",Aquaman
4133,avg-74395,Best DC Film in the past 5 years,9,17 December 2018,"Great cinematography: check
Amazing CGI: Check
Engaging Content: Check
This movie has all the elements of a great blockbuster. Admittedly, the romance between Arthur and Mera seems a bit forced and cliched but the movies makes up for it on all other aspects. It retains enough of the original lore to keep comic fans engrossed while keeping the general audience hooked.With the obvious comparisons that will be made to the MCU, this movie can easily hold its own among the likes of Thor and Avengers",Aquaman

4145,jaccmrn,Fatally flawed from the beginning,2,20 December 2018,"I ask just one thing if a superhero movie. Entertain me.They are meant to be fun. This wasn't.I'm not quite sure how they managed to squeeze in so many clichés, plot holes, stolen imagery moments from other films and blatant 'twists', but they managed it.Nothing made sense, nothing flowed, nothing was viable, the cgi was very hit & miss, the script was lazy and weak, the action sequences (especially the black manta fight) looked like they were straight out of an early 90's power rangers episode.Creating a world is always going to be a challenge and for that reason I will excuse their iteration of Atlantis but when they actually make real world locations look like low budget film sets it worries me about the quality of the footage that hit the cutting room floor.Ultimately I wanted to like this film. I wasn't optimistic in the slightest with dc's current strike rate but I hoped it would be good. In the end I would have walked out happier with aquaman dying at the end because at least I wouldn't have seen it coming.This film makes suicide squad look like a success.

In concert with this idea, this movie had more plot holes than swiss cheese and had such inconsistent pacing and narrative that I found myself either rolling my eyes or laughing my head off during scenes that were allegedly supposed to be emotionally jarring. With that being said, if you want to watch something with jason momoa just watch game of thrones.",Aquaman

It certainly starts strong, but it just dragged for tooooo long and the story line gets messy and boring.

4157,x-88466,"Same like justice league, audience can't join the movie.",5,22 December 2018,"First, I didn't read any Aquaman comic books or any DC comic either. But I watched 'Justice League'. I don't want talk too much about 'Justice League'.but after watch any DC's film, make me feel liked I'm like freshman in DC math class, my teacher is using few day teaching me what is math, then my teacher is taking me to finish final immediate. My points is Aquaman had so many story plot didn't talk same like Justice League. But director is pushing so hard to finish story. I knew DCU is tried to copying 'The Avengers'. Before 'Avengers', MCU already produce lots of films to tell us what is Iron man, captain America, ect. We were watching every hero grows up. But DCU is trying to put equivalent job in a film. As same as Aquaman, director Wen is pushing story so fast. I the sorry had four different water race, but he didn't talk too much about it. And he didn't talk too much about human, it shows like this is all story is about other world stuff, it is not link with human, but the acctually conflict is cause human. Wen didn't show enough.
Secondly, 'Aquaman' showed early in China. I'm Chinese, so I read some news and comments from China internet like Weibo before I watch this film. 'Aquaman' is successed in China, most comments said 'this is good movie, good CG, good actor, so-so story. But good director.' I agree that. By the way, this film is better than other DC film, but all had same problem. So my question is these problem is made by every DC directors, or because DCU' management wants using less money for making as same money as MCU.
Thank you for reading, sorry for bad grammar.",Aquaman
4158,stevetucker-43678,A movie im definitely going to watch again!,10,22 December 2018,"I.. absolutely.. loved.. Aquaman. I've been a fan of comics and comic based movies for a long time, and a character that i found quite odd and interesting at the same time was none other than Aquaman. The way James Wan had depicted him on the big screen, is the best way possible to potray the character. Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, most importantly James Wan did WONDERS with this movie . Atlantis looks so dreamy and beautiful, the sea creatures, to be honest deserve their own movies, and everything else is just.. no words. Absolutely amazing. It'd be absolutely amazing if the next Aquaman movie had another member of the justice league, cant wait. For the people comparing the movie to any other Marvel movie is just straight up, retarded or is just too obsessed with Marvel and you need to relax.

4159,ironmike-06141,Visuals are STUNNING. But that's about it.,6,22 December 2018,"Aqua man could be placed up there with some of the greatest in terms of its visuals. The movie features bright, vibrant colors; well-done CGI; and amazing fight sequences. But in terms of plot and character development, I don't think this movie was the best. The characters lacked the depth that would generally cause you to fall in love with them and I found myself experiencing very little emotion for the entirety of the film. Everything seemed to come really easy to the MC and the plot was predictable. Like REALLY predictable. By the end of the film, only people I cared about were the parents of aqua man. Another thing that was really annoying was the gross over-use of music. You know that powerful crescendo movies use whenever the main villain hits the screen? Well this film used it. Like Eleven Times. Every time ANY antagonist came to the screen you'd hear the loud minor chords, and every time aqua man accomplished the tiniest feet the music got loud and majestic. After 30 minutes of the film the sounds will really start to annoy you and you'll be begging for a quiet scene. In general this was certainly not the worst film, but wasn't the best either. If you go see it you'll enjoy it, but it won't be memorable.",Aquaman

4162,rubin_mathew,A GOOD MOVIE. A CHRISTMAS GIFT 🎁,10,23 December 2018,"This is my first time giving a review.This movie has all the elements that you need for a superhero film which is a perfect balance. It has sentiments, humor, fun and serious. Aquaman should be watched in theatre for great experience. First of all James Wan is ""The Man"". He had taken the risk and courage to bring this superhero to life. Aqua man was the least appreciated superhero before. But now it has changed. Wan did the magic making the character lovable like how Robert Downey Jr. made us like Iron Man.Now to the main part
The script is simple. It doesn't mean it is bad. It is simply good. With this simple script, Wan had delivered an extraordinary way of storytelling which is enganging and makes us glued to the seat till the very end. The narration, the vfx and whole are in the next level. We don't feel any lag as the story is taking us to an whole new adventure.
The actors did their part very well. Especially Mamoa and Heard. Patrick Wilson and Yahya did their job well. No words to explain how good they are.The chemistry between Amber and Jason is very well executed. I didn't feel the jokes were forced. Even if it is, it doesn't matter much.As I said the movie has the perfect balance in emotion, love, action, adventure, humor and serious. This movie won't be a let down for anyone who had watched or who is planning to watch it thanks to James Wan.""Praises to the whole casts, vfx team and one and only JAMES WAN for giving us the wonderful ride.""And to those who are degrading the movie.
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself for degrading a movie which is good in every way.To the people who are reading this.
Don't listen to the critics. They are giving lame execuses for not liking this movie. Follow your instinct and don't judge the book by its cover.

4164,tanneradaines,I Really Wanted to Like It But....,4,26 December 2018,"Avatar meets The Clone Wars, meets Jurassic Park, meets underwater Godzilla, meets Aquaman... What is happening? Yeah, the CGI was cool, but who can't create cool effects anymore? That's not a standard we're still trying to set. Besides, No matter how good your effects are, they can't make up for rushed and unrelatable character development, bad dialouge, forced humor (which was painfully obvious), and an overbearing/confusing storyline. So much was happening and there were so many strange inconsistencies. What was with the underwater lightning portal that took them to the center of the earth where there were dinosaurs? Overall I left the theater feeling like I had been cheated out of two and a half hours of my life and 20 bucks. If you can ignore the core parts of a movie that gives it substance and meaning than yeah, it was an action packed film with over the top special effects. However, I personally am not so easily besieged by such deceptions.",Aquaman

I watched Bumble bee after Aquaman but despite the hype, the Aquaman was still more gripping than the Bumble bee movie.Jason Momoa has come quite a long way from Stargate Atlantis. Hehehe... he really pulled it off with this movie. Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard as pretty as ever.Well done everyone for making such a great movie.The last time I saw a movie this gripping was probably Gladiator or Speed.Thanks for making the end of 2018, a year to remember!Compliments of the season to everyone!",Aquaman

The visuals are stunning and colorful and great cinematography as well, really adds to the atmosphere of darkness and vastness of the oceans.

Also, Amber Heard lungs are quite interesting. If you're expecting more, you might be disappointed. No storyline, dialogues are written by a five years-old and it is a succession of embarrassing moments never ending. Thank you interns from DC for creating this.",Aquaman
4173,reefmavericks,Aquaman makes box office splash? More like splat.,2,25 December 2018,"If you care about great acting, dialogue, and character development, maybe this is not the movie for you. James Wan should stick with the jump scare horror movies, because this movie was an embarrassment, compared to his Insidious series.
Jason Momoa, scenery, and the kraken: maybe the only positives of this movie. It also has a good message: Be humble, a true king fights for everyone, not only his people.
But why the bad rating?
1. Awful Dialogue! This movie is stuffed with cheesy one liners, and horribly basic dialogue throughout. This made it hard to really enjoy the movie. I understand this movie is rated PG-13 and mainly meant for children to see, but it really could have been better.
2. Bad acting. The dialogue did make it hard for the actors to really shine with what they were given. However, the man who played Black Manta was not very good. As a revenge character, he just looked like a mad child and was unconvincing. Patrick Wilson also disappointed in this movie. Nicole Kidman did do a good job with the small role she was given though.
3. Overuse of CGI. The underwater scenery was good, very glowy and spectacular like in Avatar. However, the metal suit CGI was pretty bad. Much too shiny and unconvincing. (Iron Man did it better)
4. Bad costumes! Queen Atlanta, Mera, and Aquaman's fish scale suits looked like they had been bought at a Halloween store. The sleeve ends showed too much and the scales looked like they had been drawn on. Some CGI could have been used here, to add dimension to them.
5. Romance? Where? The romance between Mera and Aquaman seemed like an after thought. Just one scene showing real connection would have helped. Very flat and business like relationship. She helps him, he helps her, and then they end up together somehow.
Despite all this, the movie was an okay way to waste time and the children enjoyed it.",Aquaman
4174,minhanhng-55950,SPOIL AND REVIEW,3,25 December 2018,"I dont understand why people are so upset with this movie. For me, it's completely normal, and ridiculous. the plot twist was so easy to guess that why when aquaman's mom still alive, me absolutely no suprises at all. The script is pretty weird. It made aquaman to become a coward because when he lost the battle, but he was saved by his brother's fiancée (??) i mean, its so damn weird!! The circuit kept jumping. And the man who lost his father, i thought he would play a big role in making Aquaman trouble in saving the Alantis. And he was defeated easily in spite of having a super armor... And King Orm (is that right) was much stronger than Aquaman. Just because aquaman had a trident, and he is the lead male so he won. That made me unable to submit this result and the power of Aquaman. Its suck!
My english is not so good to make a long comment so...",Aquaman

4180,halfdim,Complete waste of time and money,1,26 December 2018,"This movie justifies the addition of a Zero Stars rating. Or even minus numbers. What a dog. I feel terrible for Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe, two really great actors who apparently are past their commercial prime and have to take gigs in drivel like this. The story, what there is of it, is a mish-mash of all previous titles in its genre plus a hell of a lot of water. Every cliche in the book is employed, and how the actors kept a straight face while delivering some of these lines is astonishing. One would have to be a 10 year old boy on the verge of puberty to enjoy this flick, just for the skin-tight mermaid outfits on the female characters.

The film started off interesting. A story was building to a point, and then it fell of the wagon completely.
Characters were very poorly introduced, and since I have no real knowledge of some of these characters, it was very difficult to form connections with them. The background of the characters, even of some of the main characters, is very vague and this made me lose interest early on into the film.
The storyline was very predicatable. Also, very 'unrealistic' and not well thought out. In some cases, it's not really known why characters do certain things or how they get from place to place. It's very wishy washy. Unfortunely, I grew bored very quickly. The movie did not grab my attention. The fights were average, and long winded. The writers tried to incorporate jokes and humour, but it was not very good. The imagery was confusing at times - in the end, it was just a grey blur.
I don't know man. I wanted Aquaman to be the next Wonder Woman - it had the potential! But irritating villains, villains that looked like Ant-Man and predictable plots ruined it for me. I won't even spend money on Aquaman 2 if it was ever produced.",Aquaman

The lore was interesting and the movie did a good job showing Aquaman's backstory with quick flashbacks that didn't distract from the main plot.To start off, all the acting was amazing but I have to give a special shout out to Patrick Wilson (Orm). The villain could have easily came across as comical but Wilson brings a gravitas to the role that made the movie epic. Jason Momoa also did a fantastic job and his screen presence really shows in every scene and that's important for a role like Aquaman.The CGI was fantastic, especially for all the underwater scenes. The creatures looked realistic and the world building was really great. I loved the camera work in the movie. A lot of directors get too comfortable shooting in flat, boring angles but this movie really showed how a visual medium should look to help bring out every scene. From the wide angles to the close ups, everything looked inspired and interesting.I did find some of the music choices questionable at times and the songs distracted from the what was happening but at least they were short moments in an otherwise great score.I really loved the fight scene between Aquaman and Orm. The tension and action was perfect and the small comedic quips landed. I also really liked Aquaman's speech before he got his trident.This version of Aquaman was greatly improved from the Justice League movie. You can really understand his motivations.I really got to hand it to DC this time. I haven't had this much fun watching a DCEU movie since The Dark Knight.10/10 would recommend 👍",Aquaman

Also nobody died? I mean, it would have been fine, but when a mortal human falls down and crashes into three different cliffs, they can't just survive that. I'm not even going to talk about jumping out of the plane to a desert.

4208,AreYouSirius,A Must See and Great movie to end the Year with!!!,9,31 December 2018,"Aquaman Review by Hezy James
Director: James Wan
Release Date: 12/21/1018
My Own Personal Score: 9.5/10
Rating: PG-13
Runtime: 2Hrs, 23 Mins
Cast: Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson**********WARNING! - Major Spoiler Alert**********
Okay, So I have seen it twice now with 2 different groups. I have to say that I am very impressed. Been a while since I seen a good movie that combines everything: Action, Family Drama, Comedy, Romance and Mystery. The Story/Plot is good even though there are some moments that are questionable, but I will get into that later. I absolutely loved it and would recommend you go see it yourself. The trailers do not give it enough credit. In honesty, the trailers sucked but the movie was 100 times better than the trailer. I was not sure what to expect the first time because I did not see the trailers at all before my friends took me to the movie theater. It was not until the first fight scene where the guards came to take Atlanna that I was thinking ""Oh, Okay. It's going to be one in those movies. Okay let me get comfortable then."" It was so good that the first time I saw it, I had to pee like 1 hour and 15 mins into the movie and I did not want to miss a scene, so I held it. I'm guessing everyone else did the same cause as soon as the post credits scene finished, we all ran out to the bathroom. The second time, I filled my bookbag with candy and junk food (do not Judge...We all have done it.) When the movie finishes, I completely forgot all the stuff in my bookbag. I got so hooked into the movie, I forgot I had snacks and candy. Well, let's dive right into it.Plot/Story:
I personally think the plot was well written overall minus a few moments which I will address in the ""Feedback"" section lower down. The plot is about Arthur who is Aquaman going on a journey of self-discovery. The whole movie he keeps saying he is not worthy to be king, but he finally accepts it with the help of some friends. I feel the plot had just enough of everything. Love: Between Tom and Atlanna and between Mera and Arthur. The love between Tom and Atlanna, we felt his pain all right. Imagine walking to the end of a dock every morning for 20 years just hoping the love of your life would be there. Comedy: they threw in a few jokes with Arthur that made him not look like the ""I'm all about Seriousness 24/7"" type and I loved that. Also made the whole movie theater laugh too. Family Drama: we can feel the tension coming from Arthur's little brother Orm. In Orm's opinion, Arthur is the reason their mother was killed. Mystery: they added little mystery with Atlanna and what really happened to her. All they kept saying is she was sacrificed to the Trench. Which Arthur comes to learn is their form of a ""execution."" We don't get to see what the Trench is until the very end of the movie. And woah, not a nice way to be sacrificed for sure.
Characters/Cast
The cast did an amazing job. I feel as if they all fitted their characters perfectly. In my opinion, I did not see any flaws or anything I did not like. The acting was good and made the characters come to life even more.Cinematography
The shots and camera angles were amazing, specially during the fight scenes. Movement with the actors was good. I loved how it would switch scenes quickly. Like when Vulko threw the trident at Arthur and then it's a flashback of young Arthur catching a trident. The colors used to show Atlantis was stunning. The scene where Arthur arrives in Atlantis for the first time, it was just so colorful and beautiful. The Dessert scene, even though I loved it made me feel as if I was playing uncharted again. I mean I loved the game, so I did not mind that scene. Special effects were awesome with all the underwater scenes and the creatures. Overall, the scenes were shot beautifully, and the environment looked amazing.Feedback
Okay, So I have been seeing a lot of the comments for the movie. And about those questionable scenes. Let's get into it. First, the Scene where Black Manta is upgrading the weapons and armor, he got from Orm. Okay, I'm seeing a lot of comments that is asking how he knows how to re work the well what is considered ""Alien Tech"" to him. He could have messed with the wrong thing and blow himself up. Second, Atlanna and how she survived on that island alone for so long. What did she eat? Where did she get the awesome end game high level armor she was wearing? Where did she keep her bottles of Loreal on the island to keep her hair looking just like when she left in the beginning? We have to remember that they had a time limit to work with. And when movies are being editing in the final moments, a lot of scenes get deleted to meet the time goal. Aquaman is already very long at 2Hrs and 23mins. They could not really add in any extra scenes that was not really needed. Yes, we could of use a scene where a younger Black Manta was trying to sneak into Atlantis to steal weapon manuals or blueprints or instead, kidnapping one of their weapon/armor builders and him torturing them to teach him how to. Or, a scene where Atlanna was on the island trying to start a fire and cutting up some dinosaur meat. Yes, dinosaur meat: in the scene where they show the island, you can see dinosaurs running around. So, yea these scenes that we feel are missing, we will just have to use our imagination to fill in the blanks and understand that the movie is already as long as it is.Favorite Quotes
Mera: What did he just say?
Arthur: Something, Something, TridentMera: We need water, you're the closest source.
Arthur: Show Off, I could've just peed on itOrm: My Brother has come from the surface to challenge me for the throne!
Arthur: I call it an Ass-WhoopingSo Overall, I would give this movie a 9.5/10 as my own personal rating and would recommend you go watch it and see for yourself. It is a wonderful movie that displays a strong plot with an amazing group of actors set in a unforgettable environment mixed in with love, comedy and drama. Oh, and stay for the post credits scene. It shows that Black Manta might be the Big bad guy in part 2. And trust me, the End credits song is just beautiful that I actually think people stayed more just because of the song than the post credits scene. The song is Skylar Grey - Everything I need for those who are wondering. There is a original and a film version. Just remember to use the bathroom right before you go into the movie theater and don't forget that you have any snacks or junk food.",Aquaman

While trying to be funny and have a tension-filled plot, they caused anxiety throughout the whole audience in which uncomfortable laughter was the only escape. Momoa did his best but it seemed like there wasn't even a script written. Poor Julie Andrews was disgraced by voicing a faceless monster while her legacy as Mary Poppins was shrouded by the new Mary Poppins Returns which opened just days before.

The CGI was over the top, the explosions were extreme and not needed in every single scene that was shot. There were way too many subplots, zero character development, and let's face it....the jokes were just not really funny. Aquaman is not a great actor - neither was his partner in crime. It is not a bad movie...it is just really, really not good.",Aquaman
4225,No-ideas-for-my-ID,One word sums it up: Wack.,4,2 January 2019,"To be honest, I have never read the comics for Aquaman, but honestly this is what us French Canadians call a ""croûte"", which pretty much means mediocre. After seeing so many super hero movies (btw I really don't care if it's DC or Marvel, I don't know what the fanboyism is about, I just want a good movie) and actually movies in general, I had some (pretty low though) expectations. But this, this was horrible. The plot was extremely flawed (I won't spoil it but if you watch it you might know what I mean from the very beginning of the movie), and some elements just not making any form of sense with previous events. Also, the acting was at its worse (seriously, I've seen better acting from secondary school students doing a forced movie project by an english teacher). Everything the characters said was so emotionless and directly recited that it was cheesy and outright seemed unprofessional (which stunned me coming from such a large studio with some usually very good actors). The most ""dramatic"" moments were so badly interpreted that they were funny. Even if you do like the story assuming you have read the comics you probably will be shocked by the low quality of the acting and the CGI. Oh boy the CGI. When I watched it, I had the constant feeling that I was watching some cheesy Mr. Clean commercial from the mid-2000's. The movie revolves around CGI (pretty much half the movie happens underwater so obviously) and does a very poor job at it. However, even if pretty much 90% if the movie was terrible, the fight choreographies are decent, and if you like very classic movies or are with a kid, you might end up enjoying it. I was with my father who was a huge fan of the comics when I watched the movie, and even though Aquaman was one of his favorite super heroes, he thought the same as me. To sum it up, I absolutely do not recommend going to the theater to watch it, but I suggest to consider watching it when it's going to be available on streaming platforms if you want to laugh at the movie a bit or to watch some underwater fights.",Aquaman

Well, it's pretty much the opposite of that. For the acting, the CGI, the plot and much more, I call it the worst movie I have ever watched. If you are not a DC absolute fan, which you probably aren't since you most likely wouldn't be reading this review anyway, you WILL NOT like this movie.",Aquaman
4227,aguilarandrew-79732,Visual Masterpiece,9,2 January 2019,Aquaman is a visual masterpiece and a great movie in general. The acting is solid and all try their best and clearly are having fun. The humor is real hit or miss but isn't as much of an issue to kill the movie. Jason Mamoa as aquaman is great so are the rest of the cast. I left this movie satisfied of how it ended.,Aquaman
4228,Pedrisky,A very good movie of superheroes,8,13 January 2019,"This is a movie that raises my hopes that Dc will make good movies again:The film has great successes, as for example: the CGI is pleasant to see and very colorful; The fight scenes are very incredible and it becomes very interesting.But it has a bad point: it is that it is overloaded with history. I think that the plot with Black Manta could have been saved for another Aquaman movie. Many people say that the film is predictable, and the truth is that it is true, but honestly, I did not care, because the entertainment made me forget that point.In conclusion: I recommend that you go see Aquaman, unless you usually get bored easily.",Aquaman
4229,michaeltokgoz,Great Movie!!!,9,2 January 2019,"This movie first of all was the greatest thing to happen to the DCEU since the in my opinion ""awful"" 2017 Justice League movie!! This movie is action packed, and really a great story line. I would really recommend it for anyone who likes to the movie theaters. I give this movie a 9/10 there are some mistakes but that is barely noticeable due to the greatness of the rest of the movie!!!",Aquaman
4230,msolonsch-63866,Seriously...totally underwhelming (Mild spoilers only),3,3 January 2019,"So we watched the trailer, and it looked like Aquaman might actually have a storyline, rather than just extended CGI sequences of fight scenes. Well, kudos on the trailer, you convinced us to fork out our dollars and go the cinema, but the popcorn was the highlight of the evening!Ok, ok, I accept that this is a comic/superhero movie, and it's aimed for a teens audience. So, in that respect it was sort of entertaining. But really...Aquaman was such a mish mash.There were the attempted moralistic tales. First about polluted water. Next about being judgmental about other cultures (in this case the Atlantians being judgmental about the surface world) and a few others tossed in. The movie gets a tick for trying, but any decent environmental studies student could have improved that part of the script.The scenery was nice and the CGI passable - but certainly not out of this world, even though it was trying to be out of this world.But onto the weaknesses.There were the jokes. Hmm, attempted jokes. I don't think I actually laughed at any of them. Next, what's with the 70s style riding on fish creatures with a harness when the main characters all have underwater superpowers.And what about the plot? Well there are goodies and baddies. A predictable love story. And all that was really just a pretence for sequence after sequence of shoot-em-up on land and in water. And that's why it was so disappointing, it offered very little for the viewer if you were after anything more than an action flick.",Aquaman

4237,hud97,A good one for DC,7,5 January 2019,"When I first heard about this movie coming out I was very skeptical especially since this was following the train wreck Justice League. I am not fully against DC movies ( although I prefer Marvel) because DC does have really good ones, Batman, Wonder Woman, and now Aquaman. The cast was very good, Jason Momoa did a fantastic job, he fit the part really well and he is not hard to look at which is a win for DC. The casting of Aquamans evil brother however could have been better than Patrick Wilson, his usual type of movies ( insidious, and the
conjuring) are very different from his part he played in Aquaman, his acting was not bad at all I just had a hard time seeing him fit the part. Overall this movie was very fascinating to see with all of the underwater special effects since it is something I have yet to see in movies before, great color, great action. I would say it is worth it to go see Aquaman while it is still in theaters just because your television at home just can't quite capture the action and special effects that a movie theater can. Is this movie perfect? no, but really no movie is, but I would recommend you seeing this movie as it was an enjoyable fun experience.",Aquaman

4256,calm22,Can CGI and Audio Keep Aquaman Afloat?,9,18 January 2019,"To say that superhero movies are liked in this day and age is an astronomical
understatement. No matter what realm or studio these heroes come from, people are lining up to see every movie starring a supernatural hero, DC Universe (DCU) has been riding this wave for some time and while they may have fallen off a little bit here with their newest movie Aquaman, there are still a lot of things to hang in there for.
The film starts off by introducing two characters through Arthur/Aquaman's (Jason Moana) narration, his father, Tom Curry (Temeura Morrison) and his mother, Queen Atlanta (Nicole Kidman) and how their meeting and falling in love and ultimately more important the child they had were never supposed to be. Then after a few years have passed Queen Atlanta's old life catches up to her as she was part of an arranged marriage in Atlantis so in order to protect her family she must return to fulfill her part in the marriage. After this, the movie zips ahead 20 years and viewers can see that Arthur has grown up to be a mammoth of a man who possess special powers thanks to his mother's genetics and we quickly and violently learn that he is using these powers to help those in need.
The dialogue was lacking and in spots, the humor was rather dry and short-lived, the poor script causes there to be moments where something seems to be lost from the scene because of how it seems the words are just thrown in. It seems the scriptwriters tried to be funny in situations that called for something serious or smooth and this leads to a choppy sounding dialogue that leaves viewers wondering if the scriptwriters didn't read things over before they submitted it. An example of this is when Arthur dramatically breaks his way into a submarine then gives a sheepish grin and says, ""Permission to come aboard?"" The screenwriters couldn't have come up with a less original quote, causing everyone to shake their heads as there is nothing more predictable that could have been said and yet they kept it. Also, there is a major lacking of back story for Black Manta, he plays a major role in the film and yet we know next to nothing about his past. This leaves Manta to be a shallow husk of a potentially wonderful character and gives the viewers almost no reason to even like him let alone cheer for him.
With over five different studios working on the CGI for this film, it's not surprising the filmmakers were able to pull off the realistic water effects and seemingly-accurate battle scenes. The way that they made the fight scenes not only look very real but also had to work with transitioning from land to water shots quickly and there was no scene disruption which allowed the viewers to stay focused on the movie. The CGI in this movie is comparable if not better then almost any other action movie out today, some examples could be Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, Justice League, and with all of these, advanced CGI is utilized to create an almost undeniable reality.
Something that really stood out to me even as I cringed through the dialogue was how the movie used its audio. I really enjoyed how they used not only songs during action pieces or peaceful pans over beautiful scenery but just the simple non-diegetic music that helps to deepen the moment. Looking back now I can count more than a few times where I got goosebumps leading up to or in a scene because of the audio.
After diving into the underwater world of Aquaman viewers can see that though there were some rough patches, overall this movie was rather smooth sailing. When you look at the animation combined with the audio you get one great movie and though the dialogue can be rough I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a fun and beautiful looking action movie.",Aquaman

Also the themes in this movie were old fashioned in some really disturbing ways.. without spoilers, one of the characters - a female character- actually defends her own arranged marriage!!! Puke! Why is this relevant to an American audience?

4264,cabledr,Once again Amber Heard ruined a movie with her acting,6,25 January 2019,"Apparently when u have no acting skills, all you have to do is screw people in Hollywood to get cast in a movie. Too bad amber heard was cast in this movie and every other move she had ever been in. By far the WORST attempt at acting I've seen since Mariah Carey in Glitter. Their was a lot of cgi in this movie, maybe just a tad too much. Lots of fighting and under water scenes. The story line is about the same as every other superhero movie, so the lazy writers must have had hangovers or just didn't care when they were writing this because their was nothing new or extravagant in it. Basically all the main characters were casted with all the wrong people except for Jason Momoa who played Aquaman perfectly! I give him a 10/10. Amber heard scenes made me want a refund. She gets a 2/10 and I'm being very generous. Patrick Wilson was acting a little over the top and it was hard to ever take him seriously he gets a 6/10. Nicole Kidman started the movie with poor acting as well but surprised me towards the end by finishing very strong. (I think it was because she was standing next to amber heard and, a turnip acts better than her) she get a 8/10. William Defoe player a lesser of a part than I had hoped and wished to see him a little more within the story. He always gets very ""into"" his characters and performs stunningly. He gets a 9/10 for his role. I literately will never want to watch this again because I could not stop laughing at how bad amber heard was.

The majority of the acting was unbearable even my guy Momoa.It blew me away just how unoriginal and generic this movie is and sincerely implore you to save your money. The villain ""ocean master"" is the MOST CRINGE AND ONE DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER I've ever seen. That goes for all of them as this movie has zero character development, other than the cliché maturation of the protagonist. The CGI and visuals are extremely overdone, it might have been decent if they didn't go so overboard with making every suit and city so over the top.

4268,gracedownie,Better than I expected,7,26 January 2019,"With my standard set low, I came in to this film expecting it to be an over processed piece of junk, with the only thing keeping it a float being Jason Momona, aka his body. However this film took me by surprise. They reinvisioned aquaman, making him likable, funny and a rounded (but rough) main character. I felt a depth to his character, and to his female counter part was more than a pretty face as well. She complimented him and was also fitting to the role (once you got pass her devilishly red hair) She also didn't just sit by as he did all the work, she had her share of the battles and did better than aquaman in most of the fights.In the same way Wonderman knew little of the outside world, she knew little of the above world (although she didn't brush her hair with any forks) She felt a real character and part of the team and it worked well with Aquaman not knowing as much about the undersea world, but it made me wonder how he spent so much time in the ocean and not come across the under water city? Or any other Atlanitans?Look away now if you don't want any spoilers...I'm glad you like the spoilers, I like them too.So things didn't always make sense. Whether it was the badly put together bad guys (really... Black Manta? Seriously) or the war which was waged on a shoe string. The plot was thin and very much like black panther in all honesty, but there was so much going on you didn't have time to think about it.From new creatures, to the predictable jump scares, to the over the top music, they flooded the screen with one thing after another. Although the funniest thing in the whole movie was the music... and the biggest let down. It took over. One scene was supposed to be romanic and they had no speaking, only the music to carry the scene along. It felt out of place and out of touch. Very much like guardians of the Galaxy 2.The other let down was in coalition with the music... the zooming in. As if we don't know who the character is or what meaning is it supposed to be without loud drums and sudden shots just of the heros face. It was tacky and over done. It was a problem not carried as much throughout the movie but at the begining it was very over the top, while the ending, well you'll just have to watch it to find out that drama.So in all I found it funny and really enjoyed it, for the comedy it is.The film deserves it's place, just under Wonderman, far above Superman but still. It's a comedy, take it for what it is and don't worry. They'll remake the DC world again and hopefully will get it the right balance.",Aquaman

4271,aultimaetapa,Aquaman!,5,28 January 2019,"Aquaman! Finally, DC. Hi. Before I begin the analysis, I must say that I am a beginner in this world of ""human"" movie criticism. I'm brazilian, my english is ""meh"".Do you like a fun movie full of surprising and frantic action scenes to the point of impressing the viewer at any time? Correct movie. Do you prefer well-developed characters and a script that is minimally credible and does not abuse of the cliches? Wrong movie. From the very beginning we have unprecedented destruction, the film minimally tries to stop to introduce its characters in a way that provokes the affection of the public, this simply occurs naturally with the course of the scenes. Let's say at least we have some dialogues geared toward a basic introduction of what is happening and things to provoke the comic side (to the end)... Other than that, explosions. Arthur is by far the only character with a ""mini-arc"" of presentation, as the narrative unfolds between flashbacks and present events; not to curl up, since everyone has a sentimental connection to each other and only complements something for the public's understanding. The arc does not take much of the film, which is good and does not arouse the boredom of the viewer, moreover, the performance is good enough to portray with skill the strong personality of the protagonist who, although theoretically very generic, can take advantage of the clichés in a good way and improve the reputation that the hero has here. I would say that despite using the clichés in a good way, ""Aquaman"" abuses this. For example, the relationship of our couple is totally superficial, being moved and carried by a meager clichés of comedy and, also, conveniences of action. It can be said that ""Amber Heard"" does not shine or cause fascination, because her character is very superficial, which possibly hindered her performance (coloring the tedious is difficult). Mera is used as a convenient tool, more than is used as a character. Black Mamba demonstrates an interesting potential, however, it is forgotten and used in a confusing way, being a simplistic opposition to the main objective and appearing at random as a script convenience. The matches are short (with tactics worthy of Power Rangers) and may, rather, disappoint the fans. In the meantime, our antagonist is acceptable; the action reinforces well its ideals and brings to the fore that, in the end, it is not only an opposition to the others, but, yes, someone who does not understand or accepts facts; being minimally humanized in its choices and slightly different from what we are accustomed to, even though it is completely cliché and having almost nonexistent development, I believe that at least we have a potential for continuation. Other presences media have only the value of supplementing the narrative and do not necessarily give much emphasis to something, nor do they sketch out prominence (with some exceptions in certain scenes). Still, the cast is very generic, simple and poorly developed. The script, however far from being a wonder, is very predictable and simple, can impress. Because? Well, most of the cliches are well used, in addition, the direction manages to catch the viewer in some moments, although it can not be called primordial. The action, however, is quite convenient at times, and there are, yes, many repetitive scenes to break the spectator's expectation, but obviously few are caught by surprise (currently, it would be more surprising if nothing happened). The script prolongs through unnecessary comedy the romance of the main couple, only, obviously, to receive this in the end (in a moment of peace). Generic is relative, however, I would say that the movie is medium in this regard. Other than that, the ending is a stereotype used positively. You can not count predictability as a grotesque mistake, as we already knew that this premise of ideological battles would engender such a feat (even more so in a movie of a ""independent"" hero). However, the film is filled with grotesque conveniences and occasional to the extreme, misrepresenting (even) the sense of some things or generating flaws and holes. As has been said, action is impressive and frenetic; now, combine with the fundamental and beautiful design (the best part). Armor faithful to the HQ's, without removing representative details (they do not look like a cosplay either, which is great); everything is well detailed and immersive. The effects do not sin so much (only in some moments); soon, they enter, yes, in the standard quality of films of heroes of the present time. The comedy of the movie is really bad if you are already accustomed to several movies of the genre, since the jokes are only recycled from other works. Being direct, ""Aquaman"" is incredible for those who seek to have fun or for those who praise cliche heroism. Final grade? 5. Define well. Medium but fun.",Aquaman
4272,scarlettweston,I loved this movie,9,28 January 2019,"I work at a movie theater and when I saw that we were showing this movie, at first I didn't even want to watch it because I don't like the comic version. But I did end up watching it and it turned out really god and I loved it. Very glad my best friend wanted to see this",Aquaman
4273,dstout-37551,Well made but not a great story.,8,28 January 2019,Production values are great; but I felt that story itself could have been better.,Aquaman
4274,cotwo,Very bad,1,29 January 2019,Horrible movie. Too bad baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad baaaaaaaaaaaaad,Aquaman
4275,agentsalt,Terrible,1,29 January 2019,"This movie compelled me to create an IMDB account... not because it was an amazing example of American cinema, but because it was the worst movie I have ever seen.I am not going to go into detail about all the poor choices made by the producers, screenwriters, director and actors...I'm just going to say that there is plenty of blame to go around. Simply put, there was no part of this movie I enjoyed.",Aquaman
4276,waydbarton,Absolute Generic Garbage,1,29 January 2019,"Visually impressive and non-stop action, unfortunately this action is generic ""bad guys miss every shot and good guys just happen to survive everything"".
Storyline is complete generic trash, there's a couple of okay scenes (bar scene with the dad was wholesome, dive into the trench is awesome, giant cthulu crab thing was cool), Black Manta could have been cut from the storyline and the movie would have been better off for it.I am convinced that the high scoring reviews for this film were from film staff as there is a MASSIVE amount of 10/10s posted weeks before the films release, which has skewed this films rating significantly.Wait for DVD release, don't waste your $ seeing at the cinemas.",Aquaman
4277,amund-96690,Save your money,3,29 January 2019,Would watch it again to write a propper review. If it wasn't such a terribly bad movie.But in short: terrible plot. Predictable. Silly in a bad way. Some special effects are good. But then again some are very bad. Way to long.,Aquaman
4278,soringeorgevaida,You should fire Amber,1,11 November 2020,"For Aquamen 2 you should fire Amber Heard! I don't care to know the full story of what really happened between her and Johnny Depp, but if he has to pull out of movies because of the case, she should too. So even if I liked the first Aquamen movie, actually going 2 times at the cinema: premiere day and 1 week later, I will not go to the second movie if she is playing in it!",Aquaman
4279,reljacmatej,Best COMIC BOOK movie in a while...,8,29 January 2019,"I've seen it three times alredy, turn off your brain and enjoy the movie.",Aquaman
4280,phasmalegend,I HATE AMBER HEARD,1,25 March 2019,I just hate her so god damn much!!!! I will never like her ever!!!,Aquaman
4281,scarthekilla,An epic fail,1,1 February 2019,"If movie could give you cancer then you are at right place.
This is the worst movie i saw.Many stories at same time , nothing happening , no homo , after 2h everything happend in 5 min and end.Soooo stupid , overrated , please dont make next part , just dont please.
I lost 2h and 10 min on this movie and it gave me cancer.",Aquaman
4282,samuelhento,Not bad doesn't equal good.,7,4 February 2019,"Amazing cgi, decent storyline, and good acting.
However, the dialogue and overuse of cringy jokes often felt really forced and hard to look at.
The best movie of the DCEU so far, but that bar wasn't that high to reach. Looking forward to Shazam tho.",Aquaman
4283,anielmotpe,Horrible,1,4 February 2019,"This was one of the worst DC movies, and we know DC been slacking. Horrible visuals, we're in 2019, this is unacceptable. Call of Duty and GTA have better imagery than this. The only good thing about this movie was Jason Momoa. The script was horrible, seemed like the riverdale writers wrote it. Wow I'm so disappointed.
Cast 0
Script -5
Visuals and Effect -100",Aquaman
4284,aliceford-43599,Swiss Cheese,1,7 February 2019,"I believe that Aquaman is a sorry excuse for a movie and I will not change my mind. I started believing this right after the movie ended. I think that this belief is rational as the plot of a movie is extremely important and this movie has so many plot holes that it's basically swiss cheese. Nothing could change my mind; even if the movie's lack of continuity was an artistic decision to comment on movies with a lack of continuity, the movie's attempt is way too unintentional to ever pass as one. This belief is very strong (maybe unimportant) but very strong. A significant number of people agree with my belief. I would be very disappointed in the world and film experts if they rate Aquaman as a good movie.",Aquaman
4285,gharatakash,Unbelievable,10,18 March 2019,Work of jason in movie is fantastic i love this movie,Aquaman
4286,transboi-43319,Better Than Anticipated,7,15 March 2019,"I waited so long to watch this movie because I honestly thought it was going to be bad. Aquaman is probably most people's least favorite DC character, but they really did him justice. The script is well written, and the acting is great. This movie was much better than expected.",Aquaman
4287,oscarozsmite,A lot more fun than I could have thought!,6,12 February 2019,"A movie that dont really bring anything special or new to the tabel. But it is still a really entertaining movie and its dynamic camera movements will bring pretty much anyone to their seats during its intense action setpieces. I found that some of the dialog brought me to the brink of cringing but but the amazing cast really does what it can to help and make it more easy to watch. Patrik Wilson should get extra notice since he probably had the hardest time with a very weak script, but personally I think he does an amazing job and you can really tell how much fun he allows him self to have during filming.",Aquaman
4288,sirrmarco,Amber Heard,1,8 November 2020,"Good movie, But a movie with Amber heard should be banned. Did like Jason mamoa.",Aquaman
4289,kev630,Visually incredible . . solid story . .,10,26 December 2018,Loved this movie . . it went quickly for being over 2 hours long because it took time to develop several different characters . . . the visual beauty is worth admission . . but it also entertained . . .,Aquaman
4290,isab-08749,A complete waste of time,2,18 February 2019,"I don't even know where to begin... I truly regret watching this movie, because I cannot erase this traumatic experience from my mind.
The structure of the movie is completely ridiculous! The viewer knows too much about the relationship between the mother and the father and their forbidden love, but we know nothing about aquamans skills and not enough about his childhood!The dialogues are not even worth commenting on. They are not funny but seem very stupid and there is nothing content in them.
I give this movie 2 stars because of the visuals. The underwater landscapes are done very nice, but cannot save this movie at all.
This is on the line between satire and serious movies.",Aquaman
4291,dianchapman,Cheesy which fit the viewing mood for us,5,8 November 2019,"I don't know the Aquaman story so I am definitely not a purist but this movie fit the bill for us one night. We were in the mood for one of those cheesy disaster movies where the misunderstood hero gets fired for alerting the corrupt supervisor/politician then ends up saving at least their love interest and maybe some number of others. We couldn't find anything and saw this show up in HBO. So we tried it. Fit the mood exactly! Cheesy, sometimes funny, good visuals and holy crap moments when you see some of the big name actors involved. Wonder if Wilem Dafoe liked his role. I personally found it interesting (especially in the current American political climate) that the innocent victims at the beginning were Russian submariners and the villians were angry American black males. Hmmmm...",Aquaman
4292,adnanzenci,Keyifli,9,21 February 2019,"Sürükleyici senaryosu keyifli bir izlenim sunuyor, DC de gelisme var",Aquaman
4293,pablavo,DC... Stop making movies,1,21 February 2019,"When you write a review when you're still watching the movie, two things may be apparent 1. You're overly excited about the movie 2.the movie is, really that bad.
The latter is true of this awful piece of badly acted, terribly scripted crap.Oh god! What a load of crap!",Aquaman
4294,robomail,ONLY MARVEL FANBOY SAID THIS MOVIE SUCKS,10,22 February 2019,"This is the best DC movie ever since the darknight rises,Aquaman have full package of everything,best casting,best cgi,and best story",Aquaman
4295,devinmichael-33309,Worth a watch,8,9 March 2019,"I purchased this on blue ray. It was a fun time. Good action, fun twist, super cgi.",Aquaman
4296,jehuthra,Far from Marvellous,3,27 February 2019,"CGI overload - Check
Super predictable schlock - Check
Main characters yelling every time something important happens - Check
Things that make drunk/stoned people go ""oooohhhh"" - CheckWell developed story - Negative
Ability to identify with any of the characters - Negative
Mystery, subtlety, charisma - Negative
Desire to see a sequel - NegativeSuper disappointed with this one. I mean, Aquaman was already one of the LEAST popular super hero characters - why would you butcher it like this?This is probably the worst Super Hero movie I've seen in a while. I wanted to like it, I love basically all of the Marvel and DC movies, but this one just left me wanting soo much more. The character development is done halfheartedly, and they just tried to push WAY too much history into a single film. Perhaps because of this, it's hard to identify with any of the characters:
""Hey, I'm the drunk, ripped and hard-core rabble-rousing son of a queen from 'World-A', who is super arrogant for two hours but somehow acts humble in the last 10 min of the movie""...
""Hey, I'm the super-hot daughter of royalty from 'World-B' who doesn't like her arranged marriage and can basically kick everybody's butt without trying, but I'll be vulnerable just for you - perfect stranger""...
""I've got an idea, let's do stuff together and change 'World-A' and 'World-B'!! ""
Sorry for the excessively detailed plot synopsis, but that's all folks.If you want to take a few hits and enjoy some very well done visuals, then this movie will probably give you a fun 2.5 hrs - but if you actually want a movie that sticks with you and makes you want more... try again. I will not watch the planned sequel.",Aquaman
