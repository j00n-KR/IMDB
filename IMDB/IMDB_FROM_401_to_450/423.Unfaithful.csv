0,Leofwine_draca,Excellent love triangle thriller is a real surprise from nowhere,9,24 November 2016,"This is a suspenseful remake of a '60s French movie with plenty to recommend it: excellent acting from all the leads; a thrilly, twisty plot that keeps you guessing far past the initial set-up, and enough tension to fill two or three other average movies. The film boasts fine direction from Adrian Lyne and great camera-work, giving it a polished, professional look. Production values are spot-on and the music is particularly emotional/suspenseful.The focus here IS on the emotions, as the members of the central love triangle each face devastating consequences as a result of the love affair. Diane Lane, as the emotional heart of the film, is very good indeed (why haven't we heard of her before?) whilst Olivier Martinez is suitably dashing as the French bookseller. However, it's an understated performance by Richard Gere which holds the whole film together, making the last half an hour particularly tense and impressive. All over, this is a top-notch movie which never lets up for a second.",Unfaithful
1,SnoopyStyle,Cheating with classy Diane Lane,7,14 April 2014,"Connie (Diane Lane) and Ed Sumner (Richard Gere) are a suburban married couple with a kid Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan). Nothing terrible has happened but their marriage shows signs of wear. Then the winds of change starts to blow literally, and she collides with Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) in the city. He helps her out with her skinned knee. She just can't keep him out of her mind and calls him up. She keeps returning to him and finally submits to his charms. However Ed starts putting it all together.Diane Lane makes cheating classy. This movie may not work with somebody else. Never has a woman thinking about sex look so great. The story is basically a romance novel. One thing director Adrian Lyne knows about is how to class up some sexual ugliness. The use of classical piano almost makes the audience root for the cheaters. I am less certain about the on-the-nose Olivier Martinez, but the appealing Diane Lane makes up for any deficiencies.",Unfaithful
2,lee_eisenberg,Destined to happen?,7,4 May 2006,"Obviously, there have been many movies about people having affairs. In fact, Adrian Lyne - who directed ""Unfaithful"" - directed ""Fatal Attraction"". But good performances keep this one afloat. They create an interesting blend of drama and suspense here, with wife Diane Lane having the affair, and husband Richard Gere wondering how long he can put up with it.I don't know whether this is really any masterpiece. It mostly seems pretty routine. It's just that it creates a feeling of impending doom. Also starring Olivier Martinez and Erik Per Sullivan (aka Dewey on ""Malcolm in the Middle"").",Unfaithful
3,ccthemovieman-1,No Redeeming Values Here,4,6 July 2006,"The beginning of this film is good and the last 20 minutes are excellent. Unfortunately, the bulk of the movie (about an hour and a half's worth) is pure garbage. Basically, what you get is a soap opera-soft porn show as married woman ""Connie Sumner"" (Diane Lane) has some steamy affairs with young French men. Lane's body is about the only thing to admire in this film.As for the ending, I only used the word ""excellent"" meaning it was ""interesting,"" but hardly the right kind of message sent to the film viewers. ""Disturbing"" might be a better adjective as the immoral woman gets away with adultery and the husband ""Ed Sumner"" (Richard Gere) gets away with murdering one of the lovers. Nice, eh?? That's the world of films.",Unfaithful
4,moonspinner55,"Elegant, but curiously lacking in suspense or danger...",6,29 July 2006,"Overly-familiar and curiously bland flip-side to ""Fatal Attraction"" (from ""Fatal"" director Adrian Lyne) concerns wife and mother Diane Lane traveling from the New York suburbs into SoHo where she has a 'meet cute' with a handsome stud; she's drawn to him and soon returns, beginning a lusty secret affair that her husband may be wise to. Fails to stir up the same kind of controversy that permeated ""Attraction"" simply because this one isn't as well written (and is designed like a heated Harlequin romance to boot). None of this is the fault of the players: Lane (despite a penchant for making faces) is very good in the lead and Richard Gere is effectively low-keyed as her milquetoast spouse. Yet there's nothing exceptional or gripping about this story, and the final act is so colorlessly drawn-out that our sympathies ultimately shift away from the troubled couple. **1/2 from ****",Unfaithful
5,dbdumonteil,UNfaithful remake...,3,30 November 2003,"Everything that made Claude Chabrol's work a winner in 1968 has vanished in the air.SPOILERS First :Richard Gere is miscast as the lead :he's more handsome than Frenchie bland mediocre Martinez;one should note that in the original,the part of the lover was a small one ,but Maurice Ronet made his one scene count ;Martinez is unable to sustain any interest for his character.But that's not all,far from it:Chabrol began his work with a bourgeois life depiction;here the social background has been totally wiped out ,a vague middle-class couple with vague friends .But what made Chabrol's film memorable was his cinematographic language:never ,never,Michel Bouquet and Stephane Audran spoke about the tragedy afterward:only their looks allowed the audience to know about their ""communication"" .In Chabrol's film,Bouquet does not seem to enjoy sex that much and one scene in bed shows Audran's frustration;such is not the case here,cause Gere seems to be a ""true"" husband (see the scenes in the bedroom and in the bath tub):so Lane's behavior does not make much sense. A lot of scenes were directly taken from ""la femme infidèle :Gere and the private detective down by the sea ( Bouquet met his man on the banks of the Seine), the car crash, the murder (the scenes are very similar).A lack of tempo does not help either;Chabrol 's movie only lasted about 95 min,and it seems that there's a lot of filler in Lyne 's one: naturally ,he feels his quota of nudities which were totally absent in the French movie:and however ,Audran displayed much more sensuality than Mrs Lambert.A question:when will Lyne make another fantastic movie? We have not forgotten ""Jacob's ladder"" and I guess we never will.I will have forgotten ""unfaithful"" within one month... or even less.",Unfaithful
6,Quinoa1984,More than your usual run of the mill cheating drama,9,11 May 2002,"Adriene Lyne deserves credit here, he has taken an effective and potent script by Broyles and Sergent and has transformed it into an affecting drama about infidelity and personal anguish in torn love.  Diane Lane deserves special recognition for giving a performance mostly in eyes and body movements (no pun intended) to create a perfect sense of dissilutionment (and I like that she's a beautiful older woman who isn't ashamed to show some skin and action), and even Richard Gere gives more than is usually warranted as her confused husband.  Some scenes almost have nothing to do with the rest of the picture, and even that works something to.  This is a work that needs to be seen, though it is not 100%.  A or A-",Unfaithful
7,michaelRokeefe,Sometimes forbidden love is the most powerful love.,8,11 May 2002,"A stunning, provocative and sensuous thriller directed by Adrian Lyne. Enough nudity to flesh out the movie and the violence is top notch brutal. A suburbanite(Diane Lane)puts her eleven year marriage on the line by having an affair with a younger man (Erik Per Sullivan)that she accidentally runs into in the city. The affair is hot and passionate. The husband(Richard Gere)realizes that something has gone awry in his marriage. Upon finding out what his wife has been doing, he confronts her lover. Your eyes will be glued to the screen. The passion; the angst; the guilt; the shame; all drip with realism. You will probably leave the theater a little flushed and wanting a cigarette...well, you get the idea. Lane carries this movie and deserves a lot of the credit for its success. Gere is excellent as the stunned husband even if he doesn't play the stud role. Highly recommended.",Unfaithful
8,sunwarrior13,Performances Save The Film,8,11 September 2012,"Unfaithful is a film directed by Adrian Lyne.It features Richard Gere, Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez. It tells about a couple living in suburban New York City whose marriage goes dangerously awry when the wife indulges in an adulterous fling with a stranger she encounters by chance in Manhattan.The screenplay was adapted by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr. from the French film,The Unfaithful Wife. Connie (Lane) leaves her suburban home on an errand, venturing into Manhattan during a wicked windstorm. On a trash-strewn Soho street, she literally runs into Paul Martel (Martinez), a handsome young Frenchman carrying a huge stack of books. Connie has a bad scrape on her knee, and is unable to get a cab, so Paul invites her up to his apartment. Paul is quietly flirtatious as he gives Connie some ice and a bandage for her knee. Connie phones home and explains to her son, Charlie, that she's running late. Before she leaves, Paul gives her a book of Persian poetry. She mentions the encounter in passing to Edward (Gere), her husband, but it's clear that she's obsessing about Paul, and soon she's back in the city, with a pretext for calling him up. Soon, they are lovers, and they grow bolder and bolder in their passion. Edward begins to suspect, and eventually gets a private investigator to follow Connie. His worst fears confirmed, Edward decides to confront Paul, a decision that will come to haunt him.Unfaithful elevates the film because of the solid performance of the cast especially Diane Lane.While the screenplay may have been said to be recycled plots especially with adultery genres and adds nothing new to this type of films,the performances saves the film from mediocrity.Also,the resolution between the marital strife between Connie and Edward is something that would be far from satisfying. It seems that Lyne never learned from making Fatal Attraction.",Unfaithful
9,jotix100,Brief Encounter meets Fatal Attraction in Manhattan,5,26 June 2002,"I wonder where did Mr. Lyne and Mr. Sargent live. Are they confusing Chicago, the Windy City, with Manhattan? Sorry, but as a native of this city, I've never seen anything like the wind storm at the beginning of the film. It's a very silly premise to throw the 2 would-be-lovers together. At any rate, can anyone tell me what was Connie Sumner doing in Soho buying party things that she would have been able to get (much cheaper too) at the nearest mall? It just doesn't make sense, as well as the rest of the film.Could I also ask whose idea was to cast that young actor Erik Per Sullivan as Charlie? I mean, give us a break, Mr. Lyne, with such nice looking father as Mr. Gere and a gorgeous mother, Ms. Lane, you would have expected the kid to be as photogenic and a great presence on screen, instead, we keep wondering: Is this kid adopted?In order to make the story a little more realistic, Mr. Lyne should have insisted in keeping Richard Gere's hair without the help of Clairol or whatever they dyed his hair with, because then, the film would have made sense as we all would have told ourselves, well Edward can't satisfy Connie and that's why she goes into the affair. We are not given any indication of what's wrong with their marriage since all appears to be honky-dory on the surface.The cliche of having a French lover has probably been used too much already and Paul Martel, the Olivier Martinez character can provide a lot of kinky sex and raise Connie's libido. Poor Edward, he can't cut the mustard at home, so Connie must go to Soho to satisfy her desires, oh la la...Don't ge me wrong, the film is nice to look at. It's a mixture of Architecture Digest with a Pottery Barn catalogue. Wouldn't have been better to re-decorate than getting involved with Paul Martel?.The ending is a cop out. Sorry Mr. Lyne, but are you telling us that crime does pay? Obviously Connie thinks that life could be a beach at the end of the murder!Heaven help us from another collaboration between Lyne and Sargent. Amen",Unfaithful
10,LeonLouisRicci,Good Performances & the Director's Touch Enhance Cautionary Tale,8,14 August 2016,"Affairs of the ""Heart"", or more Precisely the Libido have a way of Biting You in the Ass. Like a Friend of Diane Lane's ""Connie' says at Lunch, ""Affairs never end well, there always a disaster"".This is the Kind of Stuff (Smoldering, Sexy, Artsy, and Suspenseful) that Director Adrian Lyne is known. Comparisons to ""Fatal Attraction"" (1992) and ""9 1/2 Weeks"" (1986) are Expected.But ""Unfaithful"" stands on its own because, well because this Type of Thing Taps into a ""Basic Instinct"" that is One of the ""Seven Deadly Sins"" (Lust). It's part of the Human Condition and We're Hard Wired with it, Like it or Not, so Everyone can Relate in One Form or Another.The Director's Flourishes Help make this a ""Pleasant"" Watch with the Camera Making Love to the Images. Richard Gere and the rest of the Cast all Contribute to the Downbeat Tone. The Ending is Ambiguous and that's OK, often times Life is Ambiguous. Should more than Please its Target Audience. Some Sexy Stuff is in Full View, so Prudes and the Easily Embarrassed might want to Pass. But for those Willing to take the Ride, the Movie is as Well Crafted and Good Looking as Diane Lane's Performance and Down Home Beauty.",Unfaithful
11,zardoz-13,The Consequences of Adultery,9,25 May 2008,"Lose that light-saber! Hang up those skin-tight super-hero drawers!Audiences over the age of 30 that prefer morality tales rich in irony, ambiguity, and suspense rather than those hare-brained heroics in a galaxy far away, will embrace director Adrian Lyne's provocative soaper ""Unfaithful"" with Diane Lane, Richard Gere, and Olivier Martinez. This artsy, atmospheric, European-style soap opera focuses on the fatal consequences of infidelity. Essentially, ""Unfaithful"" qualifies as an above-average remake of French film director Claude Chabrol's 1969 classic ""Le Femme Infidele,"" itself an updated version of Flaubert's vintage novel ""Madame Bovary.""""Unfaithful"" follows the turn of events that occur when a happily married wife wanders and her cuckolded husband begins to wonder about her. Although it contains more subtlety than most of Lyne's earlier efforts, namely ""Lolita"" (1997), ""Indecent Proposal"" (1987) and ""9&1/2 Weeks"" (1986),""Unfaithful"" breaks just about as many of the Ten Commandments. What sets Lyne's cautionary fable apart is its bittersweet finale, and the uncertainty that surrounds the conflicted couple. In a cinematic age hopelessly dominated by fantastic computer-generated digital special effects, ""Unfaithful"" consciously eschews special effects for unadorned realism as much as its attractive heroine, 37-year old Diane Lane, shuns cosmetics because she simply doesn't need them. Moreover, the unusual casting of Richard Gere of ""American Gigolo"" as the husband and Diane Lane of ""Streets of Fire"" as the promiscuous wife adds to the off-beat quality of ""Unfaithful."" Director Adrian Lyne and his scenaristsAlvin Sargent of ""Spider-man 2"" & William Broyles Jr., of ""Castaway""have cooked up a steamy, sordid saga that qualifies as the best of its kind since Alan J. Pakula's ""Presumed Innocent"" with Harrison Ford. In ""Unfaithful,"" Connie (Diane Lane) and Edward Sumner (Richard Gere) have shared eleven years of marital bliss. They are raising their 9-year old son Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan of TV's ""Malcolm in the Middle"") in a comfortable house by the lake in the suburbs of New York. Edward runs his own business, a Wells Fargo-style armored truck outfit. The Sumners have everything that they need and want for nothing. Connie heads into New York City as the plot unfolds to shop for Charlie's birthday. Fighting a fugitive gale-force wind that sweeps through town, Connie collides accidentally with 28-year old, rare book dealer Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez of ""Horseman on the Roof"") and literally falls on top of this Calvin Klein hunk.Martel invites her up into his fashionable Soho apartment to patch up her scraped knees and drink tea. Later, Connie tells Edward about her brief encounter, and he suggests that she send Martel a bottle of 'cheap' wine for behaving like a Good Samaritan. Unfortunately, things grow complicated, because Connie listens to her hormones instead of her head. Not long afterward, she arouses Edward's suspicions, and he hires a private eye. The photos of Connie's infidelity floor poor Edward.Make no mistake, ""Unfaithful"" condemns adultery. What happens when Edward and Paul confront each other is as unpredictable as this film is absorbing to watch.",Unfaithful
12,evanston_dad,Unerotic and Unthrilling Erotic Thriller,5,4 August 2010,"What is Adrian Lyne's problem? Has he had one too many relationships go sour? In most real-life flings, the tryst ends with at most some choice swear words. In Lyne's movie flings, the tryst ends with death.Diane Lane was the comeback kid for her performance in this and scored an Academy Award nomination, which distracted everyone from the fact that this is a cheap, tawdry and not even very original thriller about a married woman getting it on with a younger and hotter man until her husband finds out.Like all of Lyne's movies, it takes place somewhere where it's always gray and rainy and the unmarried member of the adulterous couple lives in a decked out loft space.Grade: C",Unfaithful
13,ferguson-6,"red light, green light",6,17 May 2002,"Greetings again from the darkness.  So many glowing reviews of this film that I found to be extremely predictable and almost emotionless for such an emotional topic.  OK, the subject matter is handled in a slightly more realistic manner than is the Hollywood custom, but still no real surprises. Underrated Diane Lane does have some nice moments of disgust and regret, but the two male co-stars seem to be little more than decoration.  The little kid from ""Malcom in the Middle"" is there to make us believe that Gere and Lane have a wonderful family and life living in a dream home.  It is just difficult for me to believe anyone would throw away this perfect life for lust ... especially with time to ponder the move. And I am a GUY!  Director Adrian Lyne has quite a track record of showing the weak side of people.  I think he specializes in this because it is such an easy topic/target.  It is nice to see a movie written for the over 35 crowd.  Now if we could get just a bit more depth.",Unfaithful
14,anaconda-40658,No Faith in This Film.,5,9 June 2015,"Unfaithful (2002): Dir: Adrian Lyne / Cast: Richard Gere, Diane Lane, Oliver Martinez, Erik Per Sullivan, Michelle Monaghan: Painful yet well crafted film regarding unfaithfulness. Richard Gere and Diane Lane play a married couple whose marriage is threatened when she has an affair with a bookseller played by Oliver Martinez. Predictable and dark especially when murder factors. Even a visit from the police seems recycled and obvious. Adrian Lyne's films often address sexual consequence but the sex scenes seem more as a peep show. Better examples of his work are Indecent Proposal and 9 ½ Weeks but this is not one of his better films thanks to its emphasis on being a peep show. In the first the sexual tension is high but not shown. In the second it is displayed in multiple variety to back its subject matter. Here it just seems like an excuse to place two actors in hot sexual action. Gere and Lane deliver on frustration and guilt despite being props for a dim cliffhanger. Martinez is charming and seductive and ultimately too abrupt. Other roles play for convenience over purpose. As with most Lyne films, this one is well made in terms of locations and lighting but its message might have worked more effectively had the affair been less of a peep show and more about motives and consequence. As a result it is more about steamy sex than the consequences of infidelity. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Unfaithful
15,mm-39,One should be happy with what one has,7,17 May 2002,"Richard Gere never ages.  He seems to have a problem with his wives in movies; they do not fair very well.  I would not be surprised if this was a remake of a French film.  It had an European style to it.  Richard Gere plays the loving husband and Diane plays the wife that has too much time on her hands.  The reverse of fatal attraction.  A bit long.  When events spin out of control, it leads to a tragic fate.  This film is suspenseful which Richard is great at.  7/10",Unfaithful
16,Mr-Fusion,Worth a look for the train scene. But that's about it.,5,6 September 2016,"If I remember correctly, ""Unfaithful"" was a hit, and it was mostly due to the word of mouth regarding the sex scenes; ""steamy"" this and ""scandalous"" that. And I'm not sure if it's the passage of 14 years or that I'm not Adrian Lyne's target audience, but those scenes did nothing for me. Make no mistake, I enjoy looking at Diane Lane as much as the next guy, but . . . I dunno, maybe it's that French guy that killed the mood.I was surprised to come away from this with as much antipathy towards Lane's character, though. Wives get bored and look for excitement, I get it. But it's not like her husband was unappealing. It's little things like regifting his snow globe and twisting the facts when she's enjoying another man; She's not very sympathetic here. So yeah, I sided with Richard Gere in this movie, and it was kinda rough seeing him played as a cuckold.It's not a very good movie to begin with, but it dumbs way down in the third act, once the Keystone cops enter the picture and the thriller aspect kicks in. I kinda like that it all boils down to a single irrational moment in each spouse's life that turns everything upside down. But you'll find a lot more in the love scenes than in the actual characters. But it would be unfair to slag the movie without mentioning Diane Lane's scene of post-coital remorse. So many emotions in so little time; she really did give a great performance.5/10",Unfaithful
17,whpratt1,Haunting Film,7,24 July 2006,"This film had a great deal of locations in NYC, Grand Cental Station, and the lower section of Manhattan and a very depressing apartment dwelling, which was dark and dreary. However, Diane Lane,(Connie Sumner),""The Glass House"",'01 was married to Richard Gere,(Ed Sumner),""Bee Season"",'05, and they had a young son and lived in a very comfortable neighborhood and a doll house so to speak. Connie Sumner travels on a train into Manhattan one day and purchases various items for her son's birthday party and it is rather windy and she falls down and scrapes her knees and is helped by Oliver Martinez (Paul Martel),""Taking Lives"",'04. Paul Martel is a young French man who sells books for a living and is very charming to Connie and offers to give her some bandages and some wine to help her out. This story at this point sounds like the usual routine as we have seen many times before. This film can make you feel guilty and haunted and you actually get upset with the behavior that is created in this story. The real moral of this story is simply: ""What You Reap, You will Also SOW"" !",Unfaithful
18,namashi_1,A Superb Film...,8,25 July 2010,"Adapted from the French film 'La Femme infidèle' by Claude Chabrol, Adrian Lyne's 'Unfaithful' is a superb film, that exposes adultery to the optimum. Lyne who has earlier made films on the same genre, erotic sexual thrillers, brings a memorable thriller.I had seen 'Unfaithful' long ago, back in 2003/4, but then I was least interested in the film. But after watching the film after a long time, I Loved It! I matured as a cine-goer, and that's why I understood Lyne's execution. About a couple living in the suburbs of New York whose marriage goes dangerously awry when she indulges in an adulterous fling with a stranger she randomly encounters in Manhattan. This is the plot Lyne chooses to arouse, shake and break you once the film reaches it's finale.Sadly, The Sex Scenes in this film have been a major success, rather than the film. Sure the sequences are beautifully executed, but 'Unfaithful' is more than an adulterous fling! It's about the guilt, greed, and realization!Lyne's has directed the film brilliantly. Plus, his understanding to this complicated story is intact from start to end. Alvin Sargent & William Broyles Jr's adapted screenplay is another plus-point. Music by Jan A. P. Kaczmarek is perfect.In the acting department, Diane Lane is the life of 'Unfaithful'. The Cult-Star gives herself completely to the character and delivers, a memorable, sensitive performance. Undoubtedly, Her finest performance to date. Richard Gere is fantastic as the shattered husband. The veteran is subdued when needed, and historic when needed. A stellar performance! Olivier Martinez is superb. He oozes sexuality, and looks the part to the T. Erik Per Sullivan stands out as the couple's lone kid. On the whole, 'Unfaithful' is a superb film in all respects. Move over the Sex Scenes for a while, and watch this Masterstroke entirely! From this writer, Two Thumbs Up!",Unfaithful
19,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Well, there it is then",7,13 December 2004,"And then came Bonnie and Clyde, no just kidding. Um, ""Unfaithful"" was an interesting film. I had heard a lot about it, and while I was at Blockbuster, I remembered wanting to see it. The plot: Connie is a married woman, who seems like she's got it all. A loving husband and a wonderful son. When by accident in an alley she meets a very handsome french man, Paul. They start a steamy love affair, but Connie's husband, Edward, does find out. He confronts Paul and murders him, technically he's just out of his mind for the moment. The FBI investigates, obviously Connie is caught between all the lies with Edward. But I think they live happily ever after.Good movie, but I do not think they knew how to end it correctly.7/10",Unfaithful
20,=G=,All Lane,8,19 December 2002,"""Unfaithful"" tells of a happy suburban homemaker who has an extramarital affair with profound consequences. Although there's little new in this film (an affair is an affair is an affair), it does excel in art and technicals but it's Lane's world class performance which makes the 2+ hour run worthwhile. And, though there is some steamy sex, the film concentrates on the way the adultery reverberates through the family unit with ominous rumbling undercurrents until husband and wife find themselves squeezed mercilessly between the need for normalcy and the knowledge that it is impossible to regain. A slick and serious minded drama for mature adults worth a look. (B+)",Unfaithful
21,blanbrn,Winds of change start a love affair that causes guilt.,8,30 April 2006,"Unfaithful starts off in Windy New York City as Diane Lane on the busy streets getting blown into the arms of a sexy stranger, as time progresses she starts a hot and steamy love affair with this book keeping Frenchman. As this film goes on the affair starts to take a toll on her marriage and the guilt is felt, and only matters worsen when Richard Gere who plays the husband finds out only to deal with matters his own way, and things are back to normal. I take from this film a message that you should never fall for a stranger, especially when the wind blows you right into the arms of a person as seen in this films start. Not to mention Diane Lane gives a good erotic-sexy performance also, worth a watch.",Unfaithful
22,MovieAddict2016,Unheralded,10,24 March 2004,"What would you do if you found out that your spouse was having an affair outside of your marriage? Most likely what most people do when it happens to them -- go to marriage counseling or seek a nasty divorce. Edward (Richard Gere) does something different: he kills the man his wife is seeing and tries to cover up the crime. It is, in a way, the perfect murder -- no one else knew about the affair his wife was having, no evidence traced the victim to his killer. At least that is what Edward thinks as he rushes to attend his son's school play.Soon the irony starts and the tension builds. Edward gave his wife, Connie (Diane Lane), a snow globe as a present. She then gave it to her lover (Olivier Martinez). And when Edward finally confronts his wife's newfound boy toy prior to the killing, he sees the globe sitting near his bed. ""Where did you get this?"" he asks, before delivering a massive blow to the side of his enemy's face and inadvertently killing him with the glass ball.It's an accident. He didn't mean to kill the man and he didn't even mean to overreact. But as the reality of the affair bombards his senses, Edward literally collapses, sent into a spiraling downfall of vengeance and anger.It's Richard Gere's best performance -- ever. I'm not a fan of Gere, but he brings so much raw intensity and reality to his character here that it's hard to not realize his performance as one of the best of the decade thus far. Observe his facial features as he examines the bedroom of his wife's lover. Imagine yourself in his place and imagine yourself not reacting the exact same way.But Gere is also able to bring a touching sense of love and humanity to Edward. His affection for his wife is as clear as sparkling water, and the day she comes home after encountering her new boyfriend he suspects something is wrong. Watch Gere in this film and you'll soon find yourself reconsidering whether or not he's that bad of an actor. I know I did. And you actually empathize with him. This is the man whose films have made more money the more he has become naked on-screen; the man who is renowned for being a playboy hotshot and a sleazy celebrity pretty boy. But yet in ""Unfaithful,"" Gere abandons this self-made image, and plays a meek, nerdy family man living a modest life with a wife and a son. He wears glasses, lives an ordinary wife and actually respects his wife. His performance is spot-on and heartfelt, to say the least. I could have imagined almost anyone playing this role, except Gere. His performance is amazing.After killing Martinez and dumping the body in the back of his car, Edward takes the snow globe home. He places it on a shelf behind many other souvenir globes. Imagine Connie's surprise when she sees it there, and imagine the irony in the situation: they both know that they know each other's secret. Yet since they both are shameful of what they are done, they are too scared to confront each other, for fear of being accused of their own crimes.""Unfaithful"" is one of the most elegant and firmly constructed thrillers in years -- realistic, cruel, ironic, and irreverently erotic. It's not your standard-issue sleaze. It's not all heavy on sex and style like ""Basic Instinct"" and it's not pure stupidity, either. It's actually a thriller rooted in a touching story of marriage and faith, and everything else gradually follows thereafter.Like ""A Simple Plan,"" ""Bound"" and ""Fargo,"" ""Unfaithful"" is about one single event that suddenly causes a chain reaction of horrific ones. In ""A Simple Plan,"" the moment that Hank took the cash was the moment his life changed forever. The moment that Corky's plan proceeded forwards in ""Bound"" was the moment that all hell broke loose and everything went wrong. And the moment that Jerry Lundegaard sent those two bumbling idiots on their way to kidnap his wife and hold her ransom was the same moment in time that his life would begin to dramatically fall apart, almost overnight. And the moment that Edward strikes his wife's lover with a small glass snowball is the moment that both of their wives -- his own and his wife's -- change forever. I love these sorts of movies, the kind that take your average, innocent passersby and place them in an unfortunate chain reaction that leads to a major downfall in their lives. Why do I love these movies? I think for the same reason that has made them all so successful: we love to watch characters corrupt themselves and get caught in conspiracies where they are literally fighting to stay above water. The scene in ""Fargo"" where Jerry's plan falls apart all at once is a great example of this.This is Adrian Lynne's crowning achievement. It's glossy and masterfully, beautifully constructed. It's eerie and realistic and has a noticeably strong, yet strangely subtle, presence. I cannot imagine a more effective, sensitive and touching adaptation of this story that will surely hit close to home for many people out there. Even if it's not relative to your life, you will still find yourself deeply absorbed by the lead characters and their turmoil. ""Unfaithful"" has its flaws, but I find it hard to think of a more effective and beautiful thriller of its genre made within the past five years.4/5 stars. John Ulmer",Unfaithful
23,OllieSuave-007,Faithfully executed.,8,27 April 2014,"Diane Lane and Richard Gere star as New York suburban couple Connie and Ed Summer, who has a marriage that is seemingly wonderful until Connie engages in an adultery with a man he met on the streets named Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez).Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr. did a good job in writing a screenplay which I thought was provocative, yet thoughtful and mesmerizing, as the plot carefully details the tension and consequences of the aftermath of Connie committing adultery. Adrian Lyne did a good directing job in keeping the movie fresh and suspenseful, making the story eye-catching. Land, Gere and Martinez all did a find job in their roles, delivering some serious drama that showcase showcases each of their desires and vulnerabilities. The plot is slow at times and some of the love scenes are raunchy and crass. But overall, it's a fine piece of drama and mystery that is full of surprises and leads to an unpredictable climax.Grade B",Unfaithful
24,Lejink,Murderous affair,5,2 December 2011,"Another highly stylised and implausible thriller from Adrian Lyne. Like ""Fatal Attraction"", we're presented with another triangle, this time two men to one woman. Lyne is given ample opportunity to indulge his flair, if that's the right word, for graphic sex scenes, but of course, death takes a hand before the end and suddenly the triangle is lopsided.The film is beautifully shot in the New York autumn and is accompanied by an eclectic but atmospheric soundtrack. The acting too is good especially Diane Lane (and her body double) as the feckless housewife who trips, stumbles and falls, quite literally into the great passion of her life. Richard Gere supports well as the cuckolded husband, a turnabout from the days when he was young enough to play the gigolo type who seduces his wife. Albert Martinez completes the threesome as the charismatic young rake, with a different woman for each day of the week before his misdemeanours catch him up in the end.Given all of the above, the film still ultimately failed to really grab or move me. These are impossibly beautiful people in unlikely situations for whom I couldn't care whether they lived or died. Coincidence looms large in the scheme of things. Some of the leads' actions too are questionable too - would Gere's character really race to attend his son's Thankgiving play without dumping a dead body out of his car boot while Lyne somehow manages to contrive an almost happy ending out of the situation, which has to b ring too.As a movie, it's all surface and no depth, flashy but unengaging. You'll watch it and not feel a thing.",Unfaithful
25,gbill-74877,Steamy exploration of adultery,8,2 February 2019,"Diane Lane is incandescent in this film. Watching her is like staring into a dazzling, bright light, and then being somewhat blinded to everything else at the time, and even days later. She really puts herself out there, and in addition to her considerable charms, the film is a very good exploration into the destructive aspects of adultery. Her character seems to have it all - happiness, a good marriage and husband (Richard Gere), a child, affluence, a social circle, and a big house in the suburbs. It's by chance that she meets a young bookseller in the city (Olivier Martinez), and finds herself inexorably drawn to him. Her emotions run the gamut from guilt and shame to the thrill of intense passion and discovering someone new, and Lane does a good job conveying the conflict. We soon see the strain though, as trying to lead a double life results in unhappiness in both. She obsessively thinks of her lover while at home, and feels guilty over the betrayal and messing up her 'real life' while with him, for example, failing to pick her son up on time after school. We also see her become increasingly reckless and even degraded in the lengths her lust takes her to, with the last couple of scenes with Martinez standing out.The film has plenty of flaws, unfortunately. Some aspects are as overblown as that ludicrously intense wind that blows on the first day she meets her lover. It's practically a tornado, and while of course meaning to represent the wind of passion and fate blowing up out of nowhere, it's overdone by director Adrian Lyne. Richard Gere is reasonably good in the first half of the film, making me think this may be the best I've ever seen him (a pretty low bar), but he has some atrociously bad moments, including one in the darkened kitchen with Lane that shows his limited range. There are also points that strain credibility, not in how the love triangle plays out necessarily, but in the aftermath - but I won't spoil it by referring to the characters or specifics.There are moments of real tension sprinkled throughout the film, many of which you might imagine from the inevitable suspicion and the fear of getting caught. If you've ever been in one of these situations or been aware of one, it may resonate more with you, and you'll really feel the caution in the lines of her friend, ""Someone finds out, or someone falls in love, and it ends disastrously. They always end disastrously."" The film, on the other hand, ends pretty strongly. It's entertaining for sure, and gets rounded up a half tick because of Lane, who is so compelling.",Unfaithful
26,Irishchatter,Very good film but not the ending. .,7,6 December 2015,"I thought Diane Lane looked absolutely sexy at playing as a middle aged mum. The sex scene's were really beautiful and romantic like I say anyone could agree with me on this? Also Olivier Martinez looked very handsome too, I say a lot of young girls back in 2002 definitely wanted him badly after watching this film cause I suppose he was good looking then haha! This is only my guess now, I'm not really into him. I actually was really sad that his character got killed and they didn't put Richard Gere's character into jail in the end. That was kinda disappointing for me since this is a 2 hour film at the end of the day! That's why I wouldn't give this an Oscar. They should instead just have a few nominations and then, it would make this totally reasonable! The actors were good but I wouldn't go mental with the storyline to be honest....",Unfaithful

All the characters are excellent, and it has so many powerful scenes in it as well, plus Diane Lane and Richard Gere are simply incredible in this!. It kept surprising me and guessing throughout, and I thought Lane and Gere had wonderful chemistry together, plus this is extremely well made and written as well. While the ending was very good, it was just so sad and hard for me to take, and I hated Olivier Martinez and Dian Lane's character for the affair in this and giving Gere so much misery, plus I recognized Erik Per Sullivan from Malcolm In The middle as he really surprised me by giving a top notch performance as the kid!. Even though Gere did commit a murder and tried to hide the body he was just so incredibly likable I rooted for him to get away with it, as he had a reason for doing it, and it has some great erotic scenes as well, plus this may be the best performance I have seen Diane Lane give!.It's certainly not a fun film to watch, and I think this should be a lot higher then 6.5 in my opinion, plus all the characters were extremely likable except for Martinez's!. To be honest I Haven't seen a whole lot of Richard Gere but he impressed the hell out of me here, and it has some uncomfortable sex scenes as well, plus it gives a good message about affairs and what they can do to your marriage and your lives!. I loved the music in it as some of it was haunting, and it's also quite suspenseful at times as well, plus it also gets to you emotionally at times as well. I had pretty high expectations for this, and I must say it surpassed them actually, and some scenes really blew me away, plus I thought that hiding the body in he dumpster was rather dumb on the character's part. This is a depressing but fantastic thriller, that really leaves you thinking after you are done watching it, with a gripping story and incredible performances, and I say go see it now!.The Direction is fantastic!. Adrian Lyne does a fantastic! job here with wonderful camera work, excellent angles adding lots of great atmosphere and keeping the film suspenseful and at an extremely engrossing pace.The Acting is incredible!. Diane Lane is amazing as always and is incredible here, she is very likable but I hated her actions and what she did to Gere, she was also vulnerable, and really gave a powerful performance, and as I said i had mixed feelings for her character, still this is most likely the best performance I have seen her give! (Lane Rules!!!!!!!). Richard Gere is also incredible here, I felt so sorry for his character and what he went through, and even though murder is wrong I couldn't help but root for him to get away with it because he was just so incredibly likable, his scene where he confronts Martinez was especially impressive(Gere Rules!!). Olivier Martinez is fantastic as the guy who is having an affair I hated his guts for what he did to the family with the affair and he was also a sleaze ball, but he played his role brilliantly I'll give him that. Erik Per Sullivan is excellent as the kid he really surprised me. Rest of the cast are fine.Overall go see it now!. ***** out of 5",Unfaithful
28,tabuno,Overly Obvious and Caricature of a Drama,4,26 January 2019,"16 March 2003. It's really hard to separate Diane Lane's performance from this almost saccharine, overly cloying movie that broadcasts in the loudest terms possible a series of events that shout to be heard but leave a strange, bewildering flavor. This couple must be one of the dumbest husband and wife teams alive with the biggest misfortune of circumstances and odd coincidences to come along in a long time. The scriptwriters failed at their task of making a believeable, thoughtful movie about extra-marital affairs. And the ending is one of those leave it to the viewer to decide what happens kind of endings letting the movie off the hook of committing itself to sending any sort of message. Diane Lane's performance, thusly, is strangely difficult to judge. Her Oscar-nomination for best actress is confounded by a relatively limp character which doesn't even suggest and hint at the thoughts or desires leading up to her ultimate seduction. In fact there is more about the other gentlemen and photography from his perspective to suggest more about him than about Diane Lane. Diane seems to keep bumping into the wrong people at the wrong time. The other man seems just to ask for it, as dumb as he seemed to be about his predicament and it isn't really ever even explicitly demonstrated that the other man is really a cad or not. Overall this movie is a pretty much of a mess of obvious photographic shots that scream at you about what's going on or omitting crucial pieces of information. The strongest element of this movie is Diane Lane's performance in her role in the throes of sexual ecstasy. She captures a sensual waif who really offers up one of the best, non-pornographic performances about the thrill and excitement of sexual hunger and primal erotic passion caught on screen. Whether such a performance justifies her Oscar nomination is another matter. Four stars out of ten.",Unfaithful

31,bsmith5552,Dangerous Liaison!,7,21 December 2002,"""Unfaithful"" starts out with a seemingly happy family, the Sumners who appear to have it all. The husband Edward (Richard Gere) is a successful business man, the wife Connie (Diane Lane) a devoted wife and mother to son Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan). They live in a palatial estate in the suburbs complete with a Mercedes and a SUV parked in the driveway. Then one day while shopping in town (New York), Connie gets caught up in a wind storm and literally runs into a handsome young stranger named Paul Martel. Reluctant at first, Connie is gradually drawn into a passionate extramarital affair with him. Edward becomes increasingly suspicious and hires a private detective (Domenic Chianese) to follow Connie and determine if she is having an affair. He eventually finds out that his suspicions were true and goes to confront his wife's lover. The rest of the film deals with how the characters react to Edwards discovery of the affair. The ending is particularly good in that it leaves it to the audience to imagine the characters ultimate fate. Director Adrian Lyne gets superb performances from his cast. The beautiful Diane Lane is outstanding as Connie who has everything but takes a major risk in cheating on her husband. The scene on the train where she recalls her first sexual encounter with Paul is a masterpiece. Through facial expressions raging from guilt to pleasure, she recalls her earlier tryst. Gere, playing against type, plays Edward as an ordinary happily married man with no special qualities, whose life is suddenly and dramatically changed overnight. And Olivier Martinez is charming as Paul the young lover who seems to enjoy making love in odd places. I wouldn't be a bit surprised to see Lane and Gere's names included in the list of 2002 Oscar nominees.",Unfaithful
32,dee.reid,"I give ""Unfaithful"" a 7.",7,15 July 2003,"Now, I'm not into the whole ""erotic thriller"" genre of films that seems to have been popularized by Adrian Lyne.  I'm not a fan of Adrian Lyne but three of his films are stand-outs to me.  I saw his 1987 film ""Fatal Attraction"" and was blown away by it if not totally unnerved by the ending. His 1990 film ""Jacob's Ladder"" is what I saw to be a strange turn in Lyne's career by making a brilliantly crafted horror film, which I guess in a sense, is no different from any of his other films.  Now we are at last year's ""Unfaithful"".  At first even I had my doubts about this movie (as well as many others) but also like many others, was drawn to it by Diane Lane.  (I was further enticed after reading an article about her in Entertainment Weekly last year.)  I finally watched it last night on Cinemax for the first time.  This film to me doesn't really seem to be about adultery (as many people claim to be the central focus) but more about the choices we make and how they can have devastating consequences.  True that is what the title leads the viewer to believe it's about, but the adultery isn't the center theme.  Connie Summers (Academy Award-nominee Diane Lane) makes the choice of straying away from a happy suburban marriage to her husband Edward (Richard Gere) and into an affair with a charming Frenchman (Olivier Martinez).  The husband eventually begins to have his suspicions about his wife's daily activities and one thing leads to another.***SPOILERS***Diane Lane certainly gives the best performance of her career here.  As for the film itself, the ending like ""Fatal Attraction"", leaves the viewer with something to still be desired.  If Connie knew that her affair with Martel would eventually lead to his ""accidental"" murder at the hands of Edward, I would think that she would have chose to call it off.  We see later in the film after she finds out about his death, she begins to imagine herself had she not gone to his apartment on that fateful day.  Then Edward breaks the news to Connie that he was originally going to kill her; Martel was just an accident.  But he made the choice of going to Martel's apartment and talking with him and learning the devastating facts of his wife's affair with this total stranger.  Then he killed Martel and made the choice of not calling the police, cleaning up the apartment and disposing of his body in the dump.It's this ending that made me give ""Unfaithful"" a 7, instead of a 10.  I know that with the ending here we are supposed to use our imaginations and think they'll forget everything and things will go back to normal. But I unfortunately just cannot accept this ending because with the way the last 20 minutes builds up, it leads you to accept that something even worse is going to happen and doesn't.  In either case, that's what Lyne chose to do and I have to respect that decision.  The choices we make can have serious consequences and Lyne points that out ever so carefully with this film.",Unfaithful

Well I am sure director Adrian Lyne didn't have to think twice to do another infidelity film today . Cause he has done some good ones like `Fatal Attraction' from days of yesterday that were unfaithful too.
(Chorus) Cause you gotta see `Unfaithful' , you gotta see `Unfaithful'
(Second Verse) Baby! I know it had a steamy screenplay. Especially when Diane Lane was cheating her husband Richard Gere all day. I am sure he asked her please, please don't go away or else she is giving him the blues. Maybe! She would lie with every word she said, and Gere thought of better times of yesterday but now she is tied down to her new loverboy Olivier Martinez rules.
(Third Verse) Before the Oscars get set in motion, before they vote for something more, I hope they consider Diane Lane's performance and make a notion but I guess we will have to wait for what's in store.(Chorus) Cause you gotta see `Unfaithful', you gotta see `Unfaithful'.

34,MBunge,You've heard of romantic-comedy? This is romantic-horror.,7,25 May 2011,"I wonder how many people understand that Unfaithful is a horror movie. Not in the sense of a maniac with an axe and buckets of blood spewing everywhere, but in that it portrays the slow, inexorable and unexplained destruction of a family's happiness.Constance and Edward Sumner (Diane Lane and Richard Gere) should be a happily married couple. They're rich enough to own a huge house by a lake. They have a circle of interesting friends. They have a darling young son. They have a cute dog. They're both incredibly attractive and still appear to be attracted to each other. But one day, while Connie's running errands in the city during a wind storm, she meets a handsome book dealer named Paul Martel (Oliver Martinez). He's young and charmingly European and Connie finds herself drawn to him. They begin a torrid affair with Paul consuming more and more of Connie's thoughts and time. Eventually, Edward becomes suspicious and asks a private eye to follow his wife. He sees photos and Connie and Paul together and confronts Paul about the affair. What happens then changes Connie and Edward's lives forever.This is a very engrossing story, but it's not exactly light and frothy entertainment. This isn't a thriller where suspense is generated through some twisted little game between characters. The tension this film doesn't come from artifices of plot but from watching the pain of desperate people trapping themselves in terrible situations. There are no moments of melodrama in Unfaithful, no easy rationales or easier resolutions. This is very much a movie for adults to appreciate on an adult leveland that's not a reference to Diane Lane getting naked.Though she is unclothed and terrifically sexy in this film, Lane's performance is so powerful and real that her nudity isn't titillating or exploitive but simply a match to the raw emotions overwhelming Constance Sumner. In her first sexual encounter with Paul, Connie's body literally shakes in equal parts anticipation and apprehension. The pain and the fear she feels when the affair threatens her family almost visibly radiates off her face.Richard Gere matches Lane's work, but in a different way. Edward is a man disconnected from his deeper emotions. He only swims on the surface of himself and when something comes up from deep within, he can't control it. If Lane's Constance is like a quivering exposed nerve, Edward is a rumbling volcano that erupts uncontrollably.For his part, Oliver Martinez isn't a third wheel in this adulterous triangle. His Paul may be a cad, yet he's not bad. Paul is a thoughtless hedonist, but he doesn't want to cause anyone harm. He just never allows himself to dwell on the collateral damage of his romantic and sexual behavior. Martinez may look like one of those Euro-heartthrobs who pop up in Hollywood every few years and get drooled over by all women before disappearing again, but he shows a lot of acting talent and skill here.The reason why I call Unfaithful a horror movie is because it embraces the defining theme of the genre - it is about the normal world being assaulted and destroyed by The Other. In this case, though, The Other isn't Paul Martel. He's actually part of the normal world. The Other in this horror movie is the unthinking, uncontrollable desire that seethes through Connie Sumner. Some people may watch this film and think it's about a woman dealing with a neglectful husband and an unfulfilling life. But Edward isn't neglectful and while her life may be a bit more domestic than romantic, Connie isn't some Madame Bovary trapped in an empty existence. As I mentioned earlier, Connie should be happy with her life. She even seems happy with it, but she's still caught up by this unreasoning, unexplained impulse to betray her husband and imperil her family. The fear and anxiety of watching Connie and Edward's life inescapably implode comes from thinking that it can happen to any family at any time.Unfaithful is a romantic-horror movie. It's a pretty small genre, but even if this is the only one ever made, these filmmakers have made a worthwhile contribution to the world of cinema.",Unfaithful
35,Chris_Docker,Predictable Lyne-ish - minor twist on usual triangle skinflick,6,17 June 2002,"Richard Gere plays the devoted husband whose wife has an adulterous fling with a young Frenchman. Although there are some plot twists (the less you know the better  any luck you might not guess them, obvious as they are), the main factor that makes this film stand out is the fact that we have a man who is cheated on rather than the other way round. Given that the film doesn't aspire to much anyway, this is reasonably interesting perhaps  men and women lie in different ways and watching the facial expressions and excuses that guilty wife Connie Sumner comes out with can make interesting and familiar watching to any man who has ever been cheated on. Director Adrain Lyne (Flashdance, Nine and a Half Weeks, Fatal Attraction) comes out with a predictable amount of flesh, soft-focused and made aesthetically acceptable enough to female audiences (he spent years making TV ads!) whilst still offering lazy titillation to late night male viewers probably watching it with their girlfriends.",Unfaithful

But then I'd never buy a new satin slip and tiger stilettos for any man. While written and directed by men, this does give sweet revenge turn-around for those endless movies of older married men having affairs with much younger women. It's worth the price of admission to have a barely suppressed raging Richard Gere confront the lover with ""What are you, 28?""There are legions of Gere fans out there (I've already had a debate with a colleague on this) who are stupefied that Diane Lane would cheat on him and whether Olivier Martinez is more tempting (hell, yes, he is, even though in my 15 years of running a used book sale I never once encountered a used book dealer that looked like him). But I think the case is made quite visually that's she's a fragilized, overprotected, bored trophy in a gigantic mansion with little to do other than pick up after and feed her kid and husband. Lane is also absolutely magnificent and enthralling in conveying a woman caught up in a maelstrom of passion and risk-tempting, especially enhanced by editing that focuses first on foreplay and sensual recall, though the illicit relationship gets murky with unnecessary rough stuff.Those of us who have graduated from the ""Law and Order"" School of Criminal Justice (and there's many brief appearances in the film by New York actors who have taken courses there) will find some details in the plot that make the final cliffhanger somewhat unconvincing.This film may well serve to get quite a few suburbanites to hurriedly move back to the City to save their marriages and/or encourage the wife get a job.Very nice use of the Ali Farka Toure/Ry Cooder collaboration from ""Talking Timbuktu.""(originally written 5/19/2002)",Unfaithful

I really enjoyed the script and the well written dialogue between the characters too. The sexual scenes were well choreographed and beautifully shot, they were passionate and well acted. The actor that plays Paul was great too, I really enjoyed his performance here, he was mysterious, sexy, and had a dangerous eerie manner about him.

41,a_chinn,Possibly Diane Lane's best leading role is sadly not her best film,6,27 January 2018,"Diane Lane cheats on husband Richard Gere with hunky Olivier Martinez, hence the title of the film. Based on the much smarter Claude Chabrol film ""La Femme infidèle,"" this American remake directed by Adrian Lyne (""Indecent Proposal"" ""Fatal Attraction"") is slickly made, but lacking in any depth, outside of the dramatic sutuation. The film was adapted by Alvin Sargent, who's written everything from ""Paper Moon"" to ""Ordinary People"" to the recent Marvel Spider-Man films and also by William Broyles Jr. (Appollo 13"" and ""Flags of Our Fathers""), so you might have expected a better script, and Lyne is a director who's films are typically only as good as his scripts. The Chabrol film presented a routine marriage reinvigorated by the husband's murder of his wife's lover, but Lyne's film doesn't go anywhere that dark and ends on a rather ambiguous note. What ""Unfaithful"" does feature is an excellent performance by Diane Lane, who really carries the water for the film. Lane makes her character's choices and actions believable, elevating what could have easily been an empty-headed Zalman King ""Red Shoes Diaries"" type of softcore film to something more interesting. She makes her character's inner conflict palpable and pulls the audience into her character's justifications for her choices, right or wrong. Besides Lane, the film also benefits from a fine score by composer A.P. Kaczmarek and lush photography by Peter Biziou. Lyne is an interesting commercial director who poses interesting questions and situations in his films, but most lack the depth to be considered much beyond commercial entertainment (""Jacob's Ladder"" being the exception). Overall, this is a mediocre story that's vastly elevated by a strong performance by Lane. I may be biased in favor of this film because I've had a crush on Diane Lane ever since I was 11-years old and I saw her in ""Six Pack"" with Kenny Rogers.",Unfaithful

43,triple8,a powerful movie but ultimately very disappointing.,6,23 July 2006,"SPOILERS THROUGH:I would not call this movie great or terrible. It certainly is interesting and I suppose bold. But it's also a movie where, for me anyway, starts out close to excellent and gets worse as it goes along.I would have liked this a lot more if it had not gone the way of thriller/crime story. What was so interesting about it was the character interactions, the motivations and such. By making Gear's character murder Connie's lover it alters the focus of the film and it takes a step into Lifetime movie territory. It's a disappointing twist on what was(until that point) a genuinely compelling and engrossing film.I will admit that the movie does wrap one up in the lives of the main characters and it is almost impossible, at least for me, not to get caught up in the story. But from the very moment of the murder, the film's coarse is completely altered, the tone completely changed.The high degree of tension in watching Unfaithful is constant but strays away from the marriage itself and into the ""will he get away with it"" mode. How much more interesting would it have been to have the movie concentrate on a confrontation between Connie and Ed, maybe divorce plans, maybe marital therapy. It seems in EVERY movie such as this, inevitably someone gets killed. I think the movie would have been a lot more interesting overall to keep away from that avenue as it's been done and done.I also didn't think the confrontation between the two men seemed at all believable. Also something I didn't get is that some critics have said that the two main characters' marriage was normal, loving and that she just drifted into an affair for no reason. This is puzzling because I did not get the feeling that this was a perfect normal healthy relationship. Connie never seems to me to be happily in love, she seems almost dismissive of Ed. And Ed comes across as lonely and cut off from Connie. These two don't seem happy, they seem worlds apart. I would have liked the movie to stay on the subject of relationships and infidelity rather then turning Into a lifetime movie supreme.I will say that the two main performers were excellent, and that the movie is bold and provocative. It's a plus that the movie takes on the subject at all. And the ending and it's ambiguity, I must say, was very very powerful. Yet I was frustrated at the end of this and couldn't help thinking how interesting it would have been had the second half been altered, from the time Ed found out about the affair. I would have liked to see him go home and confront Connie and see how these two people ultimately resolved this. Ultimately I think Unfaithful is a dark, compelling, very sad movie that I'd rate slightly above average. My vote's 6 of 10.",Unfaithful
44,p-stepien,A marital cop out,5,2 December 2012,"When a seemingly satisfied housewife Connie Summer (Diane Lane) becomes maddenly enticed with a much younger antique book-dealer Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), she unwittingly falls into a full-fledged romance, losing herself in the adventure and lack of rules. Unbeknownst to her loving husband Ed (Richard Gere) she starts leading a double life, one that requires definite resolution, before the secret comes out.Director Adrian Lyne returns to what gave him his widespread fame: the issues of marital relationships and sexual desires. Featuring various forms of infidelity and its consequences in ""Indecent Proposal"" or ""Fatal Attraction"", Lyne ventures back into the underbelly of marriage. With limited success. Discarding the obvious focus is placed on female adultery. Here Diane Lane is captivating, turning from an ordinary housewife into a released lascivious sexual animal. Together with Oliver Martinez the tension lingers, creating a forceful sensuality, that carries the picture well.Build-up is where Adrian Lyne seems to work best, as he construes the misguided extramarital affair and slowly undercuts its repercussions on family life, ever more destructive when the circle of people aware of the situation widens, finally reaching reaching Ed's attention.However from then on in ""Unfaithful"" cop outs in a similar manner to that of ""Fatal Attraction"", however the latter only takes an easy misguided detour in the final resolution, whilst the former is skewed from half-way in. In a moment of crazed anger Ed confronts and reactively murders Paul Martel, hence taking away the weight of blame from Connie and introducing a much heavier burden of guilt, which takes the movie away from any sensible denouement. The reasons behind Connie's indiscretion are then discarded, glossed over, as she pieces together the fate of her lover and attempts in solidarity to protect her husband. The final confrontation is pointless having almost no emotional pull, steering itself down the cliff of 'I cheated on you, you murdered him, we're both guilty, so let's forget about it and love each other'. La-di-da...The ultimate question of whether or not Ed gives himself up to the police is utterly meaningless, used basically as a tool to give the movie some sense of closure. Essentially a movie unsure of whether it wants to be a thriller with little intent of commentary or a more deeply throughout analysis of infidelity. All the more fault is placed with an absolute lack of motivation behind the affair, apart from a lunging jump into lust, as Richard Gere's character is an almost idyllic husband.",Unfaithful

There was so little story to tell that it could have been a short. Wife messes around. Husband investigate, Husband confronts lover. Husband smashes lover's brains in with snow globe. Husband dumps body at a landfill. That story doesn't need two hours to tell.When his wife called her lover at his apartment leaving a message saying that she is ending the affair, it would have been funny if the husband had picked up the phone to tell her that was probably for the best since he had just smashed the guy's brains in with a snow globe.Lifting a dead body, especially one the size of the dead gigolo, would be almost impossible. To lift it over your head as he did in the elevator would take super-strength.It's stupid to think that the cops would investigate a grown man reported missing.

48,seymourblack-1,Storm Damage,8,17 September 2017,"Early on in this movie, there's a storm brewing and when it ends, we're left to consider the sheer devastation that it's left behind. The ""storm"" in this update of Claude Chabrol's ""La Femme Infidele"" (1969), takes the form of a steamy affair that so intoxicates a seemingly happily-married woman that she recklessly risks the privileged life that she has with her loving family so that she can indulge in all the excitement, thrills and danger that she experiences in her encounters with a handsome stranger. Despite some moments of guilt that she can't escape, she carries on relentlessly until her husband becomes aware of her betrayal and reacts in a way that neither he nor she could ever have imagined and in so doing, destroys any hope of either of them ever being truly happy again.Connie Sumner (Diane Lane) lives in a riverside mansion in the suburbs of New York City with her caring, good-humoured husband Edward (Richard Gere) and their 8-year-old son Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan). With a wealthy husband (who runs his own business) and a housekeeper, Connie doesn't need to be employed or to be at home too much and so spends her time shopping, socialising and fund-raising for charities. One day, when she's been shopping, she collides with a young man in a Manhattan street and grazes her knee. Because it's very stormy, the taxis are all full and she can't catch a cab to take her home. As the collision had happened just outside his home, Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) invites her up to his apartment where he makes her a drink and gives her an ice-pack and a Band Aid for her injured knee. Before she leaves, Paul, who's a book dealer, gives Connie a book of poems as a present.Connie finds it difficult to stop thinking about the good-looking young Frenchman who'd been so helpful and friendly during their meeting and so, when she finds his telephone number in her poetry book, she takes the opportunity to get in touch with him and this proves to be her first step on the road to becoming his lover. After they consummate their relationship, Connie feels incredibly exhilarated, turned-on and also rather guilty when she reflects on what's transpired. Inevitably though, Edward notices some changes in her behaviour at home and starts to become suspicious about what's made her become so distracted. He hires a private detective to follow her and is shocked by what the investigation unearths.Edward finds out where Paul lives and goes to see him at his apartment. Their meeting is conducted in a very calm and civilised fashion but during a moment of disorientation that Edward suffers as he consumes vodka and tries to come to terms with what's happened, he loses control for a moment and does something that proves to be absolutely devastating for him, Paul and Connie.""Unfaithful"" is compelling to watch because it illustrates how a woman who has everything that society deems to be important and desirable (i.e. wealth, a privileged lifestyle and a loving family), is willing to risk everything to satisfy her most basic needs. It's also a cautionary tale about the dreadful consequences that can follow on from adultery, sexual obsession and deceit.Adrian Lyne's treatment of this story lacks the tension, subtlety and sophistication of Claude Chabrol's version and instead focuses more on explicit sex scenes, some top-quality photography and the interesting use of symbolism at various points. Probably though, the movie's strongest feature is its cast and their impressive performances with Diane Lane and Richard Gere both superb in their lead roles and Olivier Martinez very naturally displaying the charm and flirtatiousness that made his character so irresistible to Connie.",Unfaithful
49,RNMorton,Who Cares?,6,28 December 2002,"Well-acted story about the effects of an affair gone bad on a married couple.  Only problem is - it's impossible to sympathize with either lead (Lane or Gere), as they both seem to be self-centered jerks.  The best way I can describe the lack of involvement is that my wife and I stopped the movie just before the key confrontation scene for fifteen minutes, to discuss how TV Guide On-line had the wrong description for the History Channel's Boys From Brazil.  My wife says it could be considered light, Lifetime-like entertainment, and says she feel sorry for Lane.  Whatever.",Unfaithful

Diane Lane IS an actress and deserved the nomination going through all those emotions and being able to make me feel what she was feeling. That is such a gift!Then there is the movie itself. Ya just wanted it to be a bit better. Some parts will keep ya interested, others will make you look at the back of your eyelids.Which takes me to the most interesting thing about this film. Stick with it. It has alot of holes and for the first hour I was thinking..""Oh a typical Lifetime Movie"", then it went in a direction I didn't see coming. The resolve could have been better, but this film may not be as HORRIBLE as many peg it to be.The tone of the film also needed work. After it was over I thought, if Adrian Lyne filmed this in back and white, set the characters and story to the 30's/40's or maybe even the early 50's..this might have been an interesting piece of work. Being Contemporary with a very boring (at least to me) guy Ms. Lane is having the affair with, make the piece snoozy.
If it's a rainy day, you're by yourself and have nothing to watch, (meaning you've seen ""The Elizabeth Broderick Story"" parts one and two on Lifetime TV enough times) and feeling kinda gloomy, this may be the film for ya.Not a bad or horrible film...it's just...okay.",Unfaithful

The acting by Richard Gere is some of his best work in a long time, but the tour deforce performance in he movie belongs to Diane Lane. Lane gives an Oscar worthy performace as the wife of Gere.

I was so engrossed in the plot that I didn't have time to judge artistic value.  I was glued to my seat from start to finish.  This is sassy, sexy thriller that delivers the goods and then some.  But the actors make it work.  The chemistry between each of the characters is electric. 
Though Richard Gere gets star billing, it's the beautiful Diane Lane who has the most screen time.  I'm always delighted to see her beautiful face on screen, but this is her most powerful performance up-to-date.  Newcomer Olivier Martinez shows great charisma.  He is a very talented actor, and if he goes on with his career in American movies, he can become the next Antionio Banderas.  I swear, there were moments in the film where even I felt charmed by him.  Richard Gere hasn't had a successful movie in years, and hopefully he'll get back on the ball with ""Unfaithful.""  He delivers a fine, subtle performance and though I may be out on a limb, I'll say it's one of his best.  I haven't seen any of Adrian Lyne's past work, but I know he's an acclaimed director and now that I've seen this film, I'm curious to check out ""Fatal Attraction"" and his other past films.  He definitely knows how to set the tone.  The scenes have a cohesive rhythm, and I even spotted moments of symbolism.

The first 90 minutes of UNFAITHFUL unfold at the first speed. The last 30+ minutes unfold at the second.How director Adrian Lynne managed to assemble this many fine performances (Richard Gere, Diane Lane, Olivier Martinez, Erik Per Sullivan, Margaret Colin and Kate Burton), and enough nudity and hot sex for the SPICE channel and STILL manage to make a dull movie is beyond me.  Certainly the script peters out after 90 minutes, but that doesn't fully explain the overall slack pacing.One piece of advice to the writers: Diane Lane has great tits and legs, but she's also looks a little frazzled. Don't have an older, prettier, more glamourous and YOUNGER LOOKING actress as is Margaret Colin tell Lane how great she looks.  UNFAITHFUL is a 6 for the acting (and, maybe the sex) only.

Of course, it would have been more realistic for Gere's character to have immediately come clean, but the story had to continue on for another few drawn out scenes. The one character in the film that just did not fit in was the kid. Just could not come to grips with the genetics of a Lane and Gere winding up there.

Diane Lane (who looks strikingly like Tuesday Weld in some of her shots) provides a believable center for the proceedings, although the pivotal literally-swept-into-another-man's-arms scene felt more than a shade contrived.   (Plus I grew up in NYC, and I've never experienced that sort of gale force wind in all the years I lived there.) But Gere and Lane are good together, with many moments of unspoken subtlety passing between them. Lyne is remarkably restrained here - none of the hystrionics of, say, Lolita's climactic scene (which actually holds up, thanks to Jeremy Irons' and Frank Langella's superb talents), and it works to his advantage very well. The film IS predictable, though, in that it does break down into three obvious acts - girl meets another boy, girl sneaks around to be with this other boy, hubby finds out and goes ballistic with tragic consequences.  But it does play out in an intelligent and thoughtful manner, which counts for something in my book.",Unfaithful
58,MihaiSorinToma,An interesting idea which loses interest half way,5,4 September 2017,"An apparently happy and complete family with a child is about to face its biggest challenge yet when the mother stumbles upon a charming stranger to whom she is attracted. Slowly, their relationship begins to dangerously evolve, obviously pleasure-wise, while the husband becomes more and more suspicious. Their whole marriage will be put to the test multiple times but will it actually hold up, regardless of the infidelity?It's a movie which, as its title suggests, presents an unfaithful wife which falls for a complete stranger while her family is increasingly neglected. The plot is pretty straightforward, with a brief presentation of the family, then suddenly moves to the cheating part, presented with great detail and sensuality. It keeps it this way until about half of its length, when it changes the course of events with a very unexpected twist, which alters the course of events dramatically, bringing much amazement, but not in a good way. From there, everything becomes a true torture for the characters, but also for the viewer, which is forced to watch their destroyed lives struggle more and more until the moment when everything is revealed.I have to tell that while I liked the first half, although it has a pretty inexplicable intrigue, but the second one was completely wrong on so many levels. From the moment of the twist, which is as wow as it is mind boggling, everything falls to pieces, both in terms of story and viewer likeness. The characters tend to undertake a series of head-scratching decision, which ultimately leads to a very unsatisfying finale which doesn't bring anything good. It leaves everything sort of hanging, allowing the viewer to imagine the actual ending, fact which I dislike. The characters, while well described and developed, tend to do inexplicable actions which alter the course of events, the biggest one being the one from the intrigue. From the little that was presented in the beginning, the wife had absolutely no reason to betray her husband, who seemed determined to do anything for their family. Add to the equation the event from the twist and you end up with a spoiled plot which apparently doesn't lead anywhere and seems to have no consequences whatsoever. It became boring and predictable, facts which are unacceptable in this type of movie.Overall, I consider this film a missed opportunity. It presents an interesting idea with which its starts and which it develops, but it manages to spoil everything with a couple of stupid decisions which, to make it even worse, do not bring any consequences. It had good actors and sensual moments which made the first part quite enjoyable, but the second one was almost unbearable, making it a below-average movie which can be easily skipped.",Unfaithful
59,Pedro_H,Why you should never pay the-wages-of-sin with a credit card!,7,28 October 2004,"*Spoilers sign posted*A seemingly happy middle class family home is thrown in to chaos when the wife has an affair with a younger man.I can now claim to have seen all of Adrian Lyns's movies and while admitting that he has never quite hit the heights, they are all watchable. Even his teen melodrama debut, Foxes, which probably influenced quite a bit of trashy US TV.The only thing I don't like about him is that he seems a bit too influenced by soft-porn, which he thinks becomes all arty if he photographs it in natural light!Before viewing this I thought this was going to another wages-of-sin epic and came with a heavy heart, but I was quietly surprised. The handling of the production and the quality of the acting kept me on-board and asking questions to the very end. A bit of over melodramatic it may be, but very - in outline principle - believable. Richard Gere is actually not that great an actor, but he is ageing well. He looks as good as ever with a bit of grey and glasses, an improvement even. But sadly I have never seen him be great in anything - although he was good in the mostly unseen Days of Heaven.Here he gives us another of his keep-it-all-inside performances.I had to decide whether to write a spoiler review or a non spoiler review. I normally only like to do non-spoiler reviews unless there is something important that I want to say. Here spoilers are the most important thing.*Spoiler Starts*Here Gere is a killer - a hot blooded killer, rather than a cold blooded killer - but also an intelligent man. He runs a company and knows how the world turns. Panic or no panic, we have to believe that he is - in turns - both clever and a Dumbo. Why would a smart guy wrap a body in a carpet, cover it in tape and take it to the local dump? Doesn't he watch any mob movies? A body either has to be dumped in running water, buried or chopped up. People scavenge dumps all the time and people work there - they are going to ask questions why a carpet is taped like that and misshaped. Stands to reason!Equally why leave incriminating evidence that he knows for certain that his wife is having an affair in his clothes? Why would he want to keep evidence like that? It is like a newspaper, you read it, get the information from it and throw it away. What do you gain by keeping it long after the fact? Or has he forgotten he had it?Not only does he not watch The Sopranos, he also doesn't watch the Discovery Channel either, because he would learn that is impossible to go anywhere without leaving traces of yourself behind: Hair, skin, tissue samples, fingerprints, DNA, you are a walking paper trail. The police scientists would have the technology to realize in five minutes that this was a crime scene and that blood had been cleaned from the floor. Look at any number of real life cases on the Internet if you want to find out more. Sorry readers, if you plan to kill someone and get away with it you better be smarter than anyone on display here. Technology has gone up a notch since La Femme Infidele - of which this is a remake - was made in 1969.(Some reviewers seem to read that the cops where on his trail - using the technology above - but hadn't got around to arresting him. An interest premise that is impossible to discount.)Good acting and even an Oscar nomination for ""unfaithful"" Diane Lane. Maybe she is better than her track record suggests, but she has been in a awful lot of movies that have passed before my eyes - without making any mental impression on me. Although, to be fair, most were support roles.Her actions rather reminds me of the joke about the Pope giving Catholics permission to have sex on a Sunday ""as long as you don't enjoy it."" Here you can have adulterous sex as long as you feel bad about it afterwards and go through a lot of self-recriminations. Before returning for a touch of second helpings!*Spoiler Ends*This is a very watchable film and one that I am happy to recommend. It had something to say and a was stylish when saying it. However it occurred to me that films like this wouldn't get made without it having a shock-horror centre. This is a bit sad. I think it would have been just as good without it and just let it explore what adultery does to the insides of possessive people.",Unfaithful

The story is not new, but the approach by the actors and writers brings depth. There is no clear bad guy. The lover played by Oliver Martinez even escapes the normal evil other man thoughts. I was surprised to see him killed. I liked him a little. Diane Lane comes across as a vibrant woman who rediscovers or possibly discovers a strong sexual impulse in herself. The first sex scene and subsequent train ride display the breaking of her rules and the glee received by it. The look on Diane Lane's face in the last sex scene in the hallway as she begs Oliver to f**k her reveals the helplessness she has fallen to. Richard Gere finally showed me why he is famous in 2002. He starred in Chicago and Unfaithful, succeeding in both to show a talent in him that I had never seen before. His wronged husband in Unfaithful shows why the quiet ones should never be underestimated. The scene where he reveals to Diane Lane that he wanted to kill her instead of her lover shocked me. This is a couple that others in the movie aspire to be more like. The two leads drive this movie in the right direction with the help of Adrian Lyne. He bounces back from the creepy, hollow Lolita with a keeper. A good movie to pair up with Adrian Lyne's Fatal Attraction (1987) to compare the two.",Unfaithful

Uncertain at first, she relents and climbs the stairs and enters his world of books. The conversation is general. The chemistry is simmering.Diane Lane as Connie is certainly the winner in this film. She is able to portray a whole range of emotions, her excitement, her anticipation, her guilt and changing attitudes in a way that sweeps you along in the dramatic turn of events. Nervous at first in entering a stranger's apartment, she quickly departs and returns home to her husband Edward (Richard Gere) and Charlie her young son.It's amazing how a single decision can change the course of one's life. Connie makes frequent calls to the book seller, not to buy his books but to enjoy his exciting company. Olivier Martinez with his soft French accent and smoldering smile is a real charmer. What woman would not yield to such a man? Yet Connie knows full well she is cheating on her husband. The guilt is written all over her face. It is these mixed emotions that Diane Lane can so capably project.The husband's discovery of his wife's affair with this young book seller explodes into violent drama. Subsequent scenes with police investigators have both the husband and wife telling lies to cover up their respective activities at the book seller's.I felt there were a few weak points in the plot. The wife seemed to me to forgive her husband's violent crime too easily. Also the body wrapped in a floor rug seemed too small and too light and too easily carried.Various reviewers argue about who was really responsible for the whole mess. I think without doubt Connie was fully to blame. She made the wrong decision in the first place. This is admirably confirmed in the later fantasy sequence where she says ""No"" to the book seller when he invites her in. Also the husband blamed the wife not the young Frenchman. However Connie's wrong decision was followed by multiple visits to his apartment. Paul gave her what she wanted and she continued to be mesmerized by his ardent attention.A worthy production not to be missed.",Unfaithful
63,Isaac5855,Adrian Lyne looks at infidelity from another perspective....,8,16 August 2006,"Adrian Lyne, the director who scared a lot of men out of cheating on their wives with his 1987 classic FATAL ATTRACTION, takes another look at infidelity in UNFAITHFUL, a dark and sexy drama about a suburban housewife (Diane Lane) who despite a perfect life with a devoted husband (Richard Gere)and loving son (Erik Per Sullivan) finds herself drifting into an affair with a sexy young book dealer (Olivier Martinez) who she meets accidentally in the city one day. Unlike FATAL ATTRACTION'S Dan Gallagher, Lane's Connie does not really go looking for this affair but finds herself inexplicably drawn to this man. Unlike Dan Gallagher, who immediately tries to end the tryst, Connie becomes completely consumed with thoughts of this man, that drive her to, among other things, public masturbation and sex in the hallway of his apartment. Their first sexual encounter so brilliantly illustrates the conflict in Connie's mind because the whole time he is undressing her and touching and caressing her, she is in tears, but she doesn't stop him either. But once Gere's husband learns of the affair, the story takes some surprising turns. This is a riveting drama anchored by Lyne's undeniable eye for what is erotic on the silver screen and a superb performance from Diane Lane, which earned the actress her first Oscar nomination. Gere is solid as the bewildered husband and Martinez is a dark and sexy leading man. The movie also features supporting bits from Chad Lowe, Margaret Colin, and Kate Burton, but it is Lyne's masterful direction and Lane's performance that are really the stars here.

64,lawprof,Rashkolnikov et ux in Ardsley,5,15 May 2002,"WARNING-IRREVERENT REVIEW of ""UNFAITHFUL""To borrow from Oscar Wilde it would take a man/woman with a heart of stone to watch the unfolding marital drama of Connie (Diane Lane) and Ed (Richard Gere) and not laugh.Here we have a beautiful, mid-thirtyish, smart Westchester County (N.Y.) housewife married to the owner of a company that does something (legal) with fleets of armored cars.  We see enough of him at work to know he's tough, committed, savvy.  But he's not chained to the office.  He's an involved parent and a loving hubby easily aroused by his wife. Their kid, Charlie (Erik per Sullivan) is so realistically around eight-years-old that I wondered if they bothered giving him a script.So what does this bright woman do with her time?  She hunts for items for charity events and hits on acquaintances for donations.  On a sunny but very windy day her trek for dreck brings her into Manhattan.  I've seen days that windy here but usually with a hurricane.  This one ain't believable but so what?The wind (instead of the syrupy music that accompanies married woman meets un-suave European dirtbag that great song, ""They Call the Wind Maria,"" would have been a terrific choice) blows Connie into the arms, then into the apartment, then later into the bed of this guy, Paul Martel (was his name yet another shameless cinematic commercial plug?). Well, it isn't windy every time she goes to see him but you get the idea. Martel is well and greasily played by Oliver Martinez. The only redeeming feature of their torrid lovemaking for me is that this guy's place is just like mine - books absolutely everywhere.  But not anyone like Diane Lane. :(What follows is not ""Fatal Attraction,"" it's very well acted Immature Distraction.  The gal from Ardsley gets super-O's from the book dealer but there's no indication she was suffering from coital neglect back at the ranch.  Is she just bored?  Has she no values?  Does she really yearn to live again in Manhattan (a subtle sub-plot.  Very subtle.)?Richard Gere and Diane Lane ARE outstanding.  Much more so than the story. Some commentators have opined that ""Unfaithful"" is yet another snipe at suburbia.  Maybe it is:  can the truth be told too many times? What is gloriously clear (and true in my biased opinion) is that the Manhattan scenes convey a heck of a lot more life than those shot in the arid but affluent suburb where much of the film was filmed.Acting: 8/10.  Story:  4/10.",Unfaithful

I really liked that they made Richard Gere out to be a perfect husband and a very loving husband.  You really feel for his character when he finds out about the affair.  I thought Diane Lane did a great job as always and looks better than ever, she is one gorgeous woman.  I thought Oliver Martinez did a good job too, I'd never heard of him till seeing this film.There are a few things in the film that didn't sit well with me, but they were so minor that it's not worth talking about.  And the scenes that I did like made up for it.  There is one scene in particular that I just loved. If you've already seen the film, it's the scene after Richard Gere finds out about the affair.  Also the ending is very interesting, I won't say it's bad or it's good, but interesting.  You'll see what I mean when you see the film.I will warn you though, there are some pretty intense/graphic sex scenes in this film, so be careful who you see this film with.  I'm just saying that you may feel uncomfortable watching these scenes with certain people sitting right next to you.All in all, I thought it was a very interesting movie, and the story was told quite well.  I'm not sure if I liked this film better than ""Fatal Attraction"", but you can tell it's the work of the same director.  I hope you like the film as much as I did.  Thanks for reading.-Chris",Unfaithful
66,OriginalMovieBuff21,A solid film with a unique thriller,8,8 October 2004,"Unfaithful is an exciting film about a married wife who runs into a French librarian and starts having an affair with him while her real husband starts becoming suspicious. I don't know how people can call this movie a forgettable film I actually can't call it that. I thought it was well done and well directed with good performances. The thriller that is added to this movie is excellent and the ending is a big twist. The sex scenes also were good especially the frenchman and Diane Lane in the restroom having sex. That's a good sex scene. Overall, the film was very solid with good moments. I recommend this film. Hedeen's outlook: 7.5/10 *** B-",Unfaithful
67,caa821,Entertaining,8,27 January 2007,"We can watch films to view the ""message"" of their stories, and muse at length about the characters, their motivations, the consequences which result, etc., etc. --- but we also watch to be entertained, whether the film is escapist, outrageous science-fiction, humorous (whether over-the-top or subtle), a mystery/whodunit, or (like this film) romantic, with both dark and engaging moments.As one of the latter, Diane Lane's performance is perfectly sensual and seductive, and she also portrays the ""dutiful"" wife and mother when called-for.Richard Gere is excellent, as the assertively-successful businessman, yet thoroughly phlegmatic in his response to his wife's infidelity. This is a complete counterpoint to the type of macho character he has usually portrayed.Olivier Martines is perfect as the precise type of handsome, romantic, somewhat bohemian type, with whom an upper-class, suburban housewife like Lane would become enthralled.As some others have maintained, I feel the Gere character would have been less reclusive in hiding his suspicions and doubts than was shown in the film --- despite the logical, compelling arguments as to how the types of marital infidelities are handled differently by the betrayed husband versus the betrayed wife.But, again, it is an excellent piece of entertainment, a prime (if not sole) reason we view a film or play.",Unfaithful
68,EmperorNortonII,A Study of Adultery,4,19 February 2005,"""Unfaithful"" is a remake of the French movie ""Une Femme Infidele."" The story follows Connie Sumner, played by Diane Lane, as a wife and mother who finds the spark gone from her marriage. Then, one windy day in the city, she runs into Paul Martel, a charming French bookseller played by Olivier Martinez. This leads to a torrid love affair, and ultimately, an act of desperation by her husband, Edward, played by Richard Gere. The story ponders many questions, about loyalty, and if an extramarital affair is so wrong. Diane Lane puts in a fine performance, saying much in her facial expressions, and Richard Gere plays the part of the cuckolded husband adequately. In the end, this love story gone wrong will break your heart.",Unfaithful
69,shark-43,"Like The Lovers' Bed, Messy...",6,15 May 2002,"This film was well made and it had some powerful scenes. In fact, the opening scenes totally set up the family - you know Gere, Lane and their son and their ""idyllic"" life. Lyne knows how to shoot a scene but he can never shake his old ""commercial"" sensibilities. The windstorm looked so fake, so created it was almost comical and I lived in Lower Manhattan for years and they CAN happen, when a storm comes in off the Hudson and the way the high-rises create these wind tunnels - the wind can get THAT strong, but it just went on and on and Lyne adds steam so much because he likes the LOOK. But the ""look"" starts to distract from the story. *******SPOILERS HERE ON IN**********SPOILERS*******: There were some nice twists and turns and actually when Gere goes to the apt. to confront the lover and starts feeling sick and his vision gets blurry, at first I thought maybe the lover had poisoned Gere's drink (which i thought would have been a nice trick) but for Gere to be feeling ""sick"" and then attack him the way he did - I don't know. The movie seemed to fall apart after that. I mean, could Lyne have made a landfill look more elegant and dramatic and nicely lit?? Please. I will give Lane credit though - she gives a marvelous performance and I have never been a fan of her acting. So - there are peaks and valleys in this film and I like that it ended up being a morality play - could one go on with their life knowing what they did? In many ways, Changing Lanes asked the same thing and I give Hollywood credit for even making movies that ask such adult questions - I just wish the movies had turned out better.",Unfaithful
70,Spanner-2,"Lane is good, film is weak",5,13 May 2002,"This drama from director Adrian Lyne (""Fatal Attraction"") features happily married Diane Lane (who essayed similar territory in the more entertaining ""Walk on the Moon"") suddenly having an affair with Oliver Martinez, who plays one of those rare book dealer studs whom only exist in bad romance novels and movies like this. Of course once her kindof anoying husband (Richard Gere, only slightly less anoying than in his other recent films) gets wind of the action, he does some bad things that he later regrets. While the film does keep you involved for the most part, until it really starts to drag in the last section, it doesnt quite work. Lane's work is good and shows that she should be getting better parts, but the story is rather dumb and it doesnt quite work. GRADE: C",Unfaithful
71,iohefy-2,Excellent Acting - Predictable Story,6,9 May 2002,"This movie had excellent acting by all concerned, especially Diane Lane. The story was drawn out and the story was very predictable, and the ending was a bad one.  The criminal got away with murder, and the cops once again were the bafoons.  Wait for the video rental and save a couple of bucks.",Unfaithful
72,chrisbrown6453,"Director Adrian Lyne revisits a classic formula, a thriller based on the most successfully compelling elements of human nature.",6,18 June 2002,"A film grounded in familiar circumstances, it doesn't really attempt an original spin, but it does milk the effective elements for all their worth. It takes what works to the next level, and if Unfaithful is anything, it's probably the one of its kind that pulls the fewest punches. For a movie to succeed, without the advantage of being something new and original, it's really got to go the extra mile. That much was accomplished in many ways, and that's why there is mostly positive reaction to Unfaithful. It is, for the most part, a movie that keeps your attention by slapping you in the face just often enough. The movie is effectively in the hands of Diane Lane for the most part, and she pulls it off well. Not until later in the film do we spend close to equal time with the other main characters, so it is her that keeps our interest. Her lover, the French book dealing gentleman who sweeps her off her feet, is the one element that could threaten to strip some credibility from the film, but he doesn't. His performance in the film is solid, and much better than it appears in the trailers, where alternate takes of scenes were used. Yeah, the delivery you'll see in those trailers sounds unappealing, but it is a combination of both material that wasn't used, and the way it was cut together for the previews that makes it that way. In the film, the characters are effective and quite memorable. What was most impressive by the end is Richard Gere's performance. Adrian Lyne was able to work with Gere to create an emotional performance from a character very effectively, and efficiently. Gere's screen time really doesn't compare to Lane's until quite awhile into the film. The only real downside to Unfaithful, and the only thing will keep some seats empty, is hard to avoid. Many have already made up their mind and they are right to notice that this is not an original concept. It's a common thing these days, to have films that are very closely based on an already successful formula. This year more than ever, there are some really good, solid films out there that are heads and shoulders above so many others, but also very similar to those same pictures. Unfaithful is like that, similar to many movies that any seasoned viewer has already seen, but it really is good despite that. The reason Unfaithful overcomes the challenge of winning us over, despite having such a recognizable face, is basically to go farther than its predecessors. It's pretty graphic at times, and doesn't stop short of becoming uncomfortable at times, in a way that serves the story. Unfaithful works because it so effectively captures the emotion of the cheating wife, the suspicious and ultimately crushed husband, and... that French guy. The feelings the characters experience are so palatable we feel for them, for good or bad. For the most part, there are no completely sympathetic characters in the film, which perhaps makes them more believable, and the story more realistic. So it works, and works well. Enhanced by a style of directing both fresh and varied throughout the movie (Lyne shows great range in this single film, using different styles as the story takes a new direction at several points), Unfaithful will not let you down; especially recommended for anyone who hasn't seen very many thrillers out there. There are plenty you can skip in favor of this one, and anyone who doubts that should give it a shot. Adrian Lyne has managed to capture exactly what was required to pull it off, making Unfaithful another notch on a belt he should be proud to wear.",Unfaithful
73,Li_85,Good movie..with great acting,7,13 June 2006,"Unfaithful is more of a serious drama, then a erotic movie. I think it has a great realistic storyline for a change. I personally know a few girls in similar situations as Diane Lane. Diane Lane gave the BEst performance of her career in this movie. She plays a mother and housewife, but still looks very sexy. Richard Gere gave a decent performance as the husband who finds out about his wife. Oliveir Martinez plays the guy that starts the affair in a average role. The DVD has some deleted scenes which are quite funny. One particular scene is in the Cinema, Where Diane and Oliveir are love making, while watching the movie. The Sex scene have been directed quite nicely. Especially the scene in the hallway, a bit of yes and no. I think Unfaithful is one of the sexiest movies of all time.",Unfaithful
74,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Surprisingly deep and impeccably acted.,8,9 January 2012,"In 1987, Adrian Lyne brought us Fatal Attraction, an sensually charged cautionary tale to any man thinking of flirting with disaster in the form of the attractive blonde he meets by chance. He practically invented the modern erotic thriller with that work of genius and fifteen years later he released Unfaithful, yet another domestic story of a married adult straying, except this time it's the woman who ends up in the bed of an attractive stranger.Since Attraction there have been a myriad of attempts to recapture the combination of thrills, suspense and eroticism that Lyne was able to achieve but, with the rare exception, they failed to bring out the urgency and seriousness of his tone and instead fell into a parody of sorts. We began slowly but after a while it just became the same situation recycled over and over again; the loveless marriage, the bastard husband or nagging wife, the obsessive spouse -- it got to a point where when you see a poster like the one for this film, with star Diane Lane sprawled over her lover's bare chest while Richard Gere looms above her, you already know what you are going to be getting.Unfaithful once again proves that this is the genre where Lyne thrives because he breaks down a lot of the traditional moves that have become standard. The marriage between Lane and Gere isn't stale or aggressive; they are in a healthy and loving marriage. Her new sexual companion, played by Olivier Martinez, doesn't demand that she leave her husband or insist on stalking her about, he's actually a little suspiciously casual about their romance. This is a film that becomes more about the things that it doesn't say than what it does. What compels this seemingly content woman to jump into the bed of another man? What knowledge of her activities is her husband hiding under his stoic gaze? These questions are helped with tremendous skill by it's two lead actors, Lane and Gere both delivering a quality of work that I honestly had no idea they were capable of. Lane operates on so many levels here, from slinky eroticism to household mother to guilt-ridden betrayer and she sinks into this role so thoroughly that there is never a moment where she feels as though she's phoning it in. Gere gives a work of wildly internal talent, equal parts vulnerable, mysterious, intimidating and wounded. There's a confrontation scene with him where he goes through about ten different extremes in a five minute time frame and it honestly blew me away how well he pulled it off. He is devastating here.Unfaithful builds the suspense wonderfully until a shattering climax a little over the halfway mark that takes the whole thing into a new and remarkable territory. Here it becomes more than just an intriguing look into the modern marriage and a dissection of both sides of infidelity. In it's second half it turns into a complex study of human behavior, digging deep into themes of guilt and violence. The erotic scenes are very charged, as expected from Lyne, but it's the softer ones that end up leaving the strongest impression, down to the absolutely incredible final shot that is going to stick with me for a while. It's one of those shots that fully captures everything a film is trying to say, without beating you over the head with it as if you're too stupid to understand.",Unfaithful
75,bix171,Yada Yada Yada,4,6 January 2003,"Back in the day, you could count on Adrian Lyne to deliver slickly titillating treatises on the perils of women, whether it be the naive heroine of `9 ½ Weeks' or the gullible homemaker of `Indecent Proposal' all the way to the desperate shrew of `Fatal Attraction'. But nowadays, Lyne's mining of the territory seems outdated and empty and with `Unfaithful' he's delivered the R-rated equivalent of a made-for-Lifetime movie. Diane Lane, trying to play against her good-girl image (she seems to have taken the role strictly for the notoriety), stars as a housewife who falls under the sway of a hunky French book dealer (Olivier Martinez) and must suffer the wrath of her husband's retribution. (Richard Gere plays her spouse and he's terrible as usual--as an actor, he doesn't think, he just reacts.) Based on a film by Claude Chabrol (`La Femme Infidele', unseen), Lyne does allow for some steamier sex scenes than he's provided in his other pictures but they're diminished by his moral branding of the events; with Lane's perceived lack of any motivation other than lust in succumbing to her affair, everything is smugly but loudly labeled `Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!' so that the audience can feel the same sense of superiority the director does--he seems to have no sympathy for her whatsoever. Though `Unfaithful' has a graceful, distinctive look to it (it's shot by Peter Biziou, who filmed `Time Bandits' and `Pink Floyd The Wall') and has some pedigree behind its writers (Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr.), it's diminished by the low-wattage star power of the performers: they may look good but really--are these the kind of people you want to watch having sex?",Unfaithful
76,jldmp1,Suburban Ennui,5,25 June 2006,"What makes this of moderate interest is how the vision lives within ambient light and shadows, characteristic of Lyne's style. The ""9 1/2 Weeks"" derivations are plain, so Biziou's employment as cinematographer was no accident.The construction is somewhat obvious too: the French lover is the 'writer' who controls events (Lane). Gere is the 'director' -- evidenced by his use of a 'photographer' to 'take pictures' -- who is jealous of this control and fights to take back the 'vision'. He's particularly jealous of how the writer stole the object of desire to live with her within the joy of Tati's ""Jour de Fete"" (blaring at us from the movie marquee).Note the snow globe as the maguffin...a simple Hitchcock device.This wasn't bad, but there are far more intelligent predecessors out there, including ""The Player"" and ""Presumed Innocent"".",Unfaithful
77,flicklover,An intelligent flipside to Fatal Attraction,8,14 May 2002,"When I saw the trailer for this film I was not very interested in the film. It is directed by Adrain Lyne, the man behine Fatal Attraction, which dealt with the same subject, cheating on one's mate. Where as the earlier film just became a thriller, forever embedding Glen Close in the movie psycho hall of fame! This film flips the situation around, Diane Lane is a woman who cheats on her husband played by Richard Gere. She meets a french book dealer and begins a torrid sexual fling with him. The interesting thing about the movie is that Diane Lane's character is is presented to be in a good marriage, Gere is a good husband and father , nothing seems to be wrong in the marriage. Its seems to be someting she justs wants to do. The movie doesn't go the route that Fatal Attraction went, the movie doesn't go for the usual thriller plot devices, the tension in the film comes from the actors, Gere is really good, Diane Lane has a role that shows her acting ability. I don't give spoilers, but the movie is not really a thriller, but a tragedy,it shows that the choices people make have consequences. As far as the ambigious ending, as moviegoers these type of endings aren't really popular, but this one seems appropriate.",Unfaithful

80,Pookyiscute,Exceptional...,10,30 January 2006,"Romance, passion, seduction, and suspicion. This is a film of the times.It is set in suburban America; a wife, a husband and a son of eight years, they are a happy family with a house and two cars living an average life. One windy day, in the city, Constance (Lane) runs into a man carrying a stack of books. They knock each other over, and she ends up scraping her knee badly. After they've retrieved everything, he offers to have her come up to his apartment to clean her scrape. She reluctantly follows him, and tends to her wound.To thank him a week or two later, she comes over with some doughnuts, and he begins to seduce her, at her own will. Over the next several weeks, a romantic affair takes place, and of course never tells her husband (Gere), that she is falling in love with this boy, half her age.The rest of the movie takes its course as one might guess that it does, but the ending does have a surprise twist, and will leave you loving the film! The story is amazing, beautifully directed by Adrien Lynn (Fatal Attraction, 9 and 1/2 weeks, Flashdance), and the acting is impression beyond words. Diane Lane should have won for best actress in this, and was frankly cheated out of an Oscar in my opinion.It is an excellent film, although it is not appropriate for anyone under eighteen. It has several graphic love scenes, and violence as well. I think anyone who sees this, will be really surprised with just how good the film actually is. It's not just a romance. It's intense and interesting.",Unfaithful
81,Darkest_Rose,Unforgettable And Moving,10,21 December 2002,"Unfaithful is a powerful story about passion, desire and trust. Connie Sumner has a pretty good life, a husband to who she has been married for 11 years and a bright kid, charlie, who is nine years old. One day Connie is downtown and the strong wind knockes her down and she hurts her knee. Suddenly, this young attractive man helps her and invites her to his house for a band-aid and a drink. This seemed kinda funny and naive to me, not most people just go up to stranger's houses like that but anyways. The young man introduces himself as Paul and that he is a bookdealer. Nothing happens yet, but you can tell there are some sparks among them, especially when Connie grabs a book and Paul tell's her to read one of the lines, which was "" be happy for this moment, this moment is your life"". Connie exits and in the further days she begins to think more and more about paul, not being able to concentrate on anything else. She calls him finally and they meet at his house and there begins their first sexual encounter. That's when the lying begins and Connie starts going to his house more often, every day even for a quick love making. Her Husband, Edward Sumner played by Richard Gere starts getting suspicious and wonders where Connie's head is at. The affair gets out of hand and then the jealousy starts and it turns out ugly. This is a very moving movie about what an affair can do to a family. Diane Lane gives an Amazing Performance, Oscar Worth. I would give Unfaithful 9/10",Unfaithful
82,tccandler,Sometimes marriage just isn't enough!,10,11 May 2002,"Edward and Connie Sumner (Gere & Lane) are the perfect middle-aged couple living the American dream. They live a wonderful life in the New York City suburbs with their precocious nine year old son.  On a random day, a very windy day, Connie takes a trip to the city to run some errands and buy her son a birthday present.  However, her day is marred by a nasty fall where she cuts her knee on the dirty street.  A kind and mysterious stranger offers to help... ""Why don't you come up and clean it off, no?""  He is a French book trader with a sultry accent, tons of charm, and looks that draw her into a dangerous game of flirting.  Their first meeting is a relatively innocent one but it isn't their last.  She can't stop thinking about him, and no matter how much she loves her family she just has to go back and see him... over and over and over again. Their subsequent meetings are not that innocent to say the least.  Soon enough Edward begins to sense that things are wrong and hires a private detective to deliver him the truth.  I won't reveal the details, but as a surrounding character says early in the film... ""Affairs always end tragically.""  Edward and Connie struggle with the situation, one consumed by guilt, the other by jealousy.  With what they know and what they've done, they need to find a way to come back together after a vacation from their normal lives.This is a great film.  This is a mature, intelligent, erotic, exciting, sad and honest story of a marriage in trouble.  Virtually every struck note rings true, and that is a credit to all involved in the making of this film. The director, Adrian Lyne (Fatal Attraction), has experience in this kind of movie, but this is his best work yet.  There is an unsentimental, sad & thoughtful tone from the very first scene. The opening shots of the 'American Dream' house, an empty boat and a quiet suburban neighborhood on a cold misty morning are the perfect mood-setters. I have heard it said that a great film can be enjoyed with the sound off or without the picture... unfortunately it seems that many films today would best be enjoyed without either!  Unfaithful is one of the films that has fantastic visuals and superlative dialogue and music.  Lyne hasn't missed a step and should be remembered when next year's award season rolls around.The acting is absolutely amazing.  Richard Gere hasn't been this powerful in a long time... maybe ever!  He is an innocent husband drawn into a horrible scenario and the range that Gere shows surprised the heck out of me.  I had always considered him a very good actor... but this role is much better than very good.  Diane Lane is as courageous as any actress has been in a long time.  Her work here reminded me of Catherine Deneuve in Belle de Jour.  Lane has to be vulnerable, sexy, slutty, sad, guilty, angry, scared, and regretful, all the while being sympathetic to the viewer... she handles all of those emotions with incredible accuracy.  Consider the scene on the train when she recalls her first liaison with her lover.  We cut back and forth with the actual encounter and it is one of the most erotic and powerful scenes in years. Lane's acting is the key here... she treads the line between laughter and 'guilty tears' so well.  That scene reminded me of one of the most memorable love scenes in film history which took place in 1973's ""Don't Look Now"" with Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie.  Diane Lane should be nominated for every award there is... I hope the Academy can remember back this far when the Oscars roll around next year.  Olivier Martinez is a relative newcomer as the French lover.  He handles every scene well, especially the one when he meets the husband for the first time.  He goes toe to toe with Gere in a very awkward and emotionally jarring scene.  I am sure we will see more of Martinez in the future.The score is beautiful.  Primarily strings and piano dominate this under-appreciated cinematic art.  In Unfaithful the score is haunting and winsome and sad and uneasy... all at once.   It may not be melodic in the way you can whistle it on the way home... but it will help you remember all the feelings you had throughout the film.  I am sure I will add it to my soundtrack collection for those quiet nights when I'm moody and pensive.This is assuredly one of the finest films of the year.  It is mature in its examination of a seemingly happy marriage... I cannot recommend this film more.  Adults, especially couples, who want to see something other than the mindless kiddy flicks in theatres right now, would do well to see Unfaithful... you will talk about it for days, maybe weeks after. 4 Stars - 97 / 100 - A",Unfaithful

84,johnny-08,"Good remake of Chabrol's ""La Femme Infidèle""",6,21 July 2007,"""Unfaithful"" is a movie that at first starts as drama and then after while transforms in thriller (after murder). Director Adrian Lyne is a master in this genre. Most of his movies talk about same things and always there is strong bond between man and women that is very erotically shown to us, viewers. From his first movie of that type - ""Nine 1/2 Weeks"", Lyne continued with ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Indecent Proposal"", ""Lolita"" and finally ""Unfaithful"". ""Unfaithful"" is story about two people: Connie (Diane Lane) and Ed Sumner(Richard Gere), who live in marriage from dreams. They've got young son, beautiful house and enough money do live careless life. During trip to Manhattan, Connie meets 10 years younger man, Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) who sells and buys books. Soon Connie starts passionate relationship with Paul. Ed suspects on his wife so he hires private detective to follow her.This is one of Lyne's best films. On top is definitely ""Jacob's Ladder"" and after that ""Unfaithful"" is here with ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""Lolita"". In the story of cheating wife Lyne puts problem of marriage crisis and jealousy. Diane Lane was very good in her role and surprisingly Richard Gere also did good job. Diane Lane was very brave to accept this role and Oscar nomination is award for her.After all this positive things about this movie now I have to say few bad things. For me, it is quite impossible for a women who is married and has son and everything she wants to involve in this kind of connection with younger man. OK, she did it and I can even pass that but why after everything she sends him message that is over between them. What? She realized that things cannot go the way she planed? What did she planed? Lots of questions and Lyne breaks them with scene when Gere and Martinez have conversation in Martinez's apartment. After that movie goes in whole different way and that is again something good because in the middle story gets a little boring.And only one information. This is remake of legendary Claude Chabrol's movie ""La Femme Infidèle"". ""La Femme Infidèle"" is much better movie then ""Unfaithful"" but Lyne's try also counts. At least he made a decent remake with stars like Richard Gere and Diane Lane.",Unfaithful

It has some good elements as in the way women sexually become more active when they reach their 40s and their men start sexually neglecting them but nothing is unusual or exhibited smartly for the first time in movie industry as a whole.It hurts me to see good reviews for this movie which has not one single good scene and find words in the reviews such as ""So powerful"" movie! while other true powerful movies get some bad reviews.

94,boyinflares,Stylish and Elegant,8,6 January 2006,"""Unfaithful"" is a stylish and elegant thriller with a fantastic cast, intriguing story and interesting ending, and despite the film's length (it is a long film), does not feel long once you get into it. Diane Lane and Richard Gere star as Connie and Edward Sumner, and are a truly awesome on-screen pair. Diane Lane is a beautiful actress who carries herself well and is full of grace. I can't give her enough praise really, she is a very underrated actress, but one of the best. Richard Gere is, well, Richard Gere, excellent as usual. The first part of the film essentially focuses on Diane Lane and the affair her character has with Oliver Martinez's Paul, while the second part of the film focuses more on Richard Gere's character dealing with his wife's adultery.There isn't really much of a supporting cast in this film, aside from Oliver Martinez's character Paul, who is good, and Erik Per Sullivan, who plays Connie and Edward's son, Charlie. This is one role where Erik Per Sullivan was not as annoying as his role on ""Malcolm in the Middle"". The fabulous Michelle Monaghan has a very small role, while Kate Burton and Chad Lowe also make small appearances.The decisions that Diane Lane and Richard Gere's characters make in the film are always fun to watch and try and guess what they are going to do next. A decent score and nice settings add to the film's elegance. The film's ending is very interesting - leaving the ending open to the viewers to decide what happens, something not done very often in films, though here, it works just brilliantly. Very highly recommended.",Unfaithful
95,wjfickling,Hollywood Hack Work,6,13 August 2003,"If you want to see the difference between masterful, inspired film making and standard Hollywood`hack work, see Claude Chabrol's 1969 masterpiece, ""La Femme Infidele,"" the film upon which ""Unfaithful"" is based, and compare it with this film.  Chabrol's film is a masterpiece of economy of statement. It begins with the affair already established and under way.  The wife and her lover are never seen together.  The viewer's intelligence is never insulted.  Nothing has to be spelled out.  All of this is in stark contrast to ""Unfaithful.""  Here we have to be shown how the wife and lover meet and then the excruciatingly boring series of seduction scenes until they are in the sack together.  Then, lest we miss the point that they feel passion toward one another, we have to watch a number of ridiculous scenes, probably inspired by ""Post Coitum,"" in which the lovers have passionate sex in a sereis of unlikely places, such as a restaurant toilet, a seat in a movie theater during an afternoon screening, and in an apartment hallway in the middle of the afternoon.  All of this might be a bit comical if the movie were so boring, which it is right up until the scene--I'll try not to give anything away--where the husband visits the lover's apartment.  Only then does the film pick up a little steam.The film does have a few redeeming features.  As other reviewers have pointed out, Diane Lane gives a remarkable performance.  So, surprisingly, does Richard Gere.  In fact, this may be the first time I have seen the usually phlegmatic Gere do something that might be called acting.  But that's about all that can be said for this film.  Do yourself a favor and rent ""La Femme Infidele"" instead.",Unfaithful
96,GMJames,A great performance by Diane Lane,7,8 February 2003,"There is no such thing as an indifferent movie directed by Adrian Lyne. You'll either love it or hate it. I liked ""Fatal Attraction"" though I prefer the original ending, not the revised, way-over-the-top, grade B shock ending. I was not impressed with his other hit ""Flashdance"". (I've chosen not to see ""9 1/2 Weeks"" and ""Indecent Proposal"" for various reasons.) Many viewers have said that ""Unfaithful"" is simply a role reversal of Lyne's earlier hit ""Fatal Attraction"". It might be accurate but I don't think it's totally a fair comparison. I felt that the affair between Connie Sumner (Diane Lane) and Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) was just a basic physical attraction. It was a need that, for some reason, was not met with her husband. At the same time, the affair became more of an addiction for Connie. There's no love at all in that relationship. There is love between Connie and Edward (Richard Gere) but from what is presented on the screen, their love is on low tide. They certainly took each other for granted. What impressed me the most about ""Unfaithful"" was that director Lyne and screenwriters Alvin Sargent & William Broyles, Jr. (adapted from Claude Chabrol's ""La Femme Infidèle"") did not shy away from the consequences of having an affair. There was no easy out for Connie and Edward and no tidy endings. Gere was O.K. That's not to say he was bad. He didn't impress me very much. It was odd but rather interesting to see him play this rather drab, nerdy character. Something to consider: if the movie was remade in the late 70s or early 80s, Gere definitely would've played the other man. I was angry at Connie for having an affair and betraying her family. I also felt some sympathy toward her: She was not a bad person. She's basically a good person who made some very bad choices. One sequence that stood out for me (and apparently for many others) was when Connie is on the commuter train heading back home after her second encounter with Paul. Her facial expressions are so subtle but also tells more about what's going on with her with no dialog. The reactions range from excitement to anger to resignation to fear.(In the Special Features section of the DVD, check out the interview with veteran film editor Anne V. Coates. She brings an interesting perspective on how she was able to edit the sequence.)Diane Lane has received many well-deserved accolades for her performance. It's perhaps her best adult performance in her career which started in 1979 when she was just 14 in the wonderful comedy/drama ""A Little Romance"".""Unfaithful"" has a few weaknesses but luckily they are overshadowed by the film's many strengths, especially Diane Lane.",Unfaithful
97,jackjack-2,Cheap Smut,2,22 October 2003,"This movie features two actors, Richard Gere and Diane Lane neither of whom can act their way out of a wet paper bag and neither did in this movie. Diane Lane plays the role of a screen slut and Gere her husband. The plot is very predictable except for the ending which viewers will have difficulty fathoming. In fact, the movie is so poorly written and directed that there is no ending so I can't tell you how it ended.This movie was made only for one reason and that was soft porn. It didn't need it to tell the story but we see graphic and sensuous porn scenes in which Lane engages in some unrealistic sex. Supposedly the redeeming value of the movie is that engaging in adultery can lead to bad things, which happens in the movie. But for hundreds of years great authors have made that point without graphic details.Gere's efforts to clean up a murder scene are pathetic. In real life, Gere would have been arrested within a week because he was so clumsy. But in this movie the NYPD is so inept with forensic evidence that they didn't have a clue as to who the murderer was even though there were clues all over the place.",Unfaithful

Nota bene to Lyne---If you're going to have the camera linger for a  moment on a big shiny kitchen knife in an apparently wasted homage to ""Fatal""...then please have the common courtesy to STICK THE DAMNED THING INTO ONE OF YOUR CHARACTERS AT SOME APPROPRIATE JUNCTURE IN THE FILM...otherwise, leave the cutlery on the editing room floor where it belongs.

It reminded me a little of ""Ice Storm, The (1999)"". I would like to see more of that, but I fear, this is not what Hollywood's audiences like to see.",Unfaithful
100,hoxjennifer,Hard to take seriously at times,6,17 December 2015,"From the tag-line, I expected this movie to be about a secret, lusty affair and a jealous, raging husband who takes things too far. The secret, lusty affair part is right, but, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting in terms of storyline. Which isn't' to say the story itself is bad, it's not, but the execution of it was hard to take seriously at times.First off, usually with these adultery movies, we at least understand why the adulterer wants to cheat. I found that the exposition into Connie's life was not adequate enough for me to feel sorry for, or at the least understand her. She lives in a quiet suburb, she has been ""happily"" married for 11 years, she has an 8 year old son, who is cute, but somewhat annoying, as boys that age can be, her house is in a state of disarray because of this, and she seems to spend her days... doing... not much. She goes into town one day (wearing heels and a tight fitting dress... to shop for ""auction items?"") and randomly falls into a *gasp* sexy French man. She scrapes her knee in the tumble and the sexy French man invites her in to clean up. Cue sexual tension. Turns out, the French man makes his living as a bookseller and offers to give her a book of poetry about getting ""drunk off Life"", and inside the book he has snuck his phone # in it, for her to discover while she opens the book one day at home. Of course, being the foolish woman she is, she decides to call him, and things escalate from there...Now I won't reveal any more details, but at times it is just hard to take Diane Lane's character seriously. I won't disagree that her acting is amazing, but just the way the character is written and her actions is just extremely frustrating. At times, she is a guilty housewife, a lustful adulterer, and a terrible liar. The only character who I truly feel for and believe is fully developed and genuine is the husband, who displays an honest and believable reaction to finding out about the affair (let's face it, obviously he will find out, who are we kidding)...But, honestly, this movie had the potential for a higher rating from me... it just needed better execution overall.",Unfaithful
101,Captain Ed,I bet some people will be griping about the ending,9,11 May 2002,"I was surprised to see this rated so low after only a couple days of release. I felt that 'Unfaithful' presented a very realistic portrait of marriage and infidelity, and of one moment that pushes everything past the breaking point.**SPOILERS**Constance (Diane Lane) isn't necessarily unhappy as much as she is bored with her life, and when she meets a young, handsome French man, she starts sleeping with him, even though she knows it's wrong. Edward (Richard Gere) senses immediately that something is going on with his wife, but it takes a vindictive remark from an ex-employee for him to do something about it. Unfortunately, he decides to confront the young man with tragic results.Rather than blame suburbia or portray Edward as a rotten husband, the film assumes the best about all of the characters, including the lover, so it pulls you in. Lane reminds everyone that she doesn't get enough film work; not only is she gorgeous, but she is absolutely believable as a middle-aged, upper-middle-class wife and mother. Gere is also outstanding as Edward, who tries to do right and be a good husband and father, and through one very bad miscalculation (maybe two), finds himself in an inescapable moral dilemma. Olivier Martinez is good as the hunky boyfriend, but really the focus remains on Constance and Edward, with scenes so taut you could almost hear them snap.However, the ending will not please American audiences. It is very ambiguous, and if there's one thing we want, it's to have all messiness tied up in a neat little bow, and as happily as possible, too. This movie won't give you that. It won't make it that easy on anyone. In fact, this is nicely foreshadowed by making everyone involved a real person instead of a caricature, or not turning one of the three into a psycho (a lá Fatal Attraction). There are good performances in the supporting cast, although Chad Lowe needs a shave. If you are squeamish about sex scenes, this may not be the movie for you. If you favor partisan points of view where one person or the other is the bad guy, you won't find it here. You WILL find an excellent movie about real people getting pushed into places they never expected.",Unfaithful
102,marthawilcox1831,An Emotional Mess,4,15 July 2014,"There are times when this film draws too much attention to itself with lingering shots and unnecessary camera angles. The wind blowing at the beginning is all a bit too unreal. Diane Lane is a good actress and very attractive. She abandons herself in the part and you really believe her performance. But why would she fall for this French guy? Was she not happy in her marriage? Does she have an addictive personality? I lost sympathy for her character, but that doesn't take anything away from her performance.The pacing of the film is quite slow and felt more like a television movie rather than something cinematic. I believed Richard Gere's performance when he confronts the French guy, initially holding it together, and then falling sick when he sees the gift he gave to his wife giving to the French guy as a gift. If you've ever given someone you love something, or said something intimate to them, and then heard it repeated by third parties who know all about your business, you can relate to how Gere feels at this moment. The twist of him killing the French guy is cinematic with the blood pouring down from this head.I think more should have been made of the police investigation where Lane eventually realises that Gere knows about her affair and that he is responsible for the death of the French man. This is the point when the film became interesting, but it was too near the end for it to develop. The first part of Act 2 should be contracted, whereas the last part of Act 2 should be expanded. The problem with the film is the structure of the script, not the performances.",Unfaithful

104,chinaskee,One of America's great black comedies,8,7 September 2003,"For some reason this film really affected me  and I personally think most viewers as well as possibly the filmmakers ( although I suspect they didn't and are just playing a big joke on you all) have missed the entire point of this film. This movie is not supposed to be taken seriously. From the opening ""big wind "" shot its obvious that we are in a hyper-real world. Richard Gere's character hasn't done anything to warrant putting him in the kind of situation he finds himself in. He's a nice guy  who cares about his family. Diane Lane is having a fling. Why ? Who knows? I guess she's caught up in the moment. The third act is when the black comedy aspects come into play. Gere leaves as much evidence as he destroys and on top of everything else puts the corpse in the trunk of his car and then , apparently, dumps it in the town dump in his own hometown  miles away from the crime scene. On top of everything else he and the arcass get stuck in the elevator which should be a big tip off that we're not in the real world. Yes, the ending is a cheat and ambiguous but it really isn't. Watch the scenes with the NYPD homicide detectives closely. They aren't dummies and its obvious they are on to something. Based on the time line even with an ambigous ending its obvious these guys are coming back, probably on New Years Eve and Gere is going to be arrested. He's their suspect. They've got all kinds of evidence and from the moment they enter the picture its apparent they aren't just fishing. They know what happened here. Director Adrian Lyne just doesn't show it to the viewer but his detectives know who committed this murder. They know it from that first visit.",Unfaithful
105,darin-wissbaum,Lacks any focus...,4,16 September 2009,This film could have been much better had it explored infidelity a little closer and why people cheat. Maybe I missed it but why did Diane Lane's character cheat? It never really seems to explore that except that she meets this pretty boy French dude and sleeps with him. Then the rest of the film has Richard Gere growing suspicious while his wife becomes a sex starved nymphomaniac. Was she unhappy? Did she not love her husband anymore? What? It never explores or attempts to answer these questions.This film sinks towards the end as some cheap thriller and just before the credits roll has Diane Lane and Gere driving away all happy and live goes on....Please give me a break!

106,fdbjr,The Ending,8,11 May 2009,"I am writing seven years after the fact to express my bafflement over the thought that the ending, which to me was as straightforward as an arrow shot from a bow, could ever be mistaken as ambiguous.'Unfaithful' is an old fashioned morality tale, that moves in one direction almost vector-style. It is about a woman who allows a passing fancy to become an obsession, and finds the obsession devouring her entire life.Her husband ends up murdering her lover. He at first appears to have escaped consequences, but as the movie closes, it is apparent the crime will be discovered. At the end of the movie, the couple are talking in the car about love and their lives together - then the camera pans back to show they are outside a police station. To me, the thought that some have that they may run away, may not, is out of the question. The synopsis is dead wrong. This last dialog is not hopeful, but forlorn and anguished. All that they have had is irretrievably lost, due to the wife's foolishness and her husband's anger.Some members of the audience forget that characters in a movie are supposed to behave realistically. The couple in Unfaithful are far too entrenched in their upper middle class lives to have any genuine chance of flight. That last dialog is intended to underscore how much has been lost, and what devastating consequences the affair has had. It is NOT a discussion of possible alternative. The moment after the picture ends, the husband is going to surrender himself to the police. He really has no other choice.To me, this ending was sad, profound, and absolutely logical, the fitting end to a picture in which there had been a great deal of commentary on the risks of infidelity.",Unfaithful
107,emfern13,Great Movie,10,8 June 2002,This was a great movie. It was much better than i expected. The acting was great and it had a good script. It was also extremely well directed.

108,Criticalstaff,Half forbidden romance half crime thriller,5,26 May 2020,"The first half is the forbidden romance of Diane Lane and some French hunk. The second half is Richard Gere trying to cover his tracks after the murder of said hunk. It sounds like a funny premise but what makes this movie a bit disorienting is it plays it straight. It gives each separate halves more grain and makes them more interesting. However it weakens the movie as a whole.The first half presents Diane Lane having an affair. A first small nitpick is that is happens very quickly. It is barely established why she falls for the guy (except that he's a beefcake). It also takes until the almost the end of the movie to find a hint of why she is dissatisfied with her husband.
The whole romance revolves around animal attraction and sensual instincts. In other words sex. They're not really people with hopes and dreams but rather two pieces of meat. And while there is some amount of sensual charm in this story about a tidy housewife that goes to the big city to have dirty sex in bath stalls it is not exactly riveting.
At midpoint in the movie Richard Gere discovers his wife cheats and confronts her lover. He kills him, and the movie turns into a bad episode of Columbo. The movie shifts totally onto Richard Gere and how guilty her feels. At that point you might think that the movie will finally take off and become interesting, but alas it remains very much down to earth and uninspired. There is a police investigation which feels more token than anything.
The biggest problem of this movie is the absence of tension. Or rather the absence of tension between Gere and Lane. There is not really a reason for her to cheat. Their relationship is not in trouble. They are well off financially, they have a great kid, and they have good friends. The only wedge they have is a throwaway line about wanting to live in the city vs the suburbs. There is also no other psychological issue. It is not about some forfeited ambition or the sentiment of being trapped, from Diane Lane's perspective. A better execution was achieved in American Beauty: Kevin Spacey's midlife crisis has an origin. It has subtext.Unfaithful feels like a movie written by a desk clerk at a police station. It is a romance that is very dry. It is a crime thriller without passion. Another film that comes to mind: the fantastic The Man Who Wasn't There, where tragedy compound on the drama. Where the husband killing the lover condemns his unfaithful wife to the electric chair.
You could make an argument that Unfaithful is about a relationship in which Diane Lane cannot communicate with Richard Gere. But given how a lot of their communication is non-verbal, that leads itself into a paradox. The acting in that regard is great from all sides. Diane Lane is in the movie the most beautiful woman that has ever lived (and I feel the film abuses that or forces that in a way). The cinematography, the sets, everything works well to give the movie a quaint charm. It feels suburban, in a good way. In a reassuring way. The tone and the rhythm are nice and interestingly consistent throughout the movie. But the two halves feel disjointed. And would there have been a link, this movie could have been as good as American Beauty and The Man Who Wasn't There.",Unfaithful

Serviceable performances are wasted here...not surprised that it's from a french film, I find their films about romance and love to be utterly bereft.I predict that with the video release...serious people who avoid Lyne's work will venture a view and this site will be loaded with negative reviews far worse than this one...who says I'm not an optimist.

110,westpenn49,Oscar nominations abound,9,19 May 2002,"Acting, male and female, cinematography, direction just for starters. this is a movie that you love even when you wish you weren't in the theater. It is so intense, so personal, so intimate. If you have ever been a victim of infidelity (as all involved are)you may not be able to see it through. If you ever wondered how it might be to just see how life is on the other side, this movie is a must.Gere has never ever done a better job, his in control but on the edge character was perfect and would have been a walkaway for the best performance if it were not for Diane Lane. Her eyes, her skin tones, as she rides home to the Hudson River suburbs of New York tell the story all by themselves. Her ambivalence even in the midst of passion is unmistakable. She has truly turned in a masterwork of a performance and one of which to be proud.Even the small parts are pitch perfect. There is a scene with two friends in a coffee shop which will perhaps finally put Meg Ryan's coffee shop scene to rest. Wow! all three women sparkle and Olivier Martinez (Horseman on the Roof IIRC) is such a sexy bad boy, but here maybe more than anywhere else in the movie. Do not go alone.

She's doin' wrong, she knows it, she feels guilty and all distraught over it, yet her body WANTS it bad! Apparently her husband, Mr. SUCCESS, is no longer inspiring her in the sack. He seems used to getting his way and strikes fear in the hearts of anyone who might cross him, so how come he comes up short in the romance department? This is a movie for adults and the heat of the passionate affair is aptly portrayed. Just as convincing are Richard Gere's suspicions, his discovery of his wife's betrayal, and his barely contained rage over it (""I don't feel well."") What really bogs this otherwise good movie down, however, is the excessive inclusion of their son, who for some odd reason has become their very reason for living. The way middle class family types moon over their children and expect everyone else to be similarly affected is too often both silly and sickening. You see the nice kids who really are cute and well-behaved, and then there are the others, not nearly so cute and possibly downright annoying. Unfortunately, it is usually their parents who are unable to distinguish between the two sorts. This odd looking brat has a head shaped like the tip of a missile. He has far too much to say and is in way too many scenes. In my opinion, he should have been edited out of the flick as much as possible.",Unfaithful

I could care less about who's in it, who directed it or what it's about;  and on that basis, this is a 9.95 out of 10.  And it's too bad Chad Lowe's character had to walk straight out the door when he gets canned.  That stupid flaw kept it from a perfect 10.  Imagine a man, 100% committed to his wife and family.  Imagine a woman 92% committed to hers, the same people.  It's a fairy tale so real you're glued instantly to the story, circumstance and every one of its characters, including Erick Per Sullivan who, if Lane and Gere ever had a kid, this is certainly what he would look like.Diane Lane (loved her since Lonesome Dove) and Richard Gere (is there a better ending than ""Officer and a Gentleman""?) are stunning.  Olivier Martinez might as well steel himself for a flood of offers in the months ahead (for filmwork . . . , or who knows?!).  This is perfect film making, a brilliant use of subtlety (as opposed to wacking the audience over its collective head with a sledge hammer), with scenes Alfred Hitchcock himself could not have better et up.

114,RestlessRust,A Mess of a Movie about a Mess of a Marriage,3,13 November 2015,"There's a scene in ""Unfaithful"" in which the heroine, Connie Sumner, drives recklessly through the city streets, a bag of oranges spilling in the back seat of her vehicle. At first I thought one of the oranges would roll under her brake pedal and cause a wreck. When that didn't happen, I thought there might be some symbolism to the shot, as if we were meant to realize that Connie's life was running out of control like so much fresh produce rolling on the floorboard of an SUV. Maybe, or maybe it was pointless, like everything else in the film.""Unfaithful"" is the latest Adrian Lyne flick to hit the big screen (and now DVD), and it isn't any better than or even as good as any of his previous efforts. Unlike ""Indecent Proposal"", which explored basic consequences of an unusual situation, or ""Fatal Attraction"", which explored unusual consequences of a basic situation, ""Unfaithful"" is basic all the way around: woman has affair, husband begins to suspect. There's nothing here that hasn't been done a hundred times before and a hundred times better.Part of the problem is that we never really have a reason to make an emotional investment in the characters. Connie loves her family, true, but we don't really get to know her, and as a result, we never understand why she would fall for the suave Frenchman she literally bumps into on the street. Nor do we see enough of her husband to really empathize with him. We pity him, but that's a much less interesting emotion. Once the affair begins, Connie's days are filled with sex and her nights are filled with the occasional fear that she will be discovered and the nagging sense that what she's doing is wrong. Again, though, we don't understand why she began the affair or why she keeps it going. The whole thing seems to be based on sex, hardly making her a sympathetic character.Another problem is the direction. Adrian Lyne seems desperate to infuse the film with meaning, but he never succeeds. More than half the scenes feel completely pointless. The son, for example, has no significant role in the film whatsoever, yet his screen time rivals that of the lover. It may be important for us to see the innocent victims here, but in an art form in which every frame of film has to justify its existence, Lyne bogs the proceedings down with entire scenes that do nothing to expand the plot or the characters. Some may defend it by pointing to the realism of the scenes, but as Tom Clancy once said, real life is boring. If realism is indeed what Lyne was striving to achieve, I guess he succeeded.What Lyne does well is sex, and this film is full of it. I didn't realize I was going to be seeing a porno movie when I sat down to watch this, but with the basic plot and extremely explicit sexuality, I would have to say ""Unfaithful"" qualifies as one. Various positions, various locations, it's all here, and it's surprisingly graphic for a major motion picture, so be warned if you find such things offensive.The movie isn't all bad, though. Diane Lane's performance is excellent, especially in the train scene following her first illicit encounter. It's also nice to see Richard Gere playing a more insecure character than his gigolo persona. There's chemistry in all the scenes, and every relationship seems believable (even if we never fully understand the affair). Really, the only things that are truly awful about the film are the script and the direction, but those deficiencies are far too big for the cast to overcome. What we are left with is a well-acted movie that pushes the limits of what is permissible in an ""R""-rated film but fails to expand any horizons.",Unfaithful
115,dutchchocolatecake,"not bad, not good either.",4,16 March 2014,"So if you're looking for a way to burn a couple hours on a lazy day, I guess having this in as background noise is a good reason to watch it.Otherwise, it's a fairly lukewarm made-for-TV style drama that I wouldn't recommend carving out any time to watch it intently.The acting is good and there's plenty of chemistry, but the story line on the other hand is terribly cliché and the characters aren't well written. It is almost insulting in simplicity as an SUV-driving soccer mom bored with her life finds extracurricular romance in a french guy with an accent. You can find the same synopsis in any mass produced paperback romance.Human relationships, being complex as they are, require more than just the ""girl cheats on guy, guy gets revenge"" to make a good movie. You don't really know why she cheated, other than the vague guess that her husband has just gotten too comfortable and has taken her for granted.It is also perplexing how the husband acts so mild mannered and blasé about his marriage every other day beforehand, but then becomes unstable and murders the other man. The scene is excellently played out, but inconsistent with his overall character.If I were to re-do this movie, I would pay less attention to the sexual encounters and more attention to the dynamics between the two main characters and maybe do some exploration on Paul's motivations for not caring that his girlfriend is married.",Unfaithful
116,TheHrunting,Where's your partner right now?,9,22 May 2011,"Would you jump at the chance of having a sex-based fling on the side if your romance was dwindling with your established spouse? That's just what UK director Adrian Lyne stirred up heated conversations about with his go at another erotic thriller back in 2002. ""Indecent Proposal"" gave away the million dollar question with feelings of resentment, ""Lolita"" hinted at regressive middle aged men and impulsive nymphets, and ""Unfaithful"" looks at the human relationship again this time through the eyes of the average couple with one kid, house and their priorities in order. Quite possibly your everything's-fine neighbor or the employee-of-the-month person next to you at work.Little did you know that being a mature, hard-working individual wasn't always enough, but letting out the inner Casanova or Don Juan once in a while, with irresistible accent and all, to spice up your unspontaneous life might be, or possibly might not be, all it takes. Though that's just what temptations and deeper, reflective feelings are all about: sometimes they're impossible to resist and can eventually turn self-destructive if left unchecked. Can I go through with it? Is this what I really want? What if I get caught? All questions that might or might not go through one's head depending on which road is chosen. It's a can of worms that some leave unopened, while others attempt to handle the growing mess from their in-the-now, overpowering desires.""Unfaithful"" makes you feel like you're there as you get to see little, realistic details that are usually glossed over in the typical hot and steamy stimulating film. It also takes on different angles about the provoking question. Essentially it isn't a thunder-storming morality story where everything is shadowed and grim with hovering dark clouds wherever it roams. A viewer gets a tone from a drama on the surface but also tads of light fun and humor at points, though most importantly real characters reveal themselves during the expertly paced and shot film that's capable of hinting at hidden meanings even when words aren't spoken.

119,Pamsanalyst,Absorbing [Spoilers},9,19 October 2004,"This quiet almost masterpiece kept me in my chair, intrigued. Until the moment where Edward picks up the snowflake globe and bashes in the head of his wife's young lover, it is her film, and like some Hardy tale, she finds herself a prisoner of an action in her past, in this case her immediate past. Then the focus shifts to her husband, not for as long a screen time as the affair, but to a second blow up, this one entirely verbal. Having noticed that her gift to the young man, the same gift Edward gave her, has appeared on her table again, she asks ""What did you do with that beautiful young man? Did you hurt him?"" The fury in his reply is unmistakable, and it clears the air of all the ambivalence that surrounds their lives, so that the final part of the film is about the couple, trying to patch a life together again. This is adult fare, not because of the steamy sex scenes, but for the themes and ideas brought out.Diane Lane carries the first half of the film. Richard Gere is supposed to be a cypher, a hanger-on and it is only when he sets foot into Olivier Martinez loft that he takes over the film. All three principals do a great job.Lynne and his cinematographer also set off the contrast between the world of lower Manhattan and that of Westchester County. The cut from adulterous wife getting off train to husband getting off a later train is beautifully done.This is one of the better films of the past two years.",Unfaithful

I lacked depth in Diane Lane's character.Secondly, the murder scene was not believable. Two hits on the head with a snow globe decoration without it breaking to me signified that this script or direction wasn't prepared thoroughly.Overall, it lacked character depth, for I had no idea why I had to be sympathetic for these people as the movie went on.Such is the way when French stories get re-made in America.

124,paul_johnr,Lyne's 'latest' film,7,9 May 2010,"Compared to other directors of his ilk, Adrian Lyne's résumé is extremely short. From his debut film 'Mr. Smith' in 1976 to 'Unfaithful' in 2002, Lyne has only nine titles to his credit. This has been a matter of quality over quantity: Lyne is selective with his material to the point of being overtly fussy, but it encourages his painstaking detail and thorough execution.As a prime example of the gaps in Lyne's biography, 'Unfaithful' is still his most recent film after eight years. The film seems an epilogue to his long-time focus on sexual relationships that peaked with 'Nine ½ Weeks' and 'Fatal Attraction,' both major successes in the 1980s. 'Unfaithful,' using similar material, was also a top box office attraction despite mixed reviews from critics; it has pocketed $122 million worldwide and an Oscar nomination for Diane Lane's performance.Lyne had long admired the work of French director Claude Chabrol, particularly in his 1969 drama 'La femme infidèle,' which became the starting point for 'Unfaithful.' For years, Lyne tossed around the idea of building on Chabrol's theme, but left matters alone. This changed, however, when the premise of 'La femme' was expanded by writers Alvin Sargent ('Julia,' 'Ordinary People') and William Broyles Jr. (TV's 'China Beach'). This new screenplay gave the affair considerably more detail and told the story with a frankness that is only nowadays possible.The plot of 'Unfaithful' is painfully simple, yet it touches upon a great many emotions and sentiments. Diane Lane plays Connie Sumner, a suburban New York housewife who has been married for several years to Edward (Richard Gere), the owner of an armored car company. Connie has borne one child, a son named Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan), who attends grammar school. The middle-class family appears stable and free of conflict, but it is painfully ordinary: the large house, the Mercedes, and the shaggy dog look far too neat for problems not to exist beneath the surface.Connie is a former city resident who has yearned - at least in fantasy - for the bohemian life that Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) represents. Martel is an antiquarian book dealer who plies his trade from a Manhattan loft. In striking relief to Connie's loving but dull husband, Martel embodies a raw, unbridled sexuality that draws her interest. Through a chance meeting on the street, Connie and Paul settle into an affair that is far more carnal than affectionate.With a husband and son waiting at home, it is only a matter of time before things start to unravel and hearts are broken. Infidelity is a topic worked to death by cinema, which made 'Unfaithful' a considerable risk to produce. Sargent and Broyles, however, tell the story from both Connie and Edward's viewpoint, leaving empathy for both characters. Tension also reaches high levels through the screenplay's effective plotting and dialogue.Diane Lane's performance was nominated for several acting awards, including the Oscar and Golden Globe. All three adult leads are very good, but Lane is the person who truly shines. Her performance is intense, nuanced, and without a moment's doubt of her character. Gere and Martinez are effective, particularly in a key scene where the two gentlemen meet. Lyne has done superb work in converting Gere from his usual grittiness to a more vulnerable figure.The one substantial flaw of this movie is that Paul Martel does not entirely work as a character. We have seen the French man of mystery a bit too often and Olivier Martinez is forced to climb uphill against the sarcasm that his character draws. Luckily, Martinez takes firm hold of the material and works to dispel the stereotype. It also seems that Erik Per Sullivan deserved more screen time as the couple's son, but he fills the child role excellently.Music duties went to Jan A. P. Kaczmarek, who has since won an Academy Award for 'Finding Neverland' in 2004. Kaczmarek's soundtrack uses regular orchestration, is unobtrusive, and effectively colors the given scenes. 'Unfaithful' is also the first Lyne project edited by Anne Coates ('Lawrence of Arabia,' 'Becket'). Cinematographer Peter Biziou ('Nine ½ Weeks') has returned to Lyne after an extended absence and costume designer Ellen Mirojnick ('Fatal Attraction,' 'Jacob's Ladder') stays on board.'Unfaithful' is frequently aired on television and there are plenty of DVDs to get your hands on. The 2002 release from 20th Century Fox is packed with extras, including a film-length commentary track with Lyne, commentary from Lane and Martinez on specific scenes, 11 deleted scenes with Lyne's remarks, cast interviews, a 15-minute featurette on Unfaithful's production ('An Affair to Remember'), and an editing featurette with Coates.The film is presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) with Dolby 5.1 surround sound. Dubbing is offered in Spanish and French, along with subtitles in Spanish and English. Both the video and audio of 'Unfaithful' are solidly treated. Lyne's commentary offers useful background on the production, especially on why scenes were dropped or changed. The deleted scenes include a moralistic ending that was pushed by 20th Century Fox executives but later dropped in favor of Lyne's version. Decades on, adultery is still a popular subject for filmgoers and Lyne's newest project (not to mention Lane's performance) is definitely worth seeing.*** out of 4Roving Reviewer - http://rovingreviewer.blogspot.com",Unfaithful
125,dixxjamm,Adrian Lyne should be revived and praised for what he really is: an incredibly talented director and artist,10,25 April 2011,"I avoided this one for a long time, especially because it had some otherwise obnoxious actors (Gere and Lane) and the new mystery Latin lover type that seems to get all the roles that usually went to Antonio Banderas (Olivier Martinez), and i said to myself: this may be too much superstar mannerism mayhem for me to handle. I was very wrong. The movie had me mesmerized, and the first sign of awesomeness is a scene where Diane Lane remembers the first sexual encounter with her lover while sitting in a train and she goes through an incredible array of emotions in under 2 minutes, everything culminating with her going to the train lavatory, throwing her underwear and washing her crotch in the sink like some drug dealer getting rid of the evidence...well, let's just say I was really impressed by the whole scene, the dept and the subtlety.The movie really doesn't miss at all, scene after scene of great human observation and filmmaking. I won't go in any details because the movie speaks for itself.For me, this movie also had an extra juiciness to it, the fact that all characters are presented incredibly faulty and weak, even the lover's character, who was so sure of himself ends up stupidly dumped in garbage, the husband who was so much in control of his life but ends up cheated upon and doing dumb things and the wife who behaves erratically and ends up being responsible for the whole mess. All characters also do noble things, which have a certain flavor because of their faults, it feels REAL. The script feels REAL. I laughed my ass off reading some comments here complaining about how the characters motivations weren't clear or real enough. Maybe you didn't get a better look around you or you don't want to contemplate how weird people really are in their actions. But for me it's an indication that this movie bothered a lot of people because it is frank and uncompromising. A great great movie.",Unfaithful

One day while shopping in New York City, she gets caught in a severe windstorm and is unable to hail a taxi. When she falls and cuts her knee, Paul, a young bookseller with an excess of European charm, comes to her rescue. She soon finds herself in his apartment, getting tea and sympathy—and just a little too excited. Later, she returns to the danger and excitement of the city, revisits Paul's apartment and begins a fiery affair. Edward eventually suspects that Connie has wandered and hires a seedy Shamus to investigate. When the private eye produces proof, a series of events are set in motion that are unpredictable yet inevitable.REVIEW: 3 Java mugs out of 4We know what is going to happen; the title gives that away. What we don't know is why. Why would a happily married woman become unfaithful? Her husband is seemingly not to blame, and there isn't anything especially impulsive in her personality. So, we ask, why? The answer is, it just happens. And, like voyeurs, we watch it happen.This film is based on ""La Femme Infidele"" (1969) by New Waver Claude Chabrol, and the French connection is evident. A typical Hollywood film would provide justifications and explanations for her infidelity, but this film simply shows a woman who knows that what she's doing is wrong but does it anyway. The events that result from her actions aren't easily resolved and the filmmakers do not tack on a pat Hollywood ending.As for performances, Gere is understated but effective as the hurting husband and Martinez is believable as the charming young book dealer, but the film belongs to Lane, whose remarkably complex performance should be remembered at Oscar time. If we learn anything about the mystery of infidelity, it's through her performance. But thankfully, some exciting mysteries--like a windstorm, the streets of New York or an affair--are left unsolved.Director Lyne, best known for Fatal Attraction, another, far less subtle film about adultery, has taken a more thoughtful screenplay and fashioned a sexy, suspenseful drama for an adult audience.",Unfaithful

132,Teebs2,Surprisingly good,7,24 January 2006,"Diane Lane undeniably holds together this film with a magnificent Oscar-nominated performance as the middle-class housewife who has a fling with a charming young Frenchman with tragic consequences.The first hour or so of this film does play like any stereotypical ""housewife fantasy"". Adrian Lyne, second only to the Scott brothers for slick visual style, uses symbolism from the outset as what seems to be a desolate and deserted landscape turns out to be a seemingly happy family home. Connie's initial ""meet-cute"" with Paul is preceded and caused, quite literally by an almighty wind of change...You get the idea. Lane successfully keeps the audiences sympathies despite her devastatingly selfish and irrational actions. Thankfully, she doesn't quite submit to his charms and fall into bed with him immediately - it's only after some painfully awkward meetings and phone calls that the first sizzling, erotic scene occurs.As the affair continues I found my sympathies strongly transferring to Connie's husband, played by Richard Gere, and son. Her actions become more and more selfish and the web of lies and half-truths begin. In one strong scene the incredibly beautiful Connie, turns down her husbands loving, sexual advances in an atmospheric bathtub, leaving him visibly hurt and aware that something is badly wrong. In contrast Connie has passionless sex with Paul in a restaurant toilet, when a chance encounter with friends prevents her from seeing him at his flat.Like a couple of other recent dramas such as ""In the Bedroom"", the film does eventually, and disappointingly veer into conventional thriller territory. It is to Lyne, the script and his cast's credit that the film remains completely involving as both couples secrets become clear, and they are forced to regain and find strength in their relationship in different ways for their families survival.On the downside, Gere is heavily outclassed in the acting stakes by Lane, though the chemistry is there which is important. Olivier Martinez certainly looks the part, although I did feel the part was underwritten despite his role being, essentially, a mere plot device. As stated earlier, the symbolism is a touch heavy handed, though the visuals are always attractive.Overall, a surprisingly intelligent and moving look at infidelity and it's consequences on an otherwise stable and comfortable family. Lane's performance is tremendous and the script offers an incisive look at the dynamics of the couples relationship as the affair progresses, and after, as tragic events unfold. Although the film does veer into conventional thriller territory eventually, the film always tends towards reality rather than genre/movie logic, and the ending is wonderfully ambiguous.",Unfaithful
133,Cue-ball,A film about betrayal,3,21 February 2007,"There is an unusual twist to ""Unfaithful"". The trailers and reviews lead you to believe that the movie centers around a wife's meaningless betrayal of her husband and son, for no apparent reason than a childish impulse to have sex with a ne'er-do-well Frenchman probably 15 years younger than her. But when you reach the theater (or, in my case, pop in the DVD), you learn that the betrayal in this movie is much more sinister. It's the director, producer, and writers who have betrayed the audience, and the cast, with the promise of an interesting psychological thriller, and instead have littered the screen with foreseeable cliché after foreseeable cliché. The scenes aren't even original, until perhaps the denouement, but by then I've given up caring.The plot is as old as man's sexual urges. Woman marries man, moves to suburbs, has a son and a nice house. Woman runs into little French boy and is mesmerized, since we all know French men can bed any American woman they want at the drop of a hat, or a pair of underwear. Woman has sex with French boy. Woman feels guilty but continues. Man finds out. Man forces himself to confront boy. From here, the movie can take different directions, depending on which script the writers are stealing from.The plot is probably not completely predictable. Well, yes, it is. I did discover a new rule of thumb for evaluating movies: it's okay for the characters to do stupid things, or to do predictable things, but it's not okay for characters to do stupid, predictable things. If you disagree, run down to McMovie's and rent any one of the ""Friday the 13th"" films; you'll have a blast.I watched this as part of my quest to see all Oscar-nominated performances. Diane Lane was nominated for Best Actress, losing to Nicole Kidman's performance in ""The Hours"". I thought Richard Gere did the best job in the film, but Lane did have to create a character who would betray Gere, who looks about two weeks older than he did in ""An Officer and a Six-Pack Abdomen"", two decades earlier. (Reminds me of an episode of 'Columbo' where John Cassavetes cheated on Blythe Danner. You've got to be kidding.) You want to enjoy an Adrian Lyne film exploring sexuality and obsession? Please check out ""Fatal Attraction"".Roger Ebert once said that ""Mad Dog Time"" should be cut into ukulele picks to give to the poor. I'm not that clever, but I'd say rent this DVD if you're having a large dinner party and are running short of coasters. (For the record, Ebert recommended this film. What does he know.)",Unfaithful
134,littlesb,Women will understand,7,30 December 2002,"Women will understand why this woman does what she does.  Olivier Martinez is a DOLL, that's why!  The scene where Diane Lane and her friends are stuck in the coffeeshop and he walks in and the comments that her friends make about his sexiness says it all.  Contrary to what other people may say, I think that this whole plot is a very real scenario.  The wife did not set out to have an affair.  A strong attraction comes into her life totally unexpectedly and the exciting out-of-the box sex that her lover offers becomes addictive to her for a period of time.  **SPOILER**The fact that she ultimately decides to end it of her own volition is very important to the credibility that she does have a happy homelife and knows that her adulterous life cannot go on indefinitely.The confrontation between Richard Gere and the lover is also very real to me.  You want to warn Paul not to let him in, but he is naive and looks at the whole situation quite realistically, because he knew all along that he was having sex with a married woman and that his emotional involvement could only go so deep.  The way that Gere erupts is also very credible, showing that his action was not planned, but a spontaneous act of passion from a man out of his mind with emotion and grief.Yes, Diane Lane was stunning and brilliant.  Yes, I think that she should be nominated for Best Actress.  And, I also think kudos should go to the director and editor for keeping my eyes riveted to the screen from beginning to end.",Unfaithful
135,morrowmmm,How sexual urge/emotions overcome common sense,7,1 February 2003,"The reason why I comment on the film is because one of the reviewers, in a final comment stated that after seeing this film no one would consider an affair. A sound comment except the film is about a woman who feels just that way and the first half of the film concentrates upon her guilt and desire winning through. It is this part of the film which is so good. The extraordinary acting by the wife clearly shows the angst of a decision that is forced upon her. Very fine acting..a good screenplay and script yet something was not quite right. It dragged a bit and the second half was not as delicate as the first but maybe that is the sequence of an affair!",Unfaithful
136,Swangirl,"Except for Gere, just plain awful",1,10 March 2003,"My first beef with this movie is to the marketing/ad department for making this film seem like some ""suspense/thriller"" that involves some element of mystery. Let me dispell that myth. There is none. The ads are basically lies.This movie is about adultery, plain and simple. If you get a thrill from watching lots of movie sex (apparently many people here do), then this film is for you. Lane and her movie lover have plenty of it in various places all over Chicago. Connie (Lane) and Edward Sumner (Richard Gere) seem to have it all. He's a successful engineer and she's a homemaker/Junior Leaguer. They live in the typical movie house in the movie suburbs with the typical cute movie child. That part of the comparison to Fatal Attraction is true. Only in this movie, the child is a boy and his rabbit isn't boiled. He does wear a rabbit costume in his school play, which I found hilariously ironic.As in Fatal Attraction, a spouse has a fling for reasons that can't truly be fathomed. Edward is no slouch and is an attentive husband. The kid is too cute for words. But for some reason, she falls into instant lust with Paul, a smoldering-eyed French bookseller. And that's all it is. Lust. Oh, and he quotes from his various books, too. At least in Fatal Attraction, Michael Douglas' character realizes he's been an idiot. Connie Sumner (Lane) never truly does. I guess that's because she's ""living freely"" or ""soul searching"". Never mind that she destroys her family and probably gave her husband herpes. This is the MOVIES where STDs or unplanned pregnancies never happen!*SPOILERS*With little regard for her marriage or family, Connie dives into a series of ""nooners"" with Paul. They don't talk much but they don't need to since sex is what brings them together. She takes horrific risks and doesn't seem too concerned about it. If there had been some kind of exploration of their relationship, what made her take such risks with him, I might have enjoyed this movie. But you don't get anything like that here. Sex is the answer to Connie's woes.Edward, bewildered at his wife's lack of focus at home and (her new sexy shoes), starts sniffing around. He doesn't confront Connie. No, he confronts Paul. And kills him with a snowglobe. His attempts to hide it and dump the body are comical. He never really gets mad at Connie. No, he's trying to protect his family. Nothing much ever gets said about Connie's infidelity. Poor thing.*END OF SPOILERS*Diane Lane has gotten plenty of kudos for this movie. I'm not sure why. She looks like she's having a great time having sex, especially against a bathroom wall. Does that take much talent? To some, I suppose. She gets a charge out of wearing new sexy outfits for her lover. She doesn't mind lying to her family or forgetting to pick up her son at school. I guess that's what people call ""good acting"" these days. Not in my book.Gere, despite the awful script, tries to do what he can. He and the cute movie kid are about all that I liked about this film.If you're looking for a suspense/thriller, please avoid this film. If you enjoy movies with lots of meaningless sex, you'll love this one. Then again, there's plenty of that around.",Unfaithful
137,McCormack7,"AN AWESOME MOVIE! GERE AT HIS BEST IN A VERY DIFFERENT ROLE FOR HIM, & DIANE LANE IS SIMPLY AWESOME IN THIS!",10,3 May 2002,"I saw this at an advance screening last night, and I have to say that I thought it was gonna be a predictable and dull romantic thriller. But, but, - I was so, so wrong. This film really was an awesome movie! Entertaining, enthralling and beautifully shot and acted.I have to be honest that I am not a Richard Gere fan, but this was such a different role for him to do. He was so vulnerable, believable and yet sturdy as the husband. I think this is his finest ever performance (better even than ""Internal Affairs"", ""Primal Fear"" and ""Pretty Woman"").However, the real star of this film is Diane Lane, who delivers one of the best female star performances I've seen in ages. She practically ""owns"" the film, and steals every scene she's in (which is most of them as she is the main character). Lane is an actress who's been around since she was about 6 years old, and has acted in over 40 films winning a lot of industry respect and fans along the way, but this is at last her big chance to show what she can really, really do with a great part in a good, solid movie. Believe me she delivers and takes the opportunity with both hands. Great acting all around with only French star Olivier Martinez proving to be a little out of his depth. He is not bad at all, although his accent is a little troublesome, but he is up there with actors on top of their game and he seems a little out of his depth. He is certainly one to watch though, and is very good-looking. In fact Gere, Martinez and Lane make a very attractive star cast.Adrian (Fatal Attraction) Lyne's direction is stylish and assured and the movie as a whole is an awesome thriller with plot twists, edge of the seat tension, and great performances. Definately worth seeing. 10 out of 10.",Unfaithful

A terrific film no matter how many times you see it. It stills grips you, entertains you, provokes you, and leaves you thinking about it.

""UNFAITHFUL"" is also a very entertaining and watchable film. Not because of the much publicized Diane Lane nudity issue, but because it has a subtle gripping effect that gets you hooked and refuses to let you go. It is almost hauntingly hypnotizing in a very engrossing and gripping way. Adrian ""Fatal Attraction"" Lyne's movie is further enhanced by brilliant performances by a top-level cast in great form. Richard Gere has never been better than this, and Diane Lane is simply a revelation. The acting is brilliant all round, and the final act is very intelligent and unpredictable.

141,McCormack7,"UNFAITHFUL is the best thriller this year. A superbly acted, powerful film. Diane Lane is incredible in this.",10,5 June 2002,"Diane Lane is a knock-out and Richard Gere shines in sexy, cool and engrossing thriller.Adrian Lyne's Unfaithful is sensational sex-and-its-consequences melodrama at it's very best. It's a movie in which an ordinary woman from the New York suburbs, played with startling conviction and amazing range by the beautiful Diane Lane, begins to sneak away from her beautiful white dream home in the Hudson Valley, deceiving the family she loves so much in order to indulge in a cathartic sexual fling with a simply gorgeaous French hunk who's built like an Adonis. Her husband slowly suspects and then learns of the affair, and when he discovers how far it's gone, his reaction comes as as big a shock to him as it does to us.''Unfaithful'' is a domestic thriller that's been made with so much sultry juice and power that it is bound to have you thinking and talking about it long after the end credits roll. What the film observes very, very well is the deep, rich comforts of family life aren't always enough to keep even a contented person from straying.Connie Sumner (Lane) loves her doting, slightly fuddy-duddy security contractor husband, Edward (Richard Gere), as well as the life they share with their perky 8-year-old son.  So why does she let herself be seduced by Paul (Olivier Martinez), the insinuating Gallic book dealer who rescues her from a SoHo, New York windstorm? Is it because he's the sort of philosophe stud who drops pensées like ''There's no such thing as a mistake -- there's what you do, and what you don't do''? The film refuses to offer the usual excuses (e.g., cold-fish husband), and that makes the real reason all the more compelling. Connie slides into a fling because she's a sensual woman whose contentment is tinged with complacency, and because the opportunity presents itself in a way that's too sexy to resist.Once she gives in to Paul's charms, though, she gets addicted to them. The further he pushes her (a bit of S&M; a shag in a bistro bathroom), the further she wants to go. Lyne shoots the sex scenes like slivers of delirium that flirt with but never slide into fantasy, and Lane, in the most urgent performance of her long career, is nothing short of incredible -- a revelation. The play of lust, romance, degradation, and guilt on her face is the movie's real story. I hope the Academy remeber this performance, because it is Oscar worthy without doubt.Diane Lane's work in the film's intriguing and gripping second half, however, wouldn't be possible without Richard Gere's own understated performance that is one of his very best. As these two circle each other, their marriage held together by the very cycle of forbidden acts that's also tearing it apart, ''Unfaithful,'' like a more languid ''Fatal Attraction,'' becomes a thriller myth of the perils of adultery, which few filmmakers can heighten like Adrian Lyne.""Unfaithful"" is a first rate, sexy, cool and engrossing Hollywood thriller that is also refreshingly intelligent. 10 out of 10 for a GREAT movie!",Unfaithful

151,tupungato,At times overpowering,8,10 March 2008,"During the late 1970's and early 1980's when many women organized to develop ways to deal with unsolicited advances by men, this movie's premise would have provided a classic example of one of the potentially tense situations involving men in which women had found themselves. In fact, for the women who were coming up with ways to contend with sexual harassment, the scene in the bookstore when Paul Martel first comes on to Connie Sumner would have given valuable material for educational literature or an instructional video.""Faithless"" reinforces a belief, commonly held by men, that the aforementioned women hoped to dispel: If a woman first rejects your efforts to seduce her, persist and she will eventually give in. For those women working to empower themselves to better deal with male sexual impropriety, however, ""Faithless"" also presents an unpleasant truth that they may have felt reluctant to address - the behavior of some women supports the stereotype. Whether or not women, conditioned culturally to assume a subservient role in relationships or unaccustomed to trusting a wiser part of themselves, have too often accommodated men, ""Faithless"" can make a viewer question his/her ability to remain loyal to a partner.The behavior of Connie Sumner, as one of those women who ceases to resist, really disturbed me. Her husband, respectful and reasonably attractive, didn't seem to give her a reason to find him less appealing. A successful professional and outstanding provider, he also did not drive his wife away by neglecting her. In addition, Connie Sumner came across not as a promiscuous or psychologically underdeveloped woman (without the will to refuse), but as a well-adjusted woman who in an unexpected situation let her sexual feelings get to the point of overwhelming her.",Unfaithful

It is one of my favorite movies. Connie is supposedly happy but does fall into an affair. Movie was able to convince its audience that this can happen and that is its biggest strength. Love scenes in this movie are erotic and memorable. Richard Gere gives a muted performance of husband that has been betrayed. Paul Martel was very convincing as a charming French boy/man who seduces women and gives them pleasure. Even the young boy of Connie was good. Movie slows down and meanders to a not so well defined ending in the last twenty minutes but that is part of its charm. Audience is left to wonder about what will happen and that in itself is perfect ending. Loved it.,Unfaithful

The only redeeming aspect is Diane Lane who is sensual, hot and sexy as she very capability demonstrates various sexual intercourse positions.  There is a paper-thin story---partly thanks to the previews---which simply stops after two hours without a serious ending. The dialogue is weak and frequently incongruous.

This is due to the terrific performances given by Gere, whom has never been better, and Lane, who is outstanding in conveying her characters dilemma.For a plot that could have been taken from any cable TV erotica, Unfaithful is a very deliberate, well crafted drama/thriller and makes for gripping viewing.",Unfaithful

Her son is 8 and what does she do all day, go to galleries and auctions. The train scene made this film because you actually get to feel what she feels. Then the confrontation between husband and wife where he reveals its her he really wanted to hurt was intense. The movie claiming Paul/Oliver is 18 or early twenties is not believable. Late twenties early thirsties. He's a year younger than Diane Lane. Richard Gere looks great in this being 53 at the time.

165,agacyb,"Uneven, uncomfortable, unrealistic",7,8 June 2002,"CONTAINS SPOILERS ""Unfaithful"" has some very good scenes, and then it has others that seem to be trying (and failing) to make up for that horrible bunny-boiling hackjob of ""Fatal Attraction"". I'd say director Lyne took the ""shotgun approach"" -- shooting in all directions to see what he could hit. When it comes to documenting how a ""good wife"" can stray, he does a great job. Mistake number one, however, was portraying her husband (Gere) as so Hollywood-leading-man-perfect. Handsome, considerate, adores her (and of course is completely faithful, we automatically assume), attentive father, even helps clean up the kitchen, for godsake. I suppose the director wanted to say, ""Even the perfect husband can never be sure his wife won't f**k someone else."" Sure that's true, but only because THERE IS NO SUCH ANIMAL. Perfect, handsome, helpful screen husbands really bug me.So, let's assume her husband is gorgeous and wonderful, but humanly flawed in some way besides putting his shirt on inside-out, and she has reason to feel bored or neglected, or irritated -- SOMETHING. And then she does something completely human, and gets caught up in the emotional undertow of the mind-blowing sex.Gere's scene at the lover's apartment started out great. Gere was looking for something to hold onto, some meaning, some explanation, and I could see that he realized that nothing was going to give him that. He would probably just keep seeing that smirking Frenchman's face in his clouded mind for the rest of his life. Somehow he needed to get the smirk off his face. Still, the murder was over the top. That turned the movie from a realistic exploration into a silly thriller. Now the questions become too many to keep track of. Not simply, how does an affair happen and how do people live/deal with it? But, how do you clean up after a murder, what do you do with the body, how do you lie to the police, and how do you live with the crime for the rest of your life? Too much, not the central point of the movie, distracting, unreal.Getting back to the real issue, one of my favorite moments came near the end, when Connie ""flashed back"" but revised in her fantasy the beginning of the affair: Instead of going up to his apartment, she managed to get a cab, and drove away, ""seeing"" herself make the other choice.Pity that Lyne seems compelled to give us the hackneyed story of adultery destroying everything with its obsession. Someone needs to tell the other sides of the adultery story. But that will require a wiser hand than his.",Unfaithful
166,SFTVLGUY2,"Strong Performances, Weak Premise",7,31 January 2005,"This is the third of director Adrian Lyne's films to focus on adultery, following ""Indecent Proposal"" and ""Fatal Attraction,"" which convinced most men - temporarily, at least - that straying from home wasn't worth the potential consequences. In ""Unfaithful,"" it's the wife who wanders, but the price that ultimately is paid is just as steep.Connie Sumner (Diane Lane) appears to have it all - a loving husband, a precocious son, a magnificent home in the New York City suburbs, and charity work and school projects to keep her days from becoming humdrum. During an excursion to Manhattan, on a day in which it appears tornado-force winds are threatening the city, she's knocked down and rescued by a charming book dealer, Frenchman Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), who invites her into his Soho loft to tend to her injured knees. Despite his insinuatingly seductive ways, she departs with her morals intact, only to find herself obsessing over him in the following days. Against her better judgment, she contacts him, but guilt inhibits her from succumbing to his charms when they meet again. Not content with having avoided trouble twice, Connie returns again, and the third time surrenders to her desires, embarking on an ongoing affair that evolves from strictly physical encounters to emotional involvement.The premise of this film would have been far easier to accept had Connie been escaping from an insufferable or at least boring existence. But husband Edward is clearly attentive and romantic and - since he's played by Richard Gere - extremely attractive. He's not abusive, nor does he ignore her. After more than a decade of marriage, the two still flirt with each other like newlyweds. Connie is devoted to her son and his needs. So what exactly has drawn her into this affair? A one-shot encounter could be attributed to pure lust, but her long-term interest is difficult to understand. The couple progresses from steamy afternoons in bed to lunch in restaurants and excursions to the movies, as if they were dating with serious intentions. Given she can't confide in anyone, Connie is unable to convey to the viewer what it is that's compelling her to risk all she has. More than anything, I wanted to know why.Whatever weaknesses there are in Alvin Sargent's script are forgiven by the performances delivered by Lyne's cast. Lane is superb. On the train, heading home from yet another tryst, she wordlessly conveys her pleasure, her shame, her passion, her guilt, her every emotion playing itself out on her face in a scene that more than justifies her Oscar nomination. Gere is low-key as the cuckolded husband - even his anger is subdued - and he conveys the quiet rage simmering beneath the surface without resorting to screaming histrionics. Martinez adds dimension to his character, making him interesting enough to suggest he's more than a pretty face on the prowl.An alternate, more definitive ending was rejected in favor of the ambiguous finale we are given here, and the audience is left to decide in which direction Connie and Edward will take their marriage. What is clear is that whatever their choice, their shattered relationship will forever be haunted by her indiscretion and his reaction. Like ""Fatal Attraction,"" ""Unfaithful"" serves as a loud and clear warning to all spouses tempted to stray.",Unfaithful

You may feel otherwise and say yes but deep down you don't have genuine reason to love or trust him cause he hasn't been put to test. Men could be cruel, you can't know a man 100percent cuz they are can easily be influenced by the peer (friends) they hang around with.

169,missykat,High Infidelity,4,18 February 2003,"If you look back on his career, you'll notice a cinematic pattern in the directoral choices of Adrian Lyne. 'Lolita', 'Indecent Proposal' 'Fatal Attraction', '9 1/2 Weeks' all share the same core themes of sex, obsession and consequence.  Upon deeper observation, perhaps Lyne's own attitudes towards sex and relationships are revealed, along with what would appear to be a vehement distrust of women.What these films are really about is power and it's possessor.  The one who would appear to have it would be the strong and sexually charged femme fatale who has set out to control and destroy the heart/family/career of her male lead.  However, it is the male who ultimately prevails, any shadow of guilt cast upon his character consequentially forgiven in light of his strife caused by the evils that women do.  'Unfaithful' doesn't veer far off the mark.On the surface Edward and Connie Sumner, played by Richard Gere and Diane Lane, appear to be a happily married couple.  Indications that their 11-year marriage is headed south isn't detailed, only eluded to as we witness Connie's hectic morning ritual.  Maybe she is not so much unhappy, but a bored suburbanite in need of a little excitement.  A chance meeting with a smoldering French book dealer gives her all that and more as they enjoy hot, sweaty monkey sex all over the city.  These scenes are the only ones of value in the entire film.  It was the early 80's when the lovely Diane Lane first caught our attention. After her portrayal as the virginal Cherry Valance in 'The Outsiders', she went on to star in a couple more time capsule favorites of that era including 'Rumblefish' and 'Streets of Fire'. Though she worked steadily for the next two decades, it wasn't until 'Unfaithful' that she achieved the attention she has worked so hard to achieve.  As uncomfortable as you'd think it would be to shoot a sex scene, Ms. Lane is flawless.  You see her character at first as vulnerable, then brazen, caught up in the throws of her affair.  Watching her, the expression in Lane's face reveals so much more about her character's inner struggle than her dialogue.  Her first sexual encounter with the Frenchman literally had her shuddering.  This scene in particular  transcended the screen and shook me as well. The potency and strength of her performance is deserving of an Oscar, even if the film itself doesn't.I honestly fell asleep three nights in a row trying to finish this movie. There was not enough suspense between the sex to keep me enthralled.  We know the gig is up once Edward catches Connie in a lie and hires a private investigator (a nice cameo appearance by Dominick Chianese of 'The Soprano's').  But the rest of this film doesn't solve the mystery of the affair for Edward.  I would have been more satisfied if the movie revealed more of the characters themselves instead of ditching the intimacy for an easy ending.  If the ending had been more realistic, 'Unfaithful' would have dared to delve into the core of human emotion to see what we find.  Instead, the writers chose a predictable ending the rest of the film did not deserve.Of all Adrian Lyne's films, I would have to say I enjoyed 'Jacob's Ladder' the most.  Though it was more surrealistic than his usual psychological thriller, it had substance.  'Unfaithful' contains none.",Unfaithful

I was on the brinch of turning off my TV when Geres character made the 'inevetable' killing-in-affect revenge, but had to see where Diane Lane would go with HER character. The plot was ruined(by crime-and-police and female sexual role stereotyping elements=guilt), but both Gere and Lane made wonderful performances within the giving limits of script and direction.

Believable plot that overall tells us that affairs have happened, do happen and will always happen in the future; and that, not necessarily does anything have to be wrong in a marriage for one partner to cheat on the other. Thus, the theme of human curiosity, human weakness and human irrationality comes into play.Adrian Lynne really knows how to fuse a plethora of emotions, ranging from frustration to desire and obsession in his films and in his sex scenes as 'Unfaithful' shows when Connie and Olivier first try to make love. Nice to see that Lynne has made a very good erotic drama that also explores the consequences that humans have to live with as a result of them pursuing self-enlightened choices.I, myself, am thinking of purchasing this one on DVD.Give it a watch.

We know going in (it's hard to miss, given the title) what's going to happen (wife has an affair); in fact the movie is very clear, all along, in flatly stating that this can't POSSIBLY go well. So why would anyone expect the sex scenes to be more titillating or stimulating than they are? The whole point is in watching the proverbial train slowly and inevitably going off the tracks, once she makes her fateful decision. She continually THINKS this isn't really that serious, that it can't really do much harm, but the movie knows better. Sure, the guy she gets involved with is the stereotypical French seductionist. OF COURSE. We have to realize, from the start, how obvious this all is - and how completely un-obvious it is to Constance. The movie - and audience - HAVE to be way ahead of her from the beginning; that's the way foolish decisions (especially regarding love and sex) always work. The last person to realize what a stupid thing it was to do, is the person who did it.I was particularly struck by the way there isn't a wasted line of dialogue in the entire movie. EVERY line means something here (even a seeming off-handed remark about the definition of ""accountable."") In fact, there really isn't anything here that isn't specifically designed to serve a purpose. (I also enjoyed some of the humor regarding the use of an elevator, which I suspect was a nod toward Fatal Attraction. And it's wonderfully ironic to see Gere playing the husband, when 20 years ago he would have seemed tailor-made for the Martinez role.)

What annoyed me the most was the AGE DIFFERENCE.Connie Sumner is supposed to be 37 yrs old, which was Diane Lane's real age.
Paul Martel ""said"" he was only 28, which would make him 9 years younger than Connie.But the truth is that Oliver Martinez was actually 36yrs old, which means he was only ONE year younger than Diane Lane.Nothing annoys me more than when Hollywood ignores the rules of reality and puts a much older actor into the role of a much younger character.Other than that, the movie was good and believable.",Unfaithful

This is a film where no one winds up happy.  I will not give away anything of the conclusion other than to say that you will not find yourself leaving the theater unlifted. There are many serious films where terrible things happen such as Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan.  At least when the film concludes you realize that despite its depressing negatives, it was an uplifting experience and worth seeing.  Not so here.  Directed by Adrian Lyne, the film isn't a suspense melodrama like his previous exercise in marital infidelity, Fatal Attraction.  It does have a few minutes of Hitchcockian suspense but thats about it. The acting is good and Diane Lane is a beautiful and desirable woman.  I'm sure many will get a rise out of her sex scenes.

His depiction of women over the years reeks of misogyny and over-indulged sexual fantasies. 'Unfaithful' is no different, though the gender scales tip a bit closer towards the middle. His showcase of the female one might even say is slightly more respectful than from his past 'heroines.' And his middle-aged upper-class white male (Richard Gere) isn't such an innocent bystander this time around. The story is stolen and over-told and the direction, music, cinematography, etc., when taken individually are all pretty much paint-by-numbers. But pieced together around the centerpiece of the project, Diane Lane, who plays an adulteress wife, the film actually takes on a life of its own. There's the much talked about train scene, which could have been quite ludicrous, but Lane's facial expressions and focus saves it from ridicule. 6.",Unfaithful

First off, that scene is absolutely unrealistic. A poor delivery at a crucial scene like this can really put me off. After that as Gere starts to take center stage, the magic disappears as we are subject to his unconvincing acting. It's a shame because the film promised so much more.

There are other films that showcase her talent AND her body far better (""Walk on the Moon"" being one of my personal favorites).The only real shining star in this movie is Olivier Martinez, and he doesn't have much to work with here.

183,cwd2017,WHY!!!???,6,2 June 2020,"Some ask why Diane Lane's character, a good woman with an attentive husband, would risk her whole life by having an affair with a much younger man. To feel young again? Lust? Excitement? Her husband, Richard gere, is portrayed as the kind of guy who would be open to honest communication that should have taken place before Diane Lane jumped in the sack with Paul. Obviously there was discontent in her life before she met the guy; no one goes from happily married to happily married plus one. And Gere had to have been tempted over the years. But he apparently never acted on those impulses and channeled his energy and emotions into his marriage.
So what's up with Lane? Having recently watched all ten episodes of GYPSY,with Naomi Watts, I can answer that: POWER. having a huge secret makes you feel powerful and excited and continually aroused, and your emotions aren't invested in one person, which is scary when you first get married. Lane has nothing of her own, no job, no money of her own to hide from her husband. So she feels she needs something of her own that will put a Mona Lisa smile on her face when not with her lover, with whom she can experiment sexually, try things she's be too embarrassed to try with Gere. POWER is what the affair gives her, and she is seduced by it. And that POWER consumes everything in her life.",Unfaithful
184,mppullar,Ludicrously underrated,10,28 March 2003,"Every now and then, I read a review of a film which is so drastically different to my own reaction to it that I wonder if we have watched the same film. This is the case for almost EVERY review of ""Unfaithful"". Aside from the occasional positive comment that I have read by other IMDB users, and the glowing review given by Margaret Pommeranz on the (Australian) ""Movie Show"" (four and a half stars, if I remember correctly), this film seems to have met with either negative or ambivalent reactions from everyone. And this surprises me immensely, because I was overwhelmed by it. I expected quite a good, slightly arty film with good performances (particularly from Diane Lane, who really impressed me in Coppola's ""The Cotton Club""). What I got was a film which I think will be one of my favourites for many years to come.The criticisms that I have read of ""Unfaithful"" don't confuse me because they disagree with me. I can accept that - no really, I can, although I don't see how anyone could miss the brilliant acting (one user comment said that any Hollywood actress could have done Diane Lane's performance - well, I DO look forward to the J.Lo remake in a few years), or the amazing photography, this being one of the most lush and seductive films I have seen in a long time. It's the way in which the reviewers have seemingly missed the entire point of the film, or fell asleep half-way through it.Firstly, I will concede that Connie's motivations were unclear (although I'd call it subtlety, rather than poor scripting), but they weren't as unclear as many people would have you believe. Nor did Lyne simplify the relationship between Connie and Paul (someone called him Marcel - perhaps they DID watch another movie, or just couldn't spell his surname) - in fact, I would suggest that anyone who thought Connie was willing to sleep with the first guy she met would do well to rewatch this film and see the way that her mind works (or do you need a voice-over narration in addition to Lane's phenomenal performance?). In addition to this, I have read complaints about nudity (because apparently has no place in an erotic drama/thriller), technical problems (the reviewer who mentioned this loved the movie, but had issues with constant shots of the entire microphone, shots which he/she found very hard to ignore, but which I managed to miss completely) and the apparently ""cliched"" narrative. In response to the latter, I don't want to give anything away, but this film, although addressing a common topic (ie. adultery), is by no means a traditional Hollywood film, and certainly doesn't treat the topic in the same way that every other film has. Many may find the ending unfulfilling, but I can't comprehend the idea of it being cloying and unoriginal. And even if the narrative itself is conventional, the way in which it is handled by cast, director and technical crew (if you can forgive the microphone shots, I suppose) puts it so far above any of its counterparts as to warrant a much warmer reception than it seems to have been given.Diane Lane deserved the Oscar for this, without question. Unfortunately, her film came in a year when every single Best Actress nominee was of nearly equal quality. As you can see, I liked it - and wish that more people felt the same way about it. The only suggestion I can offer is that, if you have yet to see it, then don't go into it expecting a standard thriller - in fact, it can be quite slow-moving at times. But let it be what it is, because it does a damn good job at that.",Unfaithful

190,daisy3-3,Not Enough Character Development.,10,12 May 2002,"The director could have easily developed all the characters a lot more than what he has done in this film. Lane's character is portrayed as a sexually unfulfilled wife but then the story suggests she is very much indeed satisfied with her own husband as well, at least in the first few  sex scenes of the movie. She wonders into a stranger's apartment but yet we are forced to believe that she scores at least average as to her intelligence (I have argued with friends over this one and I still choose to believe that any other regular person, especially if she happens to be a suburban middle aged wife, would not step into a young New Yorker's place without a significant reason, which the film indicates she lacked)so that whole element seemed as bizarre to me as the extremely windy weather which almost looked unbelievable to say the least. I did not like what Gere had done with his character either. I think where Gere lacks as an actor is that over all portrayal of ""caring"" about any damn thing. He just simply always looks so cool and calm, it was hard for me to imagine that is how a husband behaves when he finds out where his wife's lover lives. I would love Michael Douglas in that role.
But I did enjoy the movie after all. It was refreshing to see a film that is indeed a little different from all the rest of the mainstream garbage the major studios are putting out these days. I took a chance with this one and I think it was worth it. I read somewhere that the director cut out the original ending of this movie. Anyone knows what it was supposed to be?",Unfaithful
191,david_bixby,Unremarkable,5,4 June 2002,"This movie is mildly entertaining, if for no other reason than the fact that Richard Gere is cast in the unlikely role of cuckold.

There is no dark underbelly to the marriage, and Gere seems to be very much in love with his wife...not to mention that they also have a very healthy, seemingly well-adjusted son. I was also disappointed by unmet expectations: I was led to believe that there was some very interesting twist to the story...I'm still waiting for that twist.",Unfaithful
192,david_bixby,It would be a mistake for you to pay to see this movie. Rent it.,5,6 June 2002,"In Unfaithful, Connie Sumner (Lane) is the suburban New York mom with little to do outside of shopping and planning charity auctions.  She has a devoted husband, Edward (played by Gere), and a well-adjusted, healthy son, Charlie (played by Erik Per Sullivan of Malcom in the Middle).  On a shopping trip into the City, Connie gets caught up in a bizarre windstorm and literally bumps into Paul Martel (Martinez), a used-book seller with a French accent. Martel manages to lure Connie up to his apartment so that he can bandage her knee.  He piques her curiosity, and it is not long before she is back againand againand again.Adrian Lyne, the director, is no stranger to the subject of marital infidelity, having directed both Fatal Attraction and Indecent Proposal, and he does a passable job with this latest effort.  If nothing else, it is amusing to see Richard Gere cast as the cuckold.  One big problem with this picture, however, is that it is difficult to explain why Connie Sumner would chose to pursue an extra-marital affair.  There is no sordid underbelly to her marriage, and she and her husband appear to be very much in love.Could it be that Connie has gotten bored with the suburbs (even though Connie was the one who decided the family should move to the suburbs in the first place)?  Maybe it is the result of some sort of cinematic karma, whereby Gere's character is being punished for the painfully abysmal Autumn in New York.  Or perhaps it is simply the animál magnetism of the irresistible Paul Martel, who assuages Connie's misgivings about their affair with this gem: 'There are no mistakes.  There is only what you do, and what you don't do.'No doubt many politicians and countless postmodern intellectuals would agree with this compelling logic.  However, as the affair carries on to its inevitable conclusion, we see that there apparently are mistakes, with very real consequences for all those involved.

The way I see it...that disappointment comes much earlier. Most of the love scenes are slaving to cheap hooks, formulated and deliberate lowering the standards for mass appeal while the same time, Lyne is toying with sensual side, dimensional as early draft. What is the nature of the moment this beautiful and accomplished woman voyages an intimate concord with that young Martel? Couldn't tell really, neither could Lyne.A wind? Not a typhoon could resolve these shortcomings to provide intelligent reason, a note of true passion. So many unresolved fragments as if several opposing collaborators joined with Lyne. Instant romance without a hint of passion. But still, - at least the promise and exploration of what is yet to come when Gere faces his early doubt - builds some momentum, some interest and credible lead.But wait, even that is opposed as suddenly drama departures in thriller mode, when young stallion is no more! Dilettante and fragile is result of that attempt and Lane is no longer wedded with Gere, Lyne or rest of the story. After that, everything goes downhill. Instant murder ""clearance"" to again happy family seems to offer enough sense for Lyne to actually form such a ridiculous ending. Paul Martel is really a new prototype of mega looser.

Although the company with whom I went to this movie did. They got more than they bargained for.The movie starts out with the extramarital affair of Connie developing slowly. Although the marriage is a good one, she still becomes 'unfaithful'. I find that the movie poses a very interesting premise on cheating and being (un)faithful in a marriage or relationship. Things do not have to be 'bad' to go wrong. A VERY interesting topic to talk about after the movie, be it about cheating and the effects on a relationship (trust, mostly), or forgiveness and how difficult it can be to give it.Then, in stead of developing the story into something interesting where the couple tries to deal with the situation (or not; ending in a divorce), Edward (Richard Gere) commits a ""Crime Passionel"" and kills the boy his wife has been cheating him with.The rest of the movie deals with him getting rid of the body and the guilt of the crime that keeps haunting the pair. A rather disappointing end to a movie which started out with a very promising story.",Unfaithful

This type of ending would not work in all cases, but just like the recent film ""In the Bedroom"" respect for the audience allows a skillful, satisfying and yet imginative ending. The director got the best performance out of Richard Gere and Diane Lane was simply wonderful.  The script was flawless The casting of their son may have been the only mistake in the film.

It is one of those films that grabs you early on and doesn't let go. Even after the end credits have rolled you still find yourself haunted by the films terrific story and amazing performances. You'll also find yourself in the ""what would you have done"" discussion mode. This film is extremely well done indeed. The direction is classy, the story is haunting, the performances are first rate, and the ending is superb. I can't honestly remember a better 'star-making' performance by a lead actress than the one given in 'Unfaithful' by Diane Lane. She becomes Constance and has you wholeheartedly believing her. Every facial expression, every line and word delivered is flawless. Diane Lane gives an Academy Award worthy performance if I have ever seen one. Richard Gere is also surprisingly effective in a powerful support role. The French guy was also strong although, this is Diane Lane's show without doubt. I really recommend this film very highly indeed. Haunting, intense, subtle and beautiful. If it wasn't for all the great reviews and 'buzz' that this film has received, it would have been The surprise of the year. As it stands, it is every bit as good as people say.

199,DarylDaMan,Diane Lane is sensational in another adultery classic by Adrian Lyne,10,10 September 2002,"Adrian Lyne certainly seems to have what it takes to get people to the cineplexes to see his adultery thrillers. But despite grossing over $100 million at the worldwide boxoffice so far, ""Unfaithful"" is a far less commercial film than his 1987 blockbuster ""Fatal Attraction"". Despite it's ""smash hit"" status ""Unfaithful"" is a carefully and superbly crafted human drama. It's more like a character study than an all out thriller, but it sure has some great tension filled moments of deceit and erotic charged twists and turns. Diane Lane is the star of this film and it is her character, Connie, that the film concentrates on for the most part. Lane does a sensational job in making us care about Connie and her descent into a hell-ish situation all of her own making. Lane's performance is certainly one of the best of the year and the reviews for her have been great, but Richard Gere also does a splendid job in this film as well, showing a very different side. All in all ""Unfaithful"" is a cracking film that whilst not as ""thriller-ish"" as ""Fatal Attraction"" still seems to have something that people will buy tickets to see. Class, great direction, great acting and a thought-provoking finale. A quality and wonderful film. 10 out of 10.",Unfaithful
200,DarylDaMan,A fantastic film with a brilliant star performance by Diane Lane,10,20 September 2002,"This is the kind of movie I wish Hollywood would make more of. It's a brilliant film that has subtlety, style, class and depth. When you couple that to a truly remarkable performance by the films star Diane Lane, you have a winner. Diane Lane (The Perfect Storm, Streets Of Fire) plays Connie Sumner, whose whole life starts to full apart when she becomes obsessed with a handsome (and I mean HANDSOME) Frenchman. The effect of the affair that she indulges in are catastrophic and tragic, and are presented in a heartbreakingly haunting way. Richard Gere is also very good in the film as Diane Lane's cuckold husband, but this is a Diane Lane tour-de-force that should see her win an Oscar nomination. Judging by the films box-office and critical success, it seems that Adrian Lyne (Fatal Attraction) has served up another winner.

203,katrowellpa,Making Your Bed and Lying in It,7,17 November 2012,"I really love this movie--not quite as much as Fatal Attraction, which is one of my all time favorite suspense/consequences movies, but close. As usual, Adrian Lyne focuses on suburban and marital boredom to show the consequences of an extramarital affair, and the results are dark and disturbing. You know from the beginning that all will not end well. I think my favorite part of the movie is the focus on Richard Gere's character, and how he slowly realizes that his wife is cheating on him and how he deals with it. I think he realizes how much he loves her and values the marriage and the scene between him and Martel is probably one of the most realistic. It is Gere's character sees the snow globe in Martel's bedroom and imagines the lovemaking there that he finally totally cracks and takes an action that will change his family's life forever. Although I love Diane Lane and think she did a great job with her part, I did not think her character was developed quite as well. The meeting between her and Martel was not believable to me. I don't think any woman by herself in NYC would willingly go into a stranger's apartment-no matter how cute and nonthreatening the man might seem. I did not believe that she would actually have an affair either, but if you put those 2 issues to the side, the film is easy to watch over and over again.",Unfaithful
204,aprilindeecee,Melodramatic Left Turn Overwhelms What Was A Haunting Character Study,3,12 February 2006,"During the first two-thirds of the movie, Diane Lane gives a haunting and top-quality star turn as a suburban housewife having an affair. Indeed, the movie unfolds as an anatomy of that affair and what will happen while soft-spoken and loving husband Richard Gere eventually finds out about it. Things progress interestingly - if a bit overboard in the imaginative sex department - until Lane comes finally and grimly to realization that she must end the affair.What happens next transforms Unfaithful into the realm of tawdry melodrama with no option of returning. The viewer is abruptly reminded of Glenn Close's abruptly violent spiral into insanity during the last third of Director Lyne's Fatal Attraction. Only the type of behavior exhibited by the character in question that adopts this posture is even more over-the-top and harder to reconcile with the character during the prior scenes in the movie. What ensues are scenes that recall Torn Curtain and The Trouble With Harry turning a sophisticated character study into a mock-Hitchcockian melodramatic thriller. Too Bad.",Unfaithful

The eroticism is good, and the lover is super hot, but the morality is weird. Yes, of course, cheating is bad, but isn't murder a lot worse?

Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal, and now Unfaithful. Perhaps he has deeply personal experience in this subject, who knows, but it's getting a bit boring. Not even master cinematographer Peter Biziou can save the film...well, actually the cinematography is really good, and perhaps the superior camera work and art direction do save the film. More sex. The film needed to show a bit more. More explicit sex means the viewer will feel and appreciate how unfaithful she really is, and the torment the poor husband would feel. It should have had a lot more sex.And a few of the scenes were, for me, unacceptable and far fetched. I couldn't suspend belief for everything the husband did when he found out. I suppose people can go a bit crazy when their partners cheat. People are stupid sometimes. Its just sex, and a bit of lying. Nothing that can't be sorted out with the right approach, and creative, honest thinking.One more thing, there should have been more and better sex. It's not where you have sex, it's how, and they just didn't explore that enough.",Unfaithful

Richard Gere plays his part with a stone face, so who knows what's going on with him.***SPOILERS***Anyway, this film is gripping up until the point where it turns from a sexual basis to a violent one. The result is a disappointment as the filmmakers struggle to deliver a satisfying ending. On the one hand, we don't want a murderer to go free, but on the other hand, he is basically a good guy who got screwed over by his wife.

Even though the plot is not very new, the way it has been interpreted on screen and the outstanding performances by Richard Gere and Diane Lane make this movie very unique. Throughout the movie, one can feel the emotional status that the characters are going through. Miss Lane reveals the conflict that Connie is experiencing so marvellously that I definitely think she must be nominated for the Oscar.One can't help but feel that there is an 'unfaithful' in everyone and it is important how you supress it because momentary decisions can make drastic changes which can never be repaired. One of the last scenes in the movie when Connie was thinking what would have happened if she didn't choose to go up to Paul's flat and took the cab instead was one of the most touching ones. In short, I recommend this movie to everyone who wants to see real life itself.",Unfaithful

215,katie-35,Lyne's film deserves recognition on many levels.,7,18 January 2003,"""Unfaithful"" deserved more attention than it has received.  Diane Lane knocks down a superb performance who is caught up in an illicit affair. Her life in the burbs is just too perfect.  Gere does not excite her and she seems not to like the life she lives.  An older woman being overcome with sexual desire for a younger man in a dank SoHo apartment is so opposite of her life with her husband, Edward (Richard Gere) that I can see how easily she can become so deeply involved in kinky and quite rough sex with this foreigner.  Her emotions run the gamut of confusion, lust, glow and guilt. Lane's performance is Oscar-worthy.  Gere's performance is amazing. Totally non-Gere.  His life is perfection as he sees it and the affair ruins it. The ending is disturbing.  Although the tension with Gere and Paul, the lover, is disquieting, so much so, that Edward loses his marbles and commits a crime and covers it up ---except he forgot to rub the door, elevator, etc. clean.  Then I wondered why the police, who were so interested in the family being involved in the murder, didn't look in the trunk for evidence that Paul's body had been in it.  Gere falling apart, Lane becoming so confused left me wondering if the marriage could be saved.  Had Lane gone too far? Is Gere just too much in love with her and his life that he would commit murder and continue a ""normal"" life?  Many questions are left unanswered in the end.  Getting away with murder and starting all over in Mexico just left me up in the air.  Now, isn't that great material for the police to look further?  The house goes up for sale as the the family packs.  Tickets are bought for some Mexican coastal resort.  Their kid is removed from school. Until the ending, this film had me hooked.  I loved the two main actor's performances, the lovely color contrasts, the contrast between suburbia and SoHo, the contrast between Connie's two lives---but that ending left me hanging.",Unfaithful

Otherwise, you're not missing anything.After watching Unfaithful, I wondered how Diane Lane got the nomination -- it was hardly a stellar performance. But to be fair I tried to come up with other potential candidates from 2002 films I saw ... the only thing I could come up with was Nia Vardalos for My Big Fat Greek Wedding -- she got the writing nomination; that's probably enough for her.

221,Tony-211,"Not Bad, Thought Provoking - Spoilers",9,31 May 2002,"SPOILERS I was upset at viewing the trailer for this movie, let alone see it.  Being a faithful, loving husband as myself with full trust in my gorgeous young wife, the subject disturbed me.  A happy TRUSTED wife and mother would give everything up for a little sex, and nasty sex at that.  He just doesn't have sex with her, he pretty much f---s her every way possible.  Lane does a great job at getting the whole story across with her facial expressions, she has done really well here.  Gere's confrontation scene is PERFECT, it was so real, I felt every word that he says to her, and can believe it knowing that I would feel the same way myself.The question of this movie is asked, what is the bigger sin?  The affair, or the murder??  I feel sorry for Gere's character, he got screwed by his wife, then he screwed himself when he reacted to the affair.  Seriously think about it, you find out that your loving wife is getting it on with some dirtball (who could have any disease in the book) and treating your wife like a piece of meat, of course the thoughts are going to be stirred up of what they did.  I would say that's a clear case of temporary insanity, if he wouldn't have hid the body, he might have been able to get a fair day in court.  I am ticked about the ending though, why show us a story about these two lives if you didn't intend on finishing the story.  ""Draw your own conclusions,"" the director says.  I say, ""screw that, I wanna know.""  Of course, we all know what probably happened though.This just proves the point that cheaters are scum, any way you slice it, or try to justify it, they ARE scum.  I just wish everybody would get caught like Conny did, but without the murder, just the ""I HATE YOU, YOU PIG"" speechYES the murder is the bigger sin, but the way the affair was portrayed (thinking of it happening in real life) made it a real tossup.  I don't agree with what Edward did, he should have just beat the crap out of him. Then went home, got drunk, told his wife off, then threw her out on the street.  Take the pictures, go to court and take the kid off his wife except weekends, that would have been more realistic.  She had a cozy place in SOHO to stay, I would have told her to go there from now on.Any movie this thought provoking is a decent movie, I give it a 9/10.",Unfaithful

In Chabrol the murder is deliberate (but Richard Gere is such a hunk he just can't help killing wimpy French guys), and the wife's cover-up is motivated by complex but finally selfish thinking. (Diane Lane doesn't seem able to do motivation - at least not in this film).'Unfaithful' is xenophobic, shallow, predictable, and its sex-scenes are calculatedly disgusting.

I've always admired her natural beauty  Unfaithful is the first movie that allowed her to truly display her acting competence.  She's been primarily playing second fiddle to Snipes, Sobieske - hmmmm -, Reeves. Fortunately, Lyne entrusted Lane with the lead role and she did not dissapoint.  This movie does lack an ""Oscar-bound"" script.  Heck, 99% of the movies do.  That however, does not translate into a bad storyline.  The flow of the movie is wonderful and very provocative.  Gere and Lane are great as husband and wife, Martinez on the other hand, will thrill women viewers (maybe even men...) with his sexy french accent and rugged looks.  Make no mistake though!  This is the Diane Lane show.  She will take you along for a rollercoaster ride you won't soon forget.",Unfaithful

The unfaithful wife, the young attractive guy who she is having an affair with and the jealous husband who loses control when he finds out about the affair. Adrian Lyne's moral positions fit well into the second election period of George W. Bush with its apparently strengthened conservative values. If you watch the alternative ending (included in the DVD) it gets even worse. The 'explicit' sex scenes may still shock some audiences in the US (or the Middle East), but definitely not in Europe, so even this questionable appeal is lost.It is difficult to understand how Adrian Lyne could come up with such an interesting movie as 'Jacob's Ladder' while at the same time all his other work is fairly shallow and boring.If you're after an interesting original movie about love and passion, pick any French film from the shelve and you're better off.

229,xbabe82517,"Touching, very realistic portrayal of infidelity and how destructive it can be.",9,18 July 2004,"I was very touched by this film. The way director Adrian Lyne shows that a marriage doesn't necessarily have to be in trouble for one partner to stray is very realistic, and makes the movie far more interesting because we know how much Connie (played fantastically by Diane Lane) stands to lose if her affair is ever exposed. Connie's lover Paul is played by Olivier Martinez, and I think he was equally fantastic. He just brought his character to life, and I think a lot of his appeal is largely because he's French! But he's so interesting to watch in this movie, I just loved watching the way Connie and Paul were captivated by each other. And it's all in the looks and the body language, not the dialogue. When you see Connie trying to resist Paul you only have to look at her to know what she really wants. The interaction and the chemistry Lane and Martinez had together was amazing, and for me it made the movie. Richard Gere is good and actually plays a likeable character, not arrogant and aggressive like the majority of characters he's played. All the characters are very likeable in fact, even Paul despite us having half an idea he has other women too and knowingly pursued a married woman. And we like Connie because we can see she's devoted to her family but when it comes to Paul she's powerless to resist. What I loved about this movie was the way that Connie and Paul literally blew into each other, and thus their fate was sealed. ***SPOILER!!!*** Meeting Connie ultimately led to Paul's death, and for Connie life would never be the same. It was a very touching portrayal of showing how one moment in your life can change everything. It was an accident, neither of them went looking for each other. Initially there isn't even any sexual attraction between them, which was an effective way of getting the audience to like Paul. He helped Connie because she was hurt, not because he wanted to get her into bed. Despite what he ends up doing with her we know right away that he's a caring man, but also too weak and selfish to ignore his desires. And I'm sure the majority of people have been guilty of that once or twice, whether it's indulging in an affair or having a sneaky chocolate bar when we're supposed to be dieting! I'm sure those people who've been in Connie's position would tell us that having an affair does NOT mean you no longer care about your family. And finally, the music in this movie is amazing, beautiful. The way it is used in different scenes is so perfect and just gives them that finishing touch. It sends shivers up my spine just listening to it. All in all, a fantastic movie. 9/10.",Unfaithful

You should know you're in trouble when in the first five minutes, the director has decided he must show a child urinating.  The character Paul has some of the worst dialogue, the audience was laughing at the cheesey love lines.  I also can't tell if Lane is laughing or crying, and Gere is his usual dork self.  The love scenes are extremely violent and uncomfortable, bordering on rape.  This is one of the biggest flaws of the film, because it absolves Lane's character of any kind of sin.  The ending was also unrealistic. The plot holes are numerous. I was looking for a film that treated cheating on a lover honestly; I've seen episodes of Law and Order deal with the topic better.  It's clear to see what the director was trying to do: tell the story through the violence, sets, camera angles, and disjointed cuts.  Next time, try telling the story through the script.",Unfaithful

233,jesy-1,"Great movie, great performances!",10,1 January 2005,"Unfaithful is the best film that Adrian Lyne has done since he started as a director. I have seen some of his movies and I think that Unfaithful is his best work. The story is similar to Fatal Attraction's story, but Unfaithful is better than the another film, because it is centered in the drama and the suffering that Connie feels and the suffering that Edward feels when he has discovered the truth. Olivier Martinez plays an excellent Paul Martel ""The lover"" who offers her sexual things than anything else. Fatal Attraction in centered more in Alex Forrest's madness (Glenn Close) and in the dangerous suspense that makes them live, Unfaithful shows the dramatical part of a marriage that stars not to work very well and the suspense part when Edward (Richard Gere)goes meeting her wife's lover, but it doesn't finish very well. In this film you can see a wonderful Diane Lane who takes all the applause with her performance of Connie Sumner and received a very deserved nomination to an Academy Award. A great Richard Gere in the best performance of his all career, and Olivier Martinez who has played very well the character of Connie's Lover. In the poster, if you look at it very carefully, you can see Connie's feelings represented by the darkness and the lightness that you see. If you like good dramas and Adrian Lyne's movies you have to see Unfaithful. My score: 10/10",Unfaithful

The movie started off strong, but soon all the holes began to appear and the last half-hour was very ordinary and boring. The whole premise of cheating was not explained. Why if someone is leading a perfect life would they start cheating? At least they could have showed problems in the marriage, but they kept showing a loving union between Lane & Gere.

235,riyado,It is a Masterpiece,10,15 January 2007,"It is definitely not the first movie that talks about the relation of two men and a woman. Nevertheless, in my opinion, it is probably the best. Adrian Lyne had created the best image of conflict the wife lives between desire and loyalty, between the family love and the man's love, between the right to love and the duty toward family. I can't forget the scene in the train when she is going back home after she first made love with her lover, she was crying because she feels guilty and smiling when she feels the joy. She made us stand objective in this relation. Adrian Lyne had worked on every single detail in the movie, and the actors were amazing. Richard Gere did not speak a lot in the movie, but he did not have to because his eyes were so meaningful. It is a real masterpiece.",Unfaithful
236,kayins,Unfathomable,1,3 January 2003,"In short, if you like bad movies or movies that receive undue critical acclaim, then this one is for you.  The problem in the movie does not stem from bad acting, but from bad directing and a horrible screenplay.  The entire script is contrived and the director does not know how to have his character's interact so it appears that they have chemistry.  Also, whoever cast Dewey from Malcolm in the Middle as the young boy should be shot.****Spoilers****Problem #1:  How corny and romance-novelish is it for the protagonist and her soon to be lover to be blown together literally by a freak wind storm.Problem #2:  How formulaic is it for the forbidden lover to be a handsome french guy, schooled in the art of seduction.  See any lame romance novel you've ever read that wasn't set in Texas.  The guy's name should have been Jacque Cliche.Problem #4:  Um, I believe the screenwriter's message was sometimes people have affairs without anything being wrong with their relationships.  I believe this is why the protagonist has an affair although we don't see anything quite wrong with her home life.  Keeping this in mind, I think the screenwriter should not tackle stories about the human condition until he or she realizes that people have motivation's for everything they do, whether they realize it or not.  To think people are inherently whimsical is not a mature assessment of the human condition.  That being said, it is up to the screenwriter to show the movie watchers what the protagonist's motivation was whether the protagonist realizes it or not.  This didn't happen.Problem #5:  The dialogue was bad.Problem #6:  I was prepared for all these sex scenes that were supposed to be really powerful.  They could have been if there was sufficient chemistry to believe that the Diane Lang's character was actually having passionate sex with the french guy.  I've seen more chemistry in a Cinemax soft porn. Just because she's doing her own nudity and protesting in cliche dialogue that she doesn't want to have sex, although she obviously does, does not make chemistry.  We should feel that Diane Lange wants to get with Jacque Cliche for other reasons than a french accent, good looks, and a rugged/well-read poet/renaissance man thing going for him because that's been done to death.****Spoilers****There was other obvious plot problems but I won't go into them.

The logic of the film falls apart in the story line and through certain implausibe and inexplicable scenes. Dianne Lane is gorgeous, even when Lynne tries to show her as a semi-frumpy house wife.The chemistry between Lane and Gere is non-existent.  And Erik Per Sullivan is totally unbelievable as Gere and Lane's child.(I imagine in one scene that Lynne suggested to Sullivan ""Put the collander on your head.  Yeah, that'll work."")   The dialog at home is cheesy and forced. In no way did I believe that Lane and Gere loved or cared about each other or their child at any point in the film.  Throw into the mix the chance encounters Lane has with friends and employees from her husband's business, the way that Gere acts toward his employees and the totally lack of discretion on Lane's part and you get a forced tale of washed up cliches, sterotypes, improper casting and poor scripting.The only saving grace in the whole movie are the voracious sex scenes and especially Lane's recollection of one in particular.The ending...well lets just say that if a train would have came crashing through the intersection, I would have been happy.",Unfaithful

Incredible, nuanced performances by the 3 main actors and unexpected twists and turns led this to be one of my all time favorites. And let's face it, there are no 3 better looking people on the planet than Richard Gere, Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez. Not just attractive--- they are all magnetic.

240,Itsinthewater,"*Exquisitely done, excellent direction and performances by all actors",8,13 September 2005,"Adrian Lyne is one of my favorite directors. His almost-perfect Blockbuster ""Fatal Attraction"" has met a very close match ""Unfaithful"". Similar story line of a passionate affair, attractive and likable characters, and lots of steamy sex scenes make this movie extremely fulfilling. Mr. Lyne, along with a good script,also masters incorporating a somewhat normal family setting in this film, making it all the more realistic. A seemingly happily married woman who's also a mother (Diane Lane) meets an intriguing French guy (Oliver Martinez) by accident. Her husband(Richard Gere), a doting father and businessman is oblivious at first to his wife's extramarital activities, but catches on later in the film. The big windstorm in the beginning where Diane Lane falls in the street, is pretty cool. Overall, I give this film 8 out of 10 stars. It falls short of the perfect 10 due to the ambiguous ending, although I understand the DVD version has an alternate ending available.",Unfaithful

243,Smithers101,Diane Lane gives astonishing Oscar worthy performance in another Adrian Lyne masterpiece,10,5 December 2002,"One of the qualities that separates Adrian Lyne's latest study of infidelity from other ""Cheatin' Heart"" types of movies is that it neither glorifies nor vilifies any single character. There is NO villain in the movie, just circumstance that leads three attractive, yet ordinary, people on a collision course with a tragic destiny. Most movies about cheating spouses have an abusive or neglectful husband, or a mentally unstable wife, or a psychopathic stranger who seems nice at the beginning. ""Unfaithful"" completely avoids all this familiar stuff and goes for a more mature and more realistic approach. The film is as much a character study as it is a thriller. That said the film is all the more engrossing, thought-provoking and ""different"" for it. DO NOT expect ""Fatal Attraction 2"" or a ""Fatal Attraction"" with the roles reversed. ""Unfaithful"" is more than that, but is also less than that.Diane Lane (""The Perfect Storm"", ""Judge Dredd"", ""Murder At 1600"") and Richard Gere (""Primal Fear"", ""The Mothman Prophecies"", ""Pretty Woman"") play Connie and Edward Sumner. They have a seemingly idyllic life with a nice house, a stable marriage and a cute kid called Charlie (played by Erik Per Sullivan, who plays Dewey in ""Malcolm In The Middle""). One very windy day while out shopping in New York, Connie is literally blown into a French book dealer called Paul Martel (played by the sexy Olivier Martinez of ""Before Night Falls""). This then triggers a chain reaction of events that will consume them all and which lead to a tragedy that will reverberate forever. In ""Unfaithful"", Connie's affair with French boheme Paul just ""happens,"" a mixture of serendipity and clouded decisions, a scenario probably far closer to reality than most of the contrived excuses usually made for the characters in such films. As a consequence all of the characters retain something very ""human"" in them, even if it is just a hint of sympathy.What is great about ""Unfaithful"" is the performances - we really care about these characters. Everyone is put through a living Hell and the emotions are etched on the actors faces with superb skill. Diane Lane's performance is remarkable and is, on it's own, worth watching this film for. It is THAT good. Lane's portrayal of the tragic Connie is almost certain to get her an Oscar  nomination come February. The kaleidoscopic nature of emotions and conflicts that Connie finds herself awhirl in, particularly as she starts to come to grips with the aftermath of her initial infidelity, would be a major challenge for any actress, and Lane absolutely nails it. Without a 100% authentic performance in this crucial spot, perhaps we as an audience would have been quicker to damn Connie for cheating on a perfectly good husband and betray her family as Lane leads us along Connie's ""downward spiral"". Of course, it doesn't hurt that Diane Lane has a unique beauty about her, a ""hot lady"" quality that makes her a perfect personification of middle age desirability, appealing to a wide range of male demographics. Richard Gere is surprisingly great in a supporting role as the husband. It is a role we would never expect to see him play. I always see Gere as playing the lover, but here he is the tortured cuckolded husband and he delivers one of his best ever performances. It's just so different from what we expect from Richard Gere, and while it is not in the same league as Diane Lane's (he is given far less to do), he is far better and more animated then the Richard Gere people love to criticise. This is definately his best performance since his corrupt cop in 1990's ""Internal Affairs"". Olivier Martinez plays the stereotypical French hunk, but he does infuse his character with an abundance of charm and he will definately have the girls sighing. The guy does have something about him, and he holds his own against both Lane and Gere.Full credit should also go to Adrian Lyne, who both wrote and directed this film. Lyne also knows how to film a love scene with style and a sense of eroticism. He has enthused ""Unfaithful"" with style and class. It is not just erotic, it is provocative, sexy and cool. The film is not perfect and some may find the pacing a little on the slow side. Don't expect an action packed two hours whatever you do. It is refreshing to see Lyne come up with something different from such a tired genre. Definately recommended.",Unfaithful

Unlike Fatal Attraction there's no psychopath to focus upon as theroot of the problem and unlike Bridges female infidelity is strippedof its romantic superiority to male infidelity. What we are left with is an incredibly honest and insightful portraitof good people making mistakes. Even when a murder is committed, the audience is never allowed to write off a characteras bad guy.  Every character is carefully developed and even after I left thetheater I felt that powerful sense of concern over what happensnext to these people.

I had seen the first couple of scenes and thought that it was your typical ""Basic Instinct"", ""A Perfect Murder"" kinda thriller.  I was very surprised to find that it was a lot more.  This movie takes you through an entire spectrum of emotions and the ending is absolutely perfect.  You will love, hate and then love Diane Lane as the movie progresses and Martinez pulls of a great performance as the young ""love to hate him"" fling.  What wowed me the most in this film was Richard Gere.  Without hardly any dialogue at all in this film, he was outstanding.  The key to truly enjoying this movie is to put yourself in his shoes the entire time.  I caught myself empathizing with his situation throughout the movie.  All the while, their son keeps this from becoming an extremely out-of-hand cheezy thriller.  The use of symbolism and foreshadowing is an added bonus.  I highly recommend this movie.

Lots of unintentional laughs as we watch her get into trouble and Richard Gere get suspicious. I typically hate Gere but he's actually okay in this role. What's cool about the film, besides the Playboy Channel type love scenes, is the fact it doesn't always play to expectations and I always appreciate that.

249,fk2005,Depressing and implausible,5,24 June 2009,"Overall, I just found this a bit depressing - even a happily married couple can completely disintegrate, and both parties show all the morality of a toad. Wife shags fit but superficial French bloke in various slightly disturbing ways for about an hour, hubbie then kills French bloke, packs up the body in his trunk and drives it to the tip, and no one is any the wiser. Film peters out with lots of formulaic guff designed to appeal to middle America. It lacked dramatic tension throughout, the high point was the slightly surreal confrontation between husband and lover. But it was also completely implausible both practically and emotionally - why would a conventional housewife be attracted to intellectual snob, why is she obsessed with sex, how would husband manage to kill lover with snow globe, what would hottie French guy see in her anyway. I also thought it was kind of misogynistic, this woman with no control over her own urges, neglects her child as a result and is basically shown as completely selfish and libidinous. How come the guy in Fatal Attraction just comes across as a nice guy who made a mistake, but in this film the woman is a mistake masquerading as a good wife. The film maker flatters himself that women really care about sex that much.",Unfaithful
250,JackBlackBack,Enjoyed watching but not that great,7,4 August 2008,"This is one of those movies that I could watch again, especially to see the chemistry between Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez. Diane Lane is at her best and I believe that this movie brought her career back to the spotlight. However, the second half of the movie, when I really come to think about it, is disappointing. I don't want to give away what happens, so only those who have seen the movie would know what I am referring to, but the motive for Richard Gere's actions are too contrived in wanting to blame the wife for his uncontrolled anger. The whole thing with Diane Lane's character giving her lover a gift that was shared with her husband is ludicrous! Who would do something like that? Certainly not anyone with good taste or half a brain. I thought that Adrian Lyne was a bit desperate there in looking for something awful on her part that would justify the husband's character so that in the end he is the victim. Just like Fatal Attraction takes away any blame from Michael Douglas's infidelity, this movie also zeroes in on the woman as the evildoer. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the movie.",Unfaithful
251,maxconsultant,Unsavory! possible spoiler,2,30 December 2002,"This is a horrible movie.  Diane Lane who is one of the most beautiful actresses of our generation is given a role that is so unbecoming.  She plays Richard Gere's wife, who has an affair with a guy she meets in New York.  Although believable, who cares?  It's a self-absorbed wallow.  The Robert Deniro, Meryl Streep movies of the 80's and 90's where they meet and have an affair are much better.  A far greater movie is Bridges of Madison County (with Meryl again and Clint Eastwood).Richard Gere, plays a successful New York businessman with a Scarsdale/Greenwich type home.  Once he finds his wife has an affair he cries.  These types of people don't exist.  First, a guy who looks like Richard Gere and is successful enough to have a huge house is guaranteed to be fighting babes off in New York, married or not.  Second, no housewife from those areas would ever get involved with another guy poorer than her husband to such a large extent lest they lose every penny in the ensuing divorce.

255,rahulg-2194,The enough spark could not be produced.!,7,6 July 2013,"The movie revolves around an issue which is one of the major reason of many divorces happening these days. The movie enlightens those petty things that makes man and woman drift apart after marriage. And it also brings in notice how deep a woman's heart is, how much care and love it needs and how it could suppress it's need and feelings for the love of her family. Amazing acting by Diane Lane; the sensuality, the urge for love, for not being able to restrain yourself from doing something as it fulfills your desires, all what her role demanded, she gave it to the full. Overall, she depicted a woman who is in need of love, who has her desires unfulfilled and is in a dilemma of choosing between her family and her desires. But unfortunately, it was only her who kept the movie going otherwise the movie had nothing much special in it.My movie ratings are on following basis each having 2 stars:1. Plot: .5/2 The starting was good but after a while it was quite lost. The movie could have been given a different route and surely a different ending. The issue they took on; gave to it a very unrealistic end. They could have shown much more.2. Cast&Crew: 2/2 All were at their best. Hats off to Diane Lane. And after seeing Olivier Martinez, one thing I came to know about is ladies love guys speaking English with a French accent hehe... 3. Imagination: 1.5/2 as I said, the petty things that breaks up a marriage and the unspoken desires of a woman very well thought. Half a star deducted for not thinking about a better story.4. Cinematography: 1.5/2 one thing I really liked is that the movie is all shot out in a cloudy and rainy atmosphere which perfectly goes with the story and also the music. But because of a poor plot, cinematographer's work could not get much of attention. 5.How much it satisfied its genre: 1.5/2 romance-full, drama-yes as the movie if full of feelings like desires, lust, love and revenge. There was not really any thriller in there. So overall rating- 7THANKS",Unfaithful

Either you do things, or you don't.",7,9 December 2015,"Unfaithful!So, as far the storyline goes, it's known to most, and yet, worth a quick recap for the interest of some. A wife, apparently well settled into an eleven years old marriage with a eight year old living proof for a boy-kid, busy and lonely perhaps just as most at her age and standing would be, steps into that infamous pit that society calls adultery. She bumps into this stranger one fine stormy afternoon, joins him for coffee, and thereafter for sex the next day and every other days thereon. Husband starts with getting an inkling, investigates, finds out, and then, confronts. No, not with the woman but with the lover. The confrontation that starts so well that it could even dig into the profound ""why"" and take the issue (no, not problem! Issue.) by it's horn, however, unfortunately, rather, turns into a murder scene as the husband loses control over what he was meant to do and hits the guy on the head with a gift that he gave her and then she gave him in turn. The rest of the movie becomes a matter of eventual mutual knowledge, that they know that they know, and of course, police. It ends with a note where a peaceful kid sleeps in the car backseat while the couple, musing over how their rest of life could be a beautiful escapade, both term as important, pulls up their car outside the police station and kisses passionately as the traffic signal goes from red to green to yellow, back to red.Poetic? Maybe. Unresolved? Yes.But, question remains. What about that bull that we did not take by the horn? Really, what about that?Why did it happen? Why does it happen, that way?Just the feeling of feeling special, that? That thing of being treated like not just a wife but a woman? Being told she's beautiful? Being awaited, being looked forward to, being seen off, being missed? Being treated like she exists? Being taken interest in? Oh yes, perhaps!Or perhaps, more. Perhaps, knowing that life holds more treasure than what 'they' hand out to you if you don't ask. Perhaps!No, viewer. You don't have to wrap it up with a certificate, good or bad.

So far fairly conventional. But when hubby finds out, the plot starts to twist and turn like a trapped animal, and the movie becomes almost a psychological thriller, before it settles into an uneasy resolution.The intensity, the genuine humanity and the emotion shown in the acting and the dialogue are very convincing, and the characters and plot are absorbing and believable.

259,DJBF,Craptacular!,3,4 January 2003,"Basically a well-shot, well-scored Lifetime movie with nudity and no commercials.  They could have easily cut this to fit into a 2-hr TV-movie time slot.  The reviewer who said that this would be great for an MST3K revival was spot on - this was sooo slow-moving that the only way I got thru it was to crack jokes about it to my wife during the myriad pregnant pauses. One similarity that this had w/ the infinitely superior Fatal Attraction - both movies were centered around pretty couples who were stuck with an ug-lee kid!  Is this Lyne's way of subtly foreshadowing trouble in paradise? For Diane Lane fetishists only, and you'd better be quick with the 'pause' button.",Unfaithful
260,jakasper,"Powerful, sexy film that showcases the brilliant Diane Lane",9,17 December 2002,"So many people have already commented on this film, but I wanted to add my thoughts as well.This is truly a tour de force for Diane Lane. You cannot keep your eyes off her in this movie. Her expressions are priceless, especially during the scene on the train where she is reliving her first encounter with the French lover she has been unfaithful with. She is lovely to look at, and she acts up a storm in this film. I hope she receives an Academy Award nomination for her efforts.This film gave me a lot to think about, regarding marriage and infidelity. As the film's ending shows, there are no easy answers. Adrian Lyne did a great job directing. The cinematography is top notch also. And of course, as a woman, I loved looking at Olivier Martinez! Richard Gere has always been sexy, but his character takes a back seat to this young, hot character that his wife falls for.It moves kind of slowly, but is sexy and suspenseful.",Unfaithful

262,jennoyed,Why?,1,11 May 2002,"You have a loving husband and a kid who doesn't require medication or pre-teen bootcamp.  Your husband owns his own company, so you don't have to work.  Instead, you can let your maid do the menial housework so you can spend your days wearing cute clothes, shopping, raising money for charity, and picking the kid up from school.  You have a gorgeous house, high priced vehicles, and the man you married is utterly devoted.  In spite of all this you opt to get it on with some guy with bad teeth and a subleased apartment. Then you get psychotic and possessive about him, even though you have no intention of leaving your family for him.  Why?  Sure, Richard Gere is old and has beady little eyes, but he beats the hell out of most dads strolling state fairgrounds and football stadiums.I just don't get it.  Maybe it's because I'm single with no family and no money and no Mercedes with a leather interior, so I have trouble understanding why it is that when you have everything, you'd risk losing it for some hot sex.  Don't get me wrong, I like hot sex too, and the scenes in the movie almost made it seem worth the risk.  On the other hand, I don't understand why in our new HIV world you'd get it on with a stranger and not just get a naughty book or movie and take it home to a husband who'd be more than willing to oblige.I hated this movie.  Diane Lane looked fabulous in it, and you can't help but envy her body and respect all the effort she must put into it. But that ain't worth even matinee prices.",Unfaithful

Diane Lane is hot and convincing in her emotional struggles. Olivier Martinez is more than adequate as the French lover: interested, but realistic, knowing the fire will fade. The story is rather trite and dime store romance, but the characters and their motivations are well handled to produce a nice tension, despite the predictability. Even the non-ending is predictable, but better than having the moral dilemma resolved. I don't understand some of the negative reviews and their obsession with and disapproval of the ""sex scenes"", which are not excessive and are integral to the movie. There is clearly lust, but well handled and very little skin is shown to produce the desired effect. It is not a soft-porn or sex film at all, just as Clockwork Orange is not a film about violence; neither could be made without showing the motivations for the characters and the storyline. Critics must never have experienced the insanity and thrill of real lust and the excitement of spontaneous sex in semi-public places. The movie works as far as I'm concerned.",Unfaithful

265,RWB99,"Subtle, yet haunting.",9,11 May 2002,"This movie surprised me for many reasons. First off was the absolutely astounding performance from Diane Lane, I have admired her for a while for her beauty, but there is more to her than just good looks. Second, was the role that Richard Gere played. Usually I am not a big fan of Richard Gere because he always plays a pompous blowhard. It was nice to see him in a more subdued role. Finally, I was so pleased to see that Adrian Lyne chose to stay away from all of the genre cliches that he created in movies like ""Fatal Attraction"", through the subtlety of the action we can really relate to the characters. Even though you may not necessarily support them in some of their choices, their emotions are real. I like it when directors let the audience think and ponder about what is going to happen, the ambiguous ending may drive some people crazy but I believe it goes well with the mood of this excellent movie.",Unfaithful

If it is possible, this role is deeper and even more personal and poignant than the one that she had in A Walk on the Moon, although I tended to be more sympathetic to the character of Pearl in A Walk on the Moon. As for the movie itself, I have some problems with it, but as any discussion of those problems would be a spoiler, it will have to be saved for another time. I would suggest that anyone and everyone interested in Unfaithful see it, and then go home and rent A Walk on the Moon. I think it is a far superior story, and deals with the nuances of infidelity and marital harmony in a much more interesting and satisfactory way. Still with that said, I hope that Ms. Lane and Mr. Gere's performances are remembered come awards season, as these are incredible performances that push the limits of the actor's craft.",Unfaithful
267,drattai,A 5 out of 10 would be generous,5,13 February 2003,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, as I had read all good reviews in the mainstream movie media. One of the comments I recall was something to the effect of ""wow, an older woman can really be sexy!""Yes, Diane Lane *is* very sexy in this movie. But what's the big surprise that an older woman (that is age 30) can be sexy?? No news to anyone outside of Hollywood who lives in the real world. Other than portraying a mature woman as an object of desire in this movie, there is nothing new here.......for a woman about the same age and family status as Lane's character, the movie did nothing for me. I found it to be very formulaic and predictable at every turn except for the ending. As a matter of fact, the ending was the only part that I did find pleasantly surprising, as for once the audience was allowed to actually think.Yes, Lane's acting was good, but I would not say astounding. Gere was very drab, and what's with the kid? You'd have thought they could get better acting in this role than that. Or maybe they wanted it this way so that we wouldn't feel so very angry at Lane's character for forgetting her sweet son at school while lying in bed with another man.I would certainly not classify this as a ""sexy thriller"", but instead a boring drama about an unfortunate predicament that too many middle-class North Americans get themselves into. Would have played better as a made-for-TV movie in my opinion. If you want a *very* sexy thriller, try ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" instead.",Unfaithful
268,lcotten,"Contrived, Heavy Handed, and a real romance killer.",1,14 May 2002,"It's hard to believe this movie was only two hours long. It felt like so much more as every possible but improbable plot device is painstakingly delivered so that no one, but no one, can possibly miss them. Each scene is thoroughly telegraphed in the first few seconds, but yet the director makes us watch as the rest of the scene is oh so slowly delivered exactly as expected. The end credit were SO welcome. Some directors can make great use of dramatic pauses to emphasize the most subtle expressions or to build awkward tension. This movie, which seems like at least four movies, is one big continuous but failed attempt at this technique. I feel sorriest for young Mr Sullivan, who is brilliant in ""Malcolm"", but is given a story that can't decide if he's supposed to be 8 years or 8 months old. Mr. Gere and Ms. Lane should have known better, but knowing how movies are made it's hard to blame them. DO NOT take your special someone to this file. It offers all the romance of, say, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"". I could go into more depth, but ugh, enough.",Unfaithful

The beginning was a little slow and the Olivier Martinez character could have been cast better.  Erik Per Sullivan (Malcom in the Middle and Cider House Rules) did keep me laughing throughout and Richard Gere did well with the uncharacteristic role that he played.  I think that Diane Lane's emotions were a little too overblown at some times, and not dramatic enough at others.  The story and plot line was very predictable up until the abrupt ending that really just leaves it to your imagination.  Maybe I shouldn't have seen this movie a week before my mind is on another movie, but I really don't know how much better that would make it.",Unfaithful

However, I was really expecting just a tired retread of the same thing. What I saw instead was an exceptional film that was totally engrossing from start to finish...and oh what a great ending!The films actors and the taught direction make the characters so realistic that the movie is sometimes uncomfortably real and intense. Out of all the great performances it was the incredible performance by Diane Lane which impressed me the most. Infact, it impressed me more than nearly any other female performance I've seen for years. It is one of those performances that can only be described as ""perfect"". Lane played an adulteress before in ""A Walk On The Moon"", but she is even better in ""Unfaithful"" and that combined with her sexy (very sexy) role should catapult her to mega-stardom.Richard Gere is also fantastic. He plays very against type and does a great job. I thought that Gere had lost it after a couple of duds, but this puts him right back up there.Olivier Martinez is a great new find. The guy has presence, he can act for sure, and he is one good looking man. The girls in our group were swooning the whole time!Anyway, if you love superbly crafted and entertaining films that ask questions of the audience, then you won't find better than this.

Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock beware - there is another name in town - Diane Lane. Awards await surely for this fabulous portrayal, and she's proved once and for all that she is so much more than a very pretty face.Whenever Richard Gere turns out a new film I start to worry. Another so-so vehicle for the actor who's made cocky and blinking alot his trademark. However, with Adrian Lyne's ""UNFAITHFUL"" Richard Gere has completely re-invented himself and delivers a performance that may well be his careers best. He is so un-Richard Gere like and is very impressive indeed.Olivier Martinez could well be the Brad Pitt of tomorrow with smouldering looks that had all the females in the audience in a spin. A great looking guy who can also act a bit despite being in such illustrious company as Lane and Gere.Brilliant acting and a great looking cast is not all ""Unfaithful"" is however. This film is one of the most stunning, provocative, haunting, intelligent and downright sexy films I have ever seen. Certainly one of the best thrillers of the new decade so far. It has everything, humor, power, subtlety, great acting, great camera work and a flowing, hypnotic pace that really takes you on a journey.A wonderful film that is now Adrian Lyne's best work to date. Those expecting just a rehashed, predictable, remake of other infidelity thrillers beware. This is a stunning and provocative film that stays with you.

It seems that I have a problem with the word 'thriller'.Unfaithful is a remarkably well-acted film, including a terrific performance by Diane Lane (who is getting sexier with every passing year...). BUT: Unfaithful is a drama, not a thriller.Having recently watched 'The Contender', I must say that I found similarities between the marketing of these two films. The Contender is also a good movie, but it's not a thriller either.Does it make the film worse if attached with the label ""drama""?

I usually like movies that allow me to determine an ending for myself but this was just bad.  It made me throw my drink!  I gave this a 5/10 simply because Dewey from ""Malcolm in the Middle"" is a bad ass and steals the show.  ""You're driving me bonkers, Mom!""  That kid is cool.

Having said that, it still manages to be entertaining and, even at times, quite amusing.The film is very much a film of two halves. The first half shows us Diane Lane's Connie falling for a handsome French bookdealer. They have an affair and start to get 'braver' with where they flirt. The second half is about the repercussions of the affair and what happens when Richard Gere's husband finds out.Both halves are superbly shot and brilliantly acted. Especially Diane Lane who must surely be nominated for an Academy Award for this amazing performance. She is so convincing and heart-breakingly real in this film that it even puts her great performance in ""A Walk On The Moon"" into the shade.Gere is also good, particularly in the second half of the film. Olivier Martinez as the handsome French bookdealer admirably does what he is there to do. i.e. Make the females in the audience get hot.

I watch movies to get away from thinking about real life, not to dissect them and analyze, so if you are like me, you won't mind a few lame parts.  I was simply hoping for a decent story, and some good steamy scenes with a handsome actor.  Well, on that point, I was NOT disappointed in the least!  This film's got some rather tingly moments of steamyness, so if that's what you're looking for, then definitely check out this film!  I would recommend the trio of ""Unfaithful"", ""A Walk on the Moon"", and ""A Perfect Murder"" with the lights out and comfy on the couch!****SPOILER WARNING*****I found their reaction to Paul's body being found to be quite stupid and unrealistic.

Everything else should be left for surprise.The pacing of this movie is perfect. We got a sense of Connie and Edward's home life before she met the dashing Paul. They have a darling son, Charlie, who adds a lot of humour to the movie, but in a non precocious way. After the affair starts we see Connie's feelings range from excitement to complete disgust with herself. And of course Edward inevitably finds out. His reaction is interesting, to say the least, and perhaps very honest.The acting is great, especially from Diane Lane. The sex scenes are pretty raunchy, and made me uncomfortable at certain points, but it's interesting to see how different sex with the lover and sex with the husband were.At the end of this movie I didn't feel cheated or robbed with some contrived ending (although others may argue differently). This film dealt with how being in an affair must feel, and how finding out you're being cheated on could make your react in uncharacteristic ways.As a movie critic said, this movie will indeed make you never have an affair!",Unfaithful

291,wamba1,Disturbing and strong,9,12 May 2002,"After seeing an Adrian Lyne movie, I usually feel like scrubbing myself, an image that actually occurs in this film. It's not that his films are trashy, quite the opposite - they make you look at things you would rather not acknowledge. For 'Unfaithful', filled with disturbing images and powerful performances, there just isn't enough soap.Diane Lane, who played an almost identical role in 'Walk On The Moon', is the perfect choice for Connie Sumner, a suburban housewife and mother whose life is a little too perfect. Con bumps into Paul (Olivier Martinez, who seems to have stepped out of a Calvin Klein ad) on a windy day - a bit of heavy-handed symbolism that is one of the movie's few letdowns - and scrapes her knee as she falls on top of him, their separate personal cargoes sent flying. A few meetings later this young thing is helping Connie to brush up on her French.Sounds erotic, but don't go expecting eroticism. From their very first connection, Connie begins to get unstrung by her growing desire for Paul, and soon it becomes an obsession that interferes with daily life, not to mention the volunteer activities she uses as an excuse for frequent trips to the City. Husband Ed (Richard Gere) and son Charlie soon notice things have changed because Connie has a wistful, far-off look and behaves erratically (interesting homonym there). Even the dog seems to sniff that something is up.It's been compared to 'In The Bedroom' because of the unalterable violence toward which the plot leads, but that isn't quite right. Jealousy and lust, the engines that move this film, are less predictable than revenge. And more shocking and damaging.Lyne reins in his over-the-top tastes and gets it right this time, with patient attention to details as subtle as turning off a light at the wrong time. Lane is mostly magnificent as a woman struggling to regain control of herself - at times you absolutely despise Connie, seeing the little smile she uses to string Ed along. And Gere is remarkably un-Gere, no swagger, just dedication and talent finally coming to bloom.",Unfaithful

So I sat down with no expectations and thoroughly enjoyed. Of course the topic of the movie is something that happens in every day life. And something that can wreck families and quite often end in tragic circumstances. For most average people life can become mundane. Sometimes the chance for an escape, a bit of excitement and throwing caution to the wind can be an opportunity to escape that dull existence. The wife here has a chance encounter with a handsome and charismatic young man who sweeps her off her feet and makes her feel young again. Unfortunately as with most affairs she did not see the bigger picture and the long lasting damage caused by reckless behaviour.

Everything else should be left for surprise.The pacing of this movie is perfect. We got a sense of Connie and Edward's home life before she met the dashing Paul. They have a darling son, Charlie, who adds alot of humour to the movie, but in a non precocious way. After the affair starts we see Connie's feelings range from excitement to complete disgust with herself. And of course Edward inevitably finds out. His reaction is interesting, to say the least, and perhaps very honest.
The acting is great, especially from Diane Lane. The sex scenes are pretty raunchy, and made me uncomfortable at certain points, but it's interesting to see how different sex with the lover and sex with the husband were.At the end of this movie I didn't feel cheated or robbed with some contrived ending (although others may argue differently). This film dealt with how being in an affair must feel, and how finding out you're being cheated on could make your react in uncharacteristic ways.As a movie critic said, this movie will indeed make you never have an affair!",Unfaithful
294,matt_maggard,Why? It made here feel alive,9,13 May 2002,"A poster below asked why this woman would risk all that she has for some hot sex.  Her is my take on it.  Diane Lane had everything you could ask for in a family but it does not mean that there is nothing else in the world that she desires.  By happenstance she found a man that ignited a little passion.  He made her feel desired and and sexy and everything that a suburban housewife is not.  This is all just my guess - I am an unmarried man in a long term relationship.  I can only guess.  I would imagine that to suddenly live a life outside of your own would be an enticing possibility.From statistics I have seen, the rates of infidelity are nearly the same for men and women (around 28%).  I'm sure that all of these people aren't in bad relationships - some of them are just captured in the moment.  I thought the film captured this idea perfectly.  9/10",Unfaithful
295,mercurygoddess,Whew!,10,15 May 2002,"This movie is super erotic!!!!! Seen Original Sin? Well, you'll love this one! Diane Lane is beautiful, but you'll be so mad with what she does. Olivier Martinez is one hunk! Richard Gere? Well, he's Richard Gere! Who wouldn't love him? In this movie, he's the good guy! But he's the bad guy too! Oh what the heck! Check it out!",Unfaithful
296,cindy_335,left me breathless!,10,16 June 2002,"I loved this movie and here's why -It was not loaded down with cheesy, tripe dialogue. I am so tired of movies that go on and on with the ""yadda yadda yadda let me bore you to death with my neurosis"" dialogue. Really, there is a time to shut up, even in movies. Well this movie did a flawless job of shutting up and was all the more intense and dramatic because of it.I was blown away by how the story unfolded - not at all what I expected, which was also refreshing.Yes, Diane Lane is exceptional in this movie. But I have to say I think Richard Gere did an excellent job as well. I would say probably the best I've seen of him.Please Hollywood, make more movies like this!",Unfaithful
297,MizPinkno1082,Wait for the video,3,17 May 2002,"I was very excited to see this movie after reading several rave reviews--silly me should have known better than to trust critics.  This movie was the biggest let down I've had at the movie theaters in awhile. There was nothing thrilling about this moving, the trailer was far more exciting to watch then the movie itself.  In fact I think the trailer gives the illusion of much more suspense then the movie has at any point.  There was no suspense at all, and it was predictable.  The acting was good, the direction was decent, but the story was crap.  It was the same story of cheating spouses we've heard 1,000 times--a man with a bad accent doesn't make it creative.  When the ending credits rolled up on to the screen I said (probably louder than I should have)""Are you kidding me?!""  Wait till this one comes out on video..it's not worth the theater price.",Unfaithful
298,Infinidean,Solid performances/flimsy whimsy,6,16 May 2002,"Diane Lane is wonderful. I believe that she is being tormented by her decisions. But I have no idea why she decided to do what she decided to do. It wasn't clear at the beginning of the movie, and it was never made clear. Aside from the obvious message that infidelity is wrong, I don't see what the point of making this movie is. If it were for some wonderful acting, and some passionate scenes, the film would've been a waste of time.",Unfaithful
299,GloriousGalore,"""Unfaithful"" is pure CLASS. Cool, sexy, gripping and entertaining, capped with an incredible portrayal by Diane Lane.",10,22 May 2002,"""Unfaithful"" was a film that we'd heard a lot of good things about, but we still were not that enthused about going to see it. Mainly, because we thought it would tread the same ground as countless other movies. Well, while ""Unfaithful"" is not the most original film you'll ever see, it is certainly different enough to be very interesting. And also, it happens to be very, very good. The film is a haunting and moody piece, that has a very sexy and cool undertone. The acting was top-notch, particularly Diane Lane who surely must win an Oscar for her faultless portrayal of Constance. We also felt that the ending was sensational. It's nice for Hollywood to treat us as intelligent, feeling and thinking human beings and this film did that, yet it was also very entertaining and gripping. A really well made and well acted thriller, ""Unfaithful"" is very recommended if you like intelligent, cool and sexy films. ""Unfaithful"" has CLASS written all over it. 10 out of 10.",Unfaithful
300,GloriousGalore,DIANE LANE'S Academy Award worthy performance makes UNFAITHFUL a must see!,10,12 June 2002,"UNFAITHFUL is a very engrossing, gripping and well made drama about the dangers of infidelity and the repercussions of peoples actions. It is without doubt one of the best films of it's kind and has already been a huge 'hit' both critically and commercially. What really sets UNFAITHFUL apart from other 'erotic thrillers' is the Academy Award worthy performance of the films star DIANE LANE. It is a breathtaking performance that is worth the price of admission alone. RICHARD GERE also does well in a role that is very different from his usual 'gigolo' image. OLIVIER MARTINEZ's hunky and charming Frenchman also makes a strong impression. This is DIANE LANE's film though and it is a great female role that LANE manages to completely and convincingly carry-off. Great acting in a wonderful film. 10 out of 10.",Unfaithful
301,eatsnickers,My down right personal opinion on the movie Faithful,1,22 May 2002,"Unfaithful wasn't what I was expecting it to be. I expected something more intense and with less graphic material. To some a film like this is great because of the sexually explicit material but to someone who is expecting both a drama and action in it, it is not worth going to. Not worth the seven dollars to see in the theatre or the twenty dollars to buy.",Unfaithful
302,janelove,Two Thumbs Up!!,10,31 May 2002,I really enjoyed watching this movie. I understood the situation and I could empathize with it. Diane Lane is stunningly beautiful and Olivier Martinez is extraordinarily handsome. They look great together! I love this film!!,Unfaithful
303,mister frodo,completely touching,8,18 June 2002,"For those who likes drama it's a great option.This movie was so touching that i barely felt that 2 hours.I liked a lot Richard Gere's character, he shows us that he can act again and left aside his common works.And also, i hadn't saw Diane Lane before, and she's smokin'",Unfaithful
304,heywhatsupdog,Excellent film,10,16 July 2002,"I really liked this film a lot.  There is a lot of tension!  Diane Lane, Richard Gere, and Oliver Martinez are all really good.  I liked ""Fatal Attraction"", but this is Adrian Lyne's best film in my opinion.  There are a lot of good moments that keep you riveted.  I highly recommend this film!",Unfaithful
305,lacedemonians,A woman's fantasy!,7,6 August 2003,"*Ware spoilers ahead!*This movie was a woman's fantasy, positively and negatively.  On the one hand, the wife (Diane Lane) had the attention of the younger stud, giving it to her romantically and physically; and on the other hand she had the handsome and charming (downplayed) Gere as her husband.  Similar to ""Fatal Attraction"", where Michael Douglas' wife at home happened to be the perfect Anne Archer, you have to ask ""Why is the cheating spouse screwing up such a good thing?""  Sure, Frenchy was an annoying little punk from a man's point of view, but his own ""sensitive guy"" charm was still obvious.  Of course, when Gere killed him in a state of instability, he became a co-participant in the guilt of his wife - and, in the same scene, Gere just happened to overhear wife tearfully breaking it off - the perfect female fantasy!Of course, the perfect negative (and positive) aspect to the fantasy, was the wife's discovery of the sensitive ""To my beautiful wife..."" message in the glass paperweight that her husband had given to her, and she had in turn, given to Frenchy.  Oh!  The poignancy!  I guess her husband was romantic after all!Death and body disposal at the dump seemed a little severe for Frenchy, but the message seemed to be ""It can be dangerous to get involved with married people"" - and that is certainly a true sentiment.",Unfaithful
306,bezoargoat,Very Bad Movie,1,20 July 2002,"This movie was very bad. One of the worst I have seen in a long time. It featured bad acting, a predictable storyline, and was full of filth that I did not find romantic or sexy in the least. I would definately recommend not seeing this movie, I don't know what it is rated but I not only would suggest this movie is inapproriate for children to see, but for anyone who has an ounce of decency.",Unfaithful
307,dantheman_reynolds,Stunning film with a stunning performance by Diane Lane,10,10 December 2002,"Edward and Connie Sumner (Richard Gere of 'Pretty Woman' and Diane Lane of 'The Perfect Storm') have an idyllic life. Edward is handsome, caring and has a thriving business. His family is perfect. His wife Connie is a beautiful woman, good mother and loving wife. At least that is how things seem on the surface. Adrian Lyne's remake of Claude Charbrol's ""La Femme Infidele"" shows the shattering consequences of Connie's adulterous affair with a handsome, young Frenchman named Paul Martel. Adrian Lyne is known for his sexually charged thrillers: ""Fatal Attraction"" ""9 1/2 Weeks"" and ""Indecent Proposal."" ""Unfaithful"" is superior to those films due to the characters written by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr. and wonderfully brought to life by the three lead actors. Mr. Lyne's debut film ""Foxes"" (1980) showed that he was able to deliver a well done, character driven movie. In ""Unfaithful,"" Mr. Lyne directs with a subtlety and maturity that he has never shown before. Connie Sumner is shopping in New York during a particularly blustery day. The wind blows her into the arms of Paul Martel and the couple crashes to the sidewalk. Paul invites Connie up to his loft to clean her scraps and call her a cab. He gives her a book to remember the day. Connie finds herself attracted to the young man. She returns to Paul's apartment a few days later under the ruse of thanking him for his help. Third time's the charm. Connie returns again, unable to fight her attraction for the young man who knows all the right words to say.  What follows is a torrid passionate affair. I enjoyed the fact that director Lyne didn't have Connie and Paul fall into bed on the first day. Connie seems to have everything she could want. She takes her time and weighs the risks at first. She's only flesh and blood and lust wins out. Connie indulges her mid-life crisis. Lyne doesn't give the audience a pat reason for her actions. Like the best films of the 70s, ""Unfaithful"" respects the audience's intelligence by not drawing us an overly detailed map of Connie's heart. Reality soon crashes down on the heads of the clandestine lovers. Edward begins to suspect something is amiss. The final shot is both ambiguous and satisfactory. Very haunting! ""Unfaithful"" is a morality tale that doesn't preach from the pulpit. Rather, the film takes an objective view of the characters and lets the audience reach their own conclusions as to how they will apply its lessons to their lives. This is a fine piece of adult filmmaking which is, along with ""Jacob's Ladder,"" the best film Mr. Lyne has directed. The lion's share of the film's success must be given to the magnificent Diane Lane. She is guaranteed to be nominated for an Oscar for this role. It is nice to she her finally cast in a high-profile film which showcases her vast talent as an actress, rather than the co-star or supporting parts she usually gets. As Connie rides the train back to the suburbs after her first sexual encounter with Paul, she thinks back on the afternoon. She smiles, she cries, she laughs, she worries. Intercut with this scene are flashbacks of the lovemaking. Ms. Lane is a wonder to watch during this scene, as she is during the entire film! This is her movie. That is saying a lot as Mr. Gere and Martinez are also excellent. Richard Gere delivers a very introspective performance as the cuckolded Edward Sumner. I was reminded of Donald Sutherland's excellent low-key performance in ""Ordinary People."" This is the type of performance which is never recognized by the Academy, but which, nevertheless, anchors the film and gives it greater depth. Edward is clueless to the fact that his wife would even consider having an affair. Lyne bravely showed the couple being intimate twice in the film. Connie and Edward are making love. Connie obviously loves her husband, but she has an itch that Edward can't reach. Mr. Gere's performance is largely internal. He delivers more with a simple look than most other actors could with several pages of dialogue. Having said that, he is acted off the screen by Lane who is simply on fire in this film. Oliver Martinez is also quite good as Paul. He isn't pushy. He sends out his vibe to Connie. Like an experienced fly-fisherman, Paul is a patient seducer. He and Ms. Lane have great on-screen chemistry together. Though we know the affair will have to end, we envy their small hours of passion. This is great filmmaking which can make the viewer escape into the affair as it happens, but then fret and worry about the marriage when the lovers are apart. This film shows a maturity as a filmmaker that Mr. Lyne has only hinted at before. Let's hope that this is a new beginning for him. Let's also hope that Ms. Lane will finally be recognized for more than her ample and natural beauty. A stunning film with the best performance of the year in Diane Lane's stunning portrayal.",Unfaithful
308,dantheman_reynolds,A well observed character study made great by Diane Lane,10,7 February 2003,This film is not what you expect it to be. The trailers have you thinking it's another thriller along the lines of A Perfect Murder or Fatal Attraction but it is much.much more than that. Unfaithful is a superbly directed and superbly acted character study and the tragic consequences of someone's actions. It sounds very familiar but it isn't. It's a first class and very absorbing thriller with a stand-out performance by award winner Diane Lane. In fact it is Diane Lane's unforgettable performance which lifts Unfaithful from superb to greatness. A new classic of the genre has been delivered and delivered with style and heart.,Unfaithful

I thought that ""Unfaithful"" was actually better than those other two films. It is more realistic and more provocative. The sex scenes are well filmed, tasteful, but very sexy. The acting is top-notch and Diane Lane deserves all the awards she is winning for this great and timeless performance.

311,Quietman77,I can't believe this hunk of junk gets so much praise.,1,15 January 2003,"Did I see a different ""Unfaithful"" from everybody else? I keep reading positive reviews, and I'm absolutely baffled at how many flaws are being conveniently overlooked:1. Ending? What ending? - I'm not supposed to post spoilers, and I won't. In truth, I can't spoil anything, because I can't think of one relevant thing that happened during the last 30 minutes. It was as if they ran out of money, and simply spliced together what footage they had to try to produce a conclusion.2. Yes, Diane Lane was good, but her character, Connie, is really, really dumb. She makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her affair, she allows herself to be seen in public, her lies are utterly transparent, and, amazingly, she frequently tells lies when the truth would work. (Example: Why lie about how she met the other guy? That, at least, was completely innocent.)Yes, it's certainly a legitimate portrayal, but why not make Connie a little bit more clever? Who knows, she might actually have come across as complex or interesting.3. Nobody else is significantly smarter. I can't mention exactly why without resorting to spoilers...4. There's a lot of Art-for-Art's-Sake. Do we really need all of those camera angles, closeups, etc. during the windstorm scene? Do we really need to see an overhead view of a commuter train which slowly fades to... the exact same view of a commuter train? Do we really need all of those slow-motion flashbacks? Do we really need to see Connie and Ed's son urinating with the bathroom door open? I could go on, but I only have 1000 words.5. Let me get this straight; Connie has repeated, unprotected sex with an anonymous stranger, who himself is a notorious player, and she doesn't end up with a disease or a pregnancy? I'm not trying to impose morality (It IS just a movie after all.) but those are legitimate concerns these days. Besides, an STD or a pregnancy would have jump-started the plot a little.I don't want to be completely negative. The cast was certainly good. They delivered their lines, they hit their marks, etc. The production was also very good; the camera crews and editors, especially, deserve thumbs up just for being able to pull off that windstorm scene.",Unfaithful

Would Diane Lane, also get over it quickly? She would feel guilty sure but I believe she would not only be comforted by this surprising reaction, but intrigued, the way she was with Paul. That kind of childish non chellance is what she needed some of. You have to feel sorry for Lane. She was seduced by a clever, fun-loving latin lover and was intrigued by his lifestyle.

330,gmpicket,an affair and a moral lesson,5,11 June 2002,"The movie was not quite what I expected.  It is about a women who has an affair with a young French man that she accidentally runs into on Mercer Street in Soho.  The movie proceeds to deal with her emotions and how she handles the affair and the lies that she tells to her husband.  That is what I expected the whole film to be about and I enjoyed that aspect of the film. About halfway through the movie, the focus becomes extreme, seeming to say that affairs are wrong instead of being an exploration and letting the audience decide for themselves.  So, the first half of the movie was excellent and the second half sucked.",Unfaithful

I usually find him unbearably vain but he finally seems like a real grown-up.  This was such an interesting movie and the premise was so juicy that even if the entire movie doesn't necessarily work, I still really enjoyed it.  Alot of people feel the movie was preachy but I felt it was quite thoughtful and even handed though flawed.  It was so much better than I expected and quite disturbing on a number of fronts that I definitely recommend seeing it and talking about it with your friends.",Unfaithful

You don't hear anything about the private investigator he hires. If that guy is missing wouldn't that guy know that Richard genres character is the one who killed him in a jealous rage?? or how the guy Charlie fired never says anything to him about his wife, or about how when he was in the café he sees her kissing the guy who ends up missing. I bought this movie at Circuit City for 6 bucks in the bargain bin and i think it was a decent movie. It was worth that if not more. This movie leaves you thinking what happens to them?

334,peterpemberton1,A deeply haunting and provocative masterpiece. Stunningfilm-making.,10,4 May 2002,"Whoever thought that director Adrian Lyne and star Richard Gere were finished needs to see this haunting and provocative film. Because this is a stunner that will put both back on the map - big time. For all their star power though, it is the female star Diane Lane who must take huge credit for making this such an effective movie.I've always liked Lane as an actress from when she was a kid in Francis Ford Coppola films, but she rarely got the chance to 'carry' a film. Well, she not only 'carries' UNFAITHFUL, she delivers one of the most haunting and powerful performances I have seen from an actress. Think Julia Roberts in ERIN BROCKOVICH or Ellen Burstyn in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and you get the picture. Stunning acting.While the committed performances are what make a great movie greater, it is Adrian Lyne who has constructed such a wonderful and effective rhythm and style to UNFAITHFUL. This is not an art-film, but it is not a blockbuster either. It lays somewhere between the two and delivers on all fronts. I was totally glued to my seat from start to finish.",Unfaithful
335,lynnettesilver,Bravo!,10,28 September 2006,"If there were a rating above excellent, it would certainly be my choice. I have seen this film over and over and can't get enough of the phenomenal acting on everyone's part, especially that of Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez. I think they were perfectly chosen. I can actually feel the color changes in Diane Lane's face as she experiences her different emotions. I find the story very real, extremely sensual, tender, passionate, shocking, sad, adorable (the family scenes with Edward, Connie and Charlie (and the dog) - a very special film. The photography is beautiful, as well as the subtle background music. In my estimation, ""Unfaithful"" is a stunning work of art.",Unfaithful
336,equinnett,Shallow and Disappointing,3,3 June 2008,"I watched this movie for the second time last night. I saw it the first time when it first hit DVD. My opinion of it has changed.Not by much, mind you. I remember the first time watching the initial sex scene between Lane and Martinez and thinking, what the hell is that, that's ridiculous. Upon this review however, I get it. Honestly, as much as I despise adultery in general and especially movies that seem to glorify it, I kinda got it. People do it. It's not something I see myself doing, but honestly, life takes weird turns and who knows. So I forgave the movie for its plot. Which wasn't something I forgave it for the first time around. It just didn't seem to make any sense for her to risk her marriage and her family for this affair.But here is what really bothered me about this movie upon second viewing. Here are these two well-to-do folks living in the suburbs who get mixed up with this young, naive man visiting from France who ultimately dies and gets dumped in some landfill by the husband. And for what? His family alerted the police of his absence. So this poor kid (okay he was arrogant but - how old was he, anyway?) - who should have known better, but didn't, who had a family that loved him ends up getting murdered by this husband. It was just sad. Beyond sad.Pointless, really.Which sums up my views of this movie, ultimately. It was a trite, pointless, dirty movie pretending to be more than it was starring an especially selfish spouse married to an equally self-absorbed man who murdered a young man who should have known better, but who certainly didn't deserve to die for it. And neither is punished for it. She keeps her marriage, he doesn't get caught. Life goes on. No justice for anyone involved.And honestly, what was that at the end while they're sitting next to the police station at the red light? Are we to wonder if they'll turn themselves in? That selfish pair who believes the world revolves around them? Right. Give up the house in the 'burbs? The Mercedes? The Land Rover? The high-powered job? Gardening out front on a cool fall day in one's favorite LL Bean chunky sweater? JUNIOR LEAGUE?! I think not!",Unfaithful
337,wdmuskeyn,"The stupidest, most banal piece of offal ever to be put to film!",1,19 May 2002,"SPOILERS Well, it would seem that the director of Fatal Attraction, a movie about a man with a fickle pickle amongst a bunch of olives, has ""broadened"" his ""artistic horizons"" by bringing us a movie about a woman cheating on her husband.The plot?  Wife cheats on husband.  Husband hires a private dick, says nothing to wife.  Husband kills the second guy, police ask a few questions, husband dumps body.  This is stuff for Made-for-TV movies, which is surely why I felt shafted (no pun intended) after paying the price of a movie ticket to watch a movie with a banal, hackneyed plot.The acting from Gere and Lane was (perhaps unintentionally) over the top, which in and of itself is quite irritating, although it does serve as a nice distraction from the plot (variations of which can probably be found in a few of those paperbacks sitting near the drugstore checkout).  My particular favourite scene was Gere acting like a man pretending to be sick -- delightfully amusing, although that obviously wasn't the intent.The cinematography was thoroughly inconsistent.  There were, admittedly, a few well-shot scenes, sensitive to the space and environment of the scene, particularly in the Frenchman's apartment.  All in all, however, it left much to be desired, and there were surely a few scenes that could easily been reshot with greater attention to quality.  Instead, one is left with a Sony HandyCam feeling.I'd recommend taking the money you'd spend on tickets to see this movie and instead go out for dinner.  You'll thank me later.",Unfaithful

339,gelbza,Amazing...,10,10 January 2003,"Warning, some spoilers in this review...This film was absolutely amazing.  I read several of the other user comments, and most of what I'll say is in response to those.  One person compared this to a Lifetime movie, and while the story line does seem appropriate, it is entirely unlike anything I've seen on Lifetime.  This actually ties in with another comment, that Gere is not pushing her towards infidelity, Lane does it because of all the desires that are expected to be tucked away by American society.  In making Gere a complete innocent in the first half, it makes the viewer question his guilt later on.  I honestly was thinking that Lane would end up being accused of the murder, and that possibly Gere would allow it to happen as a form of punishment.  Also, I think too often the stereotypical ""male cheating"" is done, and, like Disclosure, this is a refreshing look at similar circumstances from another point of view.  Above all, Gere's performance was incredible, as was Lane's, and I have to agree with one other reviewer, the kid was horrid and annoying.  :)",Unfaithful
340,karoszaska,This movie is terrible,1,4 March 2011,"The writing in this film is horrible - the characters often don't have clear motives for their actions, so they come across differently than intended. The acting is equally as hollow and stiff and literal. The plot ends half-way through the film and a new crime plot starts after a STUPID (as in, poorly set up and unmotivated) killing of Paul with a bang of a thin-glass snow globe. That snow globe would more likely shatter not cause such a severe wound, and Paul would not die instantly anyway and would end up with brain damage rather. The rest of the plot is completely unnecessary - who gives a f*** how they deal with it when we know the consequence is that the adultery has scarred their marriage? Especially when in the end it leads to no real resolution (at least in the original plot...) Because of the writing and equally bad acting, I can't identify with any of the characters and hate them all by the end of the film. I'm not jaded by experiences or my values - I understand why Connie would do it, but the way her character is developed makes her just look like a b**** to her husband. And her husband, he comes across as having an inner socio-path. The kid - well he's just so obnoxious and terrible, I want to shoot him by the end of the film. Paul is a more likable character because he isn't lying as much as the rest of them, but then he doesn't respect Connie's wish to end the relationship. Also because of the writing, some of the sex scenes boarder on being almost pornographic and almost rape scenes because they are not supported by motives. Connie says no I don't wanna keep going repeatedly and then she has sex? Or Paul shows up at the café and they have sex in the bathroom while her friends talk about him? That's too close to fantasy.I also find this film has a terribly narrow audience: 40+ moms who have been married for a long time and possibly work 9-5 or are housewives and are very traditional, or a variant where the woman already has cheated on her husband or wants to. I can see this film's obvious commercial aim. It's obvious in not only the characters that are created (EXACTLY like their audience) but by making constant outcasting references to family life like tags sticking out of clothes - f***, that's not cinematic!My favourite part of this movie is when Connie almost gets KILLED by the shopping cart blowing down the street at the beginning and my favourite character is her racially discriminated black maid. I laughed most of the time watching this movie, and I could not 'suspend my disbelief'. Especially when the cinematography supported the stupidity of the plot - such as, a fast zoom in while Paul grabs at Connie leaving ""seductively"" - that was hilarious! I could not feel any sympathy for the characters because instead of coming across like adults, they handled the whole situation like teenagers and eventually children. It also sucked because at any point, the whole plot could've been smashed to bits easily by Connie or Edward telling the truth. The whole aspect of the plot being *irreversible* actions was non-existent. It could've stopped anywhere - which to me says, this is not a unique enough story. And since this film rips off a French film (that's probably way better), it isn't original. If there wasn't the whole second plot of the crime, this movie would be thinner than air.",Unfaithful

Spilled fruit rolling around the back of an SUV.Then, Richard Gere as a coward. He goes to confront the man (guess what he's not married to you and the problem is with your slutty wife and your ability to keep her happy.)

All the people here saying that it was a great performance by Lane is would say that Superbad is the best movie ever (while funny, Superbad is no Godfather or Citzen Kane). The best thing in this movie is the performance by the little kid....Erik Per Sullivan (what a name by the way), from Malcolm in the Middle. He is a breath of fresh air compared to the pompous and overly dramatic performances of the rest of the ""adult"" actors. Don't see how hard it is to get humped against a wall. Yeah, great acting!

It also talks about how this film was made and organized, which you will appreciate very much (if you are fond of this film).Even though this movie is based on our daily lives and events, the director (he calls himself a selector) develops the excellence of film. Every single simple shot in the movie is very intricate with a lot of metaphors. These metaphors are not hard to understand at all but very well-thought.The director says that when audiences watch this film, they will feel somewhat alike and . you feel like you are there. Yes I did, I did not realize it until I saw the ending of the movie.

347,stephenhalpern,I can't believed I loved this as much as I did,10,4 May 2002,"The thing with these preview screenings is that they are free. This enables you to see movies that you probably wouldn't have otherwise paid to see. However, I can honestly say that having seen ""Unfaithful"" I would pay to see it again and again. This is one cool movie. In fact I'm still shocked at just how much I loved this film. It's one of those haunting films that stays with you, and a whole day later, I can't stop thinking and talking about it.Everything (except maybe some of the dialogue) is great in this film. The dialogue can be treacly at times and unoriginal, but ""Unfaithful"" makes up for it with brilliant direction, superb tense action and some of the best performances I've seen so far this year.Diane Lane of ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Murder At 1600"" fame, plays a somewhat bored housewife, who dearly loves her handsome husband and son (played by Richard Gere and Erik Per Sullivan respectively). But one day she collides with an even more handsome stranger (""Before Night Falls"" Olivier Martinez) and what ensues is a tense, slow-burning, sensuous, and very satisfying thriller with an amazing (and very tragic) final act. The films stylish build-up is mesmerizing, and everybody is believable and likeable (even Diane Lane's adulteress).The amazing thing about this film is, that it sounds like the sort of film you've seen 100 times before. But, I and others I spoke to after, felt that the film was so different from the norm in the way that it gets to where it's going. I was refreshed to see a film take the surprise turns that this one did. It's an original un-original movie, if that makes sense?
Another big plus for this film was the impeccable performances. I've never seen Richard Gere reinvent himself like he does here, and as for the beautiful Diane Lane - well she simply soars. She holds the viewer in a vice like grip with her expressions, her timing, her beauty, and her human quality. It's a perfect performance and I hope that this performance wins her major kudos, because it is one of those great performances that comes along once in a while.While it is difficult to discuss the films final third without spoiling it, I will say that it is a real thrill ride. I loved this film far more than I thought I would, and I'll be going to see it again with friends soon. A great film and a 9 out of 10 for me. (A point off for some of the dialogue).",Unfaithful

It isn't a supernatural thriller like those, but it does share the same atmospheric and eerie suspense and haunting cinematography. It is a real cut above the usual Hollywood thriller and that combined with the stars exceptional and committed performances makes ""UNFAITHFUL"" a great alternative to the ""Spider Man"" and ""Star Wars"" movies.It actually appeals to me that we as an audience are respected in this film. Everything you think is gonna happen doesn't and everything you don't expect to happen does. The film sounded un-original when I read about it before seeing it.

Richard Gere looks good in the film and also turns in a great performance very different from his usual 'stud' type thing. Diane Lane is simply amazing in the role of Connie.

This was as perfect a film as I have ever seen, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it hailed as a classic. Even all the great reviews it's getting don't let you know just how very effecting and effective this great movie is. The performances by Diane Lane and Richard Gere are the best this year so far.",Unfaithful
365,ellabennathan1,"Best film of 2002! Sheer Brilliance. Diane Lane is amazing in ""Unfaithful""",10,20 May 2002,"This is the best film of 2002 for me. It has a haunting feel to it that has you thinking about the film and discussing it days later. I loved it and can't get the film out of my mind. The story is familiar but with some very neat twists and turns. The acting is nothing short of amazing, and Diane Lane (who played a similar character in ""A Walk On The Moon"" gives perhaps one of the best performances that I have ever seen in a major film. No wonder this film is doing well at the boxoffice and getting great reviews - it is simply brilliant. I was thrilled to see a film show some respect to the audience with the brilliant ending. ""Unfaithful"" is subtle, steamy, sexy, cool, intelligent and engrossing. Yet it also entertains you and haunts you for days afterwards. Brilliant! A 10!",Unfaithful

Unfaithful affected me in this way. It is simply amazing, from start to finish. It made me think about everything, about life, and what i want, and love and passion and art and my future...it made me become emotionally attached to the characters, speculate about them for forever... I've never seen a movie more than once in the theatre, except Brotherhood of the Wolf, which I saw twice....but I just watched Unfaithful for the third time tonight. And I'm still thinking about it. I've been thinking about it, and about things in my life for this past week, since I saw it for the first time on Thursday... It was just a slap in the face, made underlying things that i had previously questioned come to light, and it's made me ponder my position on other situations...this movie has seriously moved me, and really has changed my life. I urge anyone and everyone to go out and see it right away.",Unfaithful
367,unforgettable,Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen,1,23 May 2002,"Save yourself the time and effort of watching this. I cannot believe how slow and ponderous this movie was. The scenes that one would expect to be described as romantic, erotic, hot or sensual I can only describe as vulgar, crass, and obscene.At no point do you feel sympathy for the mess the female lead has gotten herself into.  At no point do you feel any simpathy for her eurotrash partner as his fate in the movie befalls him.  Richard Gere's character could be described as a sidebar. And for some reason this film was obsessed with scenes involving urine.And for some reason the director felt that if he made you listen to single notes played on a piano for minutes and minutes on end with no actor dialog that it would put you in the right state of mind to appreciate his train wreck of a film.",Unfaithful

369,martinjeeves2001,A PROVOCATIVE AND SENSUAL MASTERPIECE. A REMARKABLE FILM.,10,25 May 2002,"This is without doubt one of the best thriller/dramas I have ever seen. It follows the struggle a once happily married couple face when one commits adultery. That's not all. Things go dangerously awry (if not downright terrifying) for the couple as well, as the serious situations escalate out of control. Diane Lane owns this film in what has to be one of the alltime great performances made by an actress. She is also great to look at and redefines sexy and attractive. Richard Gere delivers the performance of his long career in a support role that asks a lot of him. Newcomer Olivier Martinez is simply charismatic and ""hunky"" as the lover. The film has a thought provoking and very intelligent message and the ending is unpredictable and very well done. 'Unfaithful' is a provocative and sensual masterpiece that is remarkably entertaining and gripping. A winner and it's boxoffice and critical acclaim are well deserved. Full marks here.",Unfaithful
370,stevenlisa,Story was underdeveloped,6,25 May 2002,"We went and saw the movie together, and both came away with the same impression.  The movie focused too much on the affair, and did not develop what should have been a great scenerio after Richard Gere confronts the young lover.  The affair, which was what the movie focused on, was impressive.  And you got some idea of what it was that drove her in her obsession.  However, we felt that what happened after would have served the audience with much more to remember than just steamy sex scenes and the the uncomfortable feeling you got from watching a partner destroy the trust and honesty in her relationship. We both however did like the ending.  From watching some promotional interviews, Richard Gere said there were a couple of endings shot for the movie, and he personally liked the ending that finally was used.  We liked it also. Anyway, if you haven't seen it yet, might want to wait till it hits video. And then, enjoy the guilty pleasures of the affair (if you can) and don't expect to feel satisfied when you are done watching it.",Unfaithful

Of course this is normal when filming a movie, but the camera-people aren't suppose to film it, and it really shouldn't have passed the editing. This gives the movie an impression of a B-movie..

Lust is not a bad thing but there are so many more emotions,feelings,reactions and consequences that could have been explored in the time available.I felt somewhat cheated.However, Gere and Lane are excellent as the central characters but could have been outstanding if given the opportunity to portray the range of all human emotions that the storyline deserves to drag this film from a mediocre 4/10 to and achievable 8/10",Unfaithful

It also makes makes you jump, it give you a couple of twists and turns. Just when you think you have it figured out, it turns a different way.  IE: When they show the knife if the kitchen.  When they show him drinking vodka at the mans apartment...what are you thinking?  When the wife figures it all out...are you scared, what do you think will happen?  It gives you questions and makes you wonder what will happen next.  It doesn't matter if NOTHING happens.  It makes you wonder and makes you think about it.",Unfaithful
377,jm_boulay,A solid drama,9,8 June 2002,"Don't go see this movie based on the fact it's labeled a thriller. Even though it includes a murder (which is not even premeditated), it actually is a drama and centers more on the damage caused by the affair.Unfaithful shows an emotional depth rarely found in mainstream movies, and the common nature of the subject (who hasn't seen unfaithful people around them?) makes it all the more involving for the audience. The film is an acting tour de force, especially on Diane Lane's part. Her portrayal of Constance Sumner, a housewife torn between the attraction she feels towards a predatory Frenchman (Paul Mortel, portrayed by Olivier Martinez) and the guilt she feels because of it is stunning. The scene where she returns home on a commuter train after their first sexual encounter and alternates between exhilaration and despair is unforgettable. Paul Mortel is reckless and causes her to take all sorts of risks of being discovered as their affair progresses, which makes her struggle to maintain the appearance of a normal life all the more interesting. Richard Gere also gives a good performance as the husband who crashes down to earth after first suspecting and then obtaining confirmation of what is going on.The movie has some weaknesses. For example, I am wondering why the police detectives couldn't get a listing of the people who called at the victim's apartment on the days before the murder. They would certainly have been able to establish a connection with the murderer. The movie also does not have an explicit ending, which may not please some viewers.However, Unfaithful is worth seeing just for the acting, and tends to sit on your mind long after you've seen it, a bit like Hitchcock's Vertigo. You'll think twice before having an affair now.",Unfaithful

The train ride home from her lovers place is the best acting I have ever seen! That's right...EVER SEEN! Diane Lane is absolutely breathtaking in this film, as she takes her character and becomes her.Unfaithful, is a powerful, gripping and involving film that is almost hypnotic in the beautiful way that it coaxes you in and grips you till the last. There is some wonderful humor in the film as well.The much hyped Diane Lane sex scenes are spectacularly done, but they are also not gratuitous.Unfaithful, is one of the best films this year with some of the best acting ever seen. Diane Lane in particular shines.",Unfaithful
379,rarand,"The force of ""Unfaithful"" is not to be measured.",10,6 June 2002,"I regard this movie as a ""perfect storm,"" fed by the hitherto unjoined forces of Lyne, Lane, Gere and Martinez.  They've taken an ordinary agony and turned it into a terrible passion, and no one who's seen it can walk away untouched (or, in some cases, undrowned).This fact (and it is a fact), is most apparent in the comments of viewers who don''t like or respect the movie (fully half the comments published thus far have expressed such a point of view).  For them, nothing has happened, everything is vulgar, obvious, boring, overdone, or entirely predictable.  Everything, that is, except for their own disappointment, indignation, or contempt, which they find rather lively and even refreshing--lucid, assured, sensible, and worthy of our consideration. If they could only add a touch of humor to their enlightened argument, they might at least give Lyne some credit for having managed to annoy them (since no one, so far as I can tell, is merely indifferent to what he's done).Some hostile viewers, recognizing that the movie does, perhaps, somehow really happen, find themselves conceding that Diane Lane does a wonderful thing in a vehicle beneath her talents.  But their point is absurd, for ""How can we tell the dancer from the dance?""  Lane herself, in a number of interviews, has given Lyne all due credit for having pushed her well past her ""plateau"".  There was no Lane before Lyne.  Somewhere she compares the experience of making this movie to the trials of giving birth, and tells us, one year after, that  she's still recovering from its labor pains. She gave birth to a performance of indelible impact.  Who knows what will follow from this--for her, for ourselves, for movies wherever they happen?One last thing:  Lyne doesn't yield up his secrets gladly.  After five viewings, I've hardly begun to read ""Unfaithful"".  and unless I'm mistaken, it will be around for a long time to come--like ""Psycho,"" or ""Casablanca"".",Unfaithful

Newcomer Olivier Martinez is as hot as any Brad Pitt, and the girls that I sat with were all swooning. However, this is Diane Lane's film and a marvellous showcase for her talents (and amazing body!). 'UNFAITHFUL' is a beautiful film that is smart, sexy, cool, haunting and thought-provoking.",Unfaithful
381,belcher1_36yazo,A powerful and intelligent study of infidelity with great acting,10,7 June 2002,"My husband and I caught Unfaithful at a screening in London. We had heard it was an impressive film and that it had been a big success in America. Having said that, I usually hate Richard Gere, although Diane Lane I feel is a great actress. Anyway, we gave it a shot and were not disappointed at all.The film builds slowly, but there are some great spots of humor which helped, especially Diane and Richard's son, who was really cute, but not annoying. The sex scenes were very erotic and very nicely and stylishly done. The tension builds begins to wind-up when Richard Gere starts to suspect that Diane Lane is doing things she shouldn't. It gets very exciting and suspenseful, and I found myself holding my breath at times.Olivier Martinez is a real find, he is very cute and has charm in abundance. This is by far the best I have seen Richard Gere for years, he looks better than he has for ages, and also gives a good performance. He actually acts extremely well here.Unfaithful is really Diane Lane's tour-de-force though, and she is so brilliant as Constance that it is hard to remember a better female star performance. When, near the end of the film, she pictures what would have happened if she'd turned the other way and not gone with Martinez, Lane is simply heart-breaking in her intensity and emotions. There is also a scene when she is travelling home on the train after a sex session and she is so overcome with conflicting emotions that she literally breaks down - laughing, crying, etc. It is a jaw-dropping piece of acting that had the audience stunned in admiration.The pivotal part of the film is when Gere confronts Martinez, and this was an extremely well done, powerful and jolting moment. Brilliantly executed and shocking in it's intensity. The more I think about Unfaithful, and believe me - you will be thinking about it long after the end credits, the more I realized how much I loved it.Unfaithful is a powerful and intelligent study of infidelity, that is hard to criticize. It really is, in my opinion, near perfect, and a definite must-see, even just for Diane Lane's mesmerizing performance.10 out of 10!",Unfaithful
382,MJM-18,Loved it,10,27 June 2002,"I really thought this was a great movie. Diane Lane's performance deserves recognition. Olivier Martinez was perfectly cast. Given his charm and looks one could see why Connie would concede to the affair. The guy is absolutely drop dead gorgeous! I love how he uses humor to seduce her. Understandably hard to resist his charm. There were some slight flaws in the making of the film (you can see Richard Gere's black undies as he is getting in the tub with his wife) And when he goes outside with the boy on the windy day - it's not windy when they show him out there. Little stupid stuff like that; however, the movie does work. I thought the ending was really perfect. I love when you leave the theatre and are still thinking of the characters. I'm still thinking about Olivier Martinez! Hope to see him in more American films!",Unfaithful

It has a Hitchcock suspense to it that is both enthralling but also very realistic and atmospheric. It is hard to imagine a better crafted or more engrossing drama with so few characters. That is ""Unfaithful""'s key I think. It has REAL characters, made all the more believable by a great cast that is at the peak of it's game.

393,ehazell_ny,DIANE LANE gives one of the ALL-TIME GREAT performances in this ASTOUNDING and RICH film,10,23 July 2002,"As a professional actor and closet playwright, I spent much of this movie humbled by what has to be, if not THE greatest, one of the greatest displays of emotional and spiritual/artistic courage ever to be put on screen. DIANE LANE (of The Perfect Storm fame) makes Anthony Hopkins' journey to find Hannibal Lecter within himself for THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS seem like a walk in the park.There are five movies that come to mind when I think of the subject of infidelity. Before this, the other four were Bertolucci's BESEIGED with Thandie Newton, of course FATAL ATTRACTION, Spike Lee's message about race JUNGLE FEVER, and DAMAGE, with an incredible role by Jeremy Irons. BESEIGED is a European art film that seeminlgy tastefully ends where the difficult questions infidelity brings to mind begin. FATAL ATTRACTION seemed to be written by women who were too afraid of being in love with cheatin' heart men to make any art; under the surface it was almost too campy in its portrayal of the crazed lunatic woman as heart of moral parable--the price of Man's playin' out on Woman--to be taken seriously. JUNGLE FEVER, as much as I love Spike when he's at the top of his game, went soft on us by making the messenger (sexuality as the basis of American racism) more important than the message (the fragility of the marriage relationship and the human soul). And DAMAGE was like a more adult version of FATAL ATTRACTION, in that it seemed to be a study of an obsession that would have destroyed a marriage if lust never came to be what drove it, not lust, marriage or infidelity itself.UNFAITHFUL is a movie that needs to be seen for a person to understand how it towers above and achieves everything that the four I just mentioned tried to do (or should have). The best double feature I could think of would be pairing this with AMERICAN BEAUTY; UNFAITHFUL could easily be seen as a sublime lesson in what the suburbs can do to the soul, and how it as such can be more dangerous to the soul than the ghetto's crime rate can be to the body and mind. *Boredom* seems to be the only motivating force leading to the eventual destruction of their entire lives in this movie--a woman's boredom. And yet what makes this film so powerful (other than, again, the triple-Oscar winning performance of DIANE LANE) is the fact that it is so well written and masterfuly directed--not to mention achieves ensemble with its supporting cast of men and women--that a clear cut motivation really does not exist. Glen Close was just crazy; Michael Douglas was just selfish; Jeremy Irons was just strung up too tight and a profoundly manipulative woman snapped him; Wesley Snipes (according to Spike) just had to have some White-ness; Thandie Newton was heartbroken...everyone had a clear cut motivation for their actions (otherwise known as the megaphone for the director in question's ideas about life the marketplace]), except DIANE LANE in UNFAITHFUL. And that is what will really disturb you to the point of needing to take a couple days out and digest the lesson on human nature you have been given by the time the credits role.If you are a RICHARD GERE fan, you will be surprised over the fact that, as good an actor as he is and can be, he triumphs in this movie almost purely by staying out of DIANE LANE's artistic way! He deserves a *most generous supporting actor* Oscar. My girlfriend's life was changed by what she saw in this movie (it deeply frightened and overwhelmed her); and I think mine was too. If you are in love or married, see this movie at your own risk. But see it. It is an astounding film, but even if you do not see it for it's story or themes--see it for some of the most amazing acting (DIANE LANE) you'll ever see. 10 stars!",Unfaithful

I love intelligent and thought provoking films that are also entertaining and compelling. However, I cannot remember an intelligent thriller being this sexy, cool and downright GREAT in a long, long time. The acting is nothing short of amazing. Diane Lane is a marvel in the film and it is a measure of her immense talent that her great performance never, ever seems O.T.T., false or hammy. It is just such a human and ""normal"" performance that makes us so sympathetic to an unsympathetic character. Lane carries the film on her shoulders and this is HER movie. One of the things that separates this from the ""Fatal Attraction"" genre is that there is no real villain. The villain is circumstance and human weakness. This has to be the thriller of the year for me. A really great film that is nearly a perfect motion picture. I hope Diane Lane is gonna be making space in her cabinet for a nice Gold Statue next year, she sure deserves it.",Unfaithful

399,ReginaldSurf,A perfect performance by Diane Lane raises Unfaithful to must-see status!,10,12 August 2002,"Unfaithful is genuinely a very, very good film. I would even go as far as calling it a great film, but what really makes this film so different from other films of this genre, is that it is the female who is Unfaithful AND she has no real reason to be. The only reason is circumstance itself. To pull this off, the film-makers had to find a special actress in order to make the character of Connie sympathetic and vulnerable despite the wrong-doing she commits. They found the perfect 'star' in consummate actress Diane Lane (from The Perfect Storm and A Walk On The Moon). Lane's performance is perfection. She is so vulnerable and heartbreakingly sympathetic despite being to a certain extent the villainess. It is her actions that have tragic repercussions that will reverborate forever, yet she is also so likeable. It takes a great actress to pull that off and Lane does it superbly while keeping us glued to the screen with her wonderful facial expressions and outstanding beauty. Richard Gere shines in the second half of the film, but this is Lane's film and she raises Unfaithful from merely a great film to a whole new level. This is a must see performance and a must see film. The best of 2002 so far and with over $100 million at the worldwide box office so far it is a deserving critical and commercial hit.",Unfaithful
400,tigerpops2000,The years best thriller with Diane Lane in astonishing form,10,16 August 2002,"Adrian Lyne's adultery hit ""Unfaithful"" is not an original film, but it does take the whole genre to a new level. The fact that Diane Lane (who gives an astonishing performance in the lead) chooses to cheat rather than is forced to is very refreshing and probably more realistic. It is also interesting to see the woman cheat for a change. So few big Hollywood films are built around actresses, so again it was nice to see ""Unfaithful"" being a big movie built around Diane Lane rather than her male co-stars (Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez). Dewey from ""Malcolm In The Middle"" also shows up well as Diane Lane's son Charlie.""Unfaithful"" is a wonderful movie, with great development and great acting.

402,Caramellights,so very real and dramatic,9,4 July 2003,I thought this movie was so close to the real thing.  You can feel what the characters are feeling.  The movie is so dramatic and intense.  It's almost as if you feel it in your own life the circumstances that could happen.  I think it's over the top.  Excellent!  I would highly recommend it for movie of the year.......Excellent!,Unfaithful

The film belongs to Diane Lane who gives the performance of the year as the star of the film. She plays Connie with a vulnerability that was simply amazing.

I didn't think I would be it was way, way better than I thought it would be. The story was good, the direction was cool, and the acting was brilliant. Diane Lane was astonishing! She's a very sexy and talented star and she carries Unfaithful on her shoulders. Her acting combined with the films sheer brilliance makes it a classic that is as good as ANY film I have seen this millennium. Fab!",Unfaithful
407,metfanmike,Great morality tale,10,31 December 2002,"This movie features an excellent cast, but especially the beautiful and sexy Diane Lane, who has never been better. This is a great morality tale which should (but probably won't) scare you off adultery. It works for me on several levels,illicit romance, suspense. One of my favorite scenes is when Diane Lane is going home on the commuter train. The bedroom scene done through flashbacks is extremely sensual. This is a must-see movie which I give a 10.",Unfaithful
408,pruittvince22,DIANE LANE's acting in this great film is unforgettable,10,9 January 2003,"DIANE LANE (of The Perfect Storm) is a revelation in this powerful and engrossing drama by Adrian Lyne (Fatal Attraction). Her acting in this film is unforgettable and I'm pleased that she is winning awards and getting nominated for her acting in this. She plays Connie, who after falling into an erotic affair, has her life (and family) falling apart around her. I watched this on DVD and loved it. The DVD was great with great picture, sound and extras. I will now be buying it without hesitation.",Unfaithful

An engrossing and thought-provoking film with a very haunting and provocative feel to it. Diane Lane especially was magnificent in one of the best displays of acting I have ever seen. Unfaithful is without a doubt one of the best films of the past year. Really, really good.",Unfaithful

I like it too because of emotion. Good emotion and best acting by Diane Lane who is very sexy. Rich Gere was good but Diane Lane is best. The story is about unfaithful wife (Diane Lane) and how her life and family is turned upside down by infidelity. 10 out of 10.,Unfaithful
411,oscarswitzerland,diane lane is great in this great film,10,17 January 2003,i loved this great film. it was one of the most suspenseful films that i've ver seen. very exciting and erotic. diane lane was great and she should win the academy award for best actress. the pace is quite slow but very engrossing and entertaining. a great film to watch with your loved one or on your own.,Unfaithful
412,carolgordon_77,Diane Lane gives an Academy Award worthy performance in this wonderful film,10,18 January 2003,"Diane Lane gives an Academy Award worthy performance in this wonderful film by the director of 'Fatal Attraction'. Lane is both sexy but sympathetic in her role as a woman who wrecks her life and the lives of her family for a sexy adulterous affair with a handsome stranger. It sounds a bit tacky, but the film is made in such a classy and atmospheric way that it is a very powerful, moving and memorable experience to watch it, not least due to Diane Lane brilliance as an actress.",Unfaithful
413,candycanekubrick,At last a great film about infidelity and it's repurcussions,10,22 January 2003,"Unfaithful is nothing short of a masterpiece of the genre. At last a great film that shows the real repurcussions of infidelity. At the same time the movie is very watchable, thanks largely to a breathtaking performance by it's star Diane Lane (The Perfect Storm, Streets Of Fire). It is a great film that will stay with you long after the end. Highly recommended for those who love great films with great acting.",Unfaithful
414,NickyFarrell7,DIANE LANE gives years best performance in this classy thriller,10,31 January 2003,"UNFAITHFUL is a very classy film which is very sexy and entertaining, but also with a very powerful and thoughtprovoking subject. The film is both a thriller and a character study. DIANE LANE excels as the star of the film and she gives the years BEST performance as Connie, the conflicted wife. The DVD is as classy as the film itself. Wonderful sound and picture nd with more extras than is usual. It takes HOURS to get through it all. This is a classy and entertaining film on a great DVD package. As for DIANE LANE, she is winnning TONS of awards for this performance - I just hope she wins the big one - the OSCAR! Her acting is THAT GOOD!",Unfaithful
415,nicki_farrell7,"Forget your expectations, this is an exceptional film",10,7 February 2003,UNFAITHFUL is an exceptional film. For those of you who think that UNFAITHFUL is another FATAL ATTRACTION rip-off please forget it. UNFAITHFUL stands well and truly on it's own with some very unique and interesting twists on the whole infidelity thriller genre. DIANE LANE is the star of the film and she acts exceptionally here (surely deserving of an Oscar nomination at minimum). RICHARD GERE is also very good in a role so very different from what we expect. OLIVIER MARTINEZ is gorguous and holds his own against the two Hollywood heavyweight stars. The film is exceptional from the well staged start to the breathtaking (if ambiguous) ending. Brilliant and well worth buying or renting on a feature packed DVD.,Unfaithful
416,cornish_adams,Oscar nominee (possibly winner?) DIANE LANE is fantastic in this moving and powerful drama,10,13 February 2003,"DIANE LANE for an Oscar!!! Oscar nominee (and winner of countless other awards this year) DIANE LANE (voted Star of the Year 2003) is GREAT in UNFAITHFUL. It is one of THE GREAT performances of all time and it will always be remembered as such. A stunning piece of acting that makes UNFAITHFUL even better than it already is. A class film made all the more classy by a classy star! Well done DIANE!!!! The film is directed by the guy who made FATAL ATTRACTION and he knows how to make a cool movie with some very erotic but stylishly done scenes. The plot is familiar, but told in a very different and engrossing way. You'll be on the edge of your seat. RICHARD GERE is also very good but this is the DIANE LANE show. Fantastic!",Unfaithful
417,peteandles,Academy Award nominee DIANE LANE - the best acting I've ever seen!,10,18 February 2003,UNFAITHFUL is a smart film. It is subtle in the way that it tells it's tragic story. The film is very realistic and human and that is helped by the amazing acting. Academy Award nominee (she should win!) DIANE LANE does some of the best acting I have EVER seen! The anguish on her face at times is unbearable as she descends into more and more trouble. This is a great film for adults. Very worthwhile. 10 out of 10.,Unfaithful
418,adamcleggson22,A stunning film! Diane Lane deserves all her awards and her Oscar nomination.,10,27 February 2003,UNFAITHFUL was a stunning motion picture. Everything about this movie is classy and cool. DIANE LANE (who is a favourite of mine - any actress who claims to have a fetish for thigh-high boots is cool in my mind!) gives a great performance and thoroughly deserves her awards and Oscar nomination. It was one of the most talked about and acclaimed performances of the year and I hope that means she wins the Oscar! Gere is also surprisingly effective in this stunning film. Well done Mr Adrian Lyne and Ms Lane!,Unfaithful
419,skidzmagrooder,I loved this. Diane Lane deserves her awards.,10,5 March 2003,I loved UNFAITHFUL and so did my wife. Both of us were drawn in by the great direction and super acting by DIANE LANE (who I recognised as the female lead in THE PERFECT STORM). I'm pleased she's won so many awards and an Oscar nomination. It is truly a great and unforgettable performance in a movie that will have you talking for hours. Excellent!,Unfaithful
420,kiki62,Who needs reasons?,8,8 March 2003,"People suggesting there's no reason for Connie to have an affair... are right, but that's the beauty of it all. Doesn't infidelity often come out of nowhere? Where would be the drama if Gere's character would be a brute or whatever. Imo a very clever choice to tell it like this. Lane is superb, Gere is surprisingly different. Lane performance in the train after her first intimate encounter is fabulous! As are the beautiful shot lovescenes. It's obvious by the way some comments fail to see the true meaning and daring way these were shot, that it had better left to Europeans. People from the US would rather see a head being blown off than two people making love. What's wrong with you people? Is it getting to 'close', to recognizable? Let it go, these prudish frustrations, and enjoy. Get into the skin of those people and maybe THEN you'll understand that there doesn't always have to be a reason for cheating!",Unfaithful
421,isesinc,"She was hot, hot, hot ...",9,23 March 2004,"(Spoilers ahead). Lane (Oscar nomination), Gere, and Martinez put on a tour-de-force of acting that propels this erotic thriller to greater and greater heights of tension (sexual and otherwise) until it's almost unbearable.Lane, in particular, communicates the full range of emotions, from passion to joy to fear to guilt, without dialog, doing it all with her facial expressions and her body language. A superior performance. The way the snow-globe was used as a prop is a good example of some terrific writing.
I know some thought the ambiguous ending was something of a cop out, but I thought it was perfect (I'm betting that they pull into the police station and turn themselves in). I highly recommend this film. 9 out of 10.",Unfaithful
422,armensarvar,Everything a movie needs to be remembered.,8,4 May 2003,"Unfaithful is a good movie, It has everything to be a good movie. It has a meaningful scenario,smart dialogues and outstanding performance from it's actors. Gere is passing the test for being a looser, I think he deserves an Oscar nomination.Leen is exagerating in the train, it's sort of artificial, but the rest is fantastic, specially the part she washes the dishes. The French guy is exactly what a man like that should be,his speaking English simltaniusly weak and smart is perfect and his serving Vodka to his killer is played so well. The Little boy also acts good, his face helps him to show what motives might a woman have to be unfaithful.",Unfaithful
423,spazit20,Great performance by Oscar nominee Diane Lane,10,2 June 2003,"This was a really cool flick. It was very suspenseful and you really feel for the characters and their plight. The acting was top drawer and of a high quality the whole time. An especially great performance by star Diane Lane was simply breathtaking. She deserved her Oscar nomination and Richard Gere was very good as well. Diane Lane and Richard Gere's scenes together were very moving, while Lane's scenes with the French guy were very hot and sexy. A really good allround flick.",Unfaithful
424,Mike20Pelham,Diane Lane rocks in this stunning adultery drama,10,7 June 2003,"There can be few actresses as good as Diane Lane. I thought she was great in 'A Walk On The Moon', 'The Perfect Storm' and many of her others, but in 'Unfaithful'!!?? Well... she completely rocks. She is so sexy, yet at the same time she is so sympathetic and vulnerable. This is a stellar performance that should put her high on the Hollywood A-List. The film is built entirely around Lane's character and I was pleased about that as her character is the focus of the film. A very well made and involving adultery drama with Lane in stunning form.",Unfaithful
425,jennifergally,Oscar nominee Diane Lane is seductive and sexy in Unfaithful,10,23 June 2003,"Unfaithful was an extremely powerful movie and was much, much more than what i had expected when i rented the dvd. Diane Lane was the main reason i got this film out because i had heard so many good things about her performance and that she has won the Oscar nomination for best actress in the films main role. Well, the hype was true. The film is excellent and Diane is seductive, sexy and downright awesome as the films main focus. She proves here what many believed before... she is a beautiful and talented star capable of carrying a movie. Richard Gere gives very solid support to her and the films director really knows his game. An all around winner.",Unfaithful

Her performance is so raw and passionate that I was amazed that she didn't win the Oscar (instead she was nominated for Best Actress). The film is very engrossing and interesting and it held my attention and had me talking afterwards. It was cool, entertaining and thought-provoking, yet it DIANE LANE that made it such a great and memorable film. The DVD is great! With tons of extras that are both quality and quantity. One day this will be dubbed a masterpiece. 10/10.",Unfaithful
427,jessica6582,Soft core porn for housewives,3,15 January 2004,"I found this movie very disturbing.  In my opinion, it was made as soft core porn for housewives - something for them to imagine -- ""Oh I wish i could bang a guy that hot when I'm that old...no wait, maybe if i do my husband will kill him...""  I didn't get any kind of a message out of it except that it would be a good movie to watch if you have kids and are bored with your life.",Unfaithful
428,bhwaltmay,Overall Great Movies - some character reactions unlikely,9,10 January 2006,"I find this movie haunting - in that I continually think about what my reactions would be in the husband's place. Diane Lane's performance is perfect - with facial expressions wonderfully conveying thoughts without dialogue. What is less convincing is the husband's preparedness to continue the marriage in the face of total betrayal - especially in view of the retribution exacted on the Lover (also a bit unconvincing with regard to the cover up attempt) Adrian Lyne's film is so much better than the original French, ""La Femme Infidèle"" - which suffers from the same problems, stated above, but with that version there is no information on the actual infidelity.",Unfaithful
429,ix42,Worst. Movie. Ever.,1,21 March 2004,"The director creates cardboard characters, runs them through every cliche in the book, and then insults the intelligence of the audience by trying to make us care about them.The pacing is abysmally slow. It's almost as if the director wants us to focus on those little artsy things that your English teacher liked so much way back in high-school. Here's a hint for the director: Symbolism works best when we aren't hit over the head with it. Hidden meaning loses its effect when it isn't hidden.The worst part is, I will never get those two hours of my life back.",Unfaithful
430,anchoress,Meh,5,9 May 2006,"I know a lot of people who disliked this movie, and I'm one of them. We fall into two camps; people who were expecting a relationship movie but got a thriller, and people who were expecting a thriller but got a relationship movie. I fall into the latter group.I won't summarise the plot, that's been done. Let's just say that the main problem with this flick is that it doesn't know what it's trying to be. Is it Fatal Attraction with a more sympathetic third wheel, or is it Terms of Endearment with a murder? Whichever it's trying to be, IMO it mostly fails. I gave the movie a rating of 5/10 because I only give *really* low ratings to totally crap flicks (which this wasn't), but IMO it really isn't much of a film.The other problem with the movie is the two leads. Now I'm partially biased because I really really don't like Diane Lane, but geez, she's such a cold fish in this flick. My mom and I were discussing the movie and she said something interesting... I was telling her how I just thought her preoccupation with her paramour was not believable, and my mom said it was like she was in a 'sexual thrall'... she wasn't in love, she wasn't infatuated, she wasn't even in lust: she was enthralled. What does that mean? Well, if you don't understand, chat me and I'll give you my mom's phone number, you can call her and ask. I can't explain it but it makes sense to me.But IMO the problem isn't just Ms Lane, it's her costar (don't remember the dude's name, the lover). He's cute and all, but to me he's just so, so, so un-sensual, unattractive, and completely unbelievable as a home-wrecker. I can't imagine *ever* risking my marriage for someone like him. In fact, the only scenes where he seems comfortable and attractive are his scenes with Richard Gere.Actually, Ms Lane seems not bad in her scenes with other actors, either, it's just with him that she seems totally unbelievable.On the plus side, Richard Gere was pretty good and the city looked great.",Unfaithful
431,GoldenLifeIsMe,Loved 'Unfaithful',9,3 March 2005,"The reason I love this movie so much is not because of what might initially stands out with people. This movie is a great example that things are not always what they seem. It looked as if Constance had the perfect life, yet she was willing to risk everything. But the truth is, she really wasn't happy. Her husband gave her the life he 'thought' she wanted. Once she got caught up, she had an out of body of experience. She didn't even know who she was anymore..wearing different kinds of clothing. She was blatantly lying to her husband and got comfortable with the fact that he would never check up on her, such the irony of her life.",Unfaithful
432,drmamm,Weak plot. Two movie stars saved a substandard film.,4,8 February 2005,"The movie does not present a persuasive argument for a woman married to a handsome, sexually active man to cheat on him (presumably for the first time); a man whom she loved. I believe without a compelling reason, the movie is seriously flawed. Furthermore, when she saw her lover with another girl and instead of breaking up with him to end an affair that made her miserable, she has sex with him. I am not really sure that a souvenir glass bowl is a strong enough tool to kill a healthy young man without even breaking. By the way, why would any woman give her lover a souvenir snow dome that her husband bought for his home?",Unfaithful
433,ahfireworks,Awesome and Captivating,10,12 April 2021,"This movie is by far the best if not the best drama of this generation. It has all the ingredients that'll blow your mind away. The steamy romance, the betrayal, the guilt, the pain, the addiction for more knowing what the outcome will be but can't end it. The reason why I personally felt this movie is because I've been there before. But anyway, yes this is a great movie with a very sad ending and the music score really jabs you real hard.",Unfaithful

436,sankalp-66088,A haunting yet a well made movie,7,19 September 2018,"A movie ranging from extreme emotions of
absolute lust to absolute digust and guilt towards oneself. At times the scenes containing sex certainly made me feel unsettled and when you watch it from Edward's perspective, you do feel that harsh reality being thrust upon you very forcefully. The emotions of regret from Connie and those of pure spite from a cheated Edward felt truly honest when you try to picture yourself in that scenario. Overall it was a well paced movie with an impressive range of emotions that would certainly make the viewers very repulsive towards having such an affair.",Unfaithful

Acting was good but not great. I kept waiting for the exciting turn but even the death scene was none climatic.There was really no ending, just a long discussion and nothing is done. No tense moments, no twist, no nothing... just 2 hours and then its over.Why the 9 out of 10? well it must have connected with my wife as I got a handi for the 3rd act and that alone is worth the price of admission...",Unfaithful
