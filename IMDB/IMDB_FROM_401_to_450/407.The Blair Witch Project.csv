0,Leofwine_draca,A film that turned me into a nervous wreck,10,21 December 2015,"On a Sunday morning in 1999 I made a rare venture to a multiplex cinema, which is 17 or so miles away from my house. I don't usually make a habit of travelling that sort of distance to see a mere film, but I felt that this one in particular was special. I mean, nobody on the face of this planet can fail to have heard of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, a low budget independent production which took Hollywood by storm and became the most profitable film of all time. My expectations were high, based on the hype. Then it began...I remembered hearing that the dizzying camera work could induce nausea, but happily I was not afflicted in this way. The shaky hand-held camera didn't annoy me in the least, and in fact within just a few minutes I was settled into the film, engrossed. As time went on, my nerves began to fray along with those of the guys on screen, and my heart beat faster. By the end of the film I might have well as been a nervous wreck. Because, more than any other film I've seen in my life, this film scared me. Yes, it was creepy and extremely disturbing too, but mainly it was just scary.Now I've read all the negative comments about the film simply not being scary. I can understand this, because for one to be truly affected by the film then you have to make an effort to engross yourself in the events, to believe that they are real, to not get distracted by the person sitting next to you. It's easy to sit back and laugh, but it's hard to actually get into a film and be there with the characters. Thankfully I did this and I had one of the scariest experiences of my life, an experience which left me scared to go to sleep that night in case I dreamt about it (I didn't, though, thankfully).The inventive use of the hand-held cameras really makes the viewer feel as if he/she is there in the film. Well, not totally perhaps, but halfway between reality and the celluloid strip. While the film may not be totally original (take, for example, the previous year's THE LAST BROADCAST), in the light of contemporary dull 'post-modern' horror films like SCREAM 2, HALLOWEEN H20 and THE FACULTY, this is a breath of fresh air. I've heard people moan and complain that nothing happens and you don't get to see anything. Well, that's the point...it's left up to your imagination, and I suppose that if you don't have one, then the film just won't scare you. It's the viewer who's lacking, not the film.The acting is surprisingly brilliant and realistic. You really get to feel for the actors by the end of the film, and each of the three is a solid, well-drawn person who could be a neighbour. Michael Williams is the most likable of the three, he loses his cool first but then regains it at the end. Joshua Leonard is the most tragic of the three as he sits and cries, and you really feel sorry for his character. Many people have said they didn't like Heather Donahue, but I thought she was amazing. The best bit has to be when she holds the camera up to her face and apologises to the trio's parents. Heather is believable, sympathetic, and her performance really tugs at the heart. The film may have a high level of swearing, but then again I'm sure if I was in that situation I wouldn't mind my language. The trio are simply superb and their acting creates believable characters to sympathise with and understand throughout.The woods are a perfect setting to conjure up fear (see THE EVIL DEAD and many others) and this film makes full use of them. Behind every tree lurks an unseen menace. I've been in the woods myself at night, and the atmosphere is just right. I don't know if I'll be able to venture into them again in the dark, though. There are also some surprisingly intense moments when the students fight amongst each other, some say that these are funny but they actually brought tears to my eyes...not because I was sad, but just because of the ferocity and violence and because I felt so sorry for the three.The actual horror elements in the film are outstanding, subtle and all the more effective for it. The piles of stones and stick men hanging in the trees are very disturbing, as is the slime covering the backpack. The worst of all has to be the teeth and things wrapped in the cloth, a moment which is hard to watch. The night time scenes are the most chilling, with the unknown noises and even the - shudder - sound of cackling and a baby crying. So creepy, and so frightening. The bit where the tent is violently attacked from the outside comes out of nowhere, and made me jump out of my seat in terror, it's that horrible. And of course the finale in the ruined house is just totally eerie with the laughing and the jolting, disorientating cameras spinning around in a last desperate rush. The final frames of the film are the most inexplicable and unnatural and leave the viewer pondering events well after the film is over to draw their own conclusions.As you might just be able to tell, I loved THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT which easily lived up to the hype in my opinion. I'll be sure to buy the video when it comes out. Unmissable, a classic, I can't praise this film enough. The scariest thing I have ever seen!",The Blair Witch Project
1,SnoopyStyle,Birth of a sub-genre,6,4 October 2014,"In October 1994, three film students Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard and Mike Williams (their real names) disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland. A year later, their cameras are found. There is a local legend of The Blair Witch and missing children. They were there to do a documentary.This is the granddaddy of the found footage movies. This could be scary if the audience buys into the film as real. I didn't and it's not scary for me. It's a little too shaky and rambling. I am reminded of Michael Moore talking about what a revelation the tripod is. Also the start is excruciatingly slow. It's an interesting idea that birthed a whole new genre. That's no easy task. However, it achieves very little more than that for me. It is more dizzying than frightening.",The Blair Witch Project
2,Hitchcoc,I really wanted to enjoy it!!!!,6,24 January 2000,"Well, here we are in this woods (which doesn't seem to have a lot of trees; it looks more like a city park).  But we have wandered in far enough to get ourselves turned around. That's cool.  We are already spooked by the legends and our minds are playing games with us.  One of our problems is that we are all so self centered (nineties kinds of people) that we don't listen.  We whine, we complain, we don't think.  We film everything creatively but we also have a really stupid streak.  I thought the actors were very good. It's what they portrayed that bothered me.  Wouldn't it be good to have a look at what was going on outside the tent at night. It could have been a fringe group of the Girl Scouts.  Why was it categorically accepted that a fire should not be set.  If the witch is out there, then wouldn't you want to see it, or at least let it get itself singed.  Hey, you're in a tent. What could be more unprotected (we all know the stories about grizzley bears that treat small tents as doggy bags). Hey, maybe we could put someone at the door and let the others sleep!!! Why do we start running?  Where are we going?  There's nothing chasing us.  The power of suggestion takes over a little quickly here.  Why go into that house?  Why try to find that guy?  I mean, your first order of business is to find a way back. I felt for them and I thought the frantic camera work was interesting.  I just couldn't get past the stupidity of the people and their lack of survival instincts and self protectiveness. I agree that experimental cinema is wonderful and I'm glad that this has done well. Hollywood gets pretty tiresome.  But this movie didn't click with me.",The Blair Witch Project
3,mark.waltz,The wait in watching this wasn't worth it.,2,14 October 2021,"A good half hour or more shows the three principals of this phony horror documentary discussing human gas, chest hair and the skipper and Gilligan. The film is only 81 minutes and the obnoxious Heather Donahue seems to drop the f bomb once a minute. Then there's the other assorted curse words she interject, verbally abusing the two young men with her as they search for evidence to prove the existence of the Blair Witch. Eventually they are all snapping at each other to the point where you begin to hope that this was real and that the Blair Witch did get them.The first five minutes interviewing ""locals"" is much more interesting than what happens when the three are alone, and the shaky camera after a while becomes annoying and waiting for anything supernatural to occur becomes interminable. This was a big smash which proves the old P. T. Barnum slogan that there is a sucker born every minute. I support independent filmmaking and new ideas, but this is a wreck in every way that gave me a headache after half an hour.",The Blair Witch Project
4,nogodnomasters,I want to avoid any cheese,6,19 January 2018,"I feel like I am the last person on the planet to have seen this film and I could have left it off my bucket list. This is the mother of the hand held genre with Heather Donahue being the cut off face that launched a 1,000 films. I found the premise to be interesting. The interviews with locals seemed extremely real and not boring. The internal conflict the group has in the woods was over done and was more grating than entertaining. Yes, I wanted to kick the crap out of Michael (Williams) too. It is iconic, so I watched it.Utz chips and beer is indeed the meal of champions.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Heather Donahue gives us the best Up-Nostril since José Ferrer in ""Cyrano de Bergerac.""",The Blair Witch Project
5,lee_eisenberg,Not exactly a masterpiece.,7,17 October 2005,"It goes without saying that we fear that which we don't know. And in ""The Blair Witch Project"", we sure as hell don't know what's out there. It's only the three filmmakers growing more and more scared. I will admit that I didn't find this movie to be as great as most people thought, but it does send a shiver down your spine, just because you don't know what's out there. I would never have wanted to go out into the woods alone to begin with, and now I really don't (although I don't believe these legends about spooks in the woods). Either way, this was an unprecedented movie when it came out - especially since it out-grossed flicks like ""Eyes Wide Shut"".",The Blair Witch Project
6,jboothmillard,The Blair Witch Project,8,8 July 2005,"This was marketed very well by the internet and word-of-mouth as ""found footage"", many people at first thought it was real, obviously this turned out to be untrue, it was a low-budget movie ($40,000) with no stars, no special effects and no gimmicks, but it proved a box office sensation. Basically in 1994, three student filmmakers, Heather Donahue, Joshua 'Josh' Leonard and Michael 'Mike' Williams (all using their own names) started a ""documentary"" interviewing the people of Burkittsville, Maryland, formerly named Blair, to hear their views and opinions of the local legend, of the ""Blair Witch"". They plan to travel to the woods and find evidence of the legend, they carry with them camping gear, a map and their video cameras. Soon after starting their trek however they get lost, they find themselves going around in circles, the map is lost, they hear strange noises in the dark, and in the daylight they find strange piles of rocks and wood symbols hanging in the trees. Josh is separated and disappears, Heather famously sobs (with lots of snot) about their impending doom, she and Mike realise that something is out there and tormenting or hunting them, and they both eventually meet their fate in a secluded and dilapidated house. All the footage and sound captured by the cameras was ""discovered"" in the woods a year later, this is what the viewer is watching. Away from the hype surrounding the film at the time, it proves that even the simplest of films, with improvised acting and action, shaky camera- work and no explicit material (you never see any monster), can become a cinema landmark. Cannibal Holocaust may have been the first ""found footage"" horror film, but this broke new ground, there would certainly be no Paranormal Activity or Cloverfield without this film, and it is genuinely freaky to watch, a terrific independent psychological horror. It was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!",The Blair Witch Project
7,ccthemovieman-1,"Inventive Approach, But Marketing Was Disgraceful",3,13 August 2007,"I never really was interested in watching this but when it got so much publicity, I thought it would be worth a shot to give it a look. I should have saved my money. I don't really find a film featuring ultra-profane, punk college kids that appealing. The movie might have been effective at what it aimed to do - to scare people - but it was just too sleazy for me. Of the three leads, the girl is probably the most annoying because of her smugness.My main complaint is really not the movie so much as it was the marketing. This movie was viewed by millions of teenagers, and that's what the producers wanted. That, along with the college crowd, was their target audience. Hey, as far as college kids seeing this, I have no problem, but not high school kids.To promote a film to that young a crowd - which it undeniably did - and have over 130 f- words, over 60 uses of ""sh-t,"" 20 usages of the Lord's name in vain and tons of other profanities - all in a paltry 80 minutes - is absolutely ridiculous and just plain wrong.I recognize the inventive film-making. They make it look - effectively so - that the kids in the story are filming some sort of documentary. It certainly has that feel to it and it's very realistic in that regard. It doesn't rely on gore but on a psychological level for the horror. It shows the evilness of witchcraft and the occult. No problem.....but.....I still remember my local library having an entire wall on where the computers are located, promoting this film, reading ""Hey, kids - It's Blair Witch Month. Celebrate with us....blah, blah, blah."" I am not making that up. Unbelievable, but that's our Liberal libraries these days. I guess that's what still ""sticks in my craw"" about this movie. It should have been promoted ""for adults only,"" but it wasn't.",The Blair Witch Project
8,Tweekums,If you go down to the woods tonight...,8,8 January 2009,"I'd heard rather a lot of hype about this film before seeing it, I'm not sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing, on the one hand few films live up to their hype on the other without that hype I probably wouldn't have seen it at all. While I don't think it is the ""scariest movie ever made"" it is certainly very creepy and makes the viewer feel that they are lost in the woods with the protagonists.At the start of the film we are told that three students, Heather, Josh and Mike, disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville (formerly called Blair) in Maryland while investigating the local legend and that a year later their equipment had been found and what we are then shown is the film recorded by them before their disappearance. Once the three of them have joined up and got their equipment together they head to Burkittsville where they interview some of the locals about the legends before heading off in to the woods to film the sites where the events in the legend are alleged to have taken place. All goes fairly well until the trio try to return to their car, while camping over night they here strange noises outside their tent and the next day despite following the map they don't manage to find their car. The same happens the next day and the next etc. as the days progress they get more and more distressed, especially as whatever is outside the tent each night is leaving strange items in the trees and messing with their equipment.I have tried to keep the spoilers to a minimum as the less you know about what happens in the woods the more disturbing the film is likely to be. If you are put off horror films by gore then this is a safe film to watch as there is almost no gore, the scares all come from being lost while some one or something is messing with your head. The way that it is filmed also adds to the atmosphere, quite often the camera is pointing and something away from the action or in the night scenes there is no image at all, just sound. The acting was very natural probably because most of it was unscripted.",The Blair Witch Project
9,BA_Harrison,Please excuse my incoherent ramblings: I was up late last night watching an over-rated horror film.,5,2 August 2010,"I had always thought that arachnophobia—the fear of spiders—was the most common of phobias, but thanks to The Blair Witch Project, I now know better: the irrational fear of small twigs and pebbles is far more prevalent. It's the only explanation I have for the phenomenal worldwide success of a horror film in which stick figures and tiny piles of stones are considered to be the stuff of nightmares?Whilst I am, of course, fully aware that big sticks and stones can break your bones (as the childhood saying goes), inanimate small pieces of rock and the lesser of branches hold no real fear for me. As a result, I didn't find The Blair Witch Project anywhere near as frightening as the millions who are afflicted by Stickstonophobia (surprisingly, I could find no official scientific term for this widespread condition, so I coined this one myself!).Admittedly, I did find some of the strange noises that occurred during the night fairly creepy (after all, they might have been made by big spiders), and the way that the film-makers were unable to find their way back to their car was unsettling (I've lost my bearings in the woods myself, and this brought back bad memories), but the ending—when Heather and Mike enter the dilapidated old house at the end of the film—was simply frustrating: surely everyone knows that derelict houses are deathtraps.Sure enough, both characters lose their footing on the obviously rotten floors and die. Or something like that.",The Blair Witch Project
10,moonspinner55,"Canny, clever novice filmmaking",6,28 June 2001,"Independently-produced thriller filmed on videotape concerning 3 student filmmakers making a documentary about the haunted woods near their Maryland homes. Those looking for a slambang chiller will be disappointed--the budget obviously didn't allow for special effects--but the movie certainly works as an examination of the deterioration of the human mind in crisis, complete with dissension and hysteria. The actors are extremely capable and the results are largely creepy for a one-time viewing. It also deserves credit for tapping into the sudden need in America for ""real"" entertainment. **1/2 from ****.",The Blair Witch Project
11,dbdumonteil,Tom Thumb has a picnic at hanging rock.,9,14 January 2002,"This movie,along with ""the sixth sense"" and some recent other ones ,is the volte-face of the fantasy and horror genre.The disappearance of these special effects which has been defacing the ""scary movies"" since ,say,""the exorcist"".A return to pure psychological suspense.Like Don Siegel 's ""invasion of the body snatchers""(1956),there are here no stars,and a shoestring budget.The form is unique,for it is an amateur camera work,almost a draft,giving the terrible feeling the heroes have really been through it all.The fears we feel in this work recall childhood terrors:the forest,when you are small may be beguiling ,but it's also an unknown world.Who has never been afraid of getting lost in this maze of trees and bushes?That's Tom Thumb syndrome:in the movie,the heroine's map is an equivalent of Tom Thumb's stones.These stones which the three lads find in front of the tent might be a nod in the direction of Charles Perrault;as the (witch's?) house might be a hint at Grimm's ""Hansel and Gretel"".Most of the terror happens in the midday sun:a fantasy and horror movie does not necessarily mean darkness.I would go as far as saying that the scenes in the daylight are the scariest:Peter Weir opened up the way in 1977 with his classic ""picnic at hanging rock"".The three characters 'roaming round this quiet place , waiting for SOMETHING to happen,all this is  extremely disturbing.There's an impending menace,but we do not know exactly what it is,and our fears are  increased tenfold.Strange signs along the way ,a gruesome treasure hunt. At night,the screen becomes sometimes completely black:in all,about five minutes(!),enough to put the spectator in a cold sweat.Like ""picnic at hanging's rock"" or""the haunting"" (1963),the ending leaves you in front of a huge hole.A movie to treasure.",The Blair Witch Project
12,Quinoa1984,One of the scarriest films ever,10,6 May 2000,"This film is not like those usual killer with weapon slasher movies in which everyone in the theater screams when something scary happens.  This is the type of film where you watch the proceedings and are so afraid when you leave the theater you feel paralized.  Why, because this film is so realistic, it looks like this is actually the footage found in Maryland. But no, it isn't, and that is what makes Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myrick such good directors.  They just give the cameras to the cast and let them run rampant. This film shows what happens when 3 student film-makers (Heather Donahue is excellent in the best female lead of the year, Michael Williams is convincing as a scarred and insane sound man, and Joshua Leonard is exceptional as a mad cameraman) who get lost in the woods of Burkittsville, Maryland.  What follows is scarrier than anything I've seen in a really long time, and it is enjoyable (especially in the dark).  One of the best films of the year.  A++",The Blair Witch Project
13,michaelRokeefe,Can things that go bump in the night really hurt you?,7,6 February 2000,"This movie chills and thrills. You bite your nails as you squirm in your seat. You want to be medicated in defense of the bouncy, jerky camera work. The sound engineer deserves a lot of credit for setting the moods and flow of this project. In the winter of 1994, three student film makers go into the woods near Burkittesville, Maryland to film a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch. A year later, their interrupted video search is found. No trace of the trio; and now their disappearance becomes part of the mystery.  Unknown actors make this thing more believable. Heather Donahue was pretty darn good. Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams were her partners. The final sequence and last ten seconds in particular left me scared as hell. I had nightmares three nights in a row. Give it a chance. The non-professionalism makes fear more believable. Try it, you'll like it.",The Blair Witch Project

15,Scarecrow-88,The Blair Witch Project,10,12 August 2008,"""We are going to die out here."" Hard to believe it's been practically a decade since ""The Blair Witch Project"" was all the buzz, revolting some with how it would not give in allowing us to see what is terrorizing these three unfortunate would-be documentarian filmmakers, causing some audience-goers to almost up-chuck at the dizzying, skakey camera work(..but, if you think about it, this only gives this piece merit, these are amateur filmmakers who have yet to truly master the right form of precise camera-movement), and leaving many furiously duped at how producers claimed it was real, that footage of vanished film students had been found and pieced together for our benefit. Watching it for the first time since, hell, 2000 I guess, I was surprised at how this gave me the creeps. It was as if I were with them, deep into the woods lost, the sinister trappings of wilderness imprisoning me. I envisioned just what it would be like, there in that tent hearing noises out in the distance, even those giggly sounds of children brought chills up and down my spine..particularly when you see and hear the slight pounding on the exterior of the tent. I mean, snapping twigs and sticks out in the darkness actually gave me the willies. At first, I could understand how three film students, Heather, Josh, & Michael would find their little adventure such a thrill..it was like a vacation with the goal of capturing a documentary for an extra grade in school lifting their average of say B- to possibly a B+. This documentary, as seen early on, seems to be little more than to photograph and convey the legend of some Witch who supposedly haunts the woods. It's treated with rolled eyes as locals share what they know second-hand about it, providing our students with fuel for later laughter. I enjoyed how, as this continues, the camaraderie deteriorates eventually leading to shouting matches and ridicule. I found this actually rather believable and realistic, it worked for me. I could see a couple of people I either barely know, or know just from reputation, getting lost with yours truly as the guide with these sort of reactionary emotions and situations happening. These are just people with everyday jobs hoping for brighter futures facing unforeseen horrors which spiral out of their control despite the fact that getting lost in the woods in our modern age shouldn't happen. Is it some mythical witch behind the spooky noises and unusually shaped rocks and stick-men? The film sure paints a picture of this in the final moments as Heather and Michael enter an eerie dilapidated house with children's hand-prints and ritualistic symbols inscribed on the walls as Josh cries for their help. The basement with a person standing with their face to the wall as a camera falls helpless to the ground after a hard thud sure opens up the scary idea that something truly disturbing was happening away from the camera. I like not knowing because I could just imagine the horrors taking place as if it were me being treated to a rude awakening that far from the civilization I know lies in the heart of the wilderness evil has freedom over those unlucky enough to enter it's domain. I know that a lot of f-king people hate this with an absolute passion, but this sure worked for me..I mean just think about it for a minute:lost in the woods, sounds and voices in the distance, you have heard about a supposed witch haunting the woods, one amongst your party is kidnapped with his agony just out of reach echoing the wilderness, and rocks(..not to mention something bloody wrapped in a napkin, neatly intertwined within sticks, cloth & string)formed in a specific manner warning you that you are not alone. It sure would have me peeing in my pants.",The Blair Witch Project
16,Hey_Sweden,A good & creepy modern fright flick.,7,9 February 2012,"""The Blair Witch Project"" can be seen as a movie along the lines of 1978's ""Halloween"": it may not be original stuff (think ""Cannibal Holocaust"", made approximately two decades before this movie, in this case), but it certainly popularized its particular sub genre, the ""found footage"" sub genre, for better and for worse. This marvel of marketing deserves its props for one main reason, and that's the way it uses its low, low budget to its advantage, placing all of its horrors squarely inside the heads of its viewers, forcing them to use their imaginations to conjure up their own demons. The story hardly needs summarizing by this point, but suffice it to say that it presents itself as the ""real"" footage of three student filmmakers who get lost in the wilderness of Maryland while investigating a local legend. What this viewer has to say, in his own personal experience, is that repeat viewings have helped him to appreciate it more than he used to. A large part of the appeal is the *very* rural setting, and the idea of being lost in this setting and having no idea where to go, possibly ending up going in circles, which would be an extremely distressing thought. Now, the largely improvised dialogue is no great shakes, but it does offer a realistic enough account of the way that humans under extreme stress may very well speak, alternating between sniping at each other and trying to bolster each others' spirits. Our three protagonists, played by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams, aren't entirely unsympathetic. The directors slowly increase the sense of menace throughout, with the last act naturally registering as the creepiest. Interview sequences at the beginning are definitely amusing. The arts and crafts displayed by our unseen antagonist(s) are genuinely striking, and do lead to my favorite line in the film: ""Rednecks aren't this creative!"" Of course, the idea in this film of one character stubbornly insisting on documenting *everything* has already become a cliché; while of course we wouldn't have the movie if this person weren't doing so, it's all too easy to understand how this would annoy other people. Overall, I realize I have been under-rating this for years (watching it late at night or early in the morning with all the lights off would create the perfect effect) - it does have good atmosphere - although *that* scene has always cracked me up, and that was before I even saw ""Scary Movie"". In the end, it does appear that assessments of ""The Blair Witch Project"" usually do tend to rely on how one reacts - either it works for the viewer or it doesn't.

17,preppy-3,Over-hyped,1,1 November 1999,"This is a VERY low-budget horror film that was WAY over-hyped! It's about three college students who go into the woods for a weekend to see if the legend of the Blair Witch is real. They film themselves all weekend long. Then they get lost, run low on food and water and some REAL spooky things happen...The moments when they're hearing noises and voices in the dark are VERY scary (especially somebody calling them from a distance). But that's it. There's nothing inventive plot wise, the characters are REAL annoying (Heather was particularly annoying--she never shut up!) and the camera-work made me seasick. Also all the horror in this is implied and never shown. There's nothing wrong with that but add that with the above ingredients and you got a very exasperating film. Basically I was never scared once...but I was bored a LOT! Also what's all this hype about the ""incredible"" ending? The ending was telegraphed at least a half hour before it happened! I really don't like this film, but I think it's because of the nonstop hype on it. You might like it, but set your expectation on low.",The Blair Witch Project
18,poolandrews,"""I never gave Mike any fart allowance."" I'm in two minds over this one.",6,1 November 2005,"The Blair Witch Project starts with the revelation that three student filmmakers disappeared in October 1994 & that the footage they shot has been discovered & is presented here for our viewing pleasure... Two young student filmmakers Heather Donahue & Joshua Leonard pick their friend Mike Williams up & set off for Burkitsville, Maryland to investigate & film a documentary on a local legend known as the 'Blair Witch'. To get their documentary going they interview various residents of Burkitsville who tell the tale of the Blair Witch, with the interview footage in the can the three set off into the nearby woods to carry on their documentary & try to delve a little deeper into the legend. Unfortunately they soon become lost, tensions begin to boil as Heather has the map but doesn't seem able to read it properly & when they try to sleep at night they are awoke & attacked by something from within the woods. Their plight becomes desperate as they run low on food, morale, patience & are continually harassed by someone or something, someone or something evil...Edited, written & directed by Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sanchez The Blair Witch Project was apparently shot in a mere 8 days, was made for about $22,000 & made back $240,500,000 which is a ratio of $10,931 made for every $1 spent which ain't too bad, is it? Persoanlly I like certain aspects of it but dislike others. The script tries to keep it as real as possible with natural dialogue (I'm not sure who counted but apparently The Blair Witch Project contains 133 'F*cks') & most of the film looks improvised which I think it was. Everything is kept to a minimum & nothing is really explained which gives it a genuine creepiness at times, in this case less is more. We know what the characters know, which is pretty much nothing when I think about it. It can drag a bit, has only three character's & it does go round in circles while the lack of any sort of explanation for anything did annoy me & then there is the bizarre ending which will either please or disappoint you. The main area where The Blair Witch Project stands out is the way it is filmed just like a documentary & the film could indeed be made up of scraps of footage haphazardly spliced together as it alternates between colour & black and white & the cinematography has a real amateur hand held jerkiness about it to add to the supposed authenticity & we get lots of pointless (but psychologically important for the whole documentary effect) shots of people's backs, the ground & the sky, the entire film is shot first-person with a hand held camera usually operated by Heather & frankly this approach can become tedious & annoying at times. For those looking for sleek cinematography, cool camera angles & fancy special effects The Blair Witch Project is not for you, for those looking for something a little bit different & original then you could do a lot worse although it's hard to tell what any one person's reaction will be to a film such as this. There is no blood or gore or sex, just lots of bad language so don't expect anything like that. I must admit there is a certain eerie atmosphere & creepiness about The Blair Witch Project especially the scenes where the three students are attacked in the dead of night & are unable to see anything. The acting is pretty good throughout by a young & unknown (at the time) cast. The Blair Witch Project is certainly different although I'm not quite sure why it turned out to be such the huge commercial success that it was, I can still remember when it came out over here it was everywhere & everyone I knew wanted to see it but most were ultimately disappointed when they did. Definitely worth a watch especially for horror fans & considering it probably turns up on TV all the time it shouldn't be too hard to get the opportunity to see it & you should give it a go if you have a spare 85 odd minutes.",The Blair Witch Project
19,CinemaSerf,A racket - on multiple fronts....,5,3 June 2020,"So three young folks go off into the wilderness in search of evidence to support the local Maryland legend of the ""Blair Witch"". Shortly afterwards, they lose their map, get lost - discover an old house; scream and cuss a lot.... A collection of three more odious folks I struggle to recollect seeing on screen. Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánches substitute noise for suspense; and despite the fact that they spend several nights (more than planned) out in the woods without food, the batteries for their camera seems to endure remarkably well as they run around in the dark edging ever closer to whatever grizzly fate they well deserve. This is an huge triumph for hype over content and the marketeers have done a truly remarkable job.

20,utgard14,Holds up well,7,25 August 2015,"Compelling and eerie found footage movie about a trio of amateur filmmakers who disappear after hiking into the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch. A modern classic that helped usher in that particular subgenre of horror we have today. Most found footage movies are absolutely terrible and can't hold a candle to this one. It's probably the only movie of its type that ever seemed remotely authentic to me, even though I knew it was all fiction. At the time, people debated whether or not this was actually real. That seems silly, of course, but I knew several people back then who believed what they saw on the screen really happened. A lot of the credit for that should go to the actors, particularly Heather Donahue, for doing such a great job of making it seem believable. I just saw it for the first time in probably a decade or more and, while it doesn't hold the same impact as it did initially, it's still a remarkably well-done low-budget psychological horror movie.Yes the movie was heavily hyped but it was deserved, in my opinion. This was a huge box office success built largely on word of mouth which is a testament to its quality. Sadly, because of its popularity, a lot of people bashed the film (and still do, judging by some of these reviews). If by some chance you have never seen this movie, please ignore the haters and give it a fair shot. I know that, after so many found footage horror movies since it was released, it won't seem as fresh. But I think if you drown out the background noise of the whiners and allow yourself to become immersed in the story, you'll find this movie is one of the best of its kind and worthy of praise.",The Blair Witch Project
21,zardoz-13,"Hype surrounds ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but the payoff is a rip-off!",6,4 September 2008,"First, ""Star Wars: Episode One: The Phantom Menace"" qualified as a good sci-fi thriller but a galactic letdown as a prequel to the original ""Star Wars."" First-rate special effects engulfed a predictable, pretentious plot with characters whose charisma rating never scored as highly as the originals. ""Star War: Episode One"" wasn't the only movie with too much hype. The second movie that generated almost as much hype in an even shorter space of time was ""The Blair Witch Project."" Independently produced on a broomstick budget for $22-thousand dollars, ""Blair Witch"" aroused all sorts of curiosity. Was it based on fact or fiction? Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who co-produced, wrote, and directed this phenomenally successful horror melodrama, have changed the way that Hollywood publicizes movies. Moreover, they may have touched off a trend that will revolutionize movies as well as movie-making. In the short time that ""Blair Witch"" has haunted movie houses, this game little thriller has generated over $240 million dollars! ""The Blair Witch Project"" concerns three student filmmakers who vanished into the stick near Burkitsville, Maryland, in October 1994. A year after their mysterious disappearance, their film and video footage was discovered, and ""Blair Witch"" reveals what happened to this ill-fated trio. The concept and the production of ""Blair Witch"" should inspire anybody with a video or film camera that has movie-making ambitions. Myrick and Sanchez didn't let a paltry budget or the lack of major studio support encumber their efforts. Anybody who studies cinema can see the resemblance between this little movie and the Italian Neo-realism movement in the late 1940s after World War II. Like the Neo-realists, Myrick and Sanchez filmed ""Blair Witch"" on authentic locations with no-name performers so that they film boasts more than a shred of authenticity. The lack of a budget transforms ""Blair Witch"" and makes it such a promising premise. If Myrick and Sanchez haven't been compared with famous Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo, who helmed the 1965 masterpiece ""The Battle of Algiers,"" they should be. The controversy raging over both movies is the superb way that the filmmakers give their subject matter an added boost by making it look like a documentary.Sadly, all comparisons between Italian Neo-realism and Pontecorvo end when the lame storyline and the imbecilic characters in ""The Blair Witch Project"" are considered in retrospect. Media theorists will have a heyday writing about the symbolic implications of this movie for years, but dyed-in-the-wool horror fans will find ""Blair Witch"" less than satisfying. First, the storyline is predictable, lame, and improvised. Myrick and Sanchez get off to a bad start. ""Blair Witch"" takes too long, even for an 80-minute movie, to get itself cranked up. Of course, enthusiasts will argue that the filmmakers are setting up the characters and the situations.Boo! These characters are as half-baked as their project. They plunge into the woods in their search for a spirited demon without any logistical support or back-up plan. Second, the characters themselves spend more time arguing than witch hunting. They aim their cameras at themselves more than at what they are searching for in the backwoods. They get themselves lost in the middle of nowhere and don't have enough sense to figure a way out. I'd have started a fire. These characters are every bit as stupid as the characters in major Hollywood epics, such as the ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" franchises.Sure, ""The Blair Witch Project"" stirs up considerable atmosphere, but the payoff is a rip-off. The witch is only hinted at through symbolic settings and off-camera hysterics. The constantly shaking cameras may induce motion sickness for some, but there is nothing in this movie that would scare anybody over age four. Indeed, ""The Blair Witch Project"" has subtlety working for it, but subtlety will only get a horror movie so far before you want to scream: Show me the Evil! The acting is not an issue, any more than the funky looking, pseudo-16mm format that gives ""Blair Witch"" a novel appearance. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have produced an interesting but deeply flawed movie that will be talked about for years. Hopefully, ""The Blair Witch Project"" will inspire a new generation of low-budget, independent filmmakers. Presumably, next time Myrick and Sanchez will contrive a story that matches their cinematic gifts.",The Blair Witch Project
22,Boba_Fett1138,Great concept...average movie.,6,1 October 2005,"The concept for ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a great and original one. The hand-held, amateur, documentary, camera-work must give the viewers a realistic view of the events and tend to make the viewer believe that all of this really happened. It makes ""The Blair Witch Project"" an highly original one of a kind movie. Never again will there be a movie like this one.Most of the time the movie has a good realistic feeling and atmosphere. At times you really have the feeling that you're really present in the woods, together with the three main characters. Most of the lines and moments are obviously improvised however when scripted moments and lines occur, it becomes painfully obvious that none of the three main actors are good actors by any means. It takes away lots of the realism and because of that the good original concept is flawed. It's also flawed because it is highly unbelievable that the three main characters kept filming that much and even at the moments when they were in peril and scared.I do applaud this movie for its originality but it simply was not as good as I expected and hoped it would be. To be honest I was even bored at times while watching this movie and it takes a lot to make me bored while watching a movie. It simply took forever at times for something to happen. And quite frankly, I wasn't scared once while watching this.Worth seeing maybe once, due to its originality.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Blair Witch Project
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Lame, slow and amateurish",1,3 July 2004,"How someone can actually take this obviously fake documentary seriously is beyond me. I guess the world has too many naive, superstitious people. The film has so many revealing things in it, like audio continuing from one clip to another, that is supposed to take place several hours later. The whole thing is so obviously staged that you'd have to *really* want to believe it to believe it. The film has no actual scares... just a bunch of sequences that might seem scary if you believe them, which requires you to be very naive. What could have been a decent enough attempt at a semi-scary documentary is ruined by it containing scenes that there is no possible reason that any sane person would film(if it were real), including arguments, fights and various pointless conversations. The worst thing about this film is that there are actually people who believe it. People who think that this film was a true documentary, and that everything on the film happened. I can't believe that there are people who are actually that naive and superstitious, that they'll accept something so blatantly obvious fake as real. I mean, I don't have anything against people who believe in ghosts and witches, not at all, don't believe any of it myself, but I wouldn't entirely write it off as rubbish if someone was trying to convince me it does exist; but to go from believing in it, to grabbing something so obviously fake and try to pass it off as evidence in these phenomenons... I mean, had they actually documented something real, something that actually happened, that can't be scientifically explained, then I would say that the movie actually accomplished something. But it doesn't. It just preys on naive, superstitious people. No one, and I do mean no one, in their right mind could possibly accept any part of this rubbish as real. The whole thing reeks of 'staged'. I won't even comment on plot, acting or character development as it's all non-existent. This movie is just plain bad. It has no actual positive qualities. Please, do yourself a favor: don't watch this movie, as it will just waste an hour and a half of your life, and you will not have gained anything, any new knowledge at all by the end of this awful excuse for a movie. I don't recommend this to anyone, seeing how all it is, is the ultimate proof that there are too many ignorant, naive people in the world.

The difference is that ""Paranormal Activity"" tried to manipulate its way into cult status, whereas ""Blair Witch"" genuinely came out of nowhere to achieve that feat naturally.This movie chilled me to the bone and stuck with me for days afterward.

25,AlsExGal,Much better than its reputation,7,19 December 2009,"It seems many people dislike this film because they think the entirety of its reputation lay in the confusion/publicity campaign generated at the time of its release as to whether it was a real film found in the woods of Maryland that documented the disappearance of three college students or whether it was just a movie. What made this film scary in 1999 and scary now is what you don't see and what you think you hear as well as the growing paranoia and fright of the college kids lost in the woods over a period of days that find - as they run out of food and supplies - that they are just wandering in circles.The very last scene is particularly chilling, and if you already know how it ends it will kill some of the fright factor for you. However, this film just proved in 1999, as it still does, that you don't have to fill a horror film with wall-to-wall state-of-the-art CGI visual effects and shocking violence in order to be scary. I personally think the horror genre has been much worse off since Jason and his ilk first invaded the movies back in 1980 with graphic violence that is predictable and, quite frankly, boring. Although I like this movie, the sequel, ""Book of Shadows"", is just awful. Its makers Hollywoodized the original concept and thus made it completely incoherent and unwatchable.

Three students undergo a project on the legendary Blair Witch. Locals describe the Blair Witch killing several children in the deep woods. Filming begins with fun but each night grows darker until they awake with bizarre happenings. Great premise shot in camcorder so that viewers can experience the film as the characters do. Effective with tension building but the ending is too abrupt. Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez who give it a documentary appeal although the shaky camera movements are distracting. Absorbing performances by Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard. Donahue gives an emotional confession to the camera with that eerie flashlight. The locals being interviewed in the opening needed more screen time just based on humour. The ending leaves viewers a bit confused. One of the boys goes missing and the remaining two panic. When we finally do see him it is not clear what is happening. Upholds the idea of fear being something we cannot see.

27,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Overblown and not really worthwhile,5,19 May 2015,"Arriving in a small Maryland town, a group of students shooting a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch head out to the woods where a series of events forces them to believe the urban legend is true and try to leave the woods alive.There wasn't much, but this one here did have a few good moments. One of the better elements here is the fact that the woods themselves look incredibly intimidating and freaky which goes a long way towards making them feel much more mysterious and imposing than normally expected. There's a really well-done attempt to make it seem like there's a real presence just beyond the eye-range, and it makes the terror and suspense of the scenes that much more powerful. Among the better sequences is when they come upon the Wiccan ceremonial site which is creepy, disturbing and a little unnerving, and it stands up as one of the best scenes in the film. There's also the fantastic scene where they come upon a specific site in the forest after leaving it behind earlier and their disbelief at it is really accomplished well. The film's best accomplishment is that it really makes it seem like a supernatural force is behind it all, and this is mostly done with just noises, yells or screams that indicate something is amiss and it just seems all the more realistic that something is causing it even without showing the actual witch here. When the small artifacts turn up or the camping equipment goes missing during the night, it just makes it far more creepy and realistic. While its' slam-bang ending ends the film in the right manner, there's quite a few flaws to it that manage to hold it down. The main one is the seemingly aggravating and annoying camera-work throughout here, as the entire purpose is ruined with the shaking-camera gimmick. Granted, it's supposed to be through their lenses as they're out in the woods and is handled well in that regard, but you still want to be able to see exactly what you're shooting. There's no way it should've featured the scenes of them running through the woods still shooting, since the shaking camera makes it nearly impossible to see what's being attempted, and there's really nothing in there that needed to be seen, making it quite confusing why that was being attempted. It's practically impossible to do so in some of the film's scenes in here, especially the second campground attack as it looks exactly like it's being shot through the wrong lens and is out-of-focus since there's no way it has to look as terrible as it does there, and a later shot of them wandering around in the woods is ruined due to the glare from the Sun in the background, and for a couple seconds it really looks like the entire scene has a tarp thrown over the area, darkening it to an unimaginable degree. The last big flaw is that this one has one of the most boring and dull set-ups ever. The early scenes of them filming their set-up for the shoot itself is just packed with nonsensical scenes that really could've been explored in a prologue introduction where they come upon research giving the same answers rather than the bland interviews here that don't move the film along any faster. The last half of the film is barely any better in that the constant yelling and screaming at each other is just impossible to sit through. It's not character-building, it's just aggravating to the audience to have to sit through them yelling and curse at each other for five minutes about moves that don't even matter at all, and each time it becomes harder to get through. Beyond these issues, there's not a whole lot to like here.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language and Mild Violence.",The Blair Witch Project

The students, after done interviewing locals, go into the woods and see some strange things before getting lost, as they literally go in circles with no idea how or why. After hearing sinister sounds at night, one of them goes missing, as tensions flair and hopes are dashed...

The film works because it is simple. It's split in two, day and night. Daytime the audience is relatively safe because we just feel the despair of the group, but when the title card says 'night', thats when the dread kicks in and the film becomes something else.Of course there are plot holes, such as 'when they lose the map, why don't they just rewind the footage because they have filmed the map?' or 'after all that time being lost, you come across a house, would you really go in?'.These are all minor things, but other wise, this film is still as scary today as it was back in 1999, the performances are great, the sound is superb, and the overall feel of dread and despair etched on to the cast is excellent.",The Blair Witch Project

This movie could have been really good.  The beginning was alright where they interviewed those people and before they yelled at each other constantly, and the end was alright too.  The middle, though, did not have enough in it.  There should have been more hints at what might be out there.

31,Wuchakk,Three amateur phukkin filmmakers stumbling around the phukkin woods of Maryland,4,26 August 2016,"Released in the summer of 1999 three weeks after the mockumentary ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" debuted on TV, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a found-footage film that covers the last days of three amateur filmmakers who wander around the woods of Maryland bickering and cussing.I'm not a fan of found-footage films because they're not entertaining by their very nature. Since these types of movies are supposed to be ""found footage"" they come across as interesting as home movies of family/friends vacations, except that something weird or horrific is taking place. In this case, the three youths are baffled by the evidence of someone (or something) harassing them in the woods, which gets increasingly terrifying. It starts with mysterious piles of rocks and then stick figures; finally someone disappears and they later hear him/her torturously yelling in the distance.The movie runs 81 minutes and that's just too long for the content. It could've easily been cut in half and would've been more effective for it, but they obviously had to make it ""feature length."" The Maryland woods and Heather Donahue's curvy butt can only maintain your attention for so long. The mockumentary ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" was a great set-up for this film and it's entertaining for what it is, but it's only like half as long. Watching three people stumble around the forest in home-movie quality footage cussing at each other is just tedious and unentertaining. For me, it's total dullsville; a snorefest.

It's horrific that it came fifth in Channel 4's scary moment poll; it's horrific that it got good reviews, and it's even more horrific that people actually like this trash. Quite simply, The Blair Witch Project is the worst film of all time. ...and yet somehow, while this film is on the same level of crappyness as films like Freddy got fingered and The Fast and the furious (except Blair Witch isn't as good as those two), I still get the feeling that someone is going to disagree with me.For the first part of this review, I will be doing things a little differently than usual. Usually I would write out my views of the film in paragraphs, however, this time, to highlight the misinterpretations that people have of this film, I'm going to show you what my TV guide's say:
Named and Shamed 1: 'What's on TV' (The UK's best selling TV magazine)
""Three student film makers get lost in the woods while investigating a legend. Forsaking special effects, this low budget documentary-style fright fest is a return to the basics of what screen horror should be all about - sheer terror""****/****Errrr...what? Excuse me, 'Sheer terror', pardon me if I'm wrong, but when I think of sheer terror, getting lost in the woods isn't the first thing that springs to mind. And where the hell did they get 'fright fest' from? I spent most of the movie waiting for something to happen, not being scared out of my wits. sheesh.Named and Shamed 2: 'Weekend' (The TV magazine that comes free with 'The Daily Mail' on a Saturday)""How does a film with a tiny budget, no stars and no effects become one of the scariest movies ever? Simple, by making the audience believe that what they are seeing is real. That's the ingenious mind game carried off by this 1999 horror hit, which pretended to be the video diary of three film students lost in a Maryland wood""****/*****Well, first off, credit where credit's due, at least they didn't give it full marks. I'll talk more about the mind game thing later but I don't how that makes the film scary, so what something that's not scary but real is somehow scary now? When I was about 10 my grandfather videoed me playing football, that was real, but was it terrifying? No.I have a more simple answer for their question though: It doesn't.
Named and Shamed 3: Sky TV's information button""This terrifying film follows three student film makers who went in search if the Blair Witch only to discover the meaning of true horror""
I think this is my favourite of the three comments. 'the meaning of true horror', oh what? So the meaning of true horror is walking around the woods with a camera? sheesh, its ok guys, none of us have anything to worry about ever if that's as bad as it gets.
People seem to think that no gore, no special effects and no big shocks are a good thing. And they can be, if done correctly. Take Rosemary's Baby for example, there is a film that has no gore, no effects and no big jumpy moments, and it worked, know why? It has an idea behind it. The idea that a woman could be carrying the child of the devil is a genuinely frightening idea, it probes into the unknown, and that is a terrifying thing to do. Getting lost in the woods, not only doesn't probe into the unknown (people have been lost in the woods before); it's just genuinely not scary. Maybe getting lost in the woods with a man eating bear might be a scary thought, but just getting lost in the woods isn't. Ok, if you really did get lost in the woods it might be frightening, but for a film, I think we need a bit more plot than that.For a film to be good, we're not talking Oscar winner here, just merely good, it needs to have several things, including:a plot a decent script Direction Acting WatchabilityBlair Witch doesn't have any of these. Look:a plot - Plot? What plot? Ok, so we have a reason why they go in the woods, but once they get there, then what? Nothing happens except for them finding a few twigs and stuff hanging from trees. Lame. a decent script - I realise that they were trying to make things look real, which gives the effect that there isn't a script but whereas in most other films the script is used to move the story along, in this film all the script is a bunch of shouting and moaning. I mean, ok, fine you're lost in the woods but surely you wouldn't just sit there shouting at each other all day. Direction - I think it's hard to judge whether or not this was directed. It just looked to me like a bunch of bad camera angles loosely strewn together.Acting - Wasn't any. Watchability - I can't see any reason to watch this film. I mean watch the film again. It just isn't watchable, the way the camera(s) move is annoying, and it's hard to tell what's going on most of the time. Well, really nothing goes on. The movie's more boring than Streetcar.The producers of Blair Witch however realised that to sell a film, you don't need those five things, you just need one thing: marketing. And sadly, they were right.I remember back in 1999 when this crap....err...film was released. Out of nowhere came great reviews, spouting crap like 'it's terrifying'. I didn't go to see it as soon as it came out, but some of my friends and family did, and every single one of them came back saying that it sucked. However, I thought 'uneducated fools, what do they know?' and then guess what? I went to see it and they were right. It's a good job the film wasn't much longer, I reckon I'd have left if it were.Then we've got this mind game thing. About it being real footage. When I first went to see it this rumour was still ripe and I thought it was really real. Well, actually I was under the impression that this was a film based on actual footage, not the actual footage itself, but anyway, same difference. So how come I still wasn't in the least frightened? And how come even now, now that everyone knows that the rumours aren't true, why do people like the writers of my TV guides say it's scary? why why why? It's too boring to be scary.I suppose they do deserve some credit for pulling that off though, even I was fooled. But that's credit for the producers, not for the film itself. It's a shame actually that this rumour was done with this film, if it were done for a good film, movie history could have been made. What a waste.
Then we come to the 'utterly horrifying' ending. Well actually, last time I checked, a man stood in the corner while a girl drops a camera isn't scary, but it looks like I'm wrong again. It's horrifying. I realise that at the start someone said that's what happened to a kid or something, but so what? It's still not scary.One of the (many) main reasons why this film isn't scary is that non of the characters are engaging, or even likable, the audience has no reason at all to like them, so why would we care if one of them has to stand in the corner? Even if it was frightening, who cares? For a good example of something horrifying happening to someone, see The Wicker Man. The Wicker Man did a good job of making itself scary because the character of Sgt Howie was portrayed as being likable so the audience could identify with him, and so when his time came, we felt empathy towards the guy, but what did we feel here? Absolutely nothing.In conclusion, The Blair Witch can be summed up in 5 no's.
No effects No gore No shocks No stars NothingI give this trash 0/10. What? What do you mean I can't? Oh ok, fine, 1/10, but I'm being VERY generous. I even feel like upgrading every film I ever gave a 1/10 to a 2/10, just to emphasize how bad this was, but I can't be bothered.",The Blair Witch Project

The Web was something that everybody started to know and this flick was well promoted on that way. Not everybody was comfortable with the web and giving nothing away except the title did the thing. I was in the US when it was promoted and yes, you did believe what you saw.Cannibal Holocaust surely was a found footage but it was all about cannibalism. And it's there that Holocaust fitted in. The Blair Witch was controversial because love or hate, no in between was possible. Some were afraid seeing it others fell asleep. But it do has a few creep moments especially the night scenes.Is it all that great, that's the big issue because the only effects used are done with branches and stones. And that's just why it all looked real.The remake is now a few days before release so I will surely go watch it. Therefor I recommend to see the original one which also spawned a sequel that was terrible.

37,ShadeGrenade,If You Go Down To The Woods Today...,10,14 September 2006,"Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez's 'The Blair Witch Project' caused a sensation when released in 1999. It was the first movie to become a hit as the result of the internet, and deservedly so. The low budget horror movie is the perfect antidote to those formulaic Hollywood shockers in which nubile co-eds get chased by some knife-wielding idiot in a mask.A group of students - Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael C.Williams - venture into woods in Maryland to make a documentary about the notorious 'Blair Witch', a sorceress believed to have actually existed and been responsible for many deaths. At first, the assignment is fun, but then things go wrong; the map goes missing, they argue amongst themselves as to whose fault it was, and they cannot find their way back to Burdittville. Strange noises can be heard at night. Worst of all, peculiar stick figures are found. Something is out in the forest with them, watching their every move, but what? As noted earlier, 'Project' was made on a very small budget. But for once this was an asset rather than a liability. So convincingly realistic did it turn out that cinema-goers thought they were watching a real video diary. The principal cast members give natural performances, particularly Donahue. For me, it brought back uncomfortable memories of camping with friends in the woods and being kept awake all night by owls and other nocturnal beasts! It owes a great debt to those eerie 'Ghost Stories For Christmas' made by the B.B.C. in the '70's, such as 'The Signalman'. It works as much on the imagination as on the senses. The film starts slowly, then ratchets up the tension so fast that by the end you're absolutely terrified. The ending is deliberately ambiguous. All we know is that the students were never found, and the film footage provides the only clue to their fate.For a short time, it looked as though there was to be a major shift towards a more natural style of horror movie, but it does not seem to have happened. Many movies have copied the look of 'Project' - the quick-fire editing, the shaky camera-work - but alas not the feel.There was a sequel - 'Blair Witch 2: Book Of Shadows' - made the following year, which was everything the first was not - uninspired and silly. If you're planning on going camping in woods, whatever you do, don't watch 'Project' the night before.",The Blair Witch Project
38,JamesHitchcock,Is This Some Sort of Bad Joke?,2,27 May 2005,"Is this some sort of bad joke? The film starts with the statement: ""In October of 1994, three student film makers disappeared in the woods near Burkittesville, Maryland. One year later, their footage was found."" Everything that follows is supposed to be the footage shot by the vanished students before they disappeared while making a documentary about a local witchcraft legend. I understand that , although the film is a work of fiction, it was originally marketed as a true story. A similar marketing technique was used to sell the film ""Fargo"", but the dubious ethics of the procedure do not affect the quality of that film, which was excellent. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is anything but. The film has a sort of faux-naif quality about it. It was shot on hand-held cameras in a deliberate attempt to mimic an amateur style of film-making, although the results are so poor that they would shame even the average home movie, let alone a project made by a group of student film makers, who would presumably have received some sort of training in basic film technique. Only a few minutes of the supposed ""footage"", in fact, consists of material which might conceivably have formed part of the projected documentary. Most of the rest consists of scenes of the three students wandering about after getting lost in the forest, endlessly quarrelling with and screaming at each other in a torrent of foul language. Why the supposed students would have wasted their film on these scenes is not explained. It appears, from a series of unexplained occurrences, that someone, or something, is pursuing the students, although it is never clear exactly who or what is involved. No explanation for their disappearance is ever given.The film has sometimes been praised for reinventing the horror genre for the late nineties, but this strikes me as an impossible ambition. The genre seems to have become stuck in a cul-de-sac, able to inspire little beyond cynically self-mocking parodies along the lines of the ""Scream"" and ""Scary Movies"" series. ""The Blair Witch Project"" never succeeds in breaking out of this cul-de-sac for the reason that its approach is a quite uninteresting one; lengthy, badly-shot scenes of people running through the woods and shouting at one another do not make for entertaining viewing. I was never able to feel either sympathy for such an unsympathetic bunch or terror on their behalf. There was only one frightening thing about the film: that such a badly-made, badly-acted, over-hyped film could manage to generate such media attention and to achieve such success at the box office. 2/10",The Blair Witch Project
39,Smells_Like_Cheese,"""You'll leave the movie theater with shock!""",1,2 June 2002,"I left the movie theater with a headache. This was the most over-hyped movie ever!!!

I went to the theater because it was claimed to be ""scary as hell"". I laughed when I got home, so I wouldn't go crazy and run over to the director's house and just smack him for creating this. There is only one good part is at the exact end. When the guy is against the wall, from a legend. Where a killer who claimed to be possessed by the blair witch would gather a bunch of children. And kill them. But when he'd kill one, the rest were facing the wall, like the guy was. And they end it! A scary part, and the end? The credits have to be the best part of this movie.

40,MovieAddict2016,"Interesting, but far from being very scary at all...",6,30 October 2003,"Some of the best horror movies are those that imply rather than explode, hint at rather than expose. Fear is scarier than scariness itself--scary is just scary. Fear is fear. And fear induces all else that follows. Fear gets you on the edge of your seat; fear makes the hairs on your neck stand up. The scare comes afterwards.The movie is false, but knowing that ruins the surprise of it all. Three amateur filmmakers--two guys and a girl (where's the pizza place?)--go into a Maryland wood, in hopes of uncovering the secret of the infamous Blair Witch, a legendary witch who is rumored to live in the woods. First they interview town folk and get their sworn testimonies. An old, apparently crazy woman insists that the Blair Witch appeared next to her in a lake once and was covered with beastly hair. (That sent chills up my spine.)Then they embark into the woods, equipped with video cameras and recording everything. But soon they get lost--the map is pointless. They just keep going in circles. They walk around the woods for days, every night hearing strange sounds outside their tents and finding mysterious wooden ornaments hanging in a graveyard.""The Blair Witch"" project is smart enough to know this, but that is about all I can credit the film for. It's that type of fear-inducing, thought-provoking horror movie not made since the likes of ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen,"" but when I was done watching it I realized that it hadn't really scared me at all. It had me thinking, yes, and it had me interested throughout, but it didn't scare me. After all the fear had settled there was no scare left. I viewed the film with all the lights in the room turned off, and yet it still didn't scare me. In fact, I found it to be rather ridiculous at times.But it is an admirable horror film, one that uses ancient techniques as opposed to chainsaw-wielding villains with ski masks chasing groups of very, very stupid, mentally under-developed big-breasted teenage bimbos around a house for hours in the dark, jumping out at the camera whenever we've gone too long without a jolt. No, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is all about insinuations and the unknown. I'll admit that the film is pretty darn creepy, if ineffectively scary. At one point, a group of three teenagers are asleep inside a tent, lost outdoors in a Maryland woods, when loud screams start coming from somewhere out there.They rush outside with the video cameras jolting about frantically. I was waiting any second for some ghostly pale figure to be seen far off in the woods. Which is part of my disappointment in the film. To unexpectedly catch a glimpse of something--the witch, the ghost of the murderer, anyone and/or anything--would have been terrific. To expose something ever so briefly so that you think, What was that? and try to play back your videotape again to pause the image. But the film doesn't ever really approach the Blair Witch. Furthermore, it never really explains anything by the end of the film. And I understand that this is the appeal of the film for most people. BUT...I'm not asking to show the Blair Witch chasing them around. All I would have liked to see was at least an ever-so-brief glimpse of some unintelligible being. That would have been far spookier, because eventually you get to the point while watching the film when you realize it isn't going to show you anything, and you start to lose interest. This movie sent chills up my spine and made the hairs on my neck stand up at certain points. This is my kind of horror movie--I'm not into the slasher flicks, primarily because I do not find them very scary at all. I'd rather have the images of the attacker lurking in the dark left up to me, not jumping forward at the screen. Am I contradicting myself? I say I do not want to see the Blair Witch, but yet moments later I say I do. No, what I want to see is some effervescent being illuminated in the dark ever so briefly; it would be the ultimate spine-tingler. Remember in ""Signs"" how M. Night Shyamalan showed the alien walking across the driveway at a birthday party? Remember how you weren't expecting it, how sudden it was? How quick? I would have liked something like that--just something very quick and very, very spooky. Not even as detailed as the alien--some far away being standing in the middle of the woods, who suddenly disappears with a shriek. (So that you never really see it at all, you just see the light and think, What was that?)The craving of seeing the attacker is part of the fun. In this case, my craving was never fully satisfied.4/5.",The Blair Witch Project
41,Red-Barracuda,The first internet event movie,8,2 February 2010,"The Blair Witch Project was an internet phenomenon back in 1999. It was in fact probably the first movie to show that the World Wide Web could be a powerful tool to promote a film. Moreover, the BWP also showed that you could achieve huge financial cinematic success on an absolutely minimal budget. Love it or loathe it, The Blair Witch Project was truly a unique cinematic happening.The film was marketed on the internet, via cyber-rumours, as a possibly-maybe real life documentary. This not only heightened expectations but also built a myth around the film similar to the fictional Blair Witch legend in the film itself. But this expectation also led many people to be somewhat underwhelmed by the Spartan nature of the final product. Many thought it was a non-movie and were annoyed to have been suckered in. While others conversely appreciated the original feeling of unease that the ultra-low budget documentary-style approach brought. These highly contrasting reactions have made The Blair Witch Project perhaps the ultimate Marmite movie. It's unusual to be truly indifferent about this film.It has to be said that I am one of the latter group who actually liked the BWP. I think that the gonzo-style film-making approach does actually add to the fright-factor. At times it's easy to put yourself in the position of these people and feel the tension and fear. The night-time scenes especially are frightening affairs, with the weird cackling and children's laughter very disturbing indeed. The fact that we can barely hear these sounds because of the muffled sound on the amateur equipment only adds to the authentic feel and, therefore, the discomfort. All of the terror in the woods in set up quite nicely with some talking head interviews at the outset of the movie where some aspects of the witch and her legacy are discussed. The information is as fragmented, contradictory and ambiguous as old legends tend to be but sometimes, as in the case of the story about the direct encounter with the witch, it's eerie and disturbing; it nicely sets the scene for the journey into the woods.If I had criticisms of the film I guess one would be that it does seem ridiculous that none of the participants think to follow the river downstream, I mean surely that's gonna be better than randomly trekking through the woods? And secondly, I feel that maybe showing just a little more would not have harmed the film at all. Perhaps the briefest flash of the witch at the end in the house? Also, even though I realize this is seriously low-budget, I would've thought they could have come up with something a little better than small piles of rocks as the portent of an evil presence.But all in all, I mostly appreciate this flick. Its unique brand of horror was a welcome alternative for the genre. It admittedly was not the first film to use a pseudo-documentary approach but it nevertheless still has the feel of something quite unlike anything that had gone before.",The Blair Witch Project

43,KineticSeoul,More irritating than scary,3,13 April 2010,"Okay this movie wouldn't have been so bad if the three students weren't so annoying to the point I ended up disliking them so much. Although the movie isn't very good and it just seems to have gotten a cult following because they went in a realistic direction. Where it seems like the incident with the students and the Blair Witch really happened, but besides that there is nothing really good about this. I am sure the creators of this film is really happy to receive other people's hard earned money for a below mediocre movie such as this. Maybe they thought the incident really happened and was entertained by that one factor. And since the creators made this with a shoestring budget, and ended up getting back way more than they invested on it. I think my favorite part of the movie though is when all three students end up getting killed by the witch cause I hated everyone in this and leading some viewers to really overrate this, there just isn't anything that will make the audience feel threatened. And I ain't saying that cause the film hardly has any violence in it, most of this movie's run time is taken up with three idiots running around screaming over half the time. I give it some props for leading some viewers as if this is something real with it's marketing. I remember when this movie first came out, it was when I was in elementary and just about everyone was making a big deal out of it. Maybe because it's the first found footage movie that I know that came out.3.9/10",The Blair Witch Project
44,sddavis63,Imaginative And Pretty Effective,7,7 November 2009,"Although the style has become fairly common, at the time this movie was released, the idea of a simple movie filmed in a documentary style using a single hand held camera was pretty imaginative, and to give the makers of this film their proper credit, no one since has mastered the raw style as effectively. The story is a simple one. Three college students learn of a Maryland legend about the “Blair Witch” and they set out for a weekend in the woods to investigate the stories.The film starts out in a light-hearted manner, showing the trio joking around as they prepare for their adventure, then doing some background interviews with residents of the nearby town of Burkittsville, which adds some horror-type mystery and “history” to the project. There wasn't much excitement in that opening, but it established that the three didn't take the legends seriously and that they weren't expecting much more than a weekend in the woods. At first we watch essentially a routine nature hike, but the suspense builds pretty quickly once the three realize they're lost. Then they begin to hear mysterious sounds at night and stumble upon strange things by day - unusual rock piles, and the now famous Blair Witch symbol made out of sticks and hanging from trees. The movie never tries to explain these things, focusing instead on the increasing terror felt by the campers. There's an interesting study of group dynamics as the three respond to their plight by increasingly turning on each other. The climax of the movie starts when Josh goes missing. He's nowhere to be found, but Heather and Bill hear him calling to them. Their search finally leads them unexpectedly to a crumbling old house. There's something terrifying in the house, but it's never revealed, the filming stopping suddenly when Heather comes across Bill staring at something. In the story, the three are never found, but the camera and film are found a year later.I realize this was in keeping with the genre, but I would have liked a bit more resolution. The movie leaves you with your heart pumping but no explanation of what happened. Still, the film is effective at building suspense and presents a frighteningly creepy feel once the kids realize that they're lost, and the three do a great job of portraying their increasing fear and desperation. The college documentary project angle also shields the film from the typical, ”low budget"" criticisms. Altogether, it's pretty effective. 7/10",The Blair Witch Project
45,Buddy-51,creepy and original horror film,9,11 November 1999,"""The Blair Witch Project"" succeeds where so many horror films fail because of the sheer simplicity of its conception and design, allowing it to tap far more deeply into a wide range of primal fears than the conventional ""fright"" films churned out regularly by major Hollywood studios.  While the latter films tend to dilute their terror through overplotting, over production and over reliance on special effects, ""The Blair Witch Project"" eschews all that for creativity, visual inventiveness and an admirable conviction that what is left unseen is often more terrifying than what is visualized.The film presents itself cleverly as a pseudodocumentary tale of a group of fictional college students who become lost in the woods while endeavoring to film a study of a local scary legend.  With this structure, the film creepily conjures up many of the basic anxieties and dreads humans are prone to such as fear of the dark, of being hopelessly lost in an isolated environment, of unidentifiable noises on which one can project one's greatest terrors, of total loss of control against an unknown and malevolent force.Even more impressive is the way the film expands to become a study of the human psyche when it is placed into a situation of unspeakable fear and desperation.  As the characters begin to grasp the gravity of their situation, the forced jocularity begins to be stripped away revealing the childlike terror, guilt, need for recrimination and eventually despair and hopelessness that overtake them.  The actors are brilliant in capturing the full gamut of emotions these characters must go through before the preordained tragic end.  The film also provides a slyly satirical spin on the obsessively cinematic tone of modern life, wherein every event must be captured on film or videotape, so much so that, even as death is breathing down the necks of these characters, the cameras continue to roll to record it.  As one of them says in justification,  ""That's all I have left.""  That is her piece of the comfortable world of familiarity that helps her, at least momentarily (if futiley), evade the harsh reality of her situation. Also, these characters pay a high price for the superior tone of cavalier indifference and almost mockery they display towards the tales of the legend they have come to ""investigate.""More than any horror film of recent memory, ""The Blair Witch Project"" gets under the viewer's skin and gives one that feeling of creepy vulnerability that only the best horror films can do.",The Blair Witch Project
46,thesar-2,The Real Witchbusters,8,3 April 2013,"The coolest thing about seeing The Blair Witch Project back in 1999, probably two weeks following its release, was that people still believed one of the biggest movie hoaxes and most cleverest marketing ideas in cinema history. (This was marketed as a documentary on ""true life"" footage found when three young adults died from an apparent witch attack.) I even remember seeing the TV (later to be confirmed as a Mockumentary) special recapping what ""actually"" happened during the incidents of three film students that went into the witch'fested woods and never returned.Now, I don't believe in ghosts, ""real"" witches, spooks, etc, so I never bought it. And my disbelief runs so deep, that the movie never once frightened me, despite my appreciation for what the film was. (AT THE TIME, that isand I'll get into that later.)I do want to clarify, and I'm getting ahead of myself, something from that last paragraph: while I was not spooked, there was a moment, not 10 seconds from the end credits that was very creepy and thought was the most effective shot in the movie. Again – not scary, but absolutely eerie.Much like what Star Wars (Episode IV: A New Hope) was to that time period, was The Blair Witch Project to the late nineties. It was the found footage newborn. Sure, there were many, manyhorrifyingly too many rip-offs and more found footage films to come, and yeah, there were just a minute number before this, but this was the nice, original and refreshing in 1999. Again, I did not believe this was a true story, but they sure as hell made you at very least believe it was. And they did all that with almost absolutely nothing. I truly admire this movie.The story was jokingly simple and that's not a bad thing when it comes to horror; think about: the masterpiece Halloween's thin script. As an amateur documentary project, two film student friends and a third newly recruited film student venture off into the woods where supposedly (to them) a witch killed many, including a lot of children decades past. Beforehand, in a fairly brilliant scene, they interview the just-outside-the-woods townsfolk for their take on the legend of the infamous Blair Witch.Once inside the woods they're armed with their camping gear, expensive, yet ""borrowed"" cameras, a device known to us to be the pre-GPS: ""a map,"" and tons of batteries to ""run a small third world county."" That last one, I loved for, they actually explain why they can continuous film miles from an electrical socket and yet, for the countless – and unnecessary found footage films to follow, they seemed to have forgotten that simple plot explanation and make us believe their devices will basically run for weeks without a recharge. My phone dies in probably 4 hours without a charge.But, I digress. Basically, the two males of the triangle of terrors are lead by the bitch (yeah, she was) Heather who claims to ""know where they're going"" deep inside the woods. As this does NOT turn out to be the case, tensions rise, and the typical motions of getting lost and feeling hopeless emerge. Oh, and lest we forget, there might be a witch out there hunting the witch hunters?While I had admitted I wasn't frightened in this movie, this type of movie or pretty much any ghost stories, such as the weak ""found footage series of the next generation"" Paranormal Activity franchise, I found the built up tension, comradery between the cast of three, the comedy, cinematography, music and dialogue real enough. They actually convinced me – and this is a rarity, for me – that if I had believed in ghosts, etc, I would absolutely have fallen for the ruse the marketing team came up with. And perhaps, it would've been even more fun to watch it. But, then again, I'm really too smart for that.Sadly, since, again, there has been countless, and mostly insipid found footage films since, if one were to watch this today, for the first time, they might be jaded and dislike it. I can dig that; but for those who pretty much started here, I'm sure there are more people that enjoyed this. For, I did love this movie and still today do.Side Note: It helps I had/have a major crush on the actor and character ""Mike."" Now, I wouldn't have rated the movie higher just because of my attraction, but it sure as hell helped while watching this. Further, and again not a star up or down in my rating, I would've preferred in a movie that basically only featured THREE actors, that Mike would have been shown more. It seems like the percentage of on screen time: (the bitch) Heather: 40%, Josh: 35% and Mike: 25%. Oh, well; that's why they made pause.",The Blair Witch Project

A ghost that has haunted those woods since the founding of the town of Burkittsville in 1810. Supposedly desecrating an old Indian cemetery in the in the area by building the town there it's felt by the people who live in and around Burkittsville that the ""Blair Witch"" is responsible for a number of vicious and unexplained murders. The string of killings started in the late 1800's when five hunters were brutally murdered by the stream at Coffin Rock. The killings continued on intermittently up until the winter of 1940-41 with the murder of seven children at the old man Parr house. The children who were still alive were made to stand in a corner and wait their turn, looking at an empty wall, in order not to see Parr murdered the others. Parr was found to be insane but the people of the town feel that he was possessed by the ""Blair Witch"". The three students drive out into the woods with their van and then take their video and living equipment in backpacks and go hiking out into the eerie forest. Nothing at first really happens to them until they pass by the haunted Coffin Rock. After a nights sleep in their tent the hikers find themselves in what is an old Indian cemetery with a number of rock piles as tombstones all around them. On their way back to their parked van the next night they hear strange noises all around their camp site and when they wake up the next morning they see the rock piles outside as if they were following them. Things become very weird where the three seem to be going around in circles and even worse Mike for some reason throws away the map that Heather had to help them find their way out of the woods. After another harrowing night in the forest the hikers find themselves in an area of the woods with Voodoo like symbols and artifacts all over the trees! Panic starts to set in on the three hikers with Josh, not being able to take it anymore, going crazy and running out into the woods away from the other two hikers. Heather and Mike searching the woods, trying to find Josh, later that night hear faint cries coming from what turns out to be an old abandon house,The old Parr house?,in the woods. Mike going in first goes room to room trying to find Josh and finally realizes that the cries are coming from the basement and runs down there, just as the cries started they all of a sudden stop. Heather screaming for Mike and Josh to answer her also runs down to the basement and then all we see from her video camera is Mike standing in the corner looking into a blank wall, like the children who were killed at the old man Parr house some sixty years ago! Terrified with fear we hear Heather give out an ear splitting cry and the camera falls out of her hand! All we can see from what the video camera recorded is an empty ceiling! Heather Mike and Josh were never seen or heard from again and all that was left of them was the video tapes that they made of their expedition in the woods that made up the movie ""The Blair Witch Project"". ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a lot like the movies directed by the late Jacques Tourneur like ""Cat People"" in 1942 and ""The Leopard Man"" in 1943 and later ""The Curse of the Demon"" in 1957. Tourneur used lights and sounds and shadows to scare the wits out of his audiences not special effects that were so used to seeing in horror movies now.

48,FeastMode,my notes,1,22 July 2019,"This movie is horrendous. i was soooooooooooo bored. the majority of the movie is them complaining about being lost and arguing with each other about who's fault it is. there are extensively long scenes of complete darkness i get the idea of trying to create tension, but i'm watching a motion picture without a picture for long portions of the movie. the only thing good about this is how they made it, with almost no budget and the actors having limited knowledge of the script. but even with that i can't give it a one star. there was almost nothing scary about this. other than it barely being creepy,
SPOILERS
there were literally only two scenes of something ""scary"" actually happening. the first takes place about an hour into the movie, and the second with 5 minutes left. i can't believe i wasted an hour and twenty minutes for those two useless scenes. and they never actually show anything. no joke. nothing.

49,paul2001sw-1,If you go down to the woods today...,10,28 October 2003,"A real horror film is always primarily about the psychology of fear, which leaves the movie maker with one key decision: how much to show, and how much to leave only in the mind.  'The Blair Witch Project' exists as the video diaries of some self-obsessed film-makers, making a film about themselves investigating the legend of a local witch.  As well as being an interesting experiment in narrative legitimacy, it also provides a novel solution to the aforementioned dilemma: we see exactly what the characters see for themselves.  It's convincingly done, and truly spine-chilling.  The ""heroes"" are annoying American brats, but as their plight deepens, one is taken with the sense that they're going to die.  The result is harrowing, and more resembles the BBC's story of nuclear winter, 'Threads', than any conventional horror film.  Not exactly light entertainment, but genuinely good nonetheless.",The Blair Witch Project
50,bowmanblue,The (sort of) original and (sort of) best,8,28 December 2015,"'The Blair Witch Project' invented the 'found footage' portion of the horror genre. Well, it kind of did. The genre was technically lurking in the background, somewhere behind the slasher genre and low budget zombie flicks. You could probably trace it back to such cinematic delights as 'Cannibal Holocaust' in the seventies (only you'd probably regret it if you did). Anyway, The Blair Witch Project may not have entirely invented the type of film which is purely watching shaky hand-held camera-work filmed (for the purposes of the story) by the characters we're following, but it did bring it back to the forefront of horror-movie making. Maybe that along means I should despise it. Only I don't.If you're not familiar with the 'found footage' genre then you probably don't watch enough horror films, therefore any interest you may have in watching three teenagers get lost in a woods will be minimal. That's pretty much the story. The three of them are film students and decide to make – you guessed it – a project on the (allegedly fictional) 'Blair Witch.' Naturally, things don't go according to plan and, if getting lost wasn't annoying enough, some unseen force starts to mess with their little school trip (and one girl gets a runny nose – if you've already seen it you'll know what I mean).You may have picked up on my use of the word 'unseen.' For all found footage films are cheaply produced (okay, feel free to shout me down with such epics as 'Cloverfield' and the odd high budget one, but MOST are!). That way the film-makers don't really have to spend that much money on special effects when they can just have the person holding the camera shake it about a bit and then run off. This is the Blair Witch Project all over. If you're expecting hordes of computer-generated monsters storming the woods and chasing our hapless teens down then you're going to be sorely disappointed.You have to realise that you're going to get long periods of time where not that much happens. The highlight for much of the film is crossing the same river again and again. When I read what I've written I really think I'm not really selling the ol' BWP very well. Believe it or not, I did enjoy it. Back when I watched it in 1999 it was still a fresh genre and, not including old 'video nasties' was pretty original. Plus the acting was good. It really felt adlibbed (actually I think some was) and what you might expect from watching hours upon hours of footage filmed by just some bloke behind the camera. Perhaps one of the reasons I enjoyed it was because I spent a fair proportion of my childhood as a young boy getting (sort of deliberately) lost in the woods and could relate to how creepy the prospect of never getting home again could be (although I made sure I was never more than a stone's throw away from the road and with my dad at all times!).The three actors themselves were just about likable enough, but they do get a little bit annoying and whiney towards the end. I guess that could be explained by them slowly losing their minds due to their predicament, so, if you don't mind their constant swearing, it can be excused.So, if you're okay with 'found footage' films and are interested in the one that spawned a hundred inferior clones, then give this one a go. It's not long and you won't waste too much of your life on it. It's genuinely creepy here and there. Just don't bother with the sequel which doesn't even bother to be original and is just your standard horror cliché-fest.Oh, and if you don't think much to the way BWP ended, you're not the only one. It's a love or hate ending. I guess Family Guy hated it – look up the clip of Brian Griffin the cinema watching Blair Witch on Youtube and see that you're not alone. I felt a little cheated, but grew to accept that that was the way it was just going to be.",The Blair Witch Project

It is a low-budget film school experimentation and I am going to review it with that in mind. Artisan really did hype this film up a lot and people judged it like they would any other movie.We all know the plot. 3 campers get lost in the woods while making a documentary about the force that eventually kills them. With the minimal of money the makers, of this over-exposed movie, create a good deal of tension and raw excitement. Of course there are a few logic errors but I'm kind-hearted enough to see past that.Although this film is shown on a 1.85:1 screen in the cinema the entire movie in is 1.33:1 because it is all shot on video. The photography may be jumpy but it didn't make me seasick like it did to some people. It is a little strange to film everything that is going on but if they didn't there would be no movie.

Many good and bad thing were said about this movie, so i won't repeat it, this is a great horror movie (skip negative reviews), which in a best horror movie traditions doesn't show you evil things (or does it?), but plays with viewers imagination with images, with sounds, with mood.

55,ironhorse_iv,"Blair Witch Project indeed swept me off my feet, but it also flew off the handle of the broom. It was kinda nausea inducing at times.",6,12 December 2016,"Shot entirely in the style of a documentary gone horribly wrong, this movie was indeed groundbreaking for the time, as it re-popularized 'the found footage' horror subgenre marketing style that was somewhat lost in the late 1980s, after the minor success of 1980's 'Cannibal Holocaust'. Using internet-based viral marketing, directors Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick was able to promote the idea that 'The Blair Witch Project' was truly the recovered footage of real documentarians that went missing in the woods of Maryland, in order to cover the local ghost stories, using fake online documents, footage, published dossiers, interviews, and even a couple of professional-looking television documentaries blurred the line between truth and fiction. The only problem with this, is that the movie doesn't know, what type of horror story, it wants to tell. For a movie titled 'Blair Witch', it doesn't really talk much about 16th-century witchcraft that much. Instead, it look like they wanted to talk about the fictional account of a 1940s child murder named Rustin Purr. Despite that, people were subtly convinced that these two legends were real, as opposed to something the film-makers made up themselves. Many were also convinced that the movie was based on a true story, or even consisted of actual footage. Because of this, the real-life actors, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard & Michael C. Williams had to play the part of the fictionalized version of themselves as demise, even after the credits start rolling. They did this, by not appearing in any type of media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film's release. It really did seem, like they walk off the face of the earth to the point that a police investigation was order to expose the facade. For the most part, this verisimilitude marketing kinda works, as it got people interested in seeing this low-budget horror movie that has nothing much happening, including me. However, the marketing did leave some very jarring questions, like if this was a real movie, how was the film footage even recovered, if the woods was really that haunted. Another, is how was any upstart studio got the rights of the footage, from the families of the demise, and able to make a profit off their family members 'supposedly' deaths. Doesn't that seem, a bit odd!? Also, it's really hard to believe that this footage is indeed 'raw', when it look like it been edited to follow a narration path. After all, doesn't it seem a bit odd for these film students to film a lot of footage of them, arguing, cursing, & bickering with each other over a map, that they can't use on their documentary, rather than saving that footage for documenting the events. Still, I guess, they gave a good reason, with Heather's insistence upon filming everything, is suggested by Josh to be her way of coping with the fact that she's lost in the woods. Mad props to Heather's apology scene. She acted so hard that you could practically see the bite marks in the camera. She sobs, screams, and shakes so realistically that her acting was so convinced, making people forget that, she accidentally zoom the camera, too far on her face. However, I did think the directors went a little too far to promote discord between the actors, by deliberately ruining their sleep, and starving them. From what I heard, they were really butting heads toward the end. Still, it does seem, a bit out of character for one of them, to throw away the map for no good reason!? It doesn't make sense, unless, one of the students was really trying to kill the other filmmaker, but that's just a film theory. Despite that, I did enjoy the actors genuinely upset reactions, even if it was somewhat annoying at times. Still, it doesn't explain, why their film footage look like crap even in the beginning, if they supposedly go to film school. Yes, it can be said, the footage was made to look like it has degraded since it's been in the open woods for nearly a year, but it doesn't explain, why these 'student filmmakers' have so many badly shots. All these low grade blurry poorly focus shots make the movie, nearly unwatchable. Also the cringe-worthy shaking cam is really annoying, as it known to makes people vomit. Although, this movie show nearly nothing that was really scary. Like some sort of cinematic Rorschach test, there was enough suspense to keep me, looking for at least something that would get a reaction from me. I give the movie credit that, it didn't relies much on outright special effects of blood, gore, and violence to get people to watch; just the psychological horror and tension of unseen forces and sounds that is slowly ratcheted up with each passing day and night of the characters' descent into madness. It left everything to the audience's grisly imagination. While, this movie had a 2000 & 2016 sequel, 'Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2' & 'Blair Witch'. They didn't live up the hype of the first movie. Overall: I have to say, there is a strong reason why this movie lead a new age of 'found-footage' horror films. It was unique at the time, however rewatching it, now. It's a bit date. Nevertheless, it's not worthless, so no need to kick it in the creek. It's more like a nostalgia watch, these days. So check it out, if you want to.",The Blair Witch Project

57,The-Sarkologist,A dark dose of Avant-Garde,5,22 October 2011,"This is one of the most hyped movies of 1999 (along with Star Wars, which was more anticipated than this movie). One of the things that helped the movie a lot was the impressive webpage (which I will discuss later) and how it actually adds a lot of background to the movie itself.The Blair Witch Project is what is called a Mockumentary. That is a fake documentary. A number have been done in the past, and the best ones are those that the viewer is left wondering if it is true or not. Man Bites Dog was incredibly disturbing while This is Spinal Tap left a lot of people wondering who this group was and where they could buy their albums. In fact, Spinal Tap was formed as a direct result of this movie.The plot to the Blair Witch Project is simple. Three film students go into the woods looking for the infamous Blair Witch and become lost. They are then killed by the Blair Witch. There are a couple of subtle things in the movie, such as the guy at the beginning talking about how a murderer lived in the hills and will force one of his victims to stand in the corner while he killed the other, simply because he could not kill when somebody was watching him.This is said to be a horror movie and pretty scary. I didn't find it scary, but it was very well made. The you never see the antagonist (except when he or she is running away) and strikes is a very intelligent manner. He strikes only at night, and then kidnaps one of them, yet keeps him alive forcing them to not only come after him, but come after him at night. They are lost but he knows the territory exceptionally well. The movie itself is a little sickening because of the motion of the camera. All of it is done using hand held, and people have been made quite sick with it. Some claim that it is because of the horror, but I don't think so. In regards to the horror, some have said that it is bad because it is not traditional horror. I am not at all concerned about that, especially since I hate traditional horror. I myself prefer thrillers to horror, and find movies like the Haunting and Nightmare on Elm Street to be very bad.This I saw not because of the horror or witchcraft, but because of the nature of the film. It is, I believe, one of the first mockumentaries to hit it big time. In fact it has made over $25,000,000US, and even though there might be criticisms about it, this figure is hard to ignore.Now to the webpage. It is designed to add to the background of the movie. I won't go into it much because you can go there yourself. What I will say is that it forms the background to the movie as putting it in the movie itself would add too much to it and destroy the feel to it. In fact, the movie is just as watchable by itself, but reading the background gives much more to it.",The Blair Witch Project

60,zkonedog,"A Precursor To ""Paranormal Activity"" (But Probably Even Better At What It Does)",6,4 March 2017,"Just recently, I read Stephen King's horror treatise ""Danse Macabre"". In that book, he discusses ""The Blair Witch Project"" as one of the most frightening movies he has ever seen. I decided to watch it on that recommendation, and I came away fascinated by the experience.For a basic plot summary, ""Blair Witch"" focuses on a group of three friends trying to produce an independent documentary about the so-called Blair Witch that haunts the woods surrounding a rural town. At first, the documentary seems to be going quite while, but when the trio gets lost in the woods and strange things start happening, things take a turn for the worse.Sadly, history will probably only remember this film for the controversy that surrounded it at the theater (people thinking that the documentary was actually a real thing). While it isn't an all-time classic, to be sure, it does produce some genuine emotion by touching on some very deep themes.Basically, this movie preys on those all-too-human emotions in which the ""monster behind the door"" (as King himself describes it) is much more scary when it is unseen. SPOILER ALERT HERE: During the entire entire, viewers never even catch so much as a glimpse of whatever/whoever is causing the strange happenings. It's the ultimate ""devil you don't know"" story.Yet, ""Blair Witch"" also works on a more human-drama level. Much like the later ""Cloverfield"", it is filmed entirely in the shaky-cam style, trying to be as close to human reality as possible. As the three hikers slowly begin to realize just how hopelessly lost they have become, parts of the film become a sort of character study in panic and emotion. Viewers begin to wonder ""would I react the same way in a similar situation?""Overall, I was more intrigued by ""Blair Witch"" than anything. It is amazing to me how a movie so stark and completely devoid of any conjured drama (no soundtrack, no ""jump scenes"", etc.) can still be a bit unsettling to watch. I have also seen the first ""Paranormal Activity"" movie, and I don't understand why that is viewed with such reverence while ""Blair Witch"" has to fight for every inch, so to speak. They are the same type of movie, but this effort actually shows the descent into panic/madness better than ""Paranormal"" ever did.",The Blair Witch Project

You just need trees, rocks and a map. Now everybody go out and make a film! Unfortunately I'm not reviewing the excellently innovative marketing campaign that the film bolstered. I'm critiquing this snoozefest instead. A group of film students are filming a documentary about the ""Blair Witch"" legend and set off out into the woods to find evidence. Where they soon encounter frightening piles of rocks, spooky dangling sticks and a terrifying lack of basic orienteering skills. Oh yes, the scare factor is at an all-time high! Sit back, relax and prepare yourself to watch absolutely nothing. Nothing! Just three ridiculously unlikeable characters shouting and screaming at each other for 78 minutes whilst aimlessly wandering around a woodland area. ""Where's the map!?""! Someone give me a camera and find me some friends, I'll do the exact same thing and make a incalculable amount of money. On a serious note, I appreciate the stripped-back concept. It's not what you see that induces fear, but your other senses perceiving the unknown. A surround sound system works most efficiently as footsteps and faint screams are heard in every direction, creating an eerie environment. But when the poorly developed characters, story and pace are used to substitute onscreen scares, it doesn't work. You don't care. You just want the ""Blair Witch"" to savagely destroy them immediately. 78 minutes felt like 2 hours, honestly it is that poorly paced and boring. It's clear that The Blair Witch Project is divisive, and I suspect my opinion would be different if I watched it back in '99 with all the ""is it real?"" hype. Alas, it's aged badly.

67,insomniac_rod,You either love it or hate it; it either scares you or you laugh about it...,8,25 August 2004,"""The Blair Witch Project"" was original on it's time, that is the late 90's. It's not the first time that a concept like this was used as ""Cannibal Holocaust"" (1978) has the exact same premise. The 19780's movie was too graphic (extreme gore) unlike the 1999 movie that attacks the audience with psychological terror (everything's in the imagination).""The Blair Witch Project"" shines because it exercises the audience's capacity to create terror and feel it on their own way.*** If you feel frightened or scared it's because you have a HIGH capacity to create terror in your mind. Depending on how much you get scared, the more pleasant the experience of the movie will be. If you get very scared then you've seen too many horror movies and you have a big capacity to create horror. That means you can feel horror. This is the best thing about ""Blair Witch"". ***I can't say if it's whether or not a good movie, I see it more as an experiment to rate your capacity to be scared. Psychological terror is the most effective way to experience a horror movie. Texas Chainsaw Massacre succeeded in that field but it got aid from the graphical violence and the frightening characters. ""Blair Witch"" talks about a witch and spirits. How do you imagine witches and evil spirits? That depends on you. Now when the movie attacks you with the lead characters' P.O.V. you feel the uncertainty of not knowing what's going on and that's when your mind plays it's part by creating a whole different story in your mind. Also, the producers created a brilliant publicity campaign by saying that these are real life events. Before watching the movie that raises the scare factor and it's up to you if you believe or not the premise. The producers tried so hard in making a truly frightening movie and it worked for a big auditory. The movie has also many detractors and it's completely normal because ""Blair Witch"" can't awake everybody's capacity to create terror. I liked this movie very much mainly because I'm a die hard fan of horror movies and supernatural things. The movie is OVERRATED because the critics and members of the ""Scream"" generation made it commercial. It's an independent film with minimal expectations that was viewed as an MTV type of movie and that's what affected the movie. Watch it as a part of horror movies history, it totally deserves the watch.

69,Anonymous_Maxine,"Whether you love it or you hate it, you have to respect The Blair Witch Project for its uniqueness and its originality.",10,3 September 2000,"One of the many unique things about the Blair Witch Project is that no one liked it. Everyone who saw it either absolutely loved it or absolutely hated it, there was unusually little in between. It should be noted that no one has ever made a professional film like this before. People often joke about a movie being so bad that a student filmmaker could make a better one. Well, a student filmmaker really COULD make a movie like the Blair Witch Project, but the point is that no one has ever made a film this deliberately crude and yet attained such stunning success. The makers of the Blair Witch Project cleverly avoid the inevitable comparisons to student films by making the actual premise of the film as a student documentary. That's what makes the movie so good! The tagline is about a bunch of kids who went into the woods, got lost, and whose video footage was found a year later. That makes the film itself realistic beyond all other horror films. The methods of production enabled the actors to present an even more convincing portrayal of a bunch of kids lost in the woods and desperate to get out. A lot of times they didn't even know what was going on with the picture, they really WERE lost and confused. Another notable element of this movie is the way that they were able to create such a tense atmosphere with a virtual absence of gore. This is proof that you do not need buckets of blood in order to make a good scary movie.
So many people complained about the shaky camera work in the Blair Witch Project. They say that it was terrible filmmaking because the camera is always bouncing around, but that was done on purpose! Don't these people realize that the home video look was the primary goal for the finished product here? These kids didn't go out into the woods to shoot this documentary with a full-on film crew complete with caterers and everything else, they went ALONE. However, there was a little bit of botched editing in this film. It is meant to be presented as though they found their video cameras, and what you see on the screen is simply what they recorded on their cameras, with little, if any, editing. Obviously the two cameras they used needed to be edited together so that they show the same material, but there was at least one scene where Heather was seen on the opposite side of a stream crossing the log (the one that they had come back to), but her voice is heard as though it is her holding the camera.
Overall, the Blair Witch Project is a very original and satisfying horror movie, but you have to have an open mind. You have to be able to accept something that was made different than your traditional movie is made, and try to really understand what is different about it and what makes it good. I think that one of the best things about the story is that it leaves so much to the imagination. You never see what is actually tormenting them from out in the woods, all you see is the dark, and that makes every individual audience member imagine whatever it is that they fear the most out there in those woods. In this sense, the film is almost interactive. No other horror film has ever come close to doing anything like that, and the Blair Witch Project should be recognized for it. This is an original, entertaining, and ultimately terrifying film, and you see something new every time you see it.",The Blair Witch Project
70,GOWBTW,No special effects here!,10,16 August 2008,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is a movie within itself. This is really a real live horror movie in the making. Everything in it here is pure and simple. No make up, no extras, no crew, just documentary that's straight forward. It is surprising that a crew doing this project would disappear with a trace. Were the others too frighten to report? Or there's something real sinister about this project? It all took place somewhere in Maryland in 1994, and the film is found a year later. That girl in the video showed real fear. I mean it nearly frightened me too. Many documentaries have their own twists and turns. Some of them are real the rest were made up to fool the viewers. This one was no faker. Great cast to do this re-enactment, and the results is unbelievable. A very good movie! 5 stars!",The Blair Witch Project

This was a film which did better promoting itself than it did delivering its supposed frightening contents. The culprits for this film fiasco are listed as Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams. From the prospective of a common boy scout these supposedly ""College"" students made every mistake as could be made by even the most stupid junior cub-scouts. Their purpose was to travel, via outdoors backpacking to the legendary ghost site of the famous Blair Witch and to ascertain her possible authenticity. As the viewer travels along with them, one wonders if they left their brains in neutral or just back in their dorms. Even Gilligan would not have been that dumb to carry out their own demise, not from the confrontation of the Witch, but with their own ignorance.

Its success was surpassed in 2002 by My Big Fat Greek Wedding.Directed by Eduardo Sanchez, TBWP is presented as a documentary pieced together from amateur footage and filmed in real time. TBWP was shot in a matter of just 8 days and all of the dialogue was, pretty much, improvised.TBWP tells the tale of 3 young Film Students who hike out into the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland to film a documentary about a local legend known as The Blair Witch.The viewer is told that these 3 students were never found, although their video and sound equipment (along with the footage they shot) was discovered a year later.In my opinion, TBWP completely fails to deliver on all counts.*Trivia Note* - Throughout the course of the story the word ""Fukk"" was spoken 154 times.

The rumors are that the Blair Witch resides in the woods just outside of town called Black Hills forest and follows the filmmakers as they search for signs of the witch in that very forest. This movie was directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez in their directorial debuts and stars Heather Donahue (Taken), Joshua Leonard (Depraved) and Michael C. Williams (Altered).

I was living in Far Rockaway, Queens at the time and got so excited to see this movie. Opening weekend we went to Virgin Megastore in Time Square and saw this masterpieces that changed my life forever.

Before seeing this movie I was sure it would be terrible. I'm not against found-footage on principle, but everything I read made this movie sound like it would be trash, especially the positive reviews.I thought that it would just coast on its gimmick and marketing and do nothing but shake the camera and scream. Saying directly to the camera ""I'm so scared!"" isn't exactly following ""show don't tell"".Maybe it's because of this that I was pleasantly surprised. I usually hate improvised stuff, it's insulting to the audience. But here they pull it off just right. The dialogue sounds spontaneous and believable. This is an edit upon rewatching. I forgot just how much quarrelling is in it. You got three people berating each other and it just gets tiring really quickly. It's like a soap.We move smoothly from the amateur documentary to frustrating situation to a bit of a nightmare. And irritating comments like ""this is creepy"" notwithstanding, as a slow burn, it is really effective (with a lot of patience AND tolerance).I basically knew how the whole thing ends, not the exact end, just the gist of it, and I was still clutching Teddy when things really kick off.This is a polarizing movie for understandable reasons.

81,drownnnsoda,"Faux folklore; love it or hate it, it's still ingenious",9,17 January 2015,"No other film made in my lifetime has stirred so much hullabaloo as ""The Blair Witch Project."" Granted, I was only ten years old when the film was released, but I remember its almost immediate absorption into the cultural lexicon; my fifth grade classmates told me stories about it, and how it was real, and how their teenage siblings had let them watch it with them when mom and dad went to bed. Thanks to an expansive marketing campaign that touted the film as ""real footage,"" ""The Blair Witch Project"" fascinated and tantalized audiences in 1999. Despite the fact that the film is entirely fabricated, and that everybody knows it, it doesn't change the fact that it captures an unusual realism that enables it to get under our skin in spite of all presupposition.The premise is simple: three college documentarians go into the woods to investigate the legend of a witch who has been said to be the source of various goings-on in a rural Maryland hamlet over the past century. What starts out as a hunky-dory camping trip slowly edges into a downward spiral of dread as the three find themselves helplessly lost and apparently hunted.As I mentioned, few films made in my lifetime have stirred up such a hullabaloo as ""Blair Witch,"" and I think few films have also been so polarizing. While it is a true ""love it or hate it"" film, and oh, are there haters, there still is no arguing that it's incredibly unique. Looking backwards over fifteen years later, the film has spawned an army of found-footage imitators that are still, for the most part, unimpressively smearing their way across cinema screens well into the twenty-first century. Few, if any, are even remotely as unsettling, and most of them are disastrous. The greatest thing about the film is that it dodges horror tropes in favor of character dynamic and vague suggestiveness. The filmmakers and actors portraying the characters ease potentialities into our heads from early on, interviewing locals about the folklore, relaying stories about purported murders and personal experiences that have been attributed to the witch; playing up the hype of the urban legend. What we don't realize as an audience, is that we very subtly become immersed in the allure and intrigue ourselves— and thus, by the time the characters find themselves at the mercy of nature and experiencing bumps-outside-the-tent-in-the-night, our psyches are impulsively running wild with the evocative power of the folklore that we have been provided. The possibilities of the nightmare here are endless, and that is the true power this film wields, even years later, and even when we know the truth. 9/10.",The Blair Witch Project
82,davispittman,One of the most effective horror movies ever made,10,15 April 2017,"If you're a fan of horror movies then you absolutely must see this classic if you haven't already. In 1999 when this extremely low budget movie was released, it very quickly became a success, both with critics reviews and with the box office. It raked in over 140 million dollars. It was made for about 40 thousand dollars, it was literally all filmed by these three young people, this is the found footage category of horror films all began. We have the filmmakers of the Blair watch project to thank for movies like paranormal activity. I love scary movies like this! This is how you make an effective scary movies that actually scares viewers. Too many horror movies use buckets of fake blood, over the top effects, and show you exactly what you're supposed to be afraid of. This movie does none of those things, not a one of those tactics are exercised at any point. And not doing any of those things is what makes this film work and it's what made it so popular back in 1999. The performances by heather, mike, and josh are all so great, they're realistic and very believable. With this movie, if the performances by the three actors didn't work, then nothing would've worked at all because that's all it is. Seeing these actors reactions to the supposed horrors that are happening to them is what sends a chill up your spine. You hear one of the guys yelling for help at night and you hear far off creepy sounds. These things are effective because it's dark and you literally have no clue what it is you're supposed to be scared of. The stick figures hanging in the woods was a good touch too, it just added on to the eerie creepy factor. If you're going to watch a scary movie one night and you have yet to see this one, just give it a try I promise you won't be disappointed. And the ending is just the icing on the cake. It's done extremely well. 10/10!",The Blair Witch Project
83,EVOL666,Don't Go See This One Drunk...,3,9 February 2006,"I tend to like to sneak some liquor in when I go to the theater - makes me feel more like I'm watching it at home but on a bigger screen and usually makes the screening process more enjoyable...not so with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. This film had more shakes then a Tijuana hooker. I literally felt sea-sick from all the shaky camera-work (the cheap bourbon may have played a part too - but I doubt it...). I know this was a micro-budget film and that the ""real"" feel is supposed to be what makes this films so ""great"" - it just made my stomach hurt.This one is about a group of kids who venture into the woods of Frederick County, Maryland (where I just so happen to reside...) in search of some mythical witch. There's also some side-story about a crazy old guy that abducts kids, but honestly, it's been so long since I've seen this one that I don't even remember what that whole thing was about. In fact, I've lived here for quite a while and have never heard anything about any Blair Witch in the first place, but that's another story. The kids go into the woods and they disappear, and the premise of the film is that what the audience sees is the ""found footage"" (much like the basic storyline of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST)...The same reason that I give this film credit is the very same reason that I hate it - MARKETING. This film had the most ingenious marketing techniques and ""hyping"" that I've ever personally witnessed for a theatrical release. The endless bombardment of commercials, the ""true"" documentaries - everything about how this film was marketed was absolutely brilliant. Which brings me to my major gripe with the film...It didn't live up to the hype. The first two-thirds of the film is boring footage of the three adventurers getting ready for their trip, and then walking in circles in the woods - all shot through a hand held camera that looks as though the person holding it has Parkinson's disease. The very end of the film is relatively ""creepy"", but I couldn't figure out how it tied in to the rest, and honestly don't care to bother trying to piece it together.I give the filmmakers credit for pulling off such a hugely successful film with no budget, and I like the idea of an independent film being shown theatrically - but THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT just wasn't scary, and in my opinion is THE MOST over-hyped film I've ever seen. 3/10",The Blair Witch Project

91,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Terrifying Look at What Could Happen,9,9 April 2019,"This is a film that I still remember the first time that I saw it. My father rented it and as a family we all saw it. At the time of viewing it, I don't even know if I had the internet yet. It was so believable, my sister for years thought this really happened. The synopsis is three film students vanish after traveling into a Maryland forest to film a documentary on the local Blair Witch legend, leaving only their footage behind.To get back into what I really liked about this film the first time is the realism. This isn't the first found-footage film, but it definitely helped revitalize the genre. It really does feel like a documentary. It is even better than the three leads all use their real names as their characters. The director and narrator of it is Heather Donahue. She worked with Joshua Leonard previously and he reached out to Michael Williams to do sound for it.They get to Burkittsville and interview people in the town. One very interesting one is of Mary Brown (Patricia DeCou), an eccentric old woman. She claims to have seen a hairy woman whose feet didn't touch the ground. There is also a couple of the people who talk about a local legend of a child murderer named Rustin Parr.The trio head into the woods looking first for Coffin Rock and then an old cemetery. Tensions start to run high when Mike doesn't believe that Heather knows where she is taking them and that she has gotten them lost in the woods. Noises at night outside of their tent make it even worse as they descend into frustration and terror.As I said earlier, I did think this really happened for some time. Now that I know the truth behind the film, I have to say that the filmmakers did a great job at their campaign. They decided that they wanted everyone to believe that this film was real, even though it is fictional. This is genius to me, especially since they had such a low budget. If not for that, I don't believe this film would do as well as it did.It is a premise though that we can connect with. The scary thing is that even today, with all of the technology we have, something like this could happen. We definitely could get lost in some of the woods in the country and never be found again. This film really is light on the supernatural, which makes those moments even scarier. I have to say, the scenes at night in the pitch black really get my tension going. The real life horror of exhaustion, lack of food and maybe never getting out is there as well.The pacing and editing of this film is interesting. The realism is there and it does just feel like three college students trying to themselves out of the mess they are in. The basic story is simple and the footage is edited in a way where it feels like they would record for stretches and that is what we get. The longer they are lost, the more the tension builds. It can come from the interactions between characters as tempers flare and also from what happens at night. The film is actually written well as there are callbacks to things from earlier in the film, which I'm a sucker for. The ending is bleak and simple, but very effect.I'm not sure this film would be as strong if not for the acting of the trio. Donahue, Leonard and Williams are really just playing themselves, but from what I've read, some of what they were doing wasn't really acting. They did stay out in the woods and writers/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez really messed with them to get the most visceral reactions they could. It is kind of messed to hear, but it did make for a much better product. The interviewees were all great as well. There is such an amateur feel which helps with the realism.There weren't really any effects in the film, but it didn't need them. I have read they wanted to actually have a witch. I'm glad this is something that didn't happen, especially with the budget they had. The little Tiki-men like figures were creepy. The setting is what really makes it and the old house as well.Last thing to really cover would be the soundtrack. The film doesn't have anything that is not ambient. I'm glad they didn't use music, as that really would have broken the realism. The use of sounds while being in the foods was great. That is what drives quite a bit of the fear, especially at night. Something I noticed this time is that at the end, all of the sound is coming from the non-film camera. I bring this up because it is unnerving watching Heather's footage while she is upstairs. This was definitely used strategically.Now with that said, this film is interesting. In the grand scheme of things, not happens. I can see that being an issue for some people. I think what makes it great is that they stick to the realism and it truly feels like a documentary. The true horror comes from being lost, exhaustion and being hungry. What happens to them at night really makes it even worse and build the tension. The acting seems real and even though there aren't a lot of effects, what we get is solid. The soundtrack of the film was used strategically as well. If you've never seen it, give it a viewing. I think this is a really good film and definitely helped spark the found-footage boom that happened again.",The Blair Witch Project
92,Samiam3,A project unlike any other,8,17 September 2009,"Next to Spinal Tap, The Blair Witch Project is probably the century's most memorable mockumentary. Usually that term is associated with comedy, but this film although starting out kind of amusing turns into everything but. What we see is the footage captured on a handicam from three kids who went out into the woods in search of an urban legend, the Blair witch, but their incompetence got them lost, which led to frustration, which led to anger, which led to fear, and then to... well lets just say careful what you which for, you might find it.My first bit of advice for approaching The Blair Witch Project is this; take a gravol pill. The camera work which is intentionally shaky and awkward is nauseating, aside from that this is a wicked presentation (sometimes literally so) Cinema cannot get anymore subjective than this.

94,Spleen,Dull incompetence wrapped up in false advertising,1,19 May 2000,"It's either a documentary or a work of fiction.  If it's a documentary it's a fraudulent one.  (It's not even a clever fraud.  I wouldn't have thought that such grotesquely inept camera-jiggling could have fooled anyone; but apparently it did.)  If it's a documentary then it's none of MY business to condemn it - I should simply report the scam to the police, the broadcasting tribunal, etc. and hope that someone will have the nerve to prosecute.Taken as a work of fiction `The Blair Witch Project' is possibly the most wretched that has ever come to my attention.  I'm serious.  I can think of works of fiction that are worse in some positive way - books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, for instance - and I can't be expected to keep every single forgettable old book or television show lodged in my memory - still, I know of no other work so thoroughly lacklustre.  We don't even get the bare minimum of competent camera work we demand as a matter of course in other lame, incompetent endeavours.  The camera wobbles stupidly and does NOTHING else.  It doesn't even give us information.  The characters TELL us everything that's going on, in their long-winded way; they then offer us the camera footage as a kind of proof that they're not lying.  What's true of the images is true of the sound, too.  Heather and crew hear some `scary' noises at night; but do WE get a chance to listen to them properly, to decide for ourselves if they're scary or not?  Nope: instead we get an earfull of everyone panicking and DESCRIBING the sounds that I'm surprised they can still hear over the gabble of their own voices.How could something so bad as `The Blair Witch Project' turn a profit?  How could it show, not just a profit, but the greatest return on investment of any film in history; how could it, despite all the people who walked out of the cinema or wished that they had, produce a few testimonials from people who said that they were duly scared - even that they LIKED it?  I think I have an answer.  The film disguised itself as a documentary.  The dullest footage of the most banal murder has its attractions, provided it's genuine. Fictional murders have to work, so to speak, to be interesting: real murders automatically are.  A simple lie can transform eighty minutes of utter rubbish into box office gold.But you wouldn't want to tell an open lie too blatantly or too consistently. The law still has SOME teeth.  A better tactic is to persuade people to pretend - not imagine, but PRETEND - that they're watching a documentary. If we can't really believe that this is a documentary, they'd like us to come as close to really believing as possible.  Fiction is all about `suspending disbelief', right?Well, no, it isn't.  A good work of fiction can frighten us, thrill us, fill us with aching longing and/or keen interest, etc. without asking us to be so feeble-witted as to suspend disbelief.  `The Blair Witch Project' can't.P.S.:  Some say we should be merciful because the film only cost $30 000 to make.  But what does this have to do with us?  It's not as if they reduced admission prices in consequence.",The Blair Witch Project
95,EdgarST,A Treat for Film Students,6,25 November 1999,"There is nothing worse than watching a movie with film students. They not only complain about technical aspects, but they usually think of the way they would have shot the same script. For four years working at the Havana Film and Television School, I went through this, and I suppose I caught some of their ""disease."" The consequences of this ""film alphabetization"" came to the forum while watching ""The Blair Witch Project."" I remembered the students' approval of something good, as well as their loud reactions, their laughter and booing. At the same time I was questioning the film during the whole projection. This does not mean I did not find it an interesting film experience (I saw it in a theater, and I was the only customer). Quite the contrary: it is an original cinematic concept, an intelligent reflection on fear, and a good definition of horror as nothing but a state of mind, related to ignorance and darkness. However in too many occasions more than I can remember right now-- the situations were barely credible on technical and dramatic grounds: for example, would you believe someone lost in the woods (Heather) would keep on taping images while discovering that another person (Mike) has thrown their only connection to civilization --a map-- to the river? Well, Heather shouts at Mike like hell but she never stops gazing through the visor of her video camera! She is one of the most obnoxious characters ever to appear on a film (see during the first part, how she does not let her interviewees finish their sentences), not only for her bully ways but also for her obsessive recording of a ""documentary."" She is not a filmmaker; she is just a student working on a project, because of which her life is in danger. Before the resolution, there is a brief moment when Heather and Mike are alone in the darkness, inside the tent, when it seems improbable that the recorder would be registering sounds. And on top of that, we are not told that this is the edited and Dolby version of the found footage, a fact that predisposes the ""film alphabetized"" viewer to distance himself/herself from the film, and smile at the naïve opening title. But it is a remarkable film nonetheless, although the overrating affects the objective appreciation of the filmmakers' good work.",The Blair Witch Project

As many people have already said, it scares because it doesn't show anything, just leave you imagining all the creepy stuff. All the three main actors are extremely professional in what they're doing, you can't say they're acting-- specially Heather Donahue, whose panic face in the last scenes is phenomenal. As many people also already said, this movie inspired many others, which makes it even better, considering it's huge originality back when released.

99,lemon_magic,"If you go out in the woods today, you'll get a BIG SURPRISE...",7,7 January 2006,"""Blair Witch Project"" has come under a lot of heavy criticism for its many shortcomings, for its over-hyped/overcooked viral marketing campaign, and for its length (some critics seem to think it would have been much better as a 30 minute short subject). Many of these criticisms have merit. However, once I saw it (on VHS, long after the hype had died down), I enjoyed it quite a bit. The fact that I first saw it on VHS, on my living room television, may have had much to do with my positive reaction to it. Even though it is mostly set in the woods of Maryland, BWP's tiny cast and rough, grainy, under-lit feel lend it a curiously intimate quality, as of a ghost story told around a campfire at night...and I think this quality comes across better in a dark, silent living room than a large movie theater with dozens-to-hundreds of people in the place with you. I also think the grainy, cheap, hand-held feel translates better on the small screen. It's better than it deserves to be...you might think of it as one of those 'accidents' of film making like the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". In fact, I am pretty sure that the editors and the choices they made were what 'saved' this film from obscurity. Many slick film makers have tried to duplicate TCM, including its director, and no one has ever completely succeeded. I think the same is true here...the film makers got lucky and they knew it. Mostly, I think I enjoy BWP because I have a understand the true impact of the phenomenon that rangers and outdoors-men refer to as 'woods shock' - the devastating impact of being REALLY LOST in the woods. Modern urban dwellers can easily underestimate this impact and dismiss it because we've never been truly 'lost' in our lives. But many fit, experienced hikers and campers actually given up, laid down, and died from the stress of being lost in the North American forests and mountain ranges, often less than a day's hike from civilization and with supplies and rations still in their packs. The original meaning of the term 'bewilder' is to take someone out in the woods and get them lost, and leave them there...and it was first coined hundreds of years ago, by people who were much more comfortable in forests than we are now. So I think the basic story idea, of three callow film students going for a 'simple', ordinary overnight trip into the woods and stumbling into disaster makes for compelling viewing if it is handled right...and I feel that BWP use of the plot device of hand-held cameras (documenting their growing unease, bewilderment, and finally hopeless terror), is a brilliant stroke that sidesteps the issues of slick production work , professional sound work, 'good' acting, etc.Yes, there are some contrived elements that don't hold up to serious examination (especially the 'editting' of the film found in the cameras, which is much more 'dramatically apt' than a simple presentation of what happened), but that's true of almost any ghost story or horror story told around a campfire at night (""And there, on the handle...was a HOOK!!!"", etc. ""Like, I am sooooo sure...""). But I found the casts' reactions to their growing predicament credible and enjoyed the way the plot kept turning the screws on them tighter and tighter. And while the payoff may have been annoyingly ambiguous, jumbled, and hard to decipher, it was plain that something Very Bad Indeed had happened to the film students. The glimpses provided of the walls of the house where everything comes to an end are the materials for good old fashioned nightmare fuel. What WERE those markings on the walls??? While the followup sequel was an unmitigated cinematic disaster, BWP succeeds as a nasty little ghost story and can be enjoyed on those terms.",The Blair Witch Project
100,eric262003,A Horror Film Where Fear is The Real Monster,8,21 February 2016,"In the 1999 horror classic ""The Blair Witch Project"", we see three aspiring young filmmakers in 1994 set out on journey to do a documentary project based on a mysterious urban legend of the Blair Witch, who resides in a forest outside of a small town in Maryland. At first we're given the impression that this film was based off of their raw footage. The research going into the documentary is pretty shoddy in execution. The camera is purely out of focus and plus that Heather (Heather Donahue) repetitively utilizes ""u-huhs and yeahs"" when she's asking questions towards the residents in the area. The opening scenes will surely make you gnash your teeth in annoyance. In fact this whole movie within a movie can be contrived at times. But once the young students enter the woods in search of the Blair Witch, the annoyance becomes more paranoiac as the fears and the anxieties start to send chills down our spines. Fortunately, the real filmmakers (Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez) were not as inept as the student filmmakers. We get some believable settings as the determined crew makes their way into the Maryland forests, where they are lost and the more trapped they are in the labyrinth of tress and shrubs, the more the adrenaline level goes up rapidly as the fears and paranoia become overwhelming. The daytime scenes start off quite equivocal as just the sounds of twigs from tree or on the ground snap can surely garner scares where expect the unexpected becomes focal in our minds as much as theirs. The rock piles that bear a resemblance of grave markers epitomizes a sense of unsettling tension of the students as though their eyes are playing tricks on them. These supernatural elements that the threesome face would likely drive anyone insane. The daytime fears seem pretty tame at first because the paranormal activity doesn't generate as much fear as the gang might shed some hope of finding their ways out of the woods, if they could trace back to where they begun their journey. When night comes and when things go bump in the night, the fear factor really gets the boost. The strange sounds nearby can be chillingly frightful and our brave but naive, unequipped students can do nothing but stick together. But nightfall the horror party finally gets tense and the audience watching this can feel this level of fear that anyone sneaking up behind them in the theaters can get someone a cardiac arrest. The forest is black, the theater is dark, everything is painted black during these scenes. The main prop in this movie is the cheap first-person camcorder which eventually becomes a character in itself as we become a part of this movie courtesy of the camera as well as the terror the gang faces it lingers on us as well as we feel convinced that there might be a Blair Witch lurking in these forests. These camera traits show adults that it is normal that human beings are scared of the dark and nothing shameful about that. The lack of preparation when entering the woods, the students have been faced in a sort of predicament they can't seem to get out of and the more they struggle the worst it gets. When Heather the booger- dripping leader of the team she confesses that it was her stubborn ways and determination to finding the truth she begs her cohorts Josh and Michael for forgiveness, we actually feel for her without the audience feeling manipulated.""The Blair Witch Project"" is utilized as a staple on why we're obligated to watch and let alone produce films. When the students start to get restless, hungry and feared, Heather decides that now's the time to close the camera. Finally, the more restrained Joshua takes her camera and retaliates by pointing it back at her and shouting back at her as though, the camera rules her life while it affects the other two characters caught in the middle of the mess she put them in. In some ways this movie helped spawn shows like ""Ghost Hunters"" and ""Ghost Adventures"" where paranormal experts go around the world in seek of the truth in that there is life beyond our mortal lives.",The Blair Witch Project
101,Sandcooler,Work of genius,10,1 November 2009,"In one way this is a bunch of people filming random trees with a video camera, in another it's one of the creepiest movies ever made. Most of the time you don't know what's happening, and that's its major strength. The mystery in this movie gets unbearable once you're into it, and for the most part you don't get any wiser as the time progresses, just more intrigued. You know it's not going to end well, but how will it end? What is all this footage leading up to? People walking around in the woods has never been this fascinating, and probably never will be again. And then you finally get the ending, and it pisses some people of, but to me it is extremely fitting. What was the audience really expecting, I wonder.

102,lewiskendell,Take a little trip into the woods.,7,22 December 2010,"""I'm afraid to close my eyes. I'm afraid to open them.""The Blair Witch Project was the first really popular ""found footage"" movie of my generation, and Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity, Quarantine, and other movies owe a lot of their success to this low-budget flick. If was mega-popular (though divisive) when it was released in 1999, but is it still chilling when watched today? For the most part, yes. What makes The Blair Witch Project effective is the great way that atmosphere and fear of the unknown are used, as well as how well the three actors sell their frustration, unease, and finally, terror. As the three amateur filmmakers get more and more lost in the woods, their anger and annoyance at one another and their situation does a great job of raising the tension. Add that to the local legends that they were exposed to before venturing out into the wilderness and the odd, disturbing events that start happening each night, and you've got a pretty creepy little film.The key to enjoying movies like The Blair Witch Project is how easily you can suspend your sense of disbelief and just go with what you're seeing. If the movie can draw you in, you'll probably have a good time with it. I didn't have a hard time putting myself in the shoes of our trio, and I know that if I had been in their situation, I would have been well and properly freaked out. It had been probably five years since I last saw this, but It still gave me the creeps and I still love the ending. It's a fun movie for the right kind of horror fan.",The Blair Witch Project
103,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"A late '90s relic, which doesn't hold up well",4,16 September 2016,"While this film not only single handedly created an entire genre (found footage) and largely ushered viral marketing, and while I was happy that an ultra low-budget horror was getting as much attention as this did upon its release, in retrospect, the film has little to recommend it. There is a degree of fear and dread, as we learn of this supposed mystery of a backwoods witch, before seemingly becoming lost in those very same woods, but the film can never give us any character or situation to invest in, as I found the trio of leads to be unlikeable, and as their own fear grows as they turn on each other, they became even more unlikeable and unsympathetic. I'm not going to recommend this for those reasons, but if you're a fan of found footage, and you can tolerant the characters, give it a go, because it does have an effectively lonely, slightly creepy (at times) feel, but I just couldn't stand the characters, or the film itself, after a while.",The Blair Witch Project
104,vengeance20,Plain as drywall,1,15 August 2016,"Really don't get the hype with this film, I really don't. There's simply nothing great about it yet it's extremely overrated! To start, the biggest & main issue is... NOTHING & I mean NOTHING happens in this film! You don't see anything aside from 3 teens screaming, shouting & swearing at one another throughout the 85 minutes of this film! There's no entity you can actually SEE, because apparently of this film was to have an ""unseen"" entity or ""force"" tormenting the 3 teens! I understand the scary idea of something you can't see or touch must be scary in real life, to just imagine it alone is scary but for it to be translated into a film for an audience behind a camera is boring! I want to SEE something not IMAGINE where's the use in that when you can easily say that ghosts don't exist? Hell you'd be better off watching an episode of Most Haunted with Yvette Fielding screaming & shouting at everything while here team also swear & curse at nothing it's that boring! That's this film in a nutshell!Film's are meant to be entertaining & the idea for this film fails to attempt to have an unseen force chasing them, we don't see anything so what on earth is the point? I just simply don't get how that can be scary considering your watching this in the comfort of your own home/cinema! It just doesn't work unless it were a real life situation! Where then it WOULD be scary & worth bragging about on the net! This film doesn't cut it & is watered down enough as it is with the shaking cam, annoying dialogue, weak story line, thin plot, Jesus need I go on!?The ending well... was crap, funnily enough better then the 85 minutes that was wasted! It was at this point, too little too late & only a 1 second bit of SOMETHING happening in the entire film! Just bad! REALLY bad!A sequel titled Book of Shadows was released in 2000 a year later & by Christ is way way WAY better than this weak piece of trash! 1/10, ignore this film & watch Book of Shadows that has action, blood, gore & something ACTUALLY happening unlike this pathetic excuse of a film!",The Blair Witch Project

This is reinforced with her handling of the map even as the crew becomes hopelessly lost. The thought that springs to mind: ""The map is not the territory"" - life is not what you expected. Even in the final scene the theme comes through, where the camera belongs to the director, yet her voice is distant - who is behind the camera?

It doesn't seem scary at first but the film slowly and expertly raises the tension and scares within each scene.Overall, this is what I think horror films should be.

It was hailed by critics and became a worldwide phenomena, catapulting itself into legendary status in the world of horror almost instantly.It was not only one of the pioneering films in the current wave of the found-footage sub-genre (which had existed since at least 1980's ""Cannibal Holocaust"", but had never quite met with such public recognition), but also one of the earliest films to successfully implement a wildly successful web-based viral marketing campaign. It helped to sell the idea that this was more than a film- this was ""real."" People genuinely did not necessarily know that this was just a movie- the marketing made us question if this was real life footage, which only garnered more and more hype.It became something more than a film... it was an event. A piece of history.So, how does it hold up now, nearly 20 years later?I'd say extremely well.Yes, it is true that ""The Blair Witch Project"" had a somewhat divisive effect on audiences around the world. Horror has a way of dividing audiences in a way due to fear being a wholly subjective experience. But I do firmly believe that it is a masterpiece of horror, able to do so much with so little, while maintaining strong character, a compelling storyline and building a top-notch mythology that still has the power to stick with you long after the credits begin to roll.We follow a trio of student filmmakers- Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard- as they travel to Burkittsville, Maryland to work on a documentary about the local legend of the ""Blair Witch."" However, their passion project soon gives way to absolute terror as they become lost in the woods, unable to find their way out, and mysterious events begin to plague them. It appears they are being followed by a mysterious force in the woods, which will stop at nothing to get them... And so, armed only with their wits and cameras to record the events plaguing them, they continue their journey, trying to escape the clutches of the evil that is pursuing them.The biggest appeal of the film is that it very much does prey on the idea that what you don't see is oftentimes scarier than what you do see. The film makes a constant and consistent effort to build an absolute atmosphere of dread using only minimal tactics. Strange sounds in the distance... pitch-black darkness surrounding our characters... the appearance of mysterious piles of rocks and figures made of sticks. It's incredibly minimalist, and yet it is so darned effective. And when the film finally does move in for those jumps to punctuate the atmosphere, you're so enthralled that it rattles you right to the core.The performances also help to elevate the material to its legendary heights. While it's key moments have been parodied to death in the ensuing years, it's hard not to connect with the characters. Particularly Heather, who despite her flaws, is still very much a person. When the film's iconic ""I'm so scared"" moments pops up (and that's not spoiling anything, it's one of the iconic images that the film was marketed by), your heart will be breaking while the hair on the back of your neck continues to stand with tension.It really is without question that writer/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez struck gold with this film. It's become a pop- culture phenomena and to this day, is still aware and relevant to horror audiences.While it's slow-build nature may turn off some movie fans, I cannot emphasize how much this film works and how important it is when viewing the history of film and horror.It's easily a perfect 10 for me.

It is extremely unpleasant and directors seem to be hiding behind the excuse of close ups and pitch black shots, to create the cheapest effects. As far as this one goes, you never see anything that proves the existence of supernatural forces. And you mostly lean towards bad joke theory. On and off screen. You can imagine any explanation except the one the title is referring to. At least the sequel, as mediocre as it can be, tried to have a script and a plausible conclusion.

It reminded me of that hoax footage that was supposedly of a live Sasquatch taking an afternoon stroll through the forest. The pseudo-documentary approach looks more like a cheap reality show.

What you will see besides leaves on the ground is the endless f-bomb arguing of these mindless brats, culminating with the classic scene of a bad actress framed conveniently in the exact corner (accidentally, right, ha ha) as she sniffs her way through a meandering apology to everyone from her folks to her pet parakeet.

It wasn't the first horror movie based on the supposed footage of ill-fated documentarians but mainstream audiences hadn't seen anything like it. The premise here is amply summed up by the film's tagline: 'In October of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary... A year later their footage was found.'The story is a good example of 'less is more' storytelling. True, the plot does involve a fair amount of aimless wandering through the woods but those scenes are crucial in the give and take of suspense where each night could be their last. There were a couple of instances when I thought that the script could have benefited from just a little less information (thus ratcheting up the mystery) but the film still shows plenty of restraint and, consequently, skillfully manipulates our fear of the unknown.Meanwhile, the cast of unknowns does a pretty good job of seeming like regular people rather than actors. There may be a few occasions whereby the emotions don't quite ring true but for the most part the actors are sufficiently convincing. They also perform double duty as cameramen, helping to enforce the film's sense of realism with mostly lo-fi visuals.In the end, though, this is one of those films that most people will either love or hate.

By the time of it's running,thru a number or film festivals and word-of-mouth promotions thru the early part of 1999,the movie was a virtual dynamo of anticipation when it finally landed in commercial theaters a week or two after the 4th of July that year.For the most part,it feels like a lot of invention and inspiration for a movie that,while inspired and effective enough,seems to be really challenging the viewer to love it or hate it. When I first saw it eleven years ago,I was much more in the ""love it"" camp. Upon re-watching it in full more recently,I'd more put it in the ""solid like"" category.Treated,at its broad-frame as a sort of ""Super documentary"",it portends to show the film of an attempted documentary of three film students from Baltimore(Heather Donahue,Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard--all using their real names and not seemingly attempting to show any distinction that would give them away as actors)who go on the trail of the rural legend of the Blair Witch,an 18th century woman who was cast into the woods of post-colonial Maryland,only to disappear and somehow,foist curse on the locals in neighboring towns. After roughly eight days of being lost in the woods somehow,the three understandably lose their cools,rationale and eventually much more as their uncanny knack to be tracked by someone(or something)in the woods has them unable to think clearly and,ultimately,escape.Plenty of ""cinema verite"" and improvisation(supposedly,the directors made the actors merely react to situations by leaving index cards along the woods telling them of what was happening next)made this simultaneously one of the more organic and unnerving films made.My lessening of enchantment of this movie is mostly from the passage of time,a chance to digest all the elements of the film/story and the re-evaluation of camera and filming tactics,which,while appreciable for their lack of excess and attention to more intangible fear and atmosphere,seem to be challenging the viewer in ways that threaten to break the viewing experience as well as enhance it.Extras on the DVD are a real plus:getting to see much of the back-story attached to this show is a largely satisfying element(and also gives me some insight into a couple of less-than-flattering reviews)to accompany a film that may seem a bit thin or ""naked"" on its own. An inspiration for ensuing ""shocker"" movies to come(Cloverfield,Quarantine,Paranormal Activity,The Last Exocrcism come to mind),this movie is worth a look,though the cleavage of opinion on it is gonna be quite difficult to overcome. Back then,a near ten;now,a weak seven. A keeper? You be the judge.",The Blair Witch Project

At the time, I didn't appreciate it because I didn't understand the concept of a found footage movie. 17 years later, I re-watched it to get ready for the new sequel and it has grown on me. It feels very real. I love the beautiful scenery and the autumn look of the woods. A woman named Heather is making a documentary on the Blair Witch. Her two friends, Josh and Mike help her with filming and the equipment. Pretty soon, they begin to hear strange noises at night, they get lost, and begin to see twig stick figures. This is definitely a good creepy iconic flick to watch when you wanna feel scared or great to watch around Halloween. I would definitely recommend THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT!!!",The Blair Witch Project

But like Paranormal activity, the movie never exactly scared me. Everyone thought that that was great. Me, well, I told people to take a pass on it. They disagreed. The Blair witch project was groundbreaking for scary movies. Just look at, for instance, Paranormal activity, and Cloverfeild, and Quarantine. They all are made in a similar sort of way. The Blair witch project is a simple plot. It's about a group of college kids who go into a woods to see if The Blair witch actually existed. Along their trip, people start to go crazy and they all get really scared.I know what you're thinking? How does that sound good at all? Well, at least this one is entertaining and creepy and disturbing. Paranormal activity wasn't that scary, occasionally creepy, and horribly repetitive. The Blair witch project may be a little overrated, but it doesn't matter. It's a chiller at it's best.The Blair witch project: A-",The Blair Witch Project
117,Big Movie Fan,Absolutely Awful Rubbish,1,11 September 2002,"Firstly, I am a fan of horror movies and I have no problem in suspending my disbelief and being scared by a movie. Over the years I've let myself be scared by movies such as Hellraiser, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, The Haunting, House On Haunted Hill, The Changeling and many others.This film however was totally rubbish. Okay, so you don't see the Blair Witch in it? The horror was supposed to be implied rather than shown. I don't have a problem with that. I prefer horror moves where the unseen is more scary but Blair Witch was rubbish.The majority of the film was set in daylight and the characters stood swearing over their map. Any scenes that were set at night were rubbish. All you could hear was twigs snapping and leaves rustling. It didn't scare me and it didn't scare me when the young lady was sniffling at the end because she knew she was going to die. This movie was supposed to make people never want to go into the woods again. Well, as me and my girlfriend enjoy hiking, I can say that this movie did not put me off going into the woods unlike Jaws which put me off swimming for awhile. Nothing in this movie scared me. As for the camera work, the crew should have brought a tripod.Another thing was that this movie was filmed documentary style. This made it no scarier. If you want to watch a horror movie filmed documentary style that is scary then I suggest the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Cannibal Holocaust.All in all, this movie was extremely bad and not at all scary unless you find the sounds of twigs snapping scary. This film was rubbish.",The Blair Witch Project

It's inventive approach makes it a must see for horror fans and it remains fresh and original to this day. It also makes for a refreshing change to the generic, overproduced, jump scare filled horror films of the modern day.That said, for a film that is included on so many 'scariest films of all time' lists, it wasn't as frightening as I was expecting. The tension and suspense is all there but it ultimately comes to nothing and I did feel a sense of disappointment when the credits rolled. 'The Blair Witch Project' is an engaging and refreshingly original film, but it just didn't scare me as much as I wanted or expected it to.",The Blair Witch Project
120,baumer,My final comment about Blair Witch,10,12 August 1999,"Warning may be some spoilersOkay, by now I think many have seen the film and there seems to be quite the split about how great it is.  I for one loved this film.  I love that it was original ( and I say that knowing there are films out there like Cannibal Hollocaust and the Last Broadcast ), I love that it was documentary style, I love that it made you use your imagination and I loved the three actors in it. But I do have a few comments to make regarding the criticism.First off, the Blair Witch Project was a small film that like El Mariachi and Clerks was just hoping to get a video deal or perhaps a cable deal to recoup there budget.  So to say that this was film was over-hyped is a bit of a fallacy.  To me over hype is when a studio comes out and says a film that has been out for a few days ( take any Disney animated film ) is already a classic.  That is hype.  But when a film that no one really thought much of takes the film world by storm and it is us, the paying audience that gives it the kudos that it deserves, that is not hype, that is word of mouth.  So to say that this is a bad film because it was over hyped is just rubbish.  These two guys ( Sanchez and Myrick ) at the very least had an innovative idea and took what they remember as being scary from the classic horror films, and they combined it all into one scary-as-hell-play-with-your-mind-psychologically-tormenting-movie.  So it is not over hyped.Secondly) I can understand why some people don't like this film.  I know it is not for every taste.  But please stop and listen to yourselves when you do criticize it.  The majority of the people that don't like it say the same thing.  ""Where's the witch?""  ""The only thing scary about this is that I spent 10 bucks on it.""  "" Borrrrring.""  Well if that is how you feel, then that is how you feel, but the least you could do is try to elaborate why it is that you feel the way you do about this film.  And also try to realize that perhaps the reason you are not scared or at least tense in the film is not because it isn't well made, it is just probably that you don't fear the same things that some of the rest of us do.  This film relies solely on playing with people's minds, and it did a hell of a job with mine.Finally, I love this film.  I love everything about it.  I think it is the best film that I have seen this summer and I admire the two directors for doing what they did.  To make a film that concentrates on atmosphere and mind games instead of blood and gore is a true testament to how much they must love the genre.  Think of classic Carpenter and Hitchcock.  They did much of the same thing.  There was hardly any blood in the shower scene in Psycho and very little in Halloween.  Blair Witch also has but one scene with blood in it, and yet it is one of the most effective scenes in the film because you are shocked by it.To people that don't enjoy this film, I honestly have pity for you, and I do not mean that in a pretentious ""I'm better than you"" kind of way.  I know we all have different tastes in horror films and that is okay, but if you could just feel the raw fear and experience that strange sensation when your heart races at the end of the film, or to actually go camping and stare into the darkness and wonder what that snapping twig is about ten feet away from you, you would really thank the guys for making this.  I love that this film could do that to me.  I love that it could get inside me like that.  And it's too bad that those of you that didn't feel that way, could, just for one moment.  That to me, is the power of film making.  To manipulate somone's emotions the way this film does is a treasure unto itself.Psycho had people in their generation always looking out of the shower. Jaws kept us out of the water.  Halloween kept us afraid of the night. Nightmare on Elm Street kept some of us from falling asleep.  Blair Witch will give you a paranoia about camping, for those of you that like the film that is.  My humble opinion, this is a 10/10.  When people ask me what the scariest horror films I've ever seen are, I will respond with Halloween, Jaws, Nightmare On Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Aliens, Angel Heart, Last House On The Left, Evil Dead, Amittyville Horror and the newest entry, The Blair Witch Project.  To me, and to many others, it is the epitome of fear.  And I love to be scared.",The Blair Witch Project
121,baumer,All of our primal fears are lived vicariously through this movie,10,3 August 1999,"The Blair Witch Project is the personification of fear.  This is a film or rather an experience that knows what it is that scares the human soul.  As one reviewer so perfectly stated, this film brings back what it is that scared us as kids.  And what it is that scares us are things that are naturally frightful.  When you are five or six years old we are not naturally afraid of men with masks that stalk babysitters or men with hockey masks that haunt horny campers.  Those are things that are taught to us by the news or by watching enough scary movies.  But what we are afraid of, even though we don't know why, is the dark, strange noises in the middle of the night and our own subconscious.  We are afraid to go downstairs when the lights are off because we don't know what is waiting down there to get us. And the reason we are scared of these things is simply that it makes us think of death or extreme pain.  The Blair Witch Project preys on those fears.  And as long as it takes to get into those primal fears, the setup is worth the payoff.  What we witness is three people that could be budds that we went to school with.  They are not caked with makeup and set in the perfect light to make them Jennifer Love Hewitt or Joshua Jackson.  They are three people that are tired, unshaven, hungry, cold, deprived and scared out of their minds.  They are a microcosm of every single one of us put in the same situation.  I have never seen a film like this one before and only a handful of times have I felt close to what I did watching this film.  First there was Jaws, that made me afraid the water.  Halloween made me afraid of the night and Nightmare On Elm Street made me afraid to go to sleep.  There are a few others that made me feel similar to this, but no movie has ever made me feel exactly the way Blair Witch did.  In here you feel like what is happening is real.  8mm cameras can do that.  You are watching a home video and what you can't see scares the hell out of you.  We hear what they hear, we feel what they feel and we are prone to curl up in a ball and wait for the inevitable.  I have seen this movie twice now.  The first time I saw it for myself, the second time I saw it to watch the reactions of the people in the audience.  When the nights came and all the ruckus started, people ( audience ) curled up almost into fetal positions, they grabbed onto whatever arm was next to them and their breathing became a little heavier.  Male or female it didn't matter.  No matter if this film is fact or fiction, it attacks everything that makes us afraid and it exploits it like perhaps no other film has ever done or will ever do.  Now I have read the comments that dismiss this film as fluff and how it is not really scary, and that may be true for some people, but for the majority of the people that have seen this, it hits us with such force that it does cause you to keep the lights on at night.  This is ingenius film making and even though it is not exactly what people would consider on par with say Citizen Kane ( only on a technical level ) you will not find a film that manipulates our senses and our primarily our fear more than this one, and on that level, this is one of the best films ever made.  I can't say enough about this film.  It is a psychological trip through fear.  It makes us feel lost and it keeps us fearing that these people will never get out alive.  And it is true what people say: the last shot of this film will scare you more than any shot in the history of film.  That is high praise coming from me, I grew up on horror films.  You can take a shot of Michael Myers rising methodically in the background in the first Halloween, the opening death of Chrissie Watkins in Jaws, the dinner table scene in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the shower scene from Psycho, the boiler room scene in Nightmare On Elm Street, the scene where Hicks discovers the aliens in the ceiling from Aliens or even any one of the rape scenes in Last House On The Left ( that is some pretty select company ) and still they will not surpass the raw emotion and primal fear that you will feel in the last five minutes of this film.  Blair Witch is pure fear.  It should be seen by everyone at least once.  If I could meet any of the five major players in this film ( the three ""actors"" and the two writer/directors ), I would thank them for showing me that someone hasn't forgotten how to make a scary film.  This is what fear should be.  Whoever makes the next ""Hollywood"" horror film has giant shoes to fill. Good luck.",The Blair Witch Project
122,baumer,A tense and frightening film. Completely original.,10,30 July 1999,"I think I am going to be the reviewer in here that is somewhat down the middle with my assessment of the film.  I have been reading reviews and comments about the film for about a month now, and most of the comments have been either a) it is the scariest film ever orat least since Halloween or b) it is absolute crap.  Well if I had to lean one way it would be towards a). But even though this film is scary, it honestly could have been the scariest film ever made if only for one small thing, and I'll get into that in a moment.As much as this film is a horror by definition, it is more of a psychological study of the human spirit.  This movie asks the question "" How much can a human being take before we lose it?""  And on that level The Blair Witch Project is perfect.  We see three people that start off with good intentions and ambitious spirits and then we watch them unravel as fear sets in.  And all throughout this film I kept asking myself how would I react if I was in the same situation?  And the answer that I came to was,probably the same way that these three did.  When you have human beings in what is seemingly a dire problem and an impossible location, how does that affect you?  Do you laugh about it?  Do you freak out on each other?  Do you look for blame?  Are you frightened?  The answer to those questions is ""Yes"". You do all of them.  The characters in this film are real people and what we see them go through is real.  And that is what makes this film as good as it is.  We feel that we are watching this happen to three people that we know because the film actually gives us time to understand these characters.  And that is good.  But what could have made the film a level above any horror film made before it is that we should of had more time at night when everything is happening and less time during the day when they are starting to lose their minds.  As I said, the way it is done is very good in it's execution, because we are watching realistic footage of how someone would be after five days of being lost in the wilderness with very little food, cold nights, and things going bump in the night.  But could you just for one second imagine how the film would of been if it concentrated more on things that go bump in the night than the psychological elements that it also gives us?  This would have been the personification of fear.  Having said that, make no mistake about it, this film is scary.  It is much more frightening than any film that has come out this decade.  And what makes it scary is the fear of not knowing.  No one knows what it is that they are hearing.  No one knows what it is that you see in that bundle of wood.  It's red and wet and looks like blood and enamel, but what exactly is it?  Not knowing what it is that is scaring these three people is terrifying.  I have been out of the theater for at least a half an hour now and my heart is still beating a little faster, it still hasn't recovered from all that this film put me through.  But as scary as it was, it could have had more night time stuff and less day time lead up to what happens at night.  The film established the fact that all the scary stuff happens when the sun sets, so why not give the audience what it came for?  And the only reason I am saying this is because it's not like the movie ran out of ideas, it's too smart for that, but it's just that they gave us ( the audience ) a chance to catch our breath.  And I like it when I can't breath from fear.  I like it when I feel as helpless and as frightened as the people in this movie.  And as much as I was, I wanted more.  I thirsted for more.To know all that this movie is, is to appreciate it.  The fact that they went out and concentrated on scaring us and not on seeing how many special effects they could fit into one scene is refreshing.  And it is wonderful. These guys know what the epitome of fear is.  They must be fans of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween.  It's just too bad that they couldn't keep us that scared for longer than they did.Blair Witch is a very scary film.  To say that it is a terrible film is to not understand the meaning of horror.  To say that you didn't enjoy the film is another story.  I admire this film for all that it is and all that it wanted to be and all that it came so close to being.  If only it didn't stray off course as little as it did, if only.....  Having said that, I really do like this film and it really did scare me.  You should see this, no matter what anyone says to you.  Give the guys a chance.  They had the courage and the talent to go out on a limb and make this happen, it should at least be rewarded for that.  And if you do want to see a scary film, you won't find one better in the last ten years.  And that is all that really matters. Because even though it could have been scarier, there is no film that I've seen in recent years that can hold a candle to it. 8.5/10",The Blair Witch Project
123,PatrynXX,"Excellently shot, but this isn't a horror movie. It's a comedy!!",6,21 November 1999,"That's right.  With a laugh at every turn.  Anyone who was scared by this movie hadn't watch a horror movie (opinion only... not basis for fact).  Now if you wanna be scared ____less, watch Evil Dead.  I watched that one all the way through once.  But every time I try to watch it..  I'm going no way..  But with Blair Witch the only possibly scary moment might have been the final 3 minutes.  Otherwise it was a nice trip in the woods.  We kinda got lost in the woods once.  When I was young say in 7 or 8th grade.  So this movie was a tad silly.  I did like how it was shot though, as well as the square movie box look.  6 out of 10..",The Blair Witch Project
124,PatrynXX,Second comment:,6,10 January 2000,"Wanted to add a little something as I was reading down on the comments.  1. Thumbs up to the guy who said it was a comedy.  Hey I agree with you. Though I thought the ending was a tad scary.  That 5 minutes is probably scarier than anything in The Haunting.  But I loved The Haunting far more because of that damn house.  But the biggest problem with THAT movie is it's labeled as a Horror movie.  Not as an adventure movie.  I'd say it almost seems the same creative team behind The Mummy, also did The Haunting. (not a known fact). and 2.  To the person who'll never be alone in the woods again. Hey you'll be missing alot.  I remember once when I was young (88-89 somewhere ) That there was this place (private land, but we had permission) not far from a church out in the country near Lewiston, MN, that was named Ruprects (spelling?) Valley.  We went into a cave , it being small, us guys went over a good pool, spiders and all, and we went way in there on our hands and knees.  Since the girls couldn't make it across that pool, they had to call us back. (I was 1 of only 3 people who bothered to make it all the way in) But anyway... I and 2 girls bothered to get lost in the woods. We though managed to find our way out of that.  Sure I we wound up go a hill at an 80% incline, but what the hell.  This is the reason I have to laugh at this most unrealistic movie.  It was shot very well (or should I say they were radical in doing so), but watching three people swear in the woods, isn't what I call scary as hell.....",The Blair Witch Project

Then they got lost in the woods and kept coming back to the same spot after hiking the whole day. They kept arguing over who's responsible for them getting lost and Mike is cobstantly having panic attacks. Then Mike went missing and something from the dark calling out with Mike's voice. They knew it wasn't him. They found a ruined house and went down in the basement and Mike was looking at the wall at the corner like the kids the witch killed. At the beginning I thought they were overacting but it became geniuinely scary even though the video and audio quality of the footage was very poor but perhaps it added to the genuine feeling of the atmosphere. And of course the most iconic scene was when Heather turned the camera to herself and made a confession about how naive she was and so on while crying hysterically which looked petrifying.

127,emasterslake,As if you really were watching a home made video,8,19 November 2006,"Blair Witch Project is a simple well made, thriller/horror flick.Back in 1994, 3 student filmmakers both make a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. They interviewed some locals who were superstitious and religious on the subject of the Blair Witch. They say that numerous victims were killed by the witch if you trespass in her woods. So the 3 independent filmmakers go to those woods which is in the middle of no where.They were enjoying their project during the first few days. But every night they hear the sounds of stones being tapped together. And it's as if it was coming from all directions. And the next morning they'd find something different near their camp site. They figure it was just a prank played by someone, but they didn't tell anyone on where they were going. And eventually they start to freak out and have suspicion that the curse of the Blair Witch is more than a legend.Unlike the gory, overrated, and badly written flicks you'd see now and days. Blair Witch Project is unique and very well thought up. The cool thing is it's all filmed on student camera and video camera. Contains no visual effects, at all. It's so realistic, it'll make you think it really did happen. I won't give away the ending but it is one of those mysterious movies.

128,mentalcritic,A celebration of Nazism that has been mislabelled a classic...,1,16 December 2000,"Frankly, if I wanted to see a film in which outright lies were told about Wiccans, I would turn on my television and watch a Pat Robertson speech. Or dig up one of the propaganda movies comissioned by the German government during the mid-1930s. When I went and saw this tripe at the flicks (at the behest of a friend who publishes a magazine), I was simply appalled at the sort of Nazi-esque garbage that Republican America considers acceptable. Indeed, during one of the asinine speeches given by Heather, another member of the audience jumped up and screamed ""sieg heil"" in disgust. This comment got more applause and positive reaction than the film ever did. Indeed, by the time this appalling film was over, one patron near me was heard to remark ""you've got to be [expletive deleted] joking!"". This was the most positive comment I have heard about the film from a flesh-and-blood human to date. Indeed, when Heather is bawling her little eyes out for the camera in one of the film's last shots, another patron was heard to yell ""don't tell us your problems, Nazi bitch"". I think that just sums this entire film up.Indeed, this film has inspired me. It has inspired me to commit to making a response of my own. One day I will make a film about a young woman in Europe during the Middle Ages who is kidnapped by Christian thugs and taken off to destinations unknown where she is repeatedly raped and tortured by ""men of the cloth"" before being burned alive, solely because she attracts the unwanted attention of a Nazi pig no different than those who made this film. Unlike this film, however, what I will be showing in my film project actually happened in Medieval Europe, Colonial America, and numerous other Christian blights on history - many times over. Indeed, the only reason why the makers of this film haven't been sued for slander is because the Christian menace still controls the political system of America.It's a sad state of affairs when slanderous propaganda like this gets financial backing and then hailed as a classic by pond scum who don't know any better.",The Blair Witch Project
129,mentalcritic,In case I didn't make it clear before...,1,30 May 2001,"...this is a Nazi propaganda film masquerading as independent cinema. A blue-eyed, white skinned girl tells you as clandestinely as she can that all Wiccans are murderers guilty of infanticide, and people hail this piece of trash as an independent miracle. Adolf Hitler was more vague about calling for the murder of all those beside the Anglo-Saxon white Protestant male. Maybe you feel comfortable endorsing a film where the death of all non-Christians is called for, but when a film like this gets a ringing endorsement in a country like America, I feel chills of fear going through my body.This is to say nothing of the fact that I could have made this film in my back yard for a dollar. Maybe people mistake the grinding, painful feeling associated with extreme boredom for suspense, but I am not fooled. Eighty minutes of waiting for some tangent of a plot that can be reported to a publisher does not equal suspense for me. It equals annoyance, boredom, and anger that such an absolute piece of trash can get such major recommendations. Here I am, struggling to make a career in writing, and the bozos who made this pile of garbage are on a gravy train from strapping a camera to the head of a dying seal. The only reason I haven't sued my previous editor for aggravated assault is because he warned me that this film was nothing but Nazi propaganda, and that he wanted me to report on this film so that a semblance of balance could be injected into the media.Honestly, I am not bashing this film because of tall-poppy syndrome or any other such phenonemon. I am bashing it because I value my life, my liberty, and my ability to pursue happiness, and the fact that so many people have something vaguely positive to say about this film makes me fear for all three of those things. Since this film hit the shelves, other pieces of normalist propaganda like Wonderland have hit the shelves, too. Has anyone who praises this film as a masterwork actually gone to a real Wiccan and asked their opinion of this film? I thought we all had it bad when pieces of garbage like The Craft hit the shelves. If you really value the religious freedom granted us by the First Amendment of the US Constitution that little, then by all means, keep praising this film as a miracle of independent cinema.All in all, I am giving this film a score of zero. It is not over my head, it is not something we misunderstand, it is a piece of Nazi propaganda masquerading as an independent production, pure and simple. Those of us who have understood the message in pro-liberterian cinema like the mini-series called V should all express disgust that this load of bollocks even got the green light, leave alone a sequel. Artisan should be hanging their heads in absolute shame. Bible-belt America has a lot to answer for.",The Blair Witch Project
130,ElijahCSkuggs,Revisiting after 8 years.,8,23 November 2007,"And it's still a good flick. I saw this as soon as it came out. It was opening day, before it went nation-wide. We drove to downtown Cambridge to watch it at the Kendall Square Cinema. This is before the hype went out of control and when people were seriously confused if it was real or not. To those people, to this day, I still shake my head.The Blair Witch Project is a movie that will go down in history as a classic. It's a time-less film that has aged very well. It's arguably one of the creepiest and most frightening movies of the past decade, and possibly all-time. It's a rare movie, that uses silence and barely any blood to get it's message across. I can't even remember the last movie to scare the masses in such a simple way.My biggest gripe with Blair Project was and still is the movie not showing even a hint of the Blair Witch. Watching the movie yesterday, I knew the ending so I was never really scared. But the movie still conjured up a few chills due to the dark woods and frantic situations. Just a glimpse would have made this movie so much more a hit. That is by far the biggest gripe about this movie. People feel cheated when things are happening, but nothing is really delivered. A glimpse at the end of feet floating across the camera on the ground, would have done wonders. But oh well.The Blair Witch Project is a wonder of sorts. Only costing pocket change but making millions. Having unknown producers and actors, but still having the movie come off as real footage. Sure there are people who hated this movie, but overall the Blair Witch Project is a feat in the film industry that can never be denied. It's a film all horror fans should see and most likely all will sometime or another.",The Blair Witch Project

Best of all, the feelings of horror and suspense are not produced through the usual set of Hollywood techniques -- expensive SFX, overimposing sound track, and the usual plot line of ""girl / couple get killed after / while having sex"".One word of warning though:  you MUST see this film on the big screen, it just will not work if you see it on video.  I guess that is the reason why a relatively high percentage of people gave this film 1 / 10 points.  And you have to be prepared for a cinematic experience apart from the Hollywood mainstream.

I do like to see people become successful at entertaining the public – and for that – I applaud the movie makers. They managed to shovel out stuff, people gobbled the stuff up and the movie creators laughed all the way to the bank. For that reason – they do get a well deserved three stars.

133,Stampsfightclub,A classic showing of real horror,9,14 April 2009,"3 filmmakers head into the woods to make a documentary about the Blair Witch, a legend that haunts the woods and murdered children.Made almost 10 years ago, Daniel Myrick's picture is an unbelievable revolution into the horror genre. It was one of the first films to shoot completely digitally and showed 3 unknown actors the most terrifying part of their life by entering woods and told to improvise all of their work and create a revolutionary film, and they succeeded. Getting lost in the woods and unable to find your way out may sound conventional in this genre but this is so different from your average flick. The Blair Witch Project feels real and therefore physiologically frightening. Shot with a shaky hand held camera and juxtaposed with all the method and improvised acting gives the film a highly soaked feeling of spontaneity, as if happening with you right there. You are sucked into the drastic turns of events as the trio encounter numerous difficulties and importantly for a horror film, this is open and appreciative of its target audience in regards to the legend, which will keep you hooked.The opening shot shows added text stating that the footage of 3 filmmakers was found a year after their disappearance in the woods and therefore we ultimately think it to be true. What follows is the edited footage of their events including the build up before the woods and the heart stopping discoveries and events once inside. Simply stunning combination of real life and a depiction of a legend that will have you questioning everything once the film reaches its stunning climax.At the time of my first watch I believed the story to be true and didn't even think to check the acting but looking back these are almost Oscar worthy. The feeling of hatred and undeniable concept of fear is there on every face. The rivalry and decisions reach high dramatic turns; none more so than Heather's close up confession to the camera.Like the Shining this has a lot to offer with stunning direction and realism in context and performances Jack Nicholson would be proud of. Whereas not as sharp as Kubrick's masterpiece, you will certainly not think about anything else for the rest of the evening.What perhaps is truly amazing that this was released the same year as The Matrix and American Beauty but this doesn't have star actors or special effects. It is not a mainstream hit but an almost indie classic that shows realism and terror in a new format",The Blair Witch Project

Yes, I say!This is one of the few horror films out in the world today that actually knows what works.  It taps into our primordial fears (getting lost, the dark, distant noises, inexplicable symbolism) and exploits them out the ying-yang.  It is to the film's advantage that it was shot on camcorders; the constantly moving lens gives the film an urgent, breathless feel that makes it seem as if, yes, this is all actually taking place as we see it.  Like we're there with these three crazy kids who go poking around where they shouldn't.I have only one quibble about this film.SPOILER - Even anyone with a minute cache of survival skills knows to follow a stream as it flows and it will lead to a river, pond, lake or whatever.  And there would be the most likely place you would find people, towns, cities, etc. So, why don't these green kids do that?  Yeah, I know: because then the movie would be over and they'd never find that house in the middle of the woods.  Just a small gripe in an otherwise fine horror flick.END OF SPOILEROkay, where was I?  Oh yeah; great film.  Earns every one of its scares and if any one film can trigger so much debate about whether it is real or not, you know these guys must have done something right.

It is in-fact very, very dull, I zoned out every five or so mins through total boredom. Toward the end it got a little interesting, then the end credits rolled, and that was that.

138,TOMASBBloodhound,Studio execs have to be pulling their hair out whenever this film is mentioned.,8,20 June 2005,"Film-making can be quite an interesting business. Some would insist on calling it an art, and they would also be correct. But make no mistake: Making movies is a business. When you think about the mountain of money this little indie project made as opposed to the paltry sub-fifty thousand dollar budget it had, you almost have to laugh. Then consider some of the big budget bombs we've seen recently like Kingdom of Heaven, Alexander, and XXX State of the Union that have been nothing more than an epic waste of money. You'll see why sometimes a little originality can lead to a big payday.The Blair Witch Project is essentially a bogus documentary about three young filmmakers who journey into the Maryland wilderness to investigate the legend of some gruesome goings-on. The group quickly finds themselves hopelessly lost, and at the mercy of god-knows what just past their line of vision in the surrounding foliage. The film is absolutely scary. You cannot deny that for one minute, but to think that anyone could have believed this is actual footage of three people meeting their demise is laughable. Apparently some people insist on believing it, though. You cannot deny the success of the technique. What we CANNOT see is often more scary than what is right in front of us in plain view.What we have here is a triumph not of special effects and great casting, but a triumph of ideas and atmosphere. Why is it that almost every mainstream film in the past couple years has been a sequel, a remake, or something based on a comic book? Is it any wonder why the box office numbers have been down for 17 straight weeks??? To all studio execs out there: The public is tired of watching crap! We need more inspiration and more originality!

What we have here is a very uniquely done classic horror film that I think we can safely place in the same ranks as ""Night of the Living Dead""(the original '68 classic).Just look at the similarities;Both were very cheaply done with a practically unknown cast.Most of the people I have spoken with about this movie either love it a lot,or hate it a lot,but one thing I look for in a good movie is uniqueness,and this movie definitely has it.

143,aesgaard41,Not Based On A True Story !,9,5 January 2001,"It was George Romero who set the standard for the stark realism in horror films, and this movie has also set more standards for creating a movie that has caused more tourists to settle upon the same sleepy little Maryland town than when Confederate troops stalked the same hills a hundred years ago. With a legend based loosely on Tennessee's Bell Witch and Rhode Island's Mercy Brown, this movie has a very simple if not slightly illogical premise: three college kids look for a ghost in the wilderness. I might have been the only one in my school to have taken such a feat and I'd bet even money that no one else would have joined me for the simple matter of having something better to do. While much of the movie's production baffles me, it does have more of a coming of age style that a horror flick; compare this with Rob Reiner's ""Stand By Me"" and you know what I mean. The movie doesn't really explain what happens to the three would-be film-makers, but such a point isn't important as long as the film hits it's mark and it sure did with me. when I saw the Sci-Fi's channel's documentary-style promo for the movie, I was already interested enough in the paranormal and freaked out enough to think this movie was true, but a lot of logical thinking and lateral research to look into the case set me straight. I don't understand the people condemning this movie who criticize it for not being scary. They just prove to me just how conditioned we are as a society to violence. Everyone I talk to just about agree what in the world does a chain-wielding serial killer in a hockey mask have to do with a haunted house! A true ghost story will always tap into the primal fears of terror in the human mind while the sensationalism of gore and violence always turns into little more than a pass the time schlock. To me, The Blair Witch Project starts out as a neat little ghost story that turns scary as you worry about the sanctity of these three campers who get lost while filming a documentary in the middle of no where. Yes, a pile of rocks is not very scary if you happen to be the one who put it there, but if you and two others are the only ones for miles and you keep coming across evidence that an unseen fourth person is leaving tell tale signs of their presence, then you may be a little unnerved. Again, it's the presence of what you don't know that scares you; not the presence of what you do know. What heightens the fear factory is the suggestion the movie originally intended by filming it as if it was a true story; the aspect that this movie was based on true incidents sure had me curious, but of course we all know now that that was the filmmaker's intent. The only things I find wrong with this movie are the slip-shod editing, the shaking cameras, the swearing and the endless droning on of some of the duologue, but in its execution, The Blair Witch Project really is one of the scariest films out there for serious horror fans and it will certainly go down as a milestone in true horror entertainment in the same way as Psycho and Night of The Living Dead !",The Blair Witch Project
144,itamarscomix,Mis-marketing in action,7,23 September 2011,"The Blair Witch Project is an interesting mockumentary with an intriguing concept, that was the victim of many bad decisions, in the process of making it and especially of promoting it. The ambition, it seems, was to create an experimental art-house film that would appeal to mainstream audiences, and by marketing it as a 'horror' movie, create surprise and buzz. The attempt to bridge the gap between the two viewer groups was quite positive, but what it actually achieved is alienating both: the horror crowd was disappointed and annoyed, especially younger viewers who sneaked into an R rated movie expecting gore and heads-on horror; and the more sophisticated, avant garde crowd, turned off from day one by the film's promotion, didn't even bother to go see it.A decade later, it's easier to put all that aside, as well as the internet-based hype generated by the producers at the time. The film can now be appraised as what it is, an exercise in experimental filmmaking, and an interesting one at that. It takes a lesson from the true great classics of horror - in that the fear of the unknown, the anxiety and anticipation of violence are much more effective than explicit violence in itself - and indeed, it's scarier than almost any horror movie created in the last twenty years, although the teenagers who usually go for that kind of movie will probably disagree. The Blair Witch Project creates tension and anxiety, and draws the viewer into the characters' world. And it doesn't matter one bit whether or not you think it might be real - in fact it's more impressive when you know that it's not.Unfortunately, it doesn't achieve true greatness in that respect either. In its attempt to bridge between mainstream horror and experimental indie movie-making, the film reaches a sort of middle ground that isn't quite here nor there, not quite satisfying anybody. The Blair Witch Project is not a classic or a great film, nor will it ever be, but it should be watched by fans of independent and experimental cinema and of classic horror, and remembered as a brave and innovative experiment that didn't quite make it.",The Blair Witch Project
145,mermatt,Interesting study in the psychology of fear,8,2 August 1999,"As a horror film, this is disappointing -- perhaps intentionally so to keep the audience talking about it after it is over. But as a study in the psychology of fear and self-fulfilling prophecy, the film works well. The moviemakers use fear of the unknown, fear of the dark, fear of the night, fear of unseen forces, fear of getting lost in the woods -- all very effectively.While this is not in the same league as THE EXORCIST to which it has been sometimes compared in the PR hype, it is nevertheless a good example of the old rule of horror -- less is more. The people who remade THE HAUNTING could have taken a lesson from these people instead of relying mainly on FX for the atmosphere.I think the unresolved ending is intentional to keep the word-of-mouth going. The Sci-Fi channel show ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" gives more information than the movie and is actually better than the movie. I think what we have here is the beginning of a legend. The Blair Witch myth is concocted solely for the film, but now the myth will begin to grow. Clever gimmick for a small-budget film!",The Blair Witch Project
146,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Not just a good horror film...,8,7 January 2006,"One summer in 1994 three student went on a trip to the Maryland woods to do a documentary about a local witch legend. After interviewing some people in the nearby town they head off into the woods and soon realize they got more than what they bargained for.The film is shown completely through the character's cameras and you really get the feeling you are watching a documentary. The grainy images and shaky camera really make it seem like this is some amateur student project. Obviously the whole thing was made on a low budget, but hardly ever has a production so effectively exploited its own limitations to deliver a film. The first-person perspective puts you right out into the woods and you are essentially perceiving the horror unfold through a victim's eyes and ears. This is often annoying, as by the time the film is through you'll be craving for some answers to all the spooky goings on, but the cleverness of this film cannot be denied.Also clever was the ad campaign for this film which made it seem like this was a real documentary or at least a recreation of real events. Many believed it for a time, I know, because I was one of those people. By the time I view the film I knew it was all a fake. A hoax as some would call it, but I believe that ""hoax"" is the wrong word here: ""phenomenon"" is much more suitable. More suitable, because that is what this production created, not just a horror film, but utter Blair Witch craze; from books on the ""legend"" to video games and even a modest budget sequel. I think many people felt cheated when they found out that the Blair Witch was all orchestrated and I did too, but I think it should be viewed as part of the fun and not some let down. Once again, there cleverness of this film is virtually undeniable.Years back there were some infamous Italian horror films like the terrifying ""Cannibal Holocaust"" which also made use of the documentary look and orchestrated hype about ""this really happened."" Though Cannibal Holocaust was more convincing (the production team was arrested and had to prove in court that horrifying film was just a movie), this is still a very worthy addition the horror genre.

The movie is filmed with hand-held cameras operated by three film students purported to have disappeared in the Maryland woods with only this footage to surface sometime later. Even though their fates are sealed viewers may fear the plight of the two young men and a woman who become lost rather fast and then are slowly driven insane by a stalking presence that visits them in the night and leaves horrifying gifts outside their tent.Heather Donahue plays herself as the lead documentarian. She convinces Josh Leonard and Michael C. Wiliams to venture out into the woods after interviewing the locals and hearing all sorts of terrifying stories. Heather insists for some time that they are not lost though both Michael and Josh know they are. On the second night out in the woods all sorts of terrible sounds can be heard but the team can't capture any of it on film.The horrors grow and the rough shaky angles of the camera only add to the confusion and terror. The dread increases to dramatic as the characters all grow more frustrated and turn on each other. Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez know how to draw out the dread and only give viewers a glimpse of the strange occurrences, but a glimpse is all that is needed to generate the fear to make this movie a smashing success.

The entire film is shot on a home video camcorder that is to document the final days of a three-person documentary film crew, going into the Black Hills Forest of Maryland to make a movie about the legendary Blair Witch. The creators of this film were very smart. They thought their plan out very well. Although many residents of the town itself were very angry with this, I find that it is great that they could create such a phenomenon with such a simple project idea. But that might be just because I myself don't actually live in Burkittsville (but that is what I said for my location anyhow). I am happy that Marilyn Manson and Korn finally did a song about the Blair Witch. Maybe it will be in the third film. The end credits even made it look like this was real.

It's going to be a load of fun out there in the forest...or so they thought.According to the prologue the film we see has been put together from film footage found in their discarded cameras.Admittedly the end product is a documentary with an original approach, but it does not prove or disprove anything.  The jerky camera work does provide clues that something is going on...voices in the night...little heaps of stones appearing outside the tent which were not there the night before (or were they?)... rocks in a strange nest of twigs perched in a tree...strange mobiles fashioned out of tree branches swinging in the breeze...and is somebody watching them as they wander further in to the forest? A witch....maybe?The scary atmosphere builds up after they lose their map and they decide to go south using only the compass. Cold, hungry...they seem to be going in circles...then Josh disappears into the blackness of the night!The film is more about human relationships as in their desperation they squabble amongst themselves.  Tension builds.  They are all at screaming point.  They are truly lost!The whole film plays on the imagination of the viewer.  If you are nervous and imaginative you are ready to accept the various perils that beset them. But all the dangers are suggested.  We don't see any witch.  There are no visible intruders.  It's all in the mind.When the writers ran out of ideas, they have Mike and Heather finding and exploring a broken down cottage. In a fit of hysteria their cameras are dropped and continue running until the batteries cut out.  This brings the film to a sudden and abrupt ending.But was there really a witch out there?  That, dear viewer, is for you to decide!",The Blair Witch Project
154,Hayden-86055,Intriguing and different,6,5 June 2020,"The Blair Witch Project is a very interesting film, and I've always struggled with how to rate this one. Technically the acting is bad and camera work is shoddy, but there's just something about it that makes it difficult to stop watching.Obviously it kicked off the now massive found-footage genre, and genuinely this is probably one of the better ones, the plot is fairly good and mysterious; and the location being set in a woods is spooky and fantastic. The surroundings and camera work make you feel as if you're actually there, experiencing every twig snap and the wind smack your face as you trudge on.So why do I rate it only 6/10? Because, unfortunately, it is very boring!! Especially on a second viewing, the ""Witch"" never even bothers to show her face, and the scares are mostly left up to our imagination (not necessarily a bad thing), actually at times I see this film as art, other times I don't.6/10: Despite the relatively average rating of a 6, (due to bad acting and boredom), this is something you really need to watch and experience. So I 100% recommend giving it a try, you may love it or hate it, but it sure is an experience nonetheless!",The Blair Witch Project
155,tomimt,Home video horror,3,11 April 2005,"Concept for ""Blair Witch Project"" sounded very interesting, when I first heard about it: a ""documentary"" about kids lost in woods, chased by a scary scary witch. There was lots of talk about this being actual thing that had really happened. Yeah. Right. But funny thing was, that some people really did buy that.So, concept was in order and I even saw this in a theatre with a friend. It wasn't half as good as it was claimed to be. Acting was poor, writing was even worse and direction was non existing. It all was just stuff, that anyone, and I really mean anyone could film with their own home video cameras, as it actually was done with this. The basic difference here is, that someone succeeded in marketing this outside ""Americas Funniest Home Videos"".So in summary, silly kids running around in ""woods"" while the scariness factor of the flick runs somewhere between ""Sesame Street"" and ""Winnie the Pooh""",The Blair Witch Project
156,eibon09,Over-rated and Amateurish,3,28 February 2000,"The Blair Witch Project was the worst movie and most hyped up film of 1999. The concept was original, but unfortunately the execution of this concept was badly done.  One reason why I thought BWP was bad is that It seem as the movie was made for fun and that they weren't planning to be filmmakers at all.  This change as soon as the film made money and this gave them the idea to direct again.  The success of this movie reminds me of Mel Brooks's The Producers where a play(Spring Time For Hitler)became a surpise success. Another reason this wasn't good is the lack of artistic vision(that is it seems like there wasn't anything put into this film at all by the directors.
The shack at the end of the movie reminded me of the Freudstein House in The House by the Cemetery(maybe the three college kids were killed not by The Blair Witch but by Dr. Freudstein).  The Blair Witch Project is not as scary as many people would lead others to believe, and it does not contain anything that is scary(rocks found in piles, Twigs formed in shapes, people arguing, and footage of people losing their mind is not my idea of a scary movie).  The actors in the film behave as escapees from an Insane Asylum.  I found that this movie is not as enjoyable as the supernatural thrillers of Mario Bava{The Mask of Satan(1960), Kill, Baby, Kill(1967), and The Whip and The Body(1966)], the surreal films of Dario Argento{Suspiria(1977), and Inferno(1980)], and the gothic/zombie epics of Lucio Fulci{Zombie(1979), The Gates of Hell(1980), The Beyond(1981), and The House by the Cemetery(1981)]. I prefer the cinema of Italian horror to The Blair Witch Project as they are filled with spectacular gore, great camera movement, interesting music, terrific atmosphere, and lots of pizzazz(Things that BWP completely lacks). What annoys me is that people have already start to compare the film-makers to Alfred Hitchcock which is silly as HE IS THE MASTER while they are the students.",The Blair Witch Project
157,virek213,Horror And/Or Hype?,6,13 May 2003,"THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is one of those films that made history by shooting to the top of the box office while being made on a very paltry budget of just $40,000.  It also benefitted from all the hype surrounding its story of a group of teens who venture into the desolate Maryland woods to find out if the legend of the Blair Witch is fact or fiction.  As a result, this film went on to gross $130 million during the late summer of 1999.But while the premise of the story and the inventive ""Shaky-Cam"" work of the filmmakers suggest a very chilling and suspenseful film, I am only able to give this film a '6' rating out of 10.The reason?  Even for $40,000, you think it would be easier for filmmakers Eduardo Myrick and Daniel Sanchez to come up with a better use of dialogue than you'd get in an average teen-slasher pic.  The pacing of the film is unquestionably inventive, and the atmosphere, the further the teens venture into the woods, begins to resemble John Boorman's 1972 classic DELIVERANCE. The stick figures used as the signs of the Blair Witch's presence (the witch herself, in a thoroughly brilliant move, is never, ever seen) are also good; and the lack of explicit gore is quite refreshing.  But the dialogue is so profanity-ridden that it gets tired after a while.  It is worse than any of the screaming done by the film's lead heroine (Heather Donahue) or her ""I'm-so-scared""-by flashlight scene.Unlike a lot of people, I wouldn't call THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT an overhyped low-budget disaster; in terms of premise, it more than lives up to the hype. Even the acting of this amateur group is worth sitting through.  But unlike others, because of the dialogue (the one and ONLY reason this film has its 'R' rating at all), I can't quite call it a masterpiece.  Still, it is a worthy film, if frustratingly uneven.",The Blair Witch Project

159,alice liddell,A modern masterpiece: Blair's brilliance as much about filmmaking as terror. (possible spoilers),9,27 October 1999,"True story 1: When I was ten, I had a huge row with my mother, and hid out by dark in the local ramparts for six hours.  I was so traumatised, I didn't go out again for nearly a year.  True story 2: a couple of years later, out in the woods with some friends, we were shot at by the farmer on whose land we were trespassing.  They may have been fake bullets, but we didn't know that then.  True story 3: last June I was diagnosed for a cancerous tumour. It was treated successfully, but I was convinced I was going to die, and I'm only in my early twenties.  True story 4: Two days before I saw THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, I took my dogs out for a walk at midnight. I normally go with my wife, but she was tired.  I don't know the area at all, and after a few minutes I was lost.  It was foggy, with unlocatable voices everywhere, and I kept returning, with increasing panic, to the same place.  This lasted about an hour, the longest of my life.  No wonder BLAIR scared the living bejasus out of me.Why, you may ask, is a total stranger telling me all this?  Well, I've been trying to work out why a film everybody else considered boring or disappointing, truly, deeply terrified me into a dripping cold sweat, gauntly pale face, shaking, wrenching my fingernails.  A film about uncovering the past has made me reappraise my own.  Every day when I was in college, today in the streets, posters for Missing Persons, some missing for over six years.  A young neighbour of mine a couple of years ago went on holiday with some friends and mysteriously drowned.  I remember as a baby my dad would pretend to throw me off the ferry.  Richie Edwards.  I had never really given any of these events much thought.  I can't stop now.I wrote the above last night about 20 minutes after seeing the film.  I'm a lot less hysterical now.  Like Heather, I will take relative comfort in hiding behind the camera.  Because the film is as much an investigation into filmmaking as it is an exercise in terror.  It reveals the terrible fears behind the 'home' in home movie.  It uses modern critical theorisation undermining the 'objectivity' and 'realism' of documentaries, by showing subjectivity pouring into its form with a vengeance.BLAIR is obsessed with the nature of filmmaking.  Barely a scene goes by without some reference to the camera.  Some of this is rather obvious - e.g. the shots of the cameraperson in the mirror, or other camerapersons - but much of it is brilliant.  In films, even in fiction, we are used to the camera being our detached guide to everything we see - watching it fail so badly, so rigorously, helplessly under attack is terrifying, which is why I think the film affects film buffs more than others - BLAIR is nothing less than an attack on the presumptions of the medium.  The camera is as much a source of the fear as the unknown, as light reflected off the lens creates eerie, ghostly images.Even what seemed to be flaws add to the terror.  The continued attention drawn to the camera seemed contrived, but we needed it on for the film to continue.  Through the camera we become sadistically party to the threesome's pains - we dread them turning it off.  We are the watchers as much as whatever's out there.  The perfect editing beggared belief, until you begin to ask who actually edited this?  When Mike falls near the end, and Heather can be heard screaming in the distance, the camera moves again, and it's not Heather.  Who is it?  Mike said the witch models were too creative for rednecks.  Isn't the implication horrifying?  The well-documented manner of the film's creation actually increases the terror - the confusion over fixed authoriality mirrors the characters' bewilderment at who is the author in the film of the horrors.As in most horror films, there seems to be a fundamental misogyny at play. As Heather herself notes, the Blair Witch project was her project.  She is the Blair Witch.  She takes two ordinary middle class guys out of their American homes, and subjects them to the most ghastly horrors.  She controls every aspect of what they do>.  Another reason for the panic, though, is the complete absence of sex.  Only Josh refers to a partner, and he's the first to disappear. These are characters lost in the woods - that ancient metaphor for sexuality, especially female - and the subject never comes up.  Yeah right.  The camera never lies.But, most importantly, this is a basically terrifying film.  Three people, around my, and most of the audience's age, lost, without bearings, the reassuring signifiers of modern life, in a wilderness with threats both supernatural and primitive.  It's not quite as mysterious as PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK - we do know there's something out there - but for a $150m+ film to deny explanations or closure is remarkable.  The scene where Josh and Heather are suddenly awake, running after something in the distance, is probably the scariest thing I've ever seen in a movie, although the ending comes close.  The film begins with the characters leaving home and ends with them finding one.  Having been reduced to the most basic drives of humanity, parentless, lost, the pair rediscover childhood, in the form of bloody handprints.  I don't even want to think about that one right now.  Grrrgh. You probably won't want to see this movie - it's a different kind of scary.",The Blair Witch Project
160,redkiwi,What's the big deal?,6,8 November 1999,"Considering how much everyone has been going on about Blair Witch, I really did think that it was decidedly ho hum and average.A friend of mine actually had to leave the cinema through nausea at the movement of the cameras, but I sat through it until the end, despite its lack of any real conclusion.The actors were good and fairly believable, but this certainly did not live up to hype as anything particularly special to me.",The Blair Witch Project
161,sashank_kini-1,"Such Experimentation, Such Capable Acting and Fine Editing, I'm Simply Baffled at the Hate for Blair Witch Project",9,24 August 2012,"The most striking thing about The Blair Witch Project is that the ending strikes you two seconds later, when the end credits begin. For a moment, your mind reels back to the preceding events and you realize how terrific and terrifying the moment is. Paranormal Activity, released much later may have more jump scenes, but nothing in the movie, not even the spooky as hell climax is as intense as Blair Witch's last fifteen or so seconds. If you think I am going to say 'The ending is great but the rest isn't', you are incorrect. Comments such as 'The worst movie ever', 'I hated this film', 'Indie crap' are written as usual without much justification, and that some call the characters 'absolutely unlikeable' is a thing I find utterly baffling.Three newcomers – one a Shakespearean actress (Heather Donahue), another an experienced independent director (Joshua Leonard) and the other a theater actor (Michael C. Williams) not just act but also film most of their scenes in an isolated forest area using a 16mm and handicam and not just that, the actors were not aware of what was to happen in the woods since the directors didn't tell them what would happen next in their scenes. In the director's commentary, one realizes how spontaneously the three amigos (not exactly 'amigos', just using it because it sounds sweet, sad and ironic) improvised their scenes in order to extract realistic performances. Donahue, who won the Razzie Award for Worst Actress for an act that should've clinched her a Golden Globe nomination, is believed to have modeled her character on a director with whom she had worked with. With such experimentation, such capable acting and such fine editing, I am simply astonished that the word 'worst' is attributed to The Blair Witch Project. 'Unlikable characters'? So if the characters were unlikable, then the reviewers should've loved the film since they 'got what they deserved' according to them – similar to the unlikable characters of Final Destination series. What is get from reading their reviews is plain contradiction – I think the moment they realized it was a shaky camera, they judged every other element superficially. The plot is simple: Three student filmmakers begin making a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch, and this leads them to the forest where the witch is believed to have existed. Things turn sour when they find stuff in the forest they aren't supposed to, which is ironic since these stuffs would've made their documentary even more credible. They realize that the Blair Witch is simply not a myth of the ignoramus past, and that this force would always work in a similar fashion: haunt at night, leave an after effect in the morning. They also have to maintain their sanity even when tensions and tempers are high. Shaky camera is probably the best aspect of Blair Witch Project. How close we are to the action, how much we anticipate like the actors about what's to happen, how much we are involved in the film because of this wonderful camera technique; it is something only a person who is ready to adjust to any film would understand. Remember Meryl Streep's line at the Oscars: 'When they called my name I had this feeling I could hear half of America going, ""oh, no!""', the same thing may apply to certain audience members when they sensed the shaky camera 'When they saw shaky camera, half of the audience members went 'Oh no!'. You have to look beyond that.The camera work is crisp, highly engaging and very ingenious, even though the actors themselves didn't realize some of the best shot scenes by them were accidental. I never imagined Donahue's last message to her parents was an accidental stroke of greatness till I saw the director's commentary: Heather had thought the camera was recording her entire face while she shot the sequence. Also the interesting shot of Michael in one the bottom left corner of the screen while the rest of the frame is taken up by the tall, foreboding trees was accidental. Even the perfectly coordinated shot of Michael walking away at a distance while Donahue is talking to Joshua in front. Everything is raw, raging and unconventional.Interviews with local townspeople are also very engaging, since some of the members were non-actors: Advice – don't miss the director's commentary if you have the DVD; you may find new love for the movie. Another advice: do not sleep during those things, considering them on trivial importance. Coming to the three main stars, Donahue is certainly the best, channeling so many emotions in the course of the film effortlessly. The scenes where she breaks down are absolutely powerful. Great support from the two guys, and again, you'll get to see 'Michael's Great Moment No 1,2' in the director's commentary. The DVD version does go for an overkill with the made for TV feature that seems silly and excessive – it reminded me of a silly animated movie we had made for a competition where we included dozens of additional attractions, including fake reviews for the film within the film. Verdict: Recommended. (8.5 / 10)",The Blair Witch Project
162,Bogmeister,"Here we go, a walkin' in the woods",6,22 July 2005,"By now, everyone and their grandma has heard about this super-cheap project that ended up making millions upon millions in the summer of '99. Now it's out on video and that's where it really belongs: it was mostly shot on HI8 Video, with some 16mm film. Watching it, especially the beginning (before the 3 characters go into the woods), I am reminded of similar video footage I took on a couple of past road trips; you know what I mean? - stuff taken from a moving car; people walkin' around not really doing anything. The difference is, of course, I didn't make $140+ million off of my stuff. Silly me. As a film, it's a mixed bag. The 1st 20 or so minutes, as I mentioned, are nothing more than a boring home movie. But then, the tension starts to mount - and I'm not really sure why: is it the jerky hand-held camera movement? The 'real world' sound effects? After all, one is supposedly watching real stuff, not a make-believe reel movie. That was the whole hook of the project - the thing that drew so many people to it (I believe the technique is called 'cinema verite' - a French term for realism). And, true to form, the film doesn't really 'end' - it just stops. There are no spelled-out answers in the end, forcing audiences to make their own conclusions (I did). But, also in the end, I don't think this will take its place among classics such as Night of the Living Dead[68] or even The Evil Dead[81], because the thing's a triumph of marketing, not cult horror. It's clever, it's creepy, it's unique. But it's a manipulation designed to draw grosses, not gross out people in a new exciting way (the R rating is for foul language). OK, I bought the DVD.",The Blair Witch Project

She said that afterwards, they were so scared nobody wanted to go out for gas. Well, the movie wasn't that scary.Something that I liked is that they didn't need Conrad Baker or anyone to do the camera work, the three principal actors (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael Williams) did almost all of it themselves. Heather, Josh, and Michael (the actors's names are the same in the movie) team up for a documentary about a ""blair witch"", who supposadely haunts the woods in Burkettsville, Maryland. After intervewing townspeople, they get off to the woods.It seems that what TBWP is more about is the three amateur directors and their relationships towards each other. They have ""cabin fever"", so to speak, from being around each other for so long. But, they do find mysterious things outside of their tent after each morning- piles of rocks, for instance. They hear things that go bump in the night and try chase whatever's making the noise.Soon, the map is lost, in an obvious turn of events. They walk for 15 hours to end up in the same location. There was fear all throughout the movie; mild amount during the day (especially when they see the famous symbols), and moderate during the night. I was truly creeped at the end. I did see this before, on FX, and I was scared at the end. Although the ending is obvious, I do like that style of ending.If you're looking for a horor film where bloody ghosts pop out and cut your head off, take another one. Nothing is seen here; a couple times, the screen is completly blank except for a couple camera lines at the bottom. The editing was very poor, but I guess they're excuse for that is because it's a ""home movie"". The actors were OK, but I understand why they haven't done anything else.

I thought to myself this must be some kind of experiment. Being a huge movie buff, I had heard everyone on the net and in magazines talk about how scary this film was for them. So I went to see The Blair Witch Project last night and I was right about the experiment part, this film is an experiment in total fear. The film is shot on what looks like mostly video and is very low budget. I believe however that you will be scared.

170,SquigglyCrunch,An Atmospheric Horror Driven by Great Acting and Subtle Terror,8,9 February 2017,"The Blair Witch Project follows a group of students who embark on a trip through the woods to make a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch, and the horrors which ensue when they decide to do this. For starters, the acting is all pretty fantastic. All three main actors are great, and in a role like this where they spend most of it beaten down and losing themselves, it really is impressive. Each one of surprisingly genuine, and it's clear that each actor was passionate about this project.The characters they play are fleshed out and realistic. They talk like real people right from the get-go, and it makes it so much easier to relate to and get behind these characters as real students. Throughout the movie the characters are pushed, and they react in ways you'd expect most of the time. There is one scene where the movie creates unnecessary conflict for itself, where a certain fact would've been better left untold. Otherwise, the writing and characters are very well done. There are several scenes where the camera is pointed right at the ground and we as the audience can do nothing but sit and listen to the characters. Being a found-footage film, this works very well. First of all, the characters aren't always going to be pointing their camera at whatever they are looking at. It just doesn't make sense, especially in this situation. It also adds a lot to the atmosphere, where we as the audience often live in silent, unknowing terror. We can't see anything, but we can hear the characters talking. While they don't really see much either, it still leaves a lot to the imagination with the limitation of the camera lens. In fact, the movie shows very little even when the characters are pointing the camera where they're looking, and again it creates great atmosphere. You never know what's going to happen next, and in the end you just kind of have to figure it out yourself. It becomes more terrifying without the full knowledge of what exactly is going on, and that is where this movie particularly excels. Supposedly there was a scene where the camera was supposed to turn and see the Blair Witch standing on a hill, but whoever had the camera at the time didn't do that and it was kept in the final cut, which is in a way more terrifying. We don't know what they saw, and in that way it also leaves more up to the imagination and more to interpret. Overall The Blair Witch Project is pretty terrifying, and yet it's well-acted, well-written, and just overall well made. I can count about one part where I really didn't like it, but it still makes some sense at least. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",The Blair Witch Project
171,elicopperman,It Holds Up Just Enough,6,10 June 2019,"Ever since its release 20 years ago, The Blair Witch Project has made history as a cultural horror phenomenon, mainly for how it utilized the found footage genre without showing much of what the real horror is. While it did divide audiences back in the day, the intrigue of the film lies a lot more in what we hear rather than what is actually causing hysteria. It's a testament to how divisive the film is when even though what was videotaped did actually happen in real life, just the thought of what lies out in the middle of nowhere is enough to make one feel at ease.Now understandably, the film has a very simplistic plot, in which three young filmmakers named Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard seek out the local legend called the Blair Witch infamously located at the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland in 1994, but they all disappear and the film plays out as a feature length collection of raw footage based on what they experienced. Admittedly, the film doesn't have a great start, as the leads come off as more annoying and obnoxious than likable and charming, and not much happens besides them goofing off for the first twenty minutes. However, as the film progresses, strange oddities start to occur and slowly heighten the stakes with every passing day. The very idea of being lost in the deep woods can really affect someone mentally, so even without the supernatural aspects, the movie works well in playing with the viewer's expectations with suspenseful tension.One major problem with most found footage movies is that the creatures feared by the cast are either always seen or are in a typical environment we're all familiar with. The better way to create paranoia within your horror narrative is by placing your characters somewhere they've never been before. Also, the decision to have many of the night scenes be pitch black and out of focus really helps the soundtrack, as all the crazy sounds coming from the area feel all the more terrifying without knowing where they are coming from. What people hear is more reactionary than what they see, and the filmmakers react so well to what they hear that the audience could be in their shoes as well. Even then, as the film goes on, Heather, Mike and Josh become much more relatable with their ever-growing impatience and frustrations with the whole legend itself, whether it's fake or not, and even towards each other with anger and fear. The more away from civilization you are, the less human you become.So while it may be slow paced and the idea of not seeing the real terror can be a turnoff to some viewers, I definitely think The Blair Witch Project stands well on its own after its original release. Regardless if this whole movie is complete fiction, crafting a whole narrative around the supernatural in a place as unknown as a forest at night can work if you center it around the idea of implication rather than flat out showing the creature. All you need is a shoestring budget, a cast of people you know personally as opposed to famous celebrities, and an environment you're familiar with enough to let your small camera create practically everything. In spite of the found footage genre being somewhat of a joke nowadays, there is nothing stopping you from taking on the challenge of forming a film around raw recorded material.",The Blair Witch Project

The Blair Witch Project, on the other hand, is one of the best found footage films I've seen.The Blair Witch Project tells the story of three teenagers who disappear in the woods whilst making a documentary on the urban legend known as the Blair Witch.I really wish I saw this film when it came out. It was such a huge deal in 1999 and so many people believed everything that happened in the film was real and I can see why. Unlike a lot of modern found footage flicks, The Blair Witch Project stand out to me by how much thought and care went into its presentation to make it seem as authentic as possible. The low quality footage from the camera, casting non actors and the overall low budget of the film made it incredibly convincing that these three teens actually went missing. The three actors in the movie were fantastic especially considering this was their first film. Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard were very believable in their roles and most of their conversations being improvised helped sell the fact what I was watching was real.A major complaint about this film was how it wasn't scary at all or nothing really happened which I totally understand but personally, I felt this growing tension building as the film went on. I loved the way everything started to slowly spiral and the actors got more and more agitated with one another. Despite nothing much happening, all the strange stuff that does happen kept me feeling tense and worried for the characters and, with every night, things got progressively creepier which led to an unsettling climax that genuinely freaked me out due to the brilliant camerawork and performances.I have to give praise to Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez. They came up with such a simple idea that required a really low budget and managed to inspire and popularise the found footage genre. Each element was carefully thought out to make it seem as real as possible and, in my eyes, I believe they succeeded.",The Blair Witch Project

Most of the times we followed three lost students that put the fault to be lost to each other and it can be frustrating, annoying and stupid. But it can be more believable like this, like it was reality because the director when released the movie tell that the movie was a real footage of three student lost in the woods.

175,Rickting,Important but over-hyped,5,14 January 2014,"The Blair Witch Project is considered to be a landmark in horror history and terrified everyone back in 1999. Why exactly? This is the first found footage horror film (The first to exclusively use the format) and 3 annoying teenagers go into the woods to film a documentary, get lost and are hunted by the Blair Witch. That's all there is to it. I'm sick and tired of found footage as it's just a way to make money without actually scaring anyone. Troll Hunter, Cloverfield or the excellent Chronicle are all smart examples which use the format well, and this shows in other genres found footage can work. I still can't stand those stupid Paranormal Activity films though. However, at the time, this movie would have been very scary and boosted by a good marketing campaign. It's still scary today. For about 5 minutes. More an experiment than a movie, this is a very interesting film but it's became cool to hate for good reason. It's not a bad film like some say, but it's certainly not a great movie.The film has many assets. The finale at the house is very suspenseful, the way the film never shows the witch is very good as well and what people often forget is the acting is actually good (Heather Whatshername didn't deserve that Razzie) and the film creates a sense of unease and fear. But that doesn't mean it's scary. It's unnerving, patient and unique but it's about as scary as a walk in the park most of the time. Overly minimalistic, underwhelming, full of stupid decisions and deeply, deeply boring, this is one film you should never watch more than once even if you liked it the first time. There are only so many times one can stare at trees, tents being shaken and listen to weird noises before they just start to get annoyed. It's not a bad movie, just a remarkably average one hyped to absurd levels. It had a big impact at the time, but having seen many other superior horror films TBWP feels woefully unscary.5/10",The Blair Witch Project

When they suddenly find themselves lost, they end-up becoming part of the legend themselves!Clever film is played out as a 'real' occurrence from beginning to end and frankly many viewers at the time thought it was indeed real footage shot by real missing students! Of course, it isn't, but it still went down as a landmark film of the decade. Although many people have mixed feelings about this movie, it's a unique film that pays off chillingly well for horror fans.This movie is all about mystery, atmosphere, and the unknown - all of which are themes that pay off well as the increasingly dark story unfolds. There's plenty of memorable moments to be had (the scene that pays homage to The Devil and Tom Walker is especially horrific) and it all builds to an intense climax that is truly eerie. The young stars (Donahue, Leonard, and Williams) are likable and sympathetic characters, even as their desperation drives them to anger and fear. The setting of the autumn wilderness is effectively unsettling, the old house used for the finale being particularly creepy. While some people laugh it off, which is a shame, this fan enjoys this film for it's sheer simplistic brilliance. After all it's not only one of the biggest independent films ever but quite possibly the smartest horror film of the 90's. A solid winner that deserves more respect. **** out of ****",The Blair Witch Project

It has no plot, no ending, no story. It is the 90 minute rambling of some dunderhead carrying around a hand held camera filming everything he sees. This movie was made by loading some film, getting some nobodies together, going to the woods and shooting enough film to make up 90 minutes. No film was left on the cutting room floor. Every worthless scrap was included. The ineptitude and total lack of film-making skills is astounding. I used to think Robot Monster was the pits; BWP is worse.Here is what happens in the ""film"". Three dimwits find a tape made by three nitwits who supposedly uncovered the Blair witch and were never seen again. The three dimwits head into the forest to investigate. Along the way they hear weird noises at night, find some sticks hanging from trees, get lost in the forest, start to cry because they are so scared. In the end one of the dimwits wanders into an abandoned shack and the last scene shows him trying to look scared into the camera. THE END. That's all folks. I'm not kidding. That's the movie.In these times when anyone has access to equipment to make a movie, BWP proves the theory that any talent less person can make a ""film."" BWP was the biggest movie marketing SCAM in history. It proves P.T. Barnum's ""There's a sucker born every minute."" By using the internet to lie and hype the film, the cynical lug heads who made this suckered people in. As they say in the used car business, ""For every seat, there's an ass."" I was one of the asses who got suckered. Using the same ""based on a true story"" technique as The Amityville Horror, BWP lured well-intentioned moviegoers into the theater. If BWP were a car then it would be subject to a ""lemon law"" and you could get your money back. Unfortunately, the movie business doesn't work that way. Those of us who lost our $$ on this scam have no recourse. The only recourse I have is to slam this piece of trash in this review, which I hope I have done. Why I detest BWP so much is because it was such a shameless scam that showed utter contempt for movie goers.

181,nickenchuggets,"""I'm afraid to close my eyes""",8,11 October 2021,"It's often been said (especially by me) that the creepiest horror movies are the ones which depict realistic scenarios, and this is certainly the case with this one. This movie is so tense and panic-inducing it's a little nauseating. What Blair Witch does exceptionally well is introduce a new (at the time) style of film making to mainstream audiences. The entire movie consists of camera footage taken by a group of three friends named Heather, Josh and Mike during October 1994. It gives the movie a kind of documentary feel and makes it appear less polished than other films, almost like a home movie. This makes it more relatable, and thus more disturbing. As mentioned earlier, the movie is about 3 friends who are venturing to an allegedly haunted forested area in Maryland in order to determine whether or not a local legend called the ""Blair Witch"" is real. On the way there, a man fishing in a creek tells them about a serial killer who lives out in the woods who would abduct people and kill them in his house in the 1940s. While doing this, he would kill two at a time and have one stand upright in a corner while the other was murdered. The people making the documentary don't really think much of this theory and dismiss it as a tall tale, after which they enter the woods. At first, things are slow moving and uneventful, but upon waking up the day after, they find man made piles of rocks stacked around their campsite. More creepy incidents at night occur, and there appear to be strange noises coming from outside the tent, one of which sounds like a small infant. Soon, the group's map is missing, meaning they have no surefire way to exit the woods or even tell where they are. Mike, obviously starting to lose his mind from being stuck in this nightmare of a situation, tells his friends he threw the map into a river because it wasn't any help. Josh and Heather immediately call him a traitor to the group and scream hysterically at him, convinced that if anything bad happens to them now, it's his fault. That night turns out to be the worst of them all. Some mysterious force attacks the tent in the early hours of the morning and sends the characters running for their lives. When daylight arrives, they try one more time to escape the woods, and discover they have walked in a circle because they come across a stream they recognize from earlier. Unable to make any progress at all, they are once again forced to spend another night in this place being stalked by something that doesn't want them there. Josh disappears soon after, and his voice is heard when night falls again. Heather and Mike are convinced it's just a ghost mimicking his voice, so they stay put. Now convinced they will never get out of here, Mike and Heather desperately try to locate Josh and eventually come across a seemingly abandoned and dilapidated house. When they go inside, they find satanic markings on the walls and still hear Josh's voice. Mike's camera suddenly drops and is laying on its side. Heather finds Mike standing motionless in a corner, and before she can react something hits her from behind. We can assume they were both killed by the murderer we were told about early in the movie. While I thought the ending was a little disappointing, this movie has it where it counts. It's very unnerving to witness the character's slow descent into insanity as they eventually realize they're not going to make it out of the woods. All they want to do is go home, but they can't. I really can't imagine being in a similar situation knowing that some mysterious force is chasing me through the virtually endless forest. When it's quiet, you'd be the most afraid. Like most movies with endings similar to this one's, Blair Witch Project is something you will probably only watch once. It's pretty disturbing the first time around, but after that, it doesn't hold up as well. It doesn't help that the movie itself puts a disclaimer at the end saying how the whole thing is fictional, because of course it is. Another mildly weird thing not really related to this movie is how a guy in a store is interviewed at one point, and there's bags of Utz chips behind him. Coincidentally, that's what I was eating while watching this. Overall, Blair Witch Project is a downright creepy movie, but only on the first viewing. Most of its scares come from the setting: being completely alone in a forest where nobody can hear or help you. Another perfect example of a movie that is scary because it could happen.",The Blair Witch Project

183,AKS-6,Not scary -- spooky,7,29 January 2000,"I'm quite surprised here since I liked this film. I'm not saying it's a masterpiece or the ""scariest film ever made"" because it's not. However, I found it quite spooky. I didn't jump or anything, but when you think about how these people must have felt out in the woods and if you have any imagination at all, it's got to be at least a little bit spooky. I found ""The Blair Witch Project"" to be quite fascinating and interesting. The madness of it all is what drives the film forward not the question whether there is a witch or not. And thank you very much, for there not being any ""scary"" witch seen in the film. I hate the skeleton in ""Hellraiser"", I hate the monsters in ""In the Mouth of Madness"" and ""The Faculty"", I hate Jason in ""Friday the 13th"" What you see is not always what makes a film scary or not, it's where your imagination leads you that makes a film scary or spooky. Now, some of you will have that kind of imagination that makes you not see the spookiness in this film (nothing wrong with that) and others will have the kind of imagination that will make them think this is the scariest fim they have ever seen (and I envy those people). I'm stuck in between, but I have to admit that I enjoyed the film and it was much better than I expected it to be since no one I know have liked it. I would probably give this film a 6 out of 10 because I think it deserved it. What I didn't understand, though, was the ending. I figured that ""now it begins -- the *scary* parts"" and then it just ended. Spooky, not scary. (I saw ""Forces of Nature"" as well today, and I have to admit it, after having seen that disgrace of a film even ""See No Evil, Hear No Evil"" [Sorry, Kevin Spacey, :-)] would have been a great film, so maybe that's why I found BWP quite entertaining.)",The Blair Witch Project
184,chrisbrown6453,"There is no question that The Blair Witch Project is unlike any other film you're likely to see this year. With an eerie realness to it, the movie takes you on a journey with three young people to find out t",9,18 July 2001,"Heather, Michael and Josh all head out into the woods to do a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. They interview some townspeople, get some background, and then go into the woods. What was supposed to be a weekend trip to film some footage turns into their worst nightmare. One year after they disappear, their footage is found, buried in an abandoned burned out house. 
The best thing about this movie is the ability to blend reality and fiction. There isn't a person in this country that hasn't heard of this movie, but how many people believe it's true? Did these three kids really disappear 5 years ago, or is this only make believe? From an impressive web site, to a special on the Sci-Fi Network, to just an amazing underground buzz, the line between truth and reality is blurred almost to the point of non-existence. Never has there been a movie with so much effort put into building a huge back-story leading into the actual film. Was there a Blair Witch? Was she really sent into the woods to die? Did children mysteriously disappear? Who killed 7 children in an old house? Is any of it real? 
Watching the film, you really felt like you were just watching a friends home movies (other than the fact that most friends home movies aren't edited and partly shot on 16mm black and white film). No steadicams, no special lighting, and most of the time, no script; just three kids out in the woods having the most terrifying time of their life. The movie showed, very well I might add, all three of them go from fun loving documentary artists, to three people slowly losing their minds. The movie builds very slowly to a very creepy and frightening climax. 
The buzz for Blair Witch has been astounding, and while mainstream American might be hoping for more after all the hype, this movie definitely has all the chills and thrills a good old-fashioned horror movie needs. No slashers with knives on their fingers, no one wearing a mask, just good mental horror. While it didn't completely live up to the hype, it was a great showcase for young, hardworking filmmakers to see how you can make a great film by having a good story, good young actors, and a belief that the movie you're making is going to be great.",The Blair Witch Project

If it's something you can see, you'll think of a way to deal with it.  If you don't see it, you don't know what to do.  So you become scared.  Fear starts to overwhelm you and clouds your thinking.  That's what this movie does.  You have to use your imagination and put yourself in these kids shoes.  There aren't any monsters to blow up, no ghosts to run away from, no houses to escape from.

187,DavidSim240183,Flawed but fascinating,8,8 November 2005,"I remember how excited I was when I first heard about the Blair Witch Project. The idea of a horror film seen through the eyes of a video camera was an intriguing prospect to me. Not to mention unique in this day and age of slasher films. And although it has it's failings, the Blair Witch Project provides good, solid entertainment.The three heroes of the piece Heather, Josh and Mike go off to the woods of Maryland to film a documentary about the Blair Witch. The film makes the wise choice of lulling you into a false sense of security. The opening scenes are light and comical, such as interviews with the townspeople, and witty banter between the trio.But then things start to turn ominous when Heather & Co lose their way. They can't seem to get out of the woods, and what's worse, they are not alone. Someone or something, is stalking them. When they're camped out in the middle of the night, they are certain they can hear noises from outside. Noises that are gradually getting closer to them. Weird objects are left outside their campsite. The map goes missing. Josh disappears. And so on.The fact that the BWP is seen through a camera gives a heightened sense of realism to the proceedings. But personally, what I found to be more effective was the way the three of them gradually come apart on each other. Heather's obsession with continuing to record the events is counter-played with Josh blaming her for getting them lost. The camera closes on her face, teary-eyed, frightened and very upset.Or the scene when Mike throws the map away and confesses. The anger from Heather is so profound it was almost painful to watch. And of course we can never forget the most famous scene when Heather records a final goodbye message. Again the camera is right in her face. She now fully expects to die. Because she so freely admits it, it becomes a very powerful and moving scene.These are the scenes that makes a lasting impression. BWP is never exactly all out frightening, but it is very unnerving. The psychological impact afflicting our trio is much more effective. The ending is rather unusual, because it comes so quickly. Heather and Mike come across a house. They go in. And don't come back out. We never find out what happened to them. Or what was stalking them. This makes for an anti-climatic, but pulse-pounding ending at the same time.Clocking in at a lean 79 minutes was a wise choice. It keeps events moving at a fair pace, and doesn't burn itself out with over-exposure. Those jerky camera movements would otherwise get tedious after a while. The Blair Witch Project is not without it's flaws, but it does leave a lasting impression, and will make you think twice before going off on any camping trips in the woods any time soon.",The Blair Witch Project
188,nitzanhavoc,"It hasn't aged well, and it didn't have to. You don't have to love it in order to appreciate the genius.",8,21 November 2020,"Not being that in touch with Horror hype I haven't heard about the third Blair Witch installment until rather recently, so I've decided to watch the first films again (it has literally been over a decade). So after watching this title again I checked some of the trivia details and some web articles, a process which has lead me to the unfortunate conclusion that I can't recommend TBWP to any new spectators.The story is quite simple (which is part of why it works). Three film students travel to an old city surrounded by woodlands in pursuit of information about ""The Blair Witch"", something between local folklore, an urban legend and a myth. The videotape some sites, interview some locals, and head for the woods for a night of camping before heading back to civilization. That's when things start to get wrong, as the trio gets hopelessly lost, tensions become high and someone (or something) obviously tries to make them feel unwelcome.I know, thinking of that setting almost makes you able to visualize some of the scenes, and most chances are you wouldn't be far from what's actually shown in the film. That's because most Horror fans (and even certain fans of mainstream cinema) have by now seen titles exemplifying how the ""Found Footage"" sub-genre has improved and matured over the years (and I'd say it has become boring and tedious, but that's just my own thoughts and isn't relevant). No, in order to appreciate the Blair Witch you had to have been there, way back at the turning point of the millennium, when there still hadn't been a ""Found Footage"" sub-genre and perhaps two films (UFO Abduction of 1989 and its remake Alien Abduction of 1998) have ever used the ""documentary"" shooting style in a thriller or Horror film. I was too young to take part in the hype, but from I've collected - a website came up telling of a videotape found in a deserted camera in the woods near what used to be the town of ""Blair"". With no reason not to - people believed it. With no information to contradict this intuitive conclusion - people thought they were actually going to watch an authentic found footage. The producers handed out ""Missing"" flyers of the students (actually a cast of two actors and an actress) during the debut screening in the festival, the cast itself was forbidden by contract to make any public appearances, and most spectators simply didn't know any better.Think about it. The web page. The characters' names being identical to the cast's names. Missing person flyers. A footage which in all standards looks precisely like a real documentary. Who could have known? Who would have guessed but the cynics and nay-sayers (who have an annoying habit of being right)? Watching the film under the impression the events were real would indeed justify the film being unofficially dubbed ""the scariest movie of all times"". And as much as it might today seem average at best both as a Horror title in general and as a ""Found Footage"" film specifically - numbers don't lie: 40k budget, near 300m earnings. That is how you make a legend.If any of the anecdotes (true as far as I've been able to track) mentioned here have made you curious and you wish to experience the thrill over two decades after - go right ahead and watch this, just don't expect to have your mind blown. Remember, this is the film which officially gave birth to the Found Footage sub-genre, it was a cinematic and creative breakthrough, but s was the light bulb (and you're reading this on a computer or portable device). If you'd rather enjoy the legacy - go watch any other Found Footage Horror out there (any Paranormal Activity title comes to mind, of course) and know that it wouldn't be here without the pioneering genius of the Blair Witch Project.",The Blair Witch Project
189,willcundallreview,Creepy stuff going on,8,16 December 2015,"Horror is just one of those genres that get's a pretty bad wrap some days and it's not hard to see why, cruddy remakes, poor acting and sometimes they just feel so unreal they are horrible. Sometimes though horror's come along that not only satisfy those looking for a fright, but also those who watch all kind of films, The Blair Witch Project is exactly that. Of course it was applauded when it first came out for its new take on horror using the hand-held camera and also that it felt much more human than most horror movies that came out in the 90's. It's all about a legend that some kind of thing lives in the woods near Burkitsville (formerly Blair) in Maryland. A trio of students go to search the woods to make a documentary on the legend and well there footage was found a year later and the students have vanished.The film is quite fantastic in the way it sets itself up, it doesn't try to jump into the end too fast and even with an 81 minute run time it never goes too quick. The plot is well crafted as well and the way in which it jumps between shots is good for the story to move along well and nicely, It can have it's periods where you might get frustrated at the pace but in general nearly overall it is timed well. Of course it isn't hard to get hand-held movies like this done on such a low budget and you can't expect much from this in terms of spectacular things but my word does it not need much of a budget. The creepy feel the people behind this give is spine tingling, never revealing anything properly and always the film uses the dark to great effect.The people behind this are Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez who direct and write this and do a fine job, sure everyone especially when it came out heralded the hand-held camera which is great but also these two get things like sound, colour and just generally the whole feel of the movie is spot on. Myrick and Sanchez create a script that has some nice dialogue too, it's the kind of dialogue that most horror movies need the stuff that actually sounds normal and not cheesy or lines that are way over dramatic. The cast are pretty solid too and of course being unknown it has the element of realism in there, of course after leaving the town and heading to the woods you only really see these three characters so the people playing them had to be picked just right and they are, they are likable and at the same time can be unlikeable and that really shows how the characters change as the plot goes along. The Blair Witch Project isn't something I think all horror fans will like with it's hand-held feel and not a lot of horror that's right in your face, but it works mostly in it's way that is leaves you quite literally in the dark at times. It's spooky and there aren't many more words to describe this movie than that, even when things going on aren't necessarily creepy, you still look around those woods as if something will come out at any moment. In fact watching this I even got to looking into the woods from the very first second they step foot in them, as if expecting some sort of weird thing to come out any second, but if you haven't seen this, you will see what happens.",The Blair Witch Project

Now that's what surprised me the most, there are some bits where you really will laugh - I wonder if audiences did when they thought the whole thing was real? We even found ourselves laughing at the end, but that was totally different, a nervous uneasy laugh. The kind of laugh that hides the fact that you're scared to go home after the cinema and walk in the house on your own without any lights.Go see this film, okay there's far too much hype, and there's far too many people rubbishing it for no real reason, but you have to see it. If you're a fan of psychological horror then this is for you, actually I don't think you can really use the word horror, psychological terror would be better.The real disturbing thing was the way the ""fright"" sections were underplayed, add to that the strange feeling you got from eavesdropping on three people as their relationships falls apart and you've got a film that really messes with your head.Try to forget all you've heard about it, sit down, and watch, and please, don't have nightmares!",The Blair Witch Project

This is a good example on how good marketing can make a bad movie a hit even when it doesn't deserve to be.

193,TaylorYee94,Playing with your psychology,9,30 September 2020,"Playing with your psychology rather than showing blood, corpse, ghosts, or murderer, makes this film more upscale horror film. I am not a fan of horror movies because their success depends on scale and budget rather than smart screenplay or director's capability. The more money one puts in special effects, make-up, or props, making the movie more realistic, the more it can bring out simple and direct reaction from audience (screaming, surprise, and horror), and the more success.This movie twists one factor of the film, camera, and creates butterfly effect. Three main characters go into the woods, and its shaky hand-held camera style brings the audience with them. A sense of reality skyrockets, absorbing raw emotions of the protagonists 100%. This one little innovative trick erases the screen between actors and the audience. 'The Blair Witch Project' almost created the word 'found-footage'.This horror movie does not make me scream or frown because of grotesque image.

Since its release, it's been knocked off countless times (even my middle school parodied it a few years ago). Cloverfield is the biggest example. NOTE: Do NOT call Cloverfield ""original"".

196,Gafke,Genuinely Creepy,8,20 May 2005,"Three young film students - Josh, Mike and Heather - pack up their filming equipment and head out to Burkittsville, Maryland on an autumn weekend to make a documentary about the Blair Witch, a local legend which continues to haunt the surrounding woods of the small town. The three strike out into the forest with their camping gear and are never seen again. One year later, their film footage is recovered. It's a great basis for a horror movie. What could be worse than actually finding a roll of film or two only to discover that, upon development, it contains the dark and horrible story of a missing persons last moments on earth? The hype surrounding this film was so well done that people still believe to this day that what they are seeing is real. And while the hype may have gone a tad overboard (I don't think, for instance, that this is the scariest movie EVER made) The Blair Witch Project is still a very good, well made pseudo-documentary/ horror movie. Made with hand-held cameras and boasting no special effects whatsoever, Blair Witch takes us out into the middle of the dark and spooky woods and leaves us there with the three unfortunate college kids. It's kind of like being dropped into a particularly vicious retelling of Hansel and Gretel. Strange noises echo through the woods at night, the disturbing laughter of children can be heard and many odd and primitive symbols, made of sticks and resembling crude, miniature scarecrows, are left dangling in the trees for us to find. They are all keys to a mystery which only gets larger and more sinister as the film progresses. The threesome are soon lost and find themselves wandering around in circles, unable to escape from the cursed woods, and this, for me, is where the real horror of the film lies. It can happen and, witch or no, your imagination can conjure up any number of monsters out there in the darkness, heard but never seen, but all of them waiting to eat you. Josh, Heather and Mike begin to fall apart, turning on each other and just as quickly holding on to one another as the woods loom up and consume them. Nothing is ever seen, no answers are given and the mystery surrounding the Blair Witch and the exact fate of the threesome is never solved. We are left to decide for ourselves if the stories are true and the evil rumored to be within the woods is real. The premise here is simple and the film itself very realistic. It's easy to see why it frightened so many people upon its release - at times, it's like watching a snuff film without the sex.Gritty, well-acted and genuinely disturbing. People who suffer from motion sickness should probably avoid it, since the constantly jouncing camera IS rather nauseating. People tired of car chases, obligatory sex scenes and CGI monsters should check this out - it's a very cool throwback to the ghost stories told around campfires. Very well done.",The Blair Witch Project

The Blair Witch Project is possibly the most brilliantly marketed film of all time. The public was attracted to the ambiguity of the film trailer and website, as well as the insisting notion that the events occurred were in fact real. The film also revolutionized how many horror films slash their budget by going to hand-held cameras. It's never an ideal way of film-making,some movies can pull off a shaky camera, some can't, however the Blair Witch Project absolutely does. The big bug-ab-boo is the acting and dialogue are extremely monotonous. Characters are also unlikable at times.

199,kdnor2011,Very Realistic and Very Creepy,8,6 May 2010,"Blair Witch certainly is one of the polorizing movies. There is almost no middle ground when it comes to this film, you either love it, or hate it. For me, I'm on the love side. It certainly isn't the scariest film I've ever seen, but I love it's creativity and atmosphere that I'm willing to overlook it's flaws.This is not a jump scare type of horror film, it fact throughout most of the movie it doesn't really try to SCARE you really, it mostly tries to creep you out. So if you are not a patient person, and believe me, I'm not the most patient person in the world either, than you will hate this film. It can be very tedious at times, and kind of boring. Plus I think we needed at least one more day before the crew started going crazy, but maybe that's just me. And don't watch it with a headache, I did that and I wanted to vomit.What it does do well it make a realistic atmosphere. There are people who still believe this was real, showing how realistic this movie is. The characters, aren't really characters, they're real people. No really, not only are all the actors using their real names, but the directors didn't really give them a full script, they told the actors that the legend was real and would actually make noises to freak them out to make this as realistic as possible. And because of that, I felt sympathy for these three even though they were all kind of a$$holes. Their not movie a$$holes, they're real people a$$holes, and yes there's a difference. And the film has a sense of humor to it, this is actually kind of personal as when something bad happens to me I will sometimes try to add a little humor to the situation to make it seem less bad.The Blair Witch Project is not the scariest film ever made, it's more of a creepy film. What it does best is create a realistic atmosphere and characters that you can sympathise with, and leads to one of the best ending of all time, that leaves a bit up to the imagination. Plus, the backstory to this witch is very detailed and well thought out.8/10",The Blair Witch Project

201,James_De_Bello,8.5/10,8,30 September 2016,"As one of the biggest pop culture phenomenons of the last twenty years it feels odd to give a synopsis for ""The Blair Witch Project"". The reason being is that two different versions could be given, one where you talk about a documentary one where you talk about a fictional found footage film. As twenty years have passed I think it's pretty safe to assume anyone who's reading knows this is a fictional film disguised as a documentary from three student filmmakers who go into the woods near the town of Burketsville to investigate the legend of the Blair Witch, believed to haunt the woods.Even at seventeen years from its release, even to someone like me who didn't see the film until late in the game after having seen other found footage films that used the medium to great effect (""Paranormal Activity"", ""Rec"", Chronicle""), ""The Blair Witch Project"" remains a gem of the horror genre, one of the best ever made, indicative of the fact that what truly scares us is what we don't understand.To talk about this film is also to talk about the many stories that surround its making which represent the brilliance and the inspiration these filmmakers had for the production. It is a film that, even after all of these years, remains original, fresh, unique and most of all terrifying. It is one of those movies where you just don't believe how they made it, how they came up with certain ideas and techniques, the one where you just keep asking yourself questions throughout the whole duration and one that still lets you enjoy the joy of filmmaking and directing without ever calling attention to itself.At the heart of this creepy madness are three performances that live on as remarkable efforts of acting and actor's direction. There isn't a false beat in these performances, there isn't a dull moment, you full heartily believe in these three characters, you appreciate them as fully rounder, three dimensional real people which is what ultimately makes this film the more terrifying. Again the stories of how the directors pulled these performances from the actors are fascinating and indicate how truly inspiring, great filmmaking from two individuals that had a clear, beautiful vision for this picture.The characters manage to feel so alive and real that is where almost all of the horror takes place. In reality what we have as set-pieces are a couple of sounds, one iconic imagery and a final set-piece. Yet it feels like so much more. That is because of how insanely close you manage to get with the characters. The found footage trope was used to extreme brilliance here, it was dictated by story and manages to bring us into the world of these people as no other medium could have ever had. I mean you feel every drop of sweat, every breath and insanity the characters are put through, it is absolutely harrowing.Moreover, the film also manages to have a thematic line and delves deeply into the realms of starving, desperation, getting lost and confronting yourself with death. All of this subtext it what actually makes the film as tension filled and scary as it is. The raw portrayal of this wears you out by the end and you have just the same will of these characters to get the f**k out of the woods.As a big horror fan, as a true film fan, as a lover of the art of filmmaking and as an adrenaline junkie I cannot recommend ""The Blair Witch Project"" enough, turn off all your lights, put away all other electronic devices, make sure the screen is the only source of light surrounding you and experience this film in all of its glory, you will have a blast, it lives on as one of the scariest films ever made.",The Blair Witch Project

205,glgioia,2 Words - Cell Phone!!,9,29 October 2002,"Just kidding, its hard to believe this movie is only 3 years old...seems like I've been watching it for much longer. Regardless, the film takes place back in the dark ages of 1994, when cell phones weren't as yet handed out to all citizens at birth. I've seen this movie many many times, and it still chills me. Its become the ""Its a Wonderful Life"" of the Halloween season. It expertly exploits the lingering childhood fears of the woods after dark, and the haunted abandoned house. Once again if you keep the supernatural question unanswered, (pay attention Hollywood), it is still possible to scare the fertilizer out of audiences. Film makers are usually just not willing to work that hard. This film has no sex or violence, and only the smallest tiniest dollop of gore. Yet it smokes any movie for fright thats been made in the last 20 years. The performances and writing are brilliantly natural and completely believable, and pose an interesting sociological study on group behavior in crisis. The ""I would have done this"", and ""they are stupid, why didn't they just""...thoughts and debates are what makes the film a masterpiece. Horror films about the woods have been made before, but sadly rarely make use of the woods per se, as the cuplrit of fear. Pity, that fear is deep in our psyche, stamped in our makeup, and if you cleverly storytell, a nut with a hockey mask and chainsaw are hardly required to bring it to the surface.",The Blair Witch Project

207,jayjaycee,Minimalistic found footage masterpiece,8,2 October 2020,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is a 1999 mystery horror film directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez starring Heather Donahue and Joshua Leonard.
⚪
All in all, this famous found footage film bewitches with its minimalistic yet extremely effective nature, as it turns a low budget production into a groundbreaking genre entry that creates a unique atmosphere of spine-crawling suspense and psychological terror out of almost nothing and makes you want to stay out of forests for a really long time.
⚪
It feels like as if it was only yesterday that I have finished the project, but as it turns out, a whole year has already passed and Spooktober has begun once again. As every year, the next few weeks will be dedicated to the watching of horror films as part of the celebration of probably the best month in the year, the month before Halloween. This time I thought that I would kick of this phenomenal event by watching a gem that I have already seen two years ago and that gave me nightmares already back then. I am aware that many heavily dislike this film and I can see why it would annoy rather than entertain them, but to me this is probably one of the most original and, most importantly, dreadful films I have ever seen (in terms of how scary it is!). With a runtime of merely eighty minutes it still manages to take me on an adventure that kept me awake a long time after the credits rolled. But what is it that makes it so popular and effective? Undoubtedly, how the film was originally promoted is one portion of its huge popularity, as it was famously advertised as a real incident of which only the cursed footage was found afterwards (hence the term ""found footage""). The people back in the day thought that those three film students were in fact lost in the woods and killed by some supernatural force of the forest. It was all over the news and a huge sensation for a long time, until the directors confirmed it was all publicity for their work of fiction, but considering that it was received this way only proves how realistic this film is. And I think it still holds up to this reputation, more than twenty years after the whole éclat. It didn't lose any of its eerie atmosphere and general creepy nature. There are so many seemingly insignificant details that contribute to this effect. The whole narration is influenced by minimal aspects, the different stories about the local lore, including the believe that a witch roams the forest or that a child murderer lives in a cabin in the woods, make the viewer think of what they are going to expect and already there terrorises them at this point. Regardless of what you believe in, the story unfolds in a simple and realistic manner. When the three protagonists are talking about seemingly irrelevant stuff and kid around, it adds so much to the effect that it was all filmed by a bunch of infantile and adolescent kids. Many might find them annoying, especially when they start to yell at each other and fight constantly, but I think that is what makes them so relatable in the first place. They are nothing like everyday people, and this only shows it. As their madness grows, the suspension curve rises perfectly and offers increasingly more scenes that haunt you. It is anything but graphic, but I think that is what makes it so wonderfully scary. I don't need jump scares to be haunted, sounds of something breaking twigs in the middle of the night, noises of children who then shake the tent, screams of the one who mysteriously vanishes, stick totems and brick stacks, as well as a bloody gift are enough for me to be totally freaked out. Minor spoiler: thanks to a mistake made by the camera man in a key scene, the witch is never shown on screen, it only takes place in the viewer's head. I don't know what others think, but I had the feeling that the three main characters were constantly watched by something that is more powerful than anyone can imagine. Even as I write these sentences, I feel how the simple thought of it gives me severe goosebumps. This feeling didn't leave me until the horrifying and breathtakingly mysterious ending that still confuses me in a fascinating way. What happened there? Was it the witch or was it something else? Many fan theories about this ambiguous ending are plausible to me. Some say that the whole incident was staged by Josh and Mike whose only goal was to kill Heather, some say that it was the house of the child murder who couldn't take others staring at him when he kills his victim (that's why Mike is looking into the corner), others think that it was the Blair witch herself and I think that every option is possible, as there are hints for every of those theories. Not knowing what happened there is what makes me think that it is such an incredibly hair-raising experience. It is not everybody's darling, but to me it is a minimalistic masterpiece that shows that creativity enables you to do things that will be remembered. This is the definition of an unnerving found footage gem.",The Blair Witch Project

210,mlraymond,"Potentially scary film ends up annoying viewers, not frightening them",3,22 October 2006,"I did not see the fake documentary on TV that was shown before the movie was exhibited in theaters, so I went on what I had read about it.It seemed to have some real potential, but there was a pitfall built in from the beginning: The reported determination of the producers not to show any monsters or maniacs; nothing that the three students couldn't have filmed themselves. This might have been an interesting concept, but it just does not work in the actual movie. I found it really annoying that not once in the entire film does anyone, either townspeople or students, say anything remotely serious or believable about the alleged Blair Witch. The closest it gets to that is when a man is being interviewed and he recounts the true story of the hermit who had murdered some children right at the start of World War Two. But even this seemingly promising thread goes nowhere, as it's never connected to the Blair Witch. Heather stands before a couple of locations, including a cemetery and Coffin Rock, and makes dramatic pronouncements about what happened at these places,without ever giving us a clue as to what she's referring to.The one eerie part that might have really worked up to a genuinely frightening conclusion was the disappearance of the one student, body parts being found, and terrible screams and then his voice calling to the other two for help. I toyed with the idea that a possible explanation is that he went crazy and ran off, hid out, and then murdered the other two. But we are never given any kind of real explanation for the ending. One can only assume that the remaining two students are about to be killed by someone or something, but we have no idea who or what it might be. The audience needs to be shown something, however small or insignificant it might seem. Val Lewton understood this with his RKO Studios horror pictures of the Forties. He and his crew used sounds and shadows and darkness to scare the audience by suggesting something evil was lurking nearby, or something terrible was about to happen.The Lewton pictures show just enough, without overdoing it. Best example: The Leopard Man, 1943. In a small town where an escaped leopard is prowling, a young girl has to go out alone in the dark of night to the store. She has to pass under a railroad bridge. As she starts forward fearfully into the blackness, two glowing eyes stare at her from high up and then disappear. The audience wonders if we actually saw something. A train suddenly hurtles overhead with a terrifying noise and flash of light. As we recover from this fright, there is a closeup of the roaring panther as it attacks the girl! She runs home screaming and begs to be let in, but her mother refuses to open the door. Terrible growls and screams are heard and then a pool of blood slowly puddles under the door. Now, THAT is scaring the audience with very little! There is more fright in five minutes of that film than all tedious 87 minutes of The Blair Witch Project. If only the producers had put one tenth of the imagination into the actual movie as the marketing campaign, they might have really given us a memorable horror film. As it is, The Blair Witch Project is basically nothing more than a clever idea, badly realized.",The Blair Witch Project

The obvious switching between one camera to another without breaking audio leads one easily to conclude that. Not only that, but where was the extra juice for all the video they took?

After seeing it, my feeling is that it was a very good film, using a concept that hasn't been done to death and one that served the filmmakers well. Let's hope, however, that this will not now become the cinematic wave of the future. We don't need every bunch of amateurs in the world running around with camcorders doing pseudo-cinema verite documentaries and foisting them on the public!The appeal of 'BWP' to me was not as The World's Scariest Movie but rather as an examination of what stress and fear can do do people in adverse and extraordinary circumstances. Looking at it this way I think it succeeded admirably. One of my favorite moments in the film comes when the two young men almost get hysterical when they find they've been tramping through the woods all day and have arrived at the place they started. Heather, the filmmaker, repeatedly assures them that they haven't, then out of their hearing breaks down crying, confessing to herself that in fact they are back where they began.The idea to suggest frightening sights rather than to show them was a good one that works well. There was one point, though, when Heather was running in fear and screams ""What the **** is that!"" that I thought they could have at least shown a shadowy suggestion of SOMETHING. But I can't criticize the direction the filmmakers took, because it worked. I think they made the film they set out to do. A masterful job was done of building suspense throughout the entire movie and the climax occurs right at the very last moment, like the best Edgar Allan Poe stories.

Don't waste your time.,1,28 October 2000,Just a little over a year ago I rented The Blair Witch Project and after forty minutes I was ready to fall asleep. Don't waste your money or time with this boring piece of crap. It's simple three lost film students become the prey (note supposedly prey) of an unknown entity while researching a local legend (a supposed witch) in the Maryland woods. Tell me what is the scare? Anyone who has watched this movie knows that the hype builds up to nothing. Maryland college students with raging hormones who make a film for a class research project simply disappear out of the night. Not once does this movie show a scary scene of a supposed monster(legend-witch) these students just vanish one by one like it's a planned vacation using The Blair Witch legend as a scheme. To finish this criticism off of The Blair Witch horror movies should contain gore and murder to scare this one falls way short. Anyway if the people in Hollywood want to make a film about a legend please give a try at the Bigfoot/Sasquatch legend now that's a legend to get your blood pumping. Avoid The Blair Witch Project it's a waste to not only film but to everyone.,The Blair Witch Project
216,mnpollio,A triumph of marketing genius over substance or style,3,9 May 2010,"More than 10 years after its premiere and many who watch this film may well wonder what in the world the hubbub was about. The truth is that the marketing campaign for the film is a far more interesting topic than anything that appears in the film itself (more on that later). A relatively simple tale of three amateur documentary filmmakers who vanish into the Maryland woods while investigating the title phenomena is the center of this film. The amateur nature of the film-making in that everything we see is fairly badly shot through a jittery hand-held camcorder is supposed to add authenticity and accentuate the ""you are there"" atmosphere of the unknown a la Romero's Night of the Living Dead. Unfortunately, a glaring discrepancy is that Romero's film actually had a solid premise to hang its low-budget authenticity on and the Blair Witch Project has nothing of the kind. The opening moments which introduce us to three characters, played by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams, are dreadfully uninteresting and fail to do much to ingratiate the leads, other than to emphasize that Donahue is a type-A control freak who micromanages the entire foray into the woods badly. If anyone can figure out what the ""legend"" is that is supposed to be so fascinating to inspire a documentary and propel this story forward, they are doing better than I. The mishmash of background provided by snippets of interviews with locals indicate that the legend may or may not have something to do with a witch, a ghost and/or an old male psycho who kidnaps people - the entire explanation is murky at best, which is a fatal flaw since we have no idea what exactly these people are searching for. While there would be some suspense to be mined from easily losing one's way in the wilderness, that quickly dissipates thanks to the ill-tempered characters basically shouting and cursing at other with dialog that is rather painfully made up on the fly. The supernatural elements are total misfires due to two issues: 1) for much of the time, when the characters claim to hear something ominous in the nighttime forest, the audio is so bad that we often cannot hear the same things, and 2) the reactions to the most minor of events are so hysterical as to induce unintentional laughter (ie., someone sees a pile of sticks in the forest, which results in screaming and running). Of the actors, Leonard makes little impact in his limited screen time, Donahue is shrill and annoying, and Williams hints that he might have been able to do something worthwhile within a better structured film. By the end, few if anyone will know what, why, where, how or who The Blair Witch is. It is truly a shame that some of the savvy poured into the marketing did not wend its way into the film. Over-hyped as the little film that came out of no where, such a claim was near laughable since the internet had been abuzz for months before its release laying the ground work for the film and deliberately confusing easily credulous viewers that it was true and what they were seeing was actually a video found abandoned in the woods rather than actors playing a badly written plot. Coupled with a front page Time Magazine article, ready-to-be-duped patrons flocked in droves to see the true story of the poor young victims obliterated by the supernatural, only to subsequently be disappointed in that they were conned and the production they were conned into seeing was a badly filmed, motion sickness inducing, amateurishly acted mess. Don't believe me? Seriously, try to find anyone in the physical world (not in the anonymity of the internet) who will actually admit to having been terrified or even marginally entertained by this film. It takes a really long search. And in the age of similarly filmed efforts like Cloverfield or Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch's fading star gets less notable with each passing year.",The Blair Witch Project
217,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Damn good horror movie!,7,18 June 2008,"Anyone who has even the slightest trouble with insomnia after seeing a horror movie should stay away from The Blair Witch Project--this film will creep under your skin and stay there for days. Credit for the effectiveness of this mock documentary goes to filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who armed three actors (Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Josh Leonard) with video equipment, camping supplies, and rough plot outlines. They then let the trio loose into the Maryland woods to improvise and shoot the entire film themselves as the filmmakers attempted to scare the crap out of them. Gimmicky, yes, but it worked--to the wildly successful tune of $130 million at the box office upon its initial release (the budget was a mere $40,000). For those of you who were under a rock when it first hit the theaters, The Blair Witch Project tracks the doomed quest of three film students shooting a documentary on the Burkittsville, Maryland, legend of the Blair Witch. After filming some local yokels (and providing only scant background on the witch herself), the three, led by Heather (something of a witch herself), head into the woods for some on-location shooting. They're never seen again. What we see is a reconstruction of their ""found"" footage, edited to make a barely coherent narrative. After losing their way in the forest, whining soon gives way to real terror as the three find themselves stalked by unknown forces that leave piles of rocks outside their campsite and stick-figure art projects in the woods. (As Michael succinctly puts it, ""No redneck is this clever!"") The masterstroke of the film is that you never actually see what's menacing them; everything is implied, and there's no terror worse than that of the unknown. If you can wade through the tedious arguing--and the shaky, motion-sickness-inducing camera-work--you'll be rewarded with an oppressively sinister atmosphere and one of the most frightening denouements in horror-film history. Even after you take away the monstrous hype, The Blair Witch Project remains a genuine, effective original.",The Blair Witch Project
218,flicklover,TERRIFYING!!!!,9,18 July 1999,"I went into the theater with high expectations, I read many reviews of this movie and I was really expecting to be blown away by it. The reaction that I had was not of being blown away but a sense of fear that I had really not felt ever in a movie theater. The film is being described as one of the scariest ever made, and I have to agree! I dont think that it belongs to the traditional horror movie genre, the fear that the filmakers achieve here is not cinematic, it is real, as if we are experiencing what the characters are. I felt like I was living their dilema. I felt nervous from the moment they arrived in the woods. This is the type of movie you experience not watch. Im sure that people are going to analyze this film for years, I honestly believe that there is nothing to analyse, this movie taps into our basic fears. there is one scene in the film that literally is heart-wrenching. People will disect this movie, they will talk about technique and theorise about the filmakers intentions. I believe that their single intention was to scare the audience silly! With me at least, they have succeeded! I have the film's images and sounds floating around in my head. This is truly a unique film! DON'T SEE IT ALONE!!!",The Blair Witch Project
219,flicklover,I have seen it 3 times!!! Still terrifying!!!!,9,7 August 1999,"I have seen this movie 3 times and i still believe that it is excellent. I have read most of the reviews of the film here, and most are positive, but the some of the negative ones bother me. I truly believe that they are missing the point! I have to agree that the film has been hyped too much, but at least the movie is worthy.( remember GODZILLA?). I saw the movie before the hype so I can't be accussed of being influenced by the hype. The average American moviegoer is lazy, unwilling to be challenged by a film. People today want to be wowed by special effects they dont want to use their imagination. That is what Blair Witch does, it chllenges the viewer to use his/her imagination. I love a good hollywood blockbuster as much as anyone, but they have become so  commonplace that they are not as good as they used to be. The Blair Witch Project proves that at times, less is more. What the audience doesnt see is scarier than what they do see. I can give a perfect example: in Jaws the movie was more effective whaen youm couldnt see the shark, right? The same has been implemented here. I went to see The Haunting the other day, I hated it, good production values and thats it! No sense of real fear! After the movier ended i listened to people's reaction to it, most liked it! Im amzed, the movie had a stupid story, terrible acting, nothing memorable, but the people only talked about the effects! True some of the effects were good but cmon, The Haunting doesnt hold a candle to BW! People now seem to rate a movie solely on the SFX, that is sad.The point is The Blair Witch is an example of good planning and genuine desire to scare. The performances are incredibly real, especially Heather's. Her scene alone late in the film should earn her an Oscar nod! But Im sure that the snobs in the Academy won't recognize that it is a great performance considering the kind of film The Blair Witch is. Like any movie TBW may not be everyone's cup of tea, but some of the comments im reading are just ridiculous!YES! The website was a clever way to raise interest in the film! YES! THe marketing for the film is aggressive! But the movie lives up to the hype if you go with an open mind, if you expect to see a movie like Scream( which I do like by the way) you will be disappointed. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF EXPERIENCE IN A MOVIE, LEAVE YOUR HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTER EXPECTATIONS BEHIND. The Blair Witch Project is a fresh departure from the normal moviegoing experience!",The Blair Witch Project

This reminds me of summer camp in the woods where you psyche yourself out except even little kids don't scream, yell and cry like these people. The girl needed to go first - her behavior was over the top ridiculous and yet she always has the presence of mind to have her camera filming. Garbage that has been peddled as a great masterpiece.

221,barberoux,Terror is mental.,8,24 March 2000,"I enjoyed this movie.  It is not a slasher blood bath movie with the usual stereotypical scary scenes.  Its terror is mental.  Consider being in the middle of a forest.  It is dark, wet and you are scared.  Where do you run? You can walk all day but still night comes.  You watch the sun go down and know what you will face.  And there is no way out of it.  There is nowhere to go.  A convincing film.  I heard the hype and was not in a positive mindset but I was pulled into the movie and it worked.  I would recommend it.  If you liked ""Scream""  don't bother, rent ""Scream"" again.",The Blair Witch Project
222,Rendanlovell,A great found footage horror flick,8,2 August 2016,"Now that we are getting a second sequel this year I finally decided to watch the OG 'Blair Witch Project'. Now that I've gotten around to it I'm glad I did. What's interesting about this film is that, even now, it remains one the most renowned horror movies ever. Yet, it's also the same movie that accrued a Razzie nomination for worst picture of the year. So which is it? Is it one of the greatest exercises in horror or one of the worst? In my humble opinion it's one the best. Although I wouldn't necessarily call it a horror. For my taste it's more of a thriller than anything. If you aren't aware, the film follows three young adults who venture into the woods in search of a story.A story for their documentary. Which explains the reason for the found footage style. Before this movie there really wasn't anything like this. And with the viral marketing suggesting that it was a legit thing, people were genuinely frightened for the cast. Apparently sending letters to the cast families expressing their condolences for their losses.Even with the excess of found footage films these days this one some how still feels fresh. This mainly has to do with the lack of gimmicks and clichés despite it revolutionizing a genre. There isn't any slow pan left and slow pan right followed by a jump scare. Nor is there the constant wonder as to why the characters have a camera at all times. The reason it defined a genre is because it did it so well. And now all we have is overused troupes that intend on jumping their audience to death. The thing that genuinely shocked me while watching was how the film understood that less is more. There isn't a single jump scare that I remember and there isn't a single time that you actually see the antagonist. The film understands that if it where to show the witch and sets rules for it that it would become vastly more difficult to scare you. By not having these rules set it can basically do what ever it wants without any one saying, ""That doesn't make sense."". It helps you as the audience feel and experience whats happening through the characters perspective. As more things start to happen and they start to question what is going to happen next, so do you.This intentional lack of a monster or rules makes this incredibly unsettling to watch. It feels authentically supernatural. The performances by these three unknown actors really helped sell this even more. They aren't all that good honestly, but the writing and editing for the film made everything come across convincing and natural. Not everything here works though. As I said, the performances can be quite shaky. They clearly aren't trained actors and some of their interactions can be rather cringy. But the biggest issue I have comes from some of the characters behavior. There are many times when they act so irrational that it's near impossible to not get frustrated at the film. Like when a character tosses a valuable object into a river just because he personally deemed it ""useless"".However this film honestly shocked me. It blows me away how diversified its audience is when it comes to whether they liked it or not. It may not be that scary but it's incredibly unsettling. The film is unpredictable, natural, and uncommonly convincing. It isn't exactly a perfect horror experience due to some poor performances and questionable behavior, but it's such an interesting dive into human physique. Watching these people go completely bonkers was way more enjoyable, and unsettling than it should have been.",The Blair Witch Project
223,africe,Wow! Badly filmed,1,17 November 2020,This film was terrible. The premise was fine but the constant bickering was unacceptable. The black screen throughout the film was annoying. Movies are scarier when the audience can actually see something.,The Blair Witch Project
224,the amorphousmachine,Now that the hype's gone...it's Brilliant!,9,5 November 2000,"I was expecting crap! I heard so many bad reviews about this film that I didn't expect much from it at all. I was pleasantly suprised.This film is brilliant and vividly scary! I can't believe so many people bagged BWP! It was made with a low-budget, broke all the traditional rules of the horror film genre and bought us something new and different.People were actually complaining about the fact it wasn't 'real', yeah well so what! The point is, if you watch BWP and you attempt to believe it's 'real', eventually the line between fiction and reality become blurred in this cleverly constructed film. I knew it wasn't real from the start, but it was so convincingly made, that it became very scary indeed.I liked the clever use of the two cameras, and I even liked the filmmaker's excuse for the overuse of the cameras incorporated into the narrative (through the character, Heather)! Although there is some flaws (i.e. constant use of cameras especially when you need both hands free), this film is a totally inspirational film to any would-be student of film-making. ****1/2 out of *****!",The Blair Witch Project
225,michaelradny,The Blair Bitc-,6,27 October 2015,"Whilst it was a fairly original concept for it's time, despite other movies like Cannibal Holocaust paving the way, it has now gone down as the trend setter for found footage film. A modern audience may see this film as another cheap, scare free, shaky cam, found footage movie, but if you put it in context to when it was released, it's quite an original horror tactic.Whilst The Blair Witch Project hasn't aged well, it is still fun enough to look back on and see when this horrible found footage phenomena started. It may not be as grand as you once remember it, but at least it's not the worst found footage film ever released.",The Blair Witch Project
226,Jacques98,A very intense movie for people who can appreciate what it tries to accomplish.,7,10 October 2008,"Something that so much of the horror genre lacks is realism. While ""classics"" like A Nightmare on Elm Street do nothing but bash you over the head with a block of cheese, they get positive reviews because they follow the same tired, safe formula that make the horror fans go in their pants due to nostalgia. The majority of the horror genre isn't really scary, and it never was. When The Blair Witch Project first came out it was the only movie to break these rules and delve into true, realistic terror. It didn't follow a formula. It tried to recreate the terror of someone lost in the woods on film, without the cheese or eye candy. I think that is why it captivated me. I've seen thousands of movies in my life, the majority horror movies, and maybe less than 5% really scared me. I'm not sure The Blair Witch Project scared me, but, I can say I felt the terror in the characters and script more than the vast majority of the other horror movies I've seen combined.But there is another factor it seems no one is mentioning in their reviews. If you've never been lost in the woods, as I've been many times, I'm not really sure you could appreciate or understand the fear that the characters were feeling. If you're not a camper, I really doubt you'd like this movie whatsoever. A lot of the negative reviews from people calling this ""stupid"" or ""boring"", I can understand if they've never been lost in the woods. This is NOT a film everyone will like, or should like, and that is something someone really needs to say.Because I'm reviewing this in 2008, not 1999, I'm going to have to add that this movie is not like Cloverfield whatsoever. Cloverfield was a huge adventure caught on a small camera, while this is a small adventure caught on a small camera. If you liked Cloverfield (or vice versa) and are looking for a similar experience, this isn't it. They're both good movies, but for very different reasons.The main flaw that a lot of people are having a problem with is the pacing, which is reasonably slow. The reason for this is because it is meant to echo real life, not bash you with an explosive beginning like is typical Hollywood. Some will find this boring. Some won't because they appreciate realism. I fit into the latter.Overall, a very intense movie . . . if you know how to understand it. I found it very enjoyable and lacking of the typical horror cheese, which is something I can't say much anymore. Very much worth watching. You are not a real horror fan if you haven't at least viewed this once, because it's unlike anything that has ever been made before it.3/10",The Blair Witch Project

Put that in front of a Parkinson's Patient using a handheld video camera and you have the Blair Witch Project. I'll keep this real short, because most of the negatives have already been discussed. But explain this; these three kids get lost in the woods, and even after they're terrified and at the point when survival is the number one priority, why did they continue to film the whole thing? (Even when they indulged into a few physical fights? Wouldn't they at least set the camera down?) This is amateur filmmaking at best, so shoestring and holed that it probably didn't even take a full day to square it out. You don't need a huge budget to make a good film, but if you extend your time, efforts will prove to be more thought out and worthwhile. That wasn't the case here. The premise was extremely mundane (Anyone who hasn't seen The Vanishing, Cannibal Holocaust or 84 Charlie Mopic, first, would understand), the delivery was ill-concieved and overbaked, and the characters were no less annoying than those in the common Hollywood teen horror flick. This is a rape of intelligence, money, and time. If, to you, life is a terrible thing to waste, you'll be better off avoiding this movie.

There's not really a plot or story in the movie, it's just basically a videotape recording of the events that took place during the project. The movie was a bit intriguing, but the problem is it's not very exciting or thrilling and this is probably the main reason why other people dislike the movie. That wasn't an issue for me though as I was still interested in the movie to see what will happen in the end. I didn't find the movie scary, however although I knew the movie was fictional, at times it felt real with some of the paranormal activities and the dialogue which is a credit to the actors.

Horror films that tap into our hard-wired instinctive fears probe a deeper place than movies with more sophisticated threats. A villain is only an actor, but a shark is more than a shark.""And that is what make The Blair Witch Project so effective. It depends on the sounds of nature that would scare you at night. It is what should really scare you in life. It does not use scary Psycho music(I mean, that's a good movie, but you know when she will die in the shower!), or other warnings. it just let's it happen.And the the most scariest thing is how many times they say the F word!If you want a truly scary movie, look no further than this!",The Blair Witch Project

It was a very smart decision and the only reason people were scared of it when it came out. The realism is helped a lot by pretty good performances. I only have a couple complaints about the acting. I thought the ""map was useless!"" really unintentionally hilarious because of poorly written dialogue and pretty bad acting, a few of the argument scenes are accidently pretty funny.Overall I thought the blair witch project was really boring.

This movie is scary as hell, and I'm not saying this because I'm hyped up, or because I'm going with my friends. Actually, the way I see it, everybody hated this movie. Well that is quite frightening. Has the world gone so crazy that people excpect I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER every time they walk in to a cinema?Let's put it this way. You people who don't like this movie has many reasons not to, but no one of them really is fair. I have read almost all comments and I keep seeing the same misstake in the ''bad'' comments: You don't seem to understand it. 1. Is it scary with a pile of rocks? Answer: YES, YES, YES! I bet if you heared some strange noise in the night, and wakes up to find a pile of rocks outside your tent, you would be scared as hell! 2. Heather annoying? Answer: NO, NO, NO! Isn't her reaction pretty realistic? I mean, let's face it: One of your best friends disappear without a trace (you ALSO hear him screaming in the night, but something is wrong, it isn't him) and someones teeths poppes up. Anyone, exept for Superman, would panic and, yes, scream.3. Throw up for the cameras? Answer: This was one of the stupid comments? What did you want them to do? Keep the camera straight, even though the circumstanses? I don't think so. Didn't you know before you saw TBWP, that the camera would be like this through the entire movie? Some other comments think that it's boring, probably just because that it is not like any other horrorfilm. They maybe want to see the actual creature, but HEY! That's the scary thing about a horrormovie isn't it? The unseen evil... You know that something is out there, but you never get to see it, or at least get a clear shot. That freaks, at least me, out. You guys probably wondered where the music were, or ''where did all the gore and effects go? isn't this a horrormovie''? Yes, it is. But it is a horrormovie that is very, very, very, very scary without anything of that in it. Only using a large forest, some voodostuff, and human minds and then making a masterpiece, is pure cinema art. And something we don't see every dayREALISM SCARES HERE:First of all, the acting IS NOT BAD! It is just the fact that this is a REALISTIC PORTRAIT! This is the way they'd react too, whatever they say, and it seems to piss them off royaly.The PLOT is genius for a non-budget film. Also the 8mm is genius for a non-budget. Didn't you guys feel like this was something REAL? Didn't you get the feeling that this actually happened? Frankly this movie felt like a recording I found on the attic or something. Because I could RELATE TO THE MOVIE, IT WAS VERY REALISTIC! All these negative comments, nobody says anything about it not being realistic, because IT IS!

I had no exposure at all to the hype. My younger brother told me how terrible this movie was, but I thought it must have *some* redeeming value -- in fact, it sounded interesting.  After seeing it, I realized that it had no redeeming value.  It was bad, bad, bad. Dull.  The fact that I made it all the way through without turning it off is a minor miracle.Another thing -- I'm not at all lacking in imagination.  I love atmospheric films.  I've felt a creepy sensation being in the woods before (although I usually just feel peaceful) and was terrified of the dark as a child (I got over it!)  But the fact is, this movie had no atmosphere.  It had no acting (though plenty of ridiculous overacting).  It had no plot.  It had no cinematography.  No directing.In fact, this wasn't a movie at all.  I don't know what it was... I don't...I know... it had to be a farce!  I get it now... someone posted several hundred positive reviews using different names on the IMDB, trying to get people to watch it.  Must have been whoever released the film.  The production company must have been in on it.Honest... how else to explain why ANYONE would consider this dull, meaningless piece of junk?  I feel very cheated that I wasted the money to rent this on DVD.  I would feel cheated if someone offered (and paid) me fifty dollars to see it again.The only film of ANY genre I've seen that was worse was ""The Telephone"" (Whoopi Goldberg).

235,zac-04879,"Cheap, but Terrifying",9,19 June 2021,"This ""found-footage"" horror film is what pure terror truly is, which doesn't rely on cheap gore for scares and increases tension as the film plays. It's also based on the performances of the excellent cast, who each personate realistic fear within their characters and are frequently panicking in the terrifying circumstances.The biggest thing about The Blair Witch Project is there's no violence at all. Unlike most horror movies today, there's absolutely no violence, and the film still manages you leave you frightened. It's way too scary to even view it without any company. Due to the level of terror, which is promoted by the remarkable acting, it's hard to avoid saying that this film is one of the best horror movies of all time.The filming techniques are also brilliant! The stylish footage-quality used within the full 80 minute duration adds to the petrifying effect, along with an original storyline produced into a quick and entertaining runtime. The Blair Witch Project is a suspenseful horror sensation for teens and up, even more unsettling watching in silent darkness, but can be too scary for anyone.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",The Blair Witch Project

Spiritual epiphanies have come about from running away to the local Theater Troupe known as Concept East on what used to be Adams Street.

Idly dropping off the Livernois bus to visit Doctor Curtis' Museum of Black History while unemployed and having time on my hands, I discovered, much to my astonishment, and contrary to what was to be seen on The Science Channel and 'Through The Wormhole', that Black Folks invented as much new technology and made things better for the future as much as anyone else. Besides that, you could trace their accomplishments back through time thousands upon thousands of years.On top of that, a voice came out of nowhere one day and asked me what my Top Ten Favorite movies of all time were and to list them. I did what the voice bid me to do. At that time the voice asked me what was the common denominator to all these films that I liked so much. This took me a considerable amount of thought before I could formulate a reasonable answer.When the answer dawned upon me, I marveled at my discovery. The films that I treasured the most in my hearts of hearts despite their subject matter all contained the least amount or no Sex and Violence at all in them! I went over the list again and again, thinking this couldn't possibly be the case for such a random selection of films.But, for me, it was true.It was from this that I was able to formulate my hard and fast rule about storytelling.Sex and Violence are substitutes for Character and Plot development.That brings us to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. There is no romantic relationship or love triangle between the female lead Heather Donahue or the other male characters. There are no scenes of physical conflict between any of the leads. Therefore, a very interesting question comes to mind.How could a film made for twentynine thousand dollars plus thirty thousand dollars for promotion costs with no apparent Sex and Violence to embroider its narrative yet go on to gross over a hundred and forty million dollars worldwide? Could it be the focus of the film is on storytelling? This is a great film for Independent Filmmakers to study and treasure. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, according to my lights, is the film that truly and substantially changed the landscape of Cinema. The simplicity of the idea, the method acting techniques used to prepare the actors to improvise their lines and reactions with sophomoric verisimilitude and sincerity in carefully crafted and yet somewhat open ended situations suggests anyone could have made this film.Even you.Sure why not? Anyone could pack their gear and cameras for two or three days of hiking to some place nearby like Seneca Creek State Park to investigate the local Bogeyman legend that's supposed to have happened in the woods somewhere out there. Just take a map and mark your destination so that you don't end up off the beaten track or right back where you started and make a careful record of any suspicious items or objects found on your journey. Hopefully, curiosity won't lead you screaming and running through the woods in the dark fleeing from mysterious sounds in the night. God forbid that all the footage you shoot should end up among the found objects involved with The Blair Witch Legend; that you should end up missing and never heard from again.What a bummer, huh? But it really could happen to anyone.Even you.Sure, why not?",The Blair Witch Project

It's neither sublime, nor psychologically frightening, nor visually captivating, so I simply can not comprehend for which reasons someone may have enjoyed this production. There's one thing worth admiring and that's got nothing to do with the art of film-making, but with the art of money making. I suppose you can turn any piece of junk into an underground myth as long as people will go along with it.Evil Dead, so many years older and so much more fresh than Blair Witch, is the main source of inspiration and I'm not saying it just because it's another movie that takes place in a forest. Maybe, but just maybe, BW could've been something more. Maybe it had some potential, but given that I've seen good movies with terrible premises and disastrous movies with brilliant premises you have to concur that, in the end, this just doesn't matter.

239,songod-95003,I feel for this film...,8,21 October 2019,"Celebrated like no other when released, well, before released actually thanks to a then groundbreaking internet and media campaign, it has since become the whipping boy for the entire ""found footage"" genre that followed.Films, usually awful, cashed in on the success of ""Blair Witch"". Some gems emerged, like ""Utopia Report"", ""Grave Encounters"", and ""The Last Exorcism""; but most were, as stated, awful. Predictable, boring, pointless. And most fan-boy reviewers blame ""The Blair Witch Project"" for these dreadful knock-offs.None of that applies. Thirty years after it's debut the film is still unnerving. It it plays on your primal fears of the dark, being lost, and being followed by something unknown. That makes the film truly frightening. Not a jump scare to be seen.My only issue, and one that has been an issue from the first time I saw it, is Mike tossing the map. It would have played better if the map simply vanished. Making Mike the idiot for thinking it pointless and thus tossing it in the creek really wasn't needed to amp up the discord between the three. In fact, he soon was back in good graces as Josh and Heather continued to fight each other. Had the map simply vanished, it could have been attributed to the witch.While not the very first found footage film it is the best.",The Blair Witch Project

Also most of the script was improvised.Also, the film crew made up the legend of the Blair witch, so in the film, when they ask the town folk about the blair witch (and they are real town folk), they just lie, and say that they have heard of her, and she lives in the woods.",The Blair Witch Project

The best part of the film are the arguments these three assholes have with each other, tension rises as they get even more lost in the woods, you don't even need a witch to make this film unnerving.For its style and techniques the film deserves all kinds of praise, I wont say that this is better than a big budget horror film, but its definitely worthy of recognition for the effort that these independent filmmakers put into the film.Overall, the film may not be for everyone for its lack of real scares and explanation, but I don't think that it needs any more explanation, I think its better to leave it to the audience.",The Blair Witch Project

We never see the antagonists but the suspense is gut-wrenching. The filmmakers seem to be playing on something more significant than petty slasher gore but our imaginations and what we think the attackers are, whether they are supernatural or not. These questions that we come up with add to our own personal sense of fear. The thing that baffles me about this film is how expertly the filmmakers understand the personal responses and fears of the viewer and do not tell us what to think about the villains, but allow us to visualize and expand.",The Blair Witch Project

Unfortunetely this is not anywhere near enough to have a good film, the majority of it has to be good not just the last five minutes. The way they filmed it was very interesting, they didn't tell the actors what to say or what would happen, the actors also did almost all the camera work making it bouncy and confusing which could and has made some films even scarier but in this case just gets annoying. The performances are horrible especially the girl, she is just horrible, and deserved her Razzie and should get a lifetime acheavment award from them because she has been just as bad in all her other stuff.

The movie is about three college students who go in the woods to film a documentary about the famed Blair witch who find out there is something wrong with that wood and they find out a little late for a persons liking. The film builds up to the conclusion extremely well and is the first movie that I have ever been so freaked out that I wanted to close my eyes in ( did not though as wanted to see end). Everone who enjoys watching horror movies will watch this movie and be proud that finally a movie can use its low budgetness to its advantage and still be generally scary.

249,Tcarts76,The Film that launched one of the worst trends in filmmaking,1,29 September 2012,"This is one of the most awful overrated, over touted, and waste of a viewers time ever made. The only credit I give to this movie is that it actually fooled a lot of people into thinking it was a true story and it launched the worst trend ever in the industry now known as the ""Found footage"" movie or what I call it: ""The new excuse to make a really bad movie"" trend.This movie is not scary at all. I felt like a genius when I waited for this to come out on DVD, because as I expected, it was horrible. I do say that at the time it was a genius idea and it was something new. It is one of those ideas that should have just stayed that, an idea.I can't believe people got conned into this crap. The acting was poor, it was basically shot as a home movie. Do you enjoy when your friends break out the family vacation videos? No, I didn't think so. So why do I want to watch a movie that is about the same thing.Was it scary...not even close. I have seen Disney cartoons that are scarier than this. If fact this movie was credited for making movie goers sick because of the bouncing around poor quality photography.If you want to see scary home video's go down to the local Walmart and ask to see their security tapes, they are bound to be more interesting and far more nightmarish then this heap of dung.Like my reviews, Hate em?

250,Aidan McGuinness,Good as a one off experience - but no need to repeat it,6,7 January 2002,"""The Blair Witch Project"" seems to have got itself a love/hate relationship with many people. I'm a bit divided. The premise of the movie is simple enough: Three students go into the woods to make a documentary about the Blair Witch and end up wishing they hadn't.""The Blair Witch Project"" takes the approach that what's scariest is what our imaginations can conjure up (though this is of course a result of it's budget of about $20,000). We never see anything as such - a pile of stones doesn't exactly inspire fear but how they got there is (what's meant to) create the terror. The hounded feel is compounded by the use of the hand held camera to bring us into what Heather & co. are seeing - we never know any more than they do. We're with them until the end.Does any of it work? To an extent. As a one-off-no-lights-on experience it can be eerie for the reasons I've described. The use of unknown actors - who were themselves ""scared"" during filming to add authenticity - helps add to the ""reality"" of this being lost footage. On a second viewing the flaws become apparent - there's no plot for example. That's fine for a one-time viewing but a movie should stand up to repeated viewing. The direction is obviously not really there - they just fling the camera about as they're running around and the ""actors"" are not camera people.
It's hard to judge ""The Blair Witch Project"". Certainly it's different. Different enough to be good is had to say. I'd recommend watching it to judge for yourself but I'd be surprised if many people get much out of watching it for a second time as it'd ruin the taste taken from the first. Overall I'd give it a 6.5/10 (rounded favorably to 7/10 on IMDB's voting poll because I'm a nice guy)",The Blair Witch Project
251,Brogan,This does to camping what JAWS did for swimming.,8,16 June 1999,"1999 is quite a remarkable year for the cinema.  With the comedy genre coming back strong with the brilliant ANALYZE THIS, now the horror genre is back in it's most chilling form with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  It seemed like that the horror genre was going downhill with such recent horror films as ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER,"" ""URBAN LEGEND,"" ""BRIDE OF CHUCKY,"" ""WISHMASTER,"" and the idiotic and trendy ""SCREAM"" movies.  The only recent films that were considered good horror films were ""EVENT HORIZON"" and ""JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES.""  Now,  just like 1978 with John Carpenter's ""HALLOWEEN"" the terror in films is brought back to a new figure.  And sad to say, years from now, everybody is going to be copying this film. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is about three young student film-makers who go to the small town in Maryland formerly called ""Blair.""  In this town they wish to uncover the mystery about the Blair Witch legend.  With interviews with the town locals, they tell stories that range from typical bedtime stories to urban legends.  Then the students wish to go out a seek this mysterous ""graveyard"" where some of these burials occur.  As they go out into the woods looking for this graveyard, they begin to get deeper and deeper into a horrible and scary world that they never knew that they would be getting into. This is what I call a SCARY movie.  It makes SCREAM and SCREAM 2 look like a Disney movie.  What makes it scary?  We can all relate to what these filmmakers are going through.  1.) Being lost:  we all get lost, and when we get lost, we get paranoid, confused, and scared.  These people getting lost in the woods can only cause them to not concentrate as much as they should. 2.) The scary noises in the dark:  when we go outside at night, and you hear scary noises that make you wonder what that was. This film has plenty of those, enough to have your heart racing. 3.) Being the outsiders:  these people don't know their way around, they don't know the people or the forrest that well. With this, they are like fish out of water which can also cause confusion.  4.) The terror that lurks:  these people know that there is terror that lurks in the dark with them, and from time to time there will be some very terrifying and scary surprises. This is a horror film with no music soundtrack!  There's no suspense music, no gory make-up, no silly looking person wearing a hockey mask.  This is the kind of terror that is among us.  The kind we think about when we are alone. This is without a doubt one of the best movies of 1999! This is going to be placed among Independent Film Hall of Fame along with PULP FICTION, CITIZEN RUTH, BOUND,  TRAINSPOTTING, and LOCK STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS.  This is a excellent movie, and like the last movie that did this (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) it makes you feel like that you are lost among these unfortunate souls.  Writer/Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have a successful hit on their hands.  They will more than likely be writing and directing some more movies for big studios in the future.  And don't be surprised that the stars will be making television appearances just to alert the pubilc that this is a fictional movie.  Or is it?  A terrfying masterpiece! ***** (out of *****)",The Blair Witch Project

254,PCC0921,Embrace the screaming. You'll enjoy it more.,9,12 October 2020,"With the popularity of video, slowly pushing its simulated, grubby mitts into films' domain in the 1980s and 1990s, it became clear that one day an actual use for video, in a movie, would finally arise. By the time this film came out, video, for all its cheap, easy uses, was still, for all practical purposes, a consumer medium. Good only for home movies and cheap television, it probably will never possess the color, glamour, tangibility and reality that film has to offer. My rule is to never use video in movies, unless it calls for video to be a part of the story and what we have here is a prime example.The voyeuristic property of a video camera running around the woods, in the darkness, is gold. The Blair Witch Project is an amazing ""film"". It immediately establishes its right to be on video. We know from the start that this is a film/video crew searching for answers to the myth of the Blair Witch in southern Maryland. We are also immediately taken away by the prospects of watching this ""film"" unfold through a video or film camera. The acting is top notch, especially since the actors had to pass this off as being a documentary-type film however, 20 years later (repeat viewings), you can see the ""acting"" seeping out, especially with the two fishing guys in the beginning.There was a lot of complaining back in 1999, when this film made its debut. The complaints about the main star, Heather Donahue, was that she was too annoying in her acting and it made it hard to enjoy the film. No! No! No! That is what makes the film great. If she isn't annoying, it doesn't jack up the shock and excitement more. If she isn't screaming and yelling than it sounds acted out, rehearsed and not what the film-makers wanted, which is realism. True, if I was being chased by a witch, I would drop the camera, run and not look back, but the need to keep the cameras rolling, no matter what, helped increase the determination expressed by the characters throughout the film and helps to increase the scene's shock and terror. This is great voyeuristic terror.9.0 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB",The Blair Witch Project

There is a character when they are still interviewing people about the Blair Witch who comes out holding the bible and seems to know a lot more than anyone else who they did not take into account enough, they just thought she was a weirdo. I like how with such a low budget you can have such wonderful results. The film gets more and more and more intense as we go along.

The audiences of today don't want to get involved in horror films, they don't want to think, it's sad but true!

Shot with video cameras on a minuscule budget, the film is about an asinine trio of film students who decide to go into the woods and make a documentary about the myth of the Blair Witch. Led by the bossy and foul-mouthed Heather (who seems to use the 'F' word in every sentence) along with her two geeky-type male associates, they get lost and are stalked by an unseen witch/spirit/whatever it is, notice the word unseen, we never see anything only sets of twigs made into a strange symbol and the tent moving, and we hear lots of strange noises at night. At first the amateurish camera style works but soon becomes tiresome as the trio constantly bicker. The ending is also unsatisfactory. The film has broke box office records and good luck to it, but when you have seen it you feel letdown. There was howls of derision at the cinema when I saw it, and that was from a lot of people.

Instead of feeling scared with the characters I was laughing (with most everyone else) at them.And don't look for a satisfying ending.  Without giving it away, all I can say is that it is really the only ending that fits the style and story.

Of course some movies have tried to use the hand-held camera technique but that feels more like style choise, here it's feels essential.

262,andy-227,"The scariest film I have ever seen, or probably ever will see!",10,27 July 1999,"First off, anyone who says this movie is okay, bad, or ""just plain sucked"", obviously is full of shit or needs serious psychiatric help!  This film may not be the most memorable horror film ever made, but it doesn't have to be memorable to be scary.  ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dracula"" were memorable, yes. But were those motherf*****s scary?  I don't think so.  I am delighted that I have seen this film, yet at the same time, enraged at the negative criticism people have wrote at the IMDB!   Do you guys think you could make a better or scarier movie?  I'll believe it when I see it.  Anyway, on with my review of ""The Blair Witch Project"".I honestly can't remember a time in my life where a film managed to scare me this deep into submission.  What makes this film so scary?  Well, for one thing, it's VERY realistic.  As a matter of fact, the actors truly suffered. They were deprived of food, as well as the knowledge of the fact that the directors themselves, were making the ""Blair Witch"" noises at night.  They were fooled, and the result was the capture of authentic reactions of fear on camera.  The next stroke of genius was the camerawork.  What you are seeing is supposed to be the unearthed footage of the doomed filmmakers. So, instead of paying for a cinematographer, why not give the actors the cameras.  It's their story.  They're the ones who shot the footage that was found.  Sure the camerawork is shaky.  But it's real, nonetheless.  Also, this was the first horror film I've seen that could scare you to death, without the aid of gore, special effects, music, or even a monster.  If you are deaf, or hard of hearing, then you won't be scared by ""The Blair Witch Project"" whatsoever.  You never see the ""Blair Witch"", but you can hear it. There are moments in the film, where the lenscap is on, or it's just too dark to see anything, yet you can still hear, loud and clear, what is transpiring.  I cannot describe the sounds heard by the three filmmakers. The first one is merely some twigs breaking, but the other ones are combinations of moaning and babies crying.  Whatever it was, it managed to speed up my heart rate!  Scarier still, there is little doubt in my mind that these events couldn't really happen!  I think that is the heart of the nightmare, that it could happen to you!  I've always been scared of woods, and I could've sworn on my last camping trip, that I heard something walking around outside my tent.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" brings out that phobia of darkness and the woods out of every person that sees it.  Even before I saw this film, I was scared to walk around outside my cottage at night(which is out in the country).  Does this fear worsen?  Unfortunately for the squeamish, yes!  It builds up to an unbelievable climax until something hits the camera, and complete silence fills the woods.  It's inconclusive, which is again, aiding the fright factor, because it makes you think and wonder, what did you just witness, and what happened to the three missing filmmakers?  It's a terrifying ending, and it's one I'll never forget!  I've had nightmares similar to this.  Everybody does at one point in their lives. The directors knew that.  They also knew that this kind of buildup of fear would give ""The Blair Witch Project"" it's life.  You are not going to get anything else from this film.  Not message, not euphoria, not sadness, nothing!  Just a hardcore scare, that never leaves you! NEVER!",The Blair Witch Project
263,FKDZ,Eerily real.,8,8 August 2021,"I finally got to watching this cult classic. Though, not so much cult anymore as pretty much everyone has seen it by now.I got to say, it holds up. It takes you back in time a bit and that's something to get used to. Because the characters feel so real and modern, I had to remind myself they don't have phones with a GPS in 1999 and physical maps were still a thing.What this film does incredibly well is create a real sense of dynamic between the characters and making the world feel real. Aside from some oddities like the blue goo which I wish they left out, everything else feels real. I could see why people loved this in 99'.It is a dramatic tension thriller that once it gets started, doesn't let up. I can't get enough of the characters and performances, they carried this entire premise and dragged you into this movie. The sound design (important) is good, no fake sounds used for what I can tell so that helps a lot. It's all just practical.The documentary/handy cam style directing is a essential part of making it all work. It adds to the claustrophobia and paranoia that this movie will evoke.The ending was a bit lackluster for me but I don't really know what else I'd expected. Perhaps a bit more scare. Regarding it being scary or not, its more so anxiety inducing. Not scary visually or anything.8/10 Still holds up!",The Blair Witch Project
264,LanceBrave,A Perfectly Plausible Urban Legend,7,27 March 2014,"Upon release in 1999, ""The Blair Witch Project"" was immediately declared a horror classic. The film was a huge sleeper hit and remains one of the highest grossing independent films to this day. Much of the film's box office success can be contributed to its brilliant marketing campaign. Through a then innovative website (which, charmingly, remains up and mostly unchanged to this day), the studio convinced countless people that the film was genuine. That the footage of three college students entering the woods, attempting to make a documentary about a local legend, and mysteriously disappearing, was the real deal. I wasn't fooled at the time, recognizing it as the clever marketing ploy it was, but many of my middle school classmates were. After the hype wore off, a backlash quickly kicked in, many derisively describing ""The Blair Witch Project"" as ""eighty minutes of jerks wandering around the woods."" Nearly fifteen years later, after hundreds of found footage films have followed in its wake, how does the film hold up? That the film managed to fool so many is a testament to the believable mythology it builds up over its brief run time. The legend of the Blair Witch is surprisingly detailed. The metafictional device is furthered by setting the story in a real town, Burkittsville, Maryland. Though completely invented, the Blair Witch seems like a perfectly plausible urban legend. Numerous missing children over the years are connected to the story. In the forties, a serial killer blamed his murders on the witch. The three filmmakers visit a local nut, Mary Brown, who claims to have encountered the witch. In the early scenes, local people from the town are interviewed, each giving their own opinion and stories on the legend. We are shown Coffin Rock and its gory story is related to us. In practice, the Blair Witch isn't any different then the Bell Witch, Mothman, the Bunnyman or any other real life urban legends.The success of ""The Blair Witch Project"" is built mostly on the unsettling atmosphere it generates. The film begins with white-on-black title card, letting us know that the three kids don't make it out of the woods. This information lends many of the early scenes a quiet unease. Even when Heather, Josh, and Mike are goofing off, we know dark times lay ahead for them. The movie takes the woods setting a long way. Though frequently parodied in the years since, the scenes of the three kids running blind through the dark woods, listening for strange noises, still have the power to chill. These scenes are low-tech, relying on nothing but the real fears of the viewers and the actor's terrified performances.What engineered horror elements ""The Blair Witch Project"" does have are equally subtle. Throughout the film, the campers make strange discoveries. First, they find strange piles of rocks outside their tents. Infamously, they come upon bizarre stick figures hanging in the trees. One of the highlights of the movie is, after Josh's disappearance, Heather discovers a bundle of sticks filled with bloody bits of flesh. Donahue's panicked performance really sells that moment.The common complaint of ""jerks lost in the woods"" certainly does hold some water. Long scenes in the middle section are composed of the characters wandering around, yelling at each other. While it certainly adds to the film's tone of desperation and a few moments, such as a revelation concerning some downed logs, prove effective. However, this part of the movie goes on for far too long. As short as it is, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is truthfully a little long and probably would have been best served as an hour long short.The ending makes up for a lot though. The survivors stumble into a strange house in the middle of the forest. The ending is notorious and well known. It's also incredibly stark. The viewer is left with no answers, the mystery maintained. First time viewers might not even catch why Josh is facing the wall in the basement, a reference to the earlier legend. The effect is intensely creepy, the found footage illusion maintained until the end credits roll.""Blair Witch"" was a true pop culture phenomenon and that's honestly sort of surprising. I'd never expect a film as low-key or divisive to resonate with so many people. Maybe the internet campaign really caught everyone's attention, even those who knew the movie was fiction. The movie spawned a television special, several books, comics, collectible figures, a much-contested sequel, even a series of computer games. Yet its biggest influence was on the horror genre. It took about another decade for found footage to really catch on, hundreds of copy cats following in the wake of the wildly successful ""Paranormal Activity"" series. Every notable title in the sub-genre to come, from ""Cloverfield"" to the ""Marble Hornets"" web series, owes something to ""The Blair Witch Project.""",The Blair Witch Project

After going back and reading dozens of them, I realize that many people were unfortunately victims of the hype. By that I don't mean they went to a movie that wasn't worthy of their hard-earned money, but rather they went expecting something other than what the movie delivered.I think the critics loved it so much because it was fresh, unique, original, riveting, well-acted, and because they hadn't been told ahead of time that it was the scariest movie of all time. And, by the way, it isn't.However, if you enter the theater with the only idea that you are going to accept the premise for what it is and go along for the ride and don't expect a Hollywood ending (which would be impossible anyway if it were truly a real story), then you will be more than entertained. I was and so was my wife.I wouldn't call it scary, but I would call it creepy - very creepy. And, it leaves you with some questions that you want to be left with. I mean it would take another hour or more to have answers. The idea is that a film made by dead kids in the forest is found. Do you think they had time to wrap up a perfect ending just immediately before they were killed???? I don't think so.As to the jerky camera movements. All I can say is that I get sea sick on the water as well as queasy when I view surround video.

The characterizations are well-judged, with the initial hubris of Heather's leadership providing the perfect springboard for the tensions that explode as their situation worsens - I didn't detect many false notes in it.

All we can see throughout the whole movie were the three main actors, with spooky sounds and jerky footage of the 'scary' surroundings. While I admit that the thought of being caught alone by yourselves lost in the middle of some scary forest is scary, the film could do a bit better by maybe slipping in some footage of 'scary' objects like a fleeting glimpse of a white shawl floating or something. And the jerkiness of the movie gave me (and my friends)an immense headache and nausea during the 2nd half of the show, that didn't subside until about half hour after the show ended.

Result: I simply hated this film.OK, there are no special effects, but it isn't a reason to bore us. The directors expected to put the audience as a 'fourth character' but they couldn't come even close to this. Only the 'actors' were scared. Telling the true: Snow White's witch stepmom is much scarier than the little Blair witch, who doesn't frighten even a child afraid of monsters from outer space.Everytime I expected the night to come in the film, but nothing happened and the morning always came again.And the end?

Mildly entertaining at times, but also kind of boring on the whole.Goes without saying that it's poorly-made, but that's to be expected from an independent film. Didn't really bother me anyway. ""Cloverfield"" was MUCH worse in that respect.One good thing about it, was the fact that it's somewhat refreshing (if you compared it to your typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood slashers).It was more or less suspenseful, I thought. I didn't find it one bit scary, but the suspense WAS present. There wasn't any gore or violence, which I appreciate. No cheap/stereotypical scares, either.Another good thing, is what it wasn't predictable (unlike most Hollywood movies in this genre). You're not sure what's going to happen next and it keeps you watching. The movie kind of drags, but you're curious, which keeps you from falling asleep.The acting was half-decent, but the girl was TERRIBLY annoying. She doesn't shut up for one second, and her obnoxious voice rings in your ears several hours after the movie has ended. Also, she over-acts (kind of like Sandra Bullock -- very annoying).I think calling it a ""masterpiece"", as some people have, is a huge overstatement. It's very far from being a masterpiece, but it's definitely worth watching. There are LOTS of high-budget movies that are not half as good as this one.",The Blair Witch Project

That's what makes it so great.This is the perfect proof that you can really create some scary sh*t even without special effects, or clever camera work, or hideous monsters.
Three students go deep in the woods to make a documentary about the myth of the Blair Witch. They disappeared... and the footage was found a year later. The movie is actually a documentary-style presentation of what the kids have filmed during their quest.So... everything's filmed on 16 mm, with cameras held by the actors. First, they interview some people in the village next to the forest the Witch is supposed to be in. And then they go deep in the forest. Only to get lost.
So. There are NO effects. No monsters. No witches, or killings, or horrifying images. There are 2 handy cams, held by the actors, and nothing else.Still, throughout the whole movie, your heart beats like crazy.
What makes this so scary? Maybe just the fact that it DOESN'T have effects. So it all looks real. Or the documentary-style. The noises in the night. Their discoveries. When they get lost, the forest looks haunting. And - honestly - whenever there was night, I kept hoping dawn will kick in soon.

Instead of being innovative, it gave me the feeling of going back to the roots of horror with stories, not by Lovecraft, but Algernon Blackwood (""The Wendigo"") or Arthur Machen, who could convey this sense of unseen terror and dangerous landscapes. The idea seemed reminescent of the ""dogma"" movies and a series of mock-documentaries made by the French/German TV channel Arte, all showing false documentaries about abnormal events presented as the real thing - but giving the trick in the end to question the viewer's gullibility. (But the filmmakers of BWP can't have seen it, of course.) And the movie ? I thought the end was a bit of a let-down, but as a suspense story, it was quite gripping. Why all the hype ?

283,hoernkeem,"The Blair Witch Project (1999, Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sanchez) Original, tense, scary film launched a lot of copycats and a lot of haters, but give credit where it is due!",9,4 May 2021,"This is one of those seminal films and while it is not a film that I will sit and watch over and over again I do think it is one of the best and most original horror films ever. It is a good counterpoint to another scary movie, ""The Sixth Sense"", which was also released in 1999. That film is so meticulously composed and crafted whereas 'Blair Witch' is meant to look rough, raw and grainy. While not the first ""found footage"" style film this is really at the top of the list and entered into public consciousness with a bullet. It seems commonplace to disparage or downplay this film, and that is fine but I feel that is akin to a haters gonna hate type of mentality. If you give in a little bit and buy what they are selling here it is incredibly innovative and clever as well as scary without really doing a lot to be scary.The first thing you have to remember is the derivation of this film. You have to go back to 1999 and remember the time. It is always tricky because you should not have to do a lot of research in order to enjoy a film and you don't have to for this, but I believe a solid understanding does enhance the viewing. The internet in 1999 was not what it is today but it was ramping up and this was one of the first movies to take advantage of that. In every aspect this movie has the look and feel of a real thing which is purposeful to try and enhance the tension and scare factor. It means more if you are out there really believing this is found camera footage. There was a website generated dedicated to the Blair Witch and more than a few at the time thought that this film was in some way a legit documentary thus when released it exploded on the scene in part due to the supposed true nature of the film. This is, however, a produced film from start to finish utilizing a gimmick to the utmost effect. Produced for under a million dollars it grossed over $250 million becoming one of the most successful independent films ever.We start with the statement that three students went missing in the Maryland woods while working on a documentary about a local witch legend. A year later their footage is found and we watch that footage play out on screen. It starts innocuous enough with three college aged kids Ty, Heather and Mike heading out on a hike, interviewing some citizens, and filming pertinent locations regarding the legend of the Blair Witch. A key revelation is a story from a local regarding a hermit who killed kids because of the witch. He killed them in pairs and made one stand in the corner while he killed the other. They continue and find some small cairns built in the woods, and then steadily and more progressively things get scarier for the three. At first they just seem to be lost, but then they start hearing things and no matter what they cannot find their way out of the woods. They hear twigs snapping at night, and voices. At one point they return to their camp to find their belongs all torn apart and rifled through. One of the three goes missing and a torn part of his shirt is discovered with bloody bits in it. Eventually the two remaining hear their companion's screams and run to find him stumbling upon a house in the woods. They split up to search and when Heather reaches the basement she sees her remaining companion standing in the corner and you have a revelatory moment of what is happening right before an unseen entity attacks Heather, the camera drops, the footage ends and the credits roll. It is a brilliant ending to a very stark, simple, yet effective movie.I feel a good percentage of people take an inordinate amount of pleasure in trashing this movie, but I think a lot of that stems from a generation that has seen this all done before and the novelty has lost its luster. If, however, you view this film from a more pure perspective and buy in to the novelty they are proposing it works on just about every level. The found footage doesn't feel forced. The three leads feel like real people going through this and not actors. The chronology does a good job of steadily escalating the tension and upping the ante which allows it to be scary without anything really that scary in it. Kind of like any novelty schtick I don't want to see a new genre spring up based on found footage scares but due to being the O. G. of this style of film 'The Blair Witch Project' stands up as a great example of this style of film while being incredibly canny from a business perspective and deserving of being labeled one of the best horror films of all time.Eric's Grade: A-",The Blair Witch Project

There were a couple of things that really kind of negated the whole thing for me.   The characters behaved increasingly more stupidly and illogically as the movie ran on (not TOO different from any other horror/slasher film, eh?).  And I know it's supposed to me a mock documentary but let me ask you this:  If you're awakened in the dead of the night out in the forest and scared totally witless, would you REALLY take the time and bother to pick up a video camera and film yourself as you're running away???  NO!!  You're terrified!!  Forget the camera!!  You'd just take off running like your very life depended on it!!  I'm not normally one to sit and actively poke holes into a story like this, but that fact just bugged me.  Maybe it's because of all the hype and people (even big-time critics) falling all over themselves and calling this a new classic...well, I don't buy it!

287,ScottAmundsen,Real Terror on a Shoestring Budget,10,24 October 2010,"Alfred Hitchcock may well have been the first filmmaker to demonstrate (with 1960's PSYCHO) that one could make a truly scary horror film for very little money and without throwing a lot of special effects at the screen. Few directors have learned the lesson Hitchcock taught; Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING is perhaps the best example.THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, a true original, takes the lessons of PSYCHO and milks them for all they are worth. Writer/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, showing a real grasp of the concept that less is more, put virtually nothing on the screen and yet in the process scared the hell out of audiences all across the country, myself included.By now, probably the whole world knows the plot: three college students disappeared in the woods surrounding a town called Blair while doing a documentary film about the legend of the Blair Witch. Their film was discovered, though they were never found. What follows is a jerky, often repetitive, deliberately amateurish-looking film, made completely with hand-held cameras, which documents the three kids' adventure in the woods.Woods are scary places by nature. After all, how many of the fairy tales that we heard as kids involved getting lost in the woods? Which is exactly what happens to Our Three Heroes.The genius of this film, and the thing that connects it most strongly to Wise's THE HAUNTING, is that almost nothing is actually shown on the screen, and what little is, is either in the corner of the shot, or the camera moves away before the mind can take in what it has seen. Like Wise and Hitchcock, the filmmakers here created a work of perfect audience manipulation. The camera work, which with its jerks and tilts threatens to make one seasick, adds to a feeling that everything is off balance.The three young actors deliver serviceable performances. That is to say, they are perfect for this film. It does not demand greatness; in fact, the cheesiness of the production values and the okay-but-not-great acting in a way add to the impact of this film.I went to see this when it first came out. I went alone. It left me with a case of the creeps that took me weeks to shake. There were moments during the film when I realized I was absolutely terrified yet nothing was actually going on on the screen. I cannot explain the visceral reaction that this movie invokes; it has to be experienced.TBWP will be on my top ten list of great horror movies for a long time to come.",The Blair Witch Project

As far as the movie goes, I watched it with little prior knowledge and while it was definitely a slow and shakily shot it managed to ratchet up the fear and intensity with simple but effective methods and annoying though fitting acting. Each night they spent in the forest added to the tension as you wondered what they would encounter next. The abrupt and frightening ending was suitable for a found footage film and it left me with a fear of people quietly facing walls without responding haha.
So, however you feel about it, you can't deny that its left its mark on the horror movie landscape.",The Blair Witch Project
289,cofemug,"Great movie, not for the weak-stomached",9,8 August 1999,"I really liked this movie even though it made me sick to my stomach.  No, it is not from the gore.  It was from the camera work.  Do not see this movie is you are easily susceptible to motion sickness.  I don't know if Dramamine will work but it sure could not hurt.  The camera work makes you think that you are walking and running with the people, but you are standing still, so you get sick.  Trust me, this actually happens.I have heard, however, that if you rent it the effect will not happen. However, the movie itself was great.  It was kind of creepy and it had an overall real effect, plus the ending just kicks.Plot:  Three kids making a documentery dissappear, and then their footage is found.  Basically you watch their documentary.  The movie is, although I have heard that it resembles The Last Broadcast, which I have not seen, is unlike any other movie I have ever seen.  It feels like a documentary.  If you become creeped out, just think that it is only a movie. 
Acting:  Resembled the actual downfall of human thinking.  It was superb and realistic.  You actually feel that the people are reacting to what is around them.  You will know these people and what makes them tick by the end of the movie.  It will feel like they are your friends.  In fact, their personalities are quite common.This movie was a genuinely creepy movie, and I highly recommend it to everyone, with Dramamine.  Or just wait for video.  But, if you can get past it, see it with everyone else at the theater.  You will be shocked with everyone else.  Although not a jumpy movie, it will freak you out of your mind.---------9",The Blair Witch Project
290,Kakueke,Literally vacuous movie,1,19 September 2001,"I have often wondered whether I would have been more frightened if I had seen Silence of the Lambs on a full screen rather than on TV, but in any event I was somewhat scared by it (actually, more like shocked, not really frightened).  And I was frightened by The Exorcist the first time I saw it, but sort of laughed later at some of the scenes, altho I think it was good. But I was not frightened by this idiotic, silly, and literally vacuous movie that I saw on a full screen.One thing I do not like in a movie is for nothing to happen, and this is certainly in spades here. Those who are familiar with Cannibal Holocaust know the camera and no faces (and journey into woods/jungle) were not a new idea, and, still, in that movie that was only a partial effect and you saw most of the characters most of the time (I think faces and bodies -- at least some -- are important for a movie).  Of course, the characters in Blair Witch were such idiots that it is hardly worth knowing them; the men were jerks and the woman was a complaining and screaming (pun intended) loser.  All the interplay between the three was nothing but stupid; it is fitting they lost the map.  And the character development was limited to what we had here?My comment about nothing happening's being an albatross rings particularly true with a ""horror"" film.  If I admit, having not been frightened by the tree etc. events throughout the movie, that I was slightly frightened at the end, so what?  The movie is so bad it not only should have been on no magazine covers, it should never have been made.1 out of 10.",The Blair Witch Project
291,droog-56936,A Reworking Of The Horror Genre,10,25 October 2019,The cultural phenomenon that was The Blair Witch Project cannot be overstated. The found footage era of filmmaking caught hold and became the main way to put forth the horror genre for years. Despite the hundreds of movies that have used this technique only a handful have been any good.The Blair Witch Project succeeds more on what you can't see than what you can. The human terror of darkness is used to full effect here and the actors do such a stellar job of being immersed in the fear of the unknown that it swoops you right along with them. The Blair Witch Project stands as a classic that is still unsettling but also stretched the rules of a genre and how films were made and seen.,The Blair Witch Project
292,Lucabrasisleeps,Frustrating Horror Film,4,2 February 2015,"I don't want to give this a low rating. It is an original film. Yes Cannibal holocaust did this before, but that was a campy fun horror movie. It didn't really seem real in the way this one seems to be. When I watch this movie, I clearly see the characteristics of all its imitators (The Last exorcism, Paranormal activity). But somehow this misses the mark.One of the major issues are the characters. For me, a slow burn horror movie can never work without enjoyable characters. Here what I saw was a bunch of immature people who do the worst things at the worst possible moments (kicking the flag?). Not that it matters though since maybe it was an Evil Dead sort of a situation anyway. But still these are things that maybe not many people would do in that situation. The constant bickering and the arguments drove me nuts. It spoils whatever atmosphere they want to create.Again, the same criticisms of found footage movies apply here as well. While in a movie like Paranormal activity, the cameras can be explained, here it is incomprehensible why such hysterical people would still be able to hold on to cameras even in the worst moments. That doesn't make that much sense. Still I am willing to ignore these things if the movie isn't boring.That is the biggest problem. Apart from the constant shaky cam and arguments, there really isn't much happening in the whole movie. And even when it happens, you can't see much anyway. No, it isn't the old style arty horror movie style, it is a shaky cam style where the camera shakes so much, you can't really see much. The ending is typical of the style. Nothing is visible and everybody dies. I was left unsatisfied by this style. It is funny, I do like other Eduardo Sanchez movies like Lovely molly and Altered.Anyway I am disappointed very much. I can't rate it lower than 4 since it is clearly a unique horror movie but I can't say I enjoyed it.",The Blair Witch Project

Scary, vaguely, but empty afterwards.",2,7 September 2001,"I'm just still wondering why did someone ever believed this story really happened when it's so clear that it is acting! One thing is true, this movie followed the rules that almost every good scary movie does: leave some incidents to the suggestion like the witch's look. There were only two scary parts on the movie: the night when the children's voice are outside the tent and the last part inside the abandoned house. Just that. Wanna be scared skip this one and rent The Haunting. Would you give away 8 bucks to see a shallow home made video camera movie? Think again.2 out of 10",The Blair Witch Project

However, there were many screaming females in the theatre who did believe it all. It left an uneasy feeling in my stomach that lasted throughout the drive home.

295,TheMovieDoctorful,"""You gonna write us a happy ending, Heather?""",10,2 March 2019,"I mentioned in my review of Mandy how some films transcend the boundaries of mere entertainment to become a true experience. The Blair Witch Project is one of those films. It never fails to re-capture the distant feeling of being a child growing up on the American East Coast during Halloween, when one could feel the aura of the supernatural in the air. When one had reason to be afraid to venture off into the woods. It's a film that grabs me by the head, looks me in the eye and says ""Yes. There is still some black magic left in this world."" No Horror movie has ever left me feeling more vulnerable or small than The Blair Witch Project has and it never fails to weave its frightening spell to this day. This is still the only film to ever give me nightmares.The dark allure of The Blair Witch Project begins long before film students Heather, Josh and Mike begin shooting in the demonic Black Hills Woods. Even the casual interviews with friendly town folk have an ominous tone to them. There is an unspoken but widely acknowledged truth to the legend of the Blair Witch and the legacy of Rustin Parr that you can feel from their testimonies; something wicked is afoot in the Black Hills Woods, (""I don't go up there! I believe enough not to go up there!"") but acknowledging that such an evil entity could live in their midst would mean facing their own insignificance and helplessness to its whims. The only one willing to fully accept the terrible truth is the village idiot, Mary Brown. The crew's misunderstanding of town resident's vague responses as being full on denial of the occult evil that haunts Burkittsville will ultimately spell their doom.It says a lot about the performances of these actors that they deceived an entire country into believing they had watched a snuff film. Heather Donahue perfectly embodies the strength, confidence and absent minded genius of her on-screen counterpart. Her enthusiasm and passion for filmmaking are inspiring, even as we watch her ambition, the shadow of her arrogance, become her ultimate undoing. Her screams of horror and cries of hysteria are some of the most chilling and convincing in film history. Joshua Leonard very easily could have just been the annoying stoner type, but his subtle, heightened aggression and descent into madness over the course of the film really helps to benefit the tension that Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez are trying to build with this trio. Mike Williams is deeply sympathetic as perhaps the most emotionally vulnerable member of the team, retaining a sense of innocence and naivety compared to his crew members that constantly had me rooting for him. And Lilith almighty, what a convincing screamer.For a found footage film, the visual direction in The Blair Witch Project is among the best I've ever witnessed. The woods are shot in a way that we never quite get a feel for just how far they span; they could go on from anywhere between 5 and 500 miles. All we have to shape our judgment are the sky and the endless expanse of dying, decaying trees. The 16mm camera and Hi8 camcorder give the film a disturbingly personal and nostalgic feel. The horrifying events that befall the trio of film students could easily be home video tapes of relatives or friends. Because of this, footage like countless stick figures being hung in the trees miles deep into the woods feels far more real, and the off-putting, unnatural and macabre tone of it hits a lot harder. Forget ""putting yourself in the characters shoes"", The Blair Witch Project is perhaps the most interactive Horror movie ever made in terms of generating empathy from its audience through use of visual aesthetic. Shattering of the fourth wall is standard for the found footage genre, but no film has ever done it quite so effectively as this one.Perhaps the greatest aspect of the film is its sound design. Much has been made of the film's focus on what you can't see, so a higher quality of sound design was not just important, but critical, for making The Blair Witch Project work. The sound design in The Blair Witch Project is equal parts unforgettable and nightmarish. From the all-encompassing marching of the Witch around camp to Josh's distant screams. Of course, the ""laughing children"" scene is by far the film's most terrifying and memorable use of sound to create terror, the sheer unnatural and almost perverted nature of it leaving me in an absolute frozen, chilled-to-the bone sense of fear with my mouth agape in shock every time I watch it. The slow buildup from a vague, undefined noise to clear, undeniable laughing is done absolutely wonderful, my mind (And the mind of the characters) becoming less and less capable of chalking things up to merely one's imagination. It's a haunting reminder of all the children whom the Witch has claimed, a kick in the teeth to the film's characters (And the audience, to an extent) of the dark and twisted power of legends and the reality of pure, supernatural and deadly evil. A reminder to the film students that their fate is to be nothing more than another footnote in the Blair Witch's legacy, yet another story to be told around campfires to keep the memory of the Blair Witch alive.The Blair Witch Project is a journey, a seductive nightmare that never fails to captivate, enthrall and horrify me. Not only is it possibly one of the scariest films of all time, it is a massive achievement in film-making in general. A Halloween must watch that never fails to bring in emotions and feelings inside me I thought long dead, The Blair Witch Project is a bone chilling fever dream that speaks directly to my inner child and mortifies him to his core.",The Blair Witch Project

When that moment finally arrives, it's just too vague to come to any conclusions or interpretations.If you're the kind of person who doesn't scare very easily of the dark and weird noises, you'll find Blair Witch interesting, but not quite the stuff that makes you lose your sleep.

302,pekinman,Excruciating... in ALL the wrong ways,4,13 February 2009,"I watched 'The Blair Witch Project' for the first time this evening, almost 10 years after its theatrical release. I've read a lot about this film and many of the commentaries, especially on IMDb, were positive to the point of ecstatic. I wanted to be scared out of my wits, like the original 'Night of the Living Dead' caused me to be. Perhaps this expectation and hope is largely responsible for my deep disappointment. It starts off fairly promisingly with interviews with the locals of the town on the edge of the haunted woods. There is humor and believability in these first minutes, then it all goes down the tube as soon as the three students enter the woods. The last hour of this movie is boring as can be and I found it very difficult to convince myself that these actors were really alone in the woods without some sort of pre-conceived guidance. How else could they have made their way to the house at the end?And the bobbing and lurching cameras caused me to have to take a break in the middle to go lie down and relax my stiff neck. The feeling was very much like being in a small launch in the Gulf of Mexico in a 9 foot swell. The best aspects of this film are the interesting folk art elements scattered around in the woods. Beyond that I give this effort a 4 out of 10 for chuzpah and little else.",The Blair Witch Project
303,basilisksamuk,Fear of twigs and string,1,3 March 2013,"1 THE SCAM Apparently there is a very scary film called ""The Blair Witch Project"". It is famous for the fact that, although it was made very cheaply using hand held video cameras and the like, it is really, really scary. In fact so scary that it is best to make sure you are wearing your brown trousers before entering the cinema. I thought I was going to see this film but my local cinema tricked me by showing a crap film of the same name which was so badly made that no one else would have been fooled by it. Also it was clearly a fake version as it had zero scares in it. In fact it wasn't a horror film at all but a very bad film made by art students mistaking noise for art who couldn't scare my cat, Xena, who is frightened of anything containing atoms.2 MY THEORY Urban youth in western countries no longer have any initiation rites or rites of passage. Very few of them even go camping anymore and most of them have little experience with things found in the natural world e.g. trees, leaves. Therefore the very idea of spending a night out in the woods fills them with existential dread and they find it easy to identify with the very unpleasant and very whiney stars of this film. Like the characters in the film they are terrified by the sight of a few twigs held together with bits of string or small mounds of rocks. It's sad I know but what other explanation could there be for fear engendered in some viewers of this film? For anyone who has ever spent a night out in the woods it will forever be a mystery why anyone should be prone to fear of twigs and rocks. All we can hope to do is reach out our hearts to those poor young folk living in daily dread of post traumatic twig disorder after seeing this film.3 THE ART OF THE UNSEEN I've always thought that The Haunting (original B&W Robert Wise version) to be the scariest film of all time and will brook no argument. In the proper version of The Haunting the viewer never sees what the horrible thing(s) are that hang out in Hill House but nevertheless the lack of gore and the feverish workings of the viewer's imagination supplied all that was necessary to scare the s**t out of said viewer. Presumably the makers of Blair Witch had the same idea. They failed. Miserably.4 THE ART OF NOISE Another superb feature of The Haunting was the dramatic use of sound to create a feeling of overwhelming terror. Had the Blair Witch makers attempted to engineer the soundtrack and sound effects more professionally I believe they could have turned a deeply s**t movie into one that was at least acceptably a bit prone to cause viewers to worry, a little. They didn't. Instead they opted for making the potentially scary noises inaudible and cranked up the sound of twigs rubbing together until they overpowered everything else on the soundtrack.5 HOW TO COPE WITH SEEING THIS FILM You may or may not be familiar with my dictum that all modern films would benefit from having half an hour cut from their running length. In the case of Blair Witch the film would benefit from having about 75 minutes cut out of its approximately 90 minute running time. In fact, if you are unwise enough to see the entire film you will come out of the cinema convinced that the film ran for at least 17 or 18 hours. In the interests of sanity I advise you to watch until you get to the end of the vox pop scenes and then head smartly for the nearest bar. Have a few good stiff drinks and return to the auditorium to see the last five minutes of the film. This features scenes inside an old house which are accidentally quite good. Then go home and hug a twig.",The Blair Witch Project
304,Rosabel,Creepy but not overwhelmingly scary,7,17 August 1999,"Having read and heard about ""The Blair Witch Project"" before seeing it to some extent spoiled the full impact of this movie on me.  I did not find it particularly frightening, but it was still very disturbing.  Unlike most movies, scary or not, I found myself thinking and talking about it for weeks afterwards. The film has a number of unresolved and unexplained elements to it; while some people find these exasperating, I enjoy revisiting these little puzzles.

Many people went in knowing what was happening, I think it would have been much more better if I went in knowing nothing and then yeah it might have been scary. The people reviewing it were maybe the first to see it, they new nothing about it and it was scary. But since that didn't happen, when I saw it I thought the Blair Witch Project was an average movie. Not really scary when watching it.(nothing scary happened) Overall it would have been a great movie but all the hype wrecked the whole atmosphere. I've heard about Cannibal Holocaust which is meant to be pretty much the same as BWP but it was made in the 70's.

308,KingM21,Great horror.,10,2 September 2005,"I watched The Blair Witch Project again (and the commentary and extras). Was it still a good movie, was it still scary? Absolutely. The characters were strong and realistic and showed real emotions, the setting was perfect and fully used, and the use of sound was awesome. All that made for an incredible atmosphere. At only 77 minutes, the movie moved along at a brisk pace. The shaky footage wasn't that bad at all and some of the shots of the woods are just great. I will admit that some of the power of the film has somewhat diminished over the years (and from watching it at least four times!) but the same can be said of most any scary horror flick. The ending still gave me chills for a good fifteen seconds though. I even rewound it to check something and it creeped me out a second time! BWP is not conventional horror and that's one of the reasons it works so well (but maybe that's the problem for some people too?)it's different, unique. The presentation, backed up with the mythos, is what really makes this movie something special. I've never seen another quite like it. The DVD commentary is decent and goes over the making of the film. The makers discussed the great ideas and techniques used to make the film as realistic as possible. The three trailers were pretty cool toono wonder it was a box-office hit. I also watched Curse of the Blair Witch and Stick and Stones. Sticks and Stones is basically the same as CotBW, only it's edited a bit quicker. These documentaries are informative and compelling and help set up the mood for BWP but I didn't find them particularly scary. All in all, though, I really had a good time revisiting this whole cinematic experience.",The Blair Witch Project
309,blazesnakes9,An Experiment in Terror.,10,4 February 2011,"Opening in 1999, The Blair Witch Project became a hit with critics and audiences. In my point of view, The Blair Witch Project is the most smartest and most frightening movie of all of the horror movies. In October 1994, three students go in the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about the Blair Witch. But, what they don't know is that the Blair Witch is stalking them. Though the movie is filmed completely on a hand-held camera, it does do a good job keeping track of the suspense. The Blair Witch Project also has a ultimate touch on reality and technology. In one of the scenes, one of the students say that reality isn't really real anyway when you see it. That is a very excellent set up of the whole picture. To create the illusion of suspense just by seeing a unknown object that is terrifying and intimidating. The end of the movie is probably the creepiest scene of all. With good acting from the students and good writing, The Blair Witch Project is a good-natured horror movie. Thumbs Up. ★★★★ 4 stars.",The Blair Witch Project
310,Don-102,Cinema Verite Fright...,8,25 October 1999,"Is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT a masterful ghost film or a gimmick to create a multi-media event?  It is both.  The picture, shot on super 8 video and 16mm film displayed in a squared, documentary-like frame, is quirky, annoying, and spectacularly scary.  The scenes at night quite frankly scared the hell out of me.  The gimmick that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is created confusion and wonder over whether or not the footage shot was real life.  Now, we all know the truth, but the French term 'cinema verite' is defined by this grisly film.A guaranteed cult classic, BLAIR WITCH has ""Heather, Mike, and Josh"" heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of Maryland looking for the Blair Witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills.  For most of the film, it is very unclear.  The beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are a) experiencing the supernatural, b) being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople or c) just completely out of their minds.  Its up to the viewer to decide but my money is on option A.Most filmgoers know that the filmmakers Sanchez and Myrick used their MAC cards and cookie jars to put this phenom together and I commend them.  This is a tour-de-force thriller that does indeed seem real.  Its all improvised and 'verite' like and the best part about the movie's many chills are based on the basic premise that scares most of us:  We are generally frightened by what we cannot see.  Many times throughout the film, the screen is completely dark with sudden bursts of screams and grainy scenery.  For the sake of the suspense, the film may have been better if we did not know the gimmick.  The realism is sometimes smothering.True, the hand-held camera can make you achy in the head, but the way the actors play off each other is magic and not for the faint of heart.  I viewed the film on DVD with someone who was not feeling too well because of the dizzying camera, but somehow the black and white and color and rain blend together and allow Myrick and Sanchez to do what they were attempting to do.  Spooking an audience with unseen forces is so effective and I was reminded of Robert Wise's original THE HAUNTING from 1963 with the groans and the cries and the shrieks.  A baby's giggle can be heard during one spellbinding scene when the tent the 3 students sleep in takes on a life of its own.Much has been made about a similar film made in similar fashion by some other young auteurs well before THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was released.  I never saw it and if it was as good as this film we would've seen it. Nonetheless, this past summer shocked and surprised me with the amount of good horror pictures around.  In the woods, no one can hear you scream either.Rating: ***1/2",The Blair Witch Project
311,tresm87,A foreboding and anxiety filled story that ultimately fizzles with a uneventful conclusion.,6,19 August 2018,"5.6/10 This obviously caught the world by storm when it came out due to its fantastic marketing or trolling however you look at it. People thought this was all real footage and these people actually died at the hands of the Blair Witch. As a kid when this came out, this was truly an innovative film that captivated me with its creepy ominous wood setting and the fact i thought it might have been real. I was constantly searching the woods in hopes of finding things similar to in this film and it gave me great imagination in my exploring. However I had always held an almost angry feeling towards it for not actually ever showing the witch in the film. It led us all in this tense frenzy of psychological terror without ever giving us something to see. If they had just shown something in the final house seen or anything throughout it could've easily been a better film. Ive had a love hate relationship with this for a long time and i do appreciate its forboding and ominous setting and use of the documentary style camera work, but i still feel tricked ultimately by the gimmick and tease of the film. But for what it is it works on some levels, and the folklore and backstory of the blair witch is phenomenally well imagined. The new film as Ive said is superior because we finally get to see a visual portrayal of the witch and it was made with a higher budget allowing them to expand vastly on the plotting and effects.

It was un-watched for about 2 weeks then someone spread the rumor that is was a true story of amateur film students who found a real witch. All of a sudden people started watching it.I think it is one of the first movies to become famous via internet. Of course there are a lot of ""film students"" who love the idea of this movie that gives them hope of one day duping the public in the same way and making some money for a crappy film.In reality it was not a true story, because even really stupid people could not do the moronic things these ""educated college students"" did. But it was different, full of amateur acting and amateur shooting, and writing so bad I wonder if a script even existed. The story moved way too slow, and did not have enough clarity to keep you in suspense. But the worst part about this was the filming, the camera hoping up and down is almost enough to make you sea sick.Really what kind of idiots go investigate a ""witch"" with NO GPS, NO real Map or compass. Oh and no phone or emergency radio?...geez.This is one of those rare things like Pet Rocks that gets unexpectedly hyped up, reaches a point that everyone says hey I got to see that. Then they go watch it and say to themselves ""wow that was a waste"" But then they are afraid to say how lousy it was because they will seem un-cool.All I remember is the Hundreds of copies of this movie for sale at $1 each and still nobody buying them.",The Blair Witch Project

Just an hour of people picking up sticks and rocks in a forest and getting lost until someone stares at a wall in the end.

316,Asteri-Atypical,Freshman Film Making 101 (and still only a C+ in that class),1,5 November 2001,"This is one of the scariest movies I've seen.Why?It's scary that so many people thought this movie was everything from ""wonderful"" to ""brilliant"".This is probably the most overrated movie I've ever beheld.  It's somewhat decent for an amateur film festival film done by teenagers.  However there is little ""brilliant"" or even ""original"" about it.  Why it seemed so ground breaking was merely the fact an average student film was put on the big screen.While I enjoy the concept of a horror story being told through the eyes of students, seeing the horror merely on the faces of the actors instead of special effects, shot with hand-cams and in ""raw documentary footage"" format, it was NOT executed well.It is worth noting such a concept is NOT unique to student film festivals. It's only a departure from the ""typical"" Hollywood fare.  It seems some promoter decided to take such a typical student film and promote it in the general cinema market, making it sound like it was something new and innovative.  Sadly, the public bought it.For a student film, this would have been more effective were it a lot shorter.  It dragged.  It would have been a cute short but the idea of making it a feature film is a poor one.  The characters were too sophomoric, pedestrian, foolish and inconsistent to be enjoyed.  They acted foolish and dysfunctional (but not in an interesting way).  One could not relate to what appeared to be them causing their own hysteria from childish bickering and overreaction.  The dialogue was too pedestrian to be enjoyed.  ""Dude, that's like... so not cool"" was typical of the level of dialogue.  Who wants to watch undereducated ""Bill & Ted"" types come unglued?  The whole film would have been much more enjoyable had the characters been more interesting.  If you're going to build a film around the emotions of the characters, please don't make the characters Bill, Ted and Barbie.There was not sufficient fodder for the imagination to evoke scary images. Make the fear either more mysterious or give us more imaginative scenarios. There was enough material to be interesting for perhaps 10 minutes.  After that you need something more than a couple piles of rocks and some twigs.The thing this film had going for it is that it illustrates the rut into which Hollywood has fallen in recent years.  You don't need hundreds of millions to weave a basic tale.  Stories can be told without the effects, sets, big names and music.  Students have to resort to telling tales with what they have instead of falling back on the ""typical"" Hollywood style. The slightest departure from the norm is considered ""innovative"".  Hollywood should learn something here.  It also illustrates the point Hollywood doesn't have very intelligent stories, either, as Blair Witch, as shallow as it was, was able to compete.In summary, if you're familiar with student or amateur film festival works, Blair Witch will give you nothing new.  If you have never seen anything outside of Hollywood, it's good to see something different.  Just don't make the mistake of thinking it's ""good"", however, just because it's ""not typical Hollywood"".  All in all, it's a pretty typical example of ""Freshman Film Making 101"" (but I don't think we have the next Steven Spielberg in the class this semester)",The Blair Witch Project
317,BB-15,"Once It Gets Going, a Powerful Exploration of Fear",5,31 October 1999,"It is amazing when I see an interesting movie like Blair Witch that cost under 50 thousand dollars to make. I say interesting rather than rave about it because there is about half of a very good movie here but the rest I was less impressed with.First the acting in Blair Witch is top notch, absolutely believable. I recently saw Clerks, another successful ultra cheap feature, where some of the characters weren't even acting. Instead they were simply being their strange selves. But Clerks from start to finish has something that Blair Witch does not. It is tightly paced while Blair Witch rambles for the first half hour. It is too slow and some of the townspeople are given too much air time. Now I understand this is supposed to be some quasi student documentary but it does not have to be dull. Once the actors get into the woods, the film begins to hit its stride. My only complaint about the second half hour is the lengthy time spent on reactions to piles of rocks and tied together sticks. The editing here needed to be more crisp. On a positive note the tension between the actors begins to build in a very believable way.The last third of Blair Witch was terrific. The actors slipping into madness, the running into the night is electric and the incredible speech in the tent by Heather Donahue is great. The final crazed moments in the house have a mind bending David Lynch feel, very disturbing. 
Few movies that I have seen are as up and down as Blair Witch. Considering that this is a first film and the limited budget this is understandable. But while the beginning is slow, the wait was worth it. Few films explore the depth of fear as well as Blair Witch.",The Blair Witch Project
318,moviemattb,My absolute favorite of the found footage genre,10,31 October 2014,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is a found footage movie that documents the missing three student filmmakers for disappearing into the woods near at Burkittsville, Maryland as they were shooting a documentary about the Blair Witch as it appears to be a legend. A year later their footage was found. Everyone hated this movie because its not about how shaky the camera was, but how they were extremely disappointed that the movie was not real; they all thought this was for real when they were stuffs about the three missing students, and most of all the Blair Witch that does exist in our world. I understand this movie is not real, but did it need to be? No. It does not need to be real because if it did, then it might as well ended up as a snuff film and that is not good. No one wants to see a movie that happens to be real, where they get lost into the woods and ended up being killed. That is completely stupid! I have never seen a snuff film, and I am not sure if I want to see one. I might as well not want to. I enjoy this movie for what it is! It may look like real footage, but it is not real. With that said, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of the most effective horror movies ever made, and it is not only one of my favorite horror movies but it is my absolute favorite of the found footage genre. I do enjoy other found footage movies such as ""Cloverfield;"" ""Chronicle;"" ""Zero Day;"" and the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies. The majority of the movie works so well to not include any music as it makes it very effective. However, it does appear at the film's end credits where it plays that strange creepy soundtrack that plays with all of this creepy sound as you hear something unusual. Tony Cora did that music piece for the film's credits, I thought he did great job for creating something as what I said previously unusual. The three main actors Heather Donahue; Joshua Leonard; and Michael Williams all do a wonderful job for playing themselves in a fictional way as if they were filmmakers. When I watch this movie, I get a sense of feeling that I was actually with those three and did ending up with them for getting lost into the woods; it almost like virtual reality and you feel like that you are actually there. I give credit for both Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez for writing a great story, and directing for what they had envision it; as well as editing it. To those that hate this movie, I suggest that you should give this movie another shot, and maybe understand the movie better for what it is; also, to those that may have not seen the movie, I say check it out because it feels like an experience. I highly recommend ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and I give it a 10 out of 10.",The Blair Witch Project

The only thing I could think of is that this movie is for younger people who could relate to these people.

324,thelastblogontheleft,"Good, not great",6,12 March 2017,"It might surprise some of you to hear that this was my FIRST TIME seeing The Blair Witch Project. I know, I know. I used to have a problem with movies (or TV shows, or books, or anything else) being TOO POPULAR. When something would come out and everyone was freaking out and raving over it, I would tend to roll my eyes and go the other way. I was only 12 when The Blair Witch Project showed up in theaters, but I remember everyone going nuts for it and that meant I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole. I have since (mostly) gotten over that problem — honestly, it stopped me from getting into a lot of cool things — but for some reason I just never got around to seeing this movie.When this movie first came out in 1999, it blew all expectations out of the water. Shot in 8 days on a $60,000 budget, it went on to gross $248 million in theaters, placing it as the 5th highest earning independent film ever made. The director, Eduardo Sánchez, had set up a website prior to the movie's release to convince interested watchers that it was, in fact, genuine found footage. At its Sundance release, flyers were passed out encouraging anyone with information about the missing three to come forward. The star of the movie, Heather Donahue — whose eyes are burned forever in everyone's minds from that iconic scene — still has people telling her that they thought she was dead. Her mother received sympathy cards after the movie was released. That alone — the whole concept of a hugely viral website combined with a very widely believed myth — is fascinating. It's part of the reason I love found footage style movies so much — the ability to skirt that line between fact and fiction.The basic story is simple: three 20-something film students head into the woods of Burkittsville, Maryland, to make a documentary about the legendary Blair Witch, the ghost of Elly Kedward who was supposedly banished from Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1875. Things quickly start to go very wrong and we watch them run for their lives through the woods until the tragic ending.It has some pretty natural interactions and dialogue, most likely credited to the fact that much of it was ad-libbed throughout the filming process. The three actors didn't know each other before filming but got to spend some pretty intimate days together out in the actual woods of Maryland. Honestly, the bickering between the three of them gets a little old at times, and particularly the two guys' quickness to berate and insult the director, Heather, for what they perceive as her shortcomings (losing the map, not knowing exactly where in the woods they are, etc).Overall, its strength comes from, as I mentioned, its ability to make you, at times, unsure if what you're watching is real or fake. It really makes me wish I HAD seen it in theaters, because I, of course, now know that is was not a real documentary but a huge number of people believed it when it was released, and it would have added a whole ton of suspense and tension to the watching experience if I truly hadn't been sure.But it still has that believable quality from the found footage style, and the fact that we never actually see the thing that we most fear. We have the isolation of being not only deep in the woods but lost AND without a means of outside communication. The breaking down of morale in the group. The mounting evidence that SOMEONE — or someTHING — is following closely behind as they move through the forest. The scene where Heather makes her emotional confession into the camera is brilliant in the sense that it drives home this feeling of desperation, of helplessness. You are on edge for much of the movie because you're simply looking into the darkness to see what's out there.It wasn't the most interesting movie I'd ever seen, and again, not as impressive as I imagine it might have been closer to its release, but credit where credit is due it's a masterfully done movie both in marketing and execution.",The Blair Witch Project

Refreshing, thrilling and innovating as well.  The actors really natural on their roles, the plot is thicken, and the dark atmosphere is awakening. I almost believe that this is a documentary feature. BWP is fit all my expectations about a decent horror movies, things that really rare in the post-Scream horror movies.

The found footage genre is a total mess now, with hundreds of imitations churned out at next to no cost so it's hard to recall just how groundbreaking the BWP was. However its uncompromising ambiguity is its greatest strength and sets it apart from almost everything that has come since. The hopeless downward spiral of each character is incredibly realistic and is really the centrepiece of the film; everything else is left to your imagination and that just made it all the more horrifying.

I agree, and disagree, with many of them.UNLIKE some, I was impressed with the way this flick was handled, the story was intriguing. The three students Josh, Heather and Mike were excellent, I actually sympathized with them and felt their fear at being alone and lost in the forest for 4 nights with unseen evil forces stalking them until... (And I don't normally sympathize with characters in movies!)The concept of relying on your imagination to fill in what nasty surprises the 3 students encountered was great! (For example: the stick figures) This is what real fear is, and that concept is what I enjoyed!! This was by far the BEST and most realistic horror movie I have seen.The comparing of this with stuff like Scream 2, was unfair. The BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is much better than SCREAM 2! It was a great change from seeing the usual blood-splashed horror flicks,  loaded with one cliche after another.
HOWEVER there was a downside, and that was the annoying, jiggling filming. It would've looked better if it were 'professionally' filmed, rather than done in this style. It can still look grainy like the film WAS found a year later without looking like it had been filmed by 3 year olds... (sorry!) It didn't really add authenticity even though it tried to... We had a lot of scenes which were unnecessary. It was very frustrating sitting there while the students were running around panicking, camera pointing at ground, tree, sky, ground, etc etc etcCONCLUSION: Ah, ha!

331,Michael Kenmore,An idiotic exercise in independent filmmaking,1,23 October 1999,"Man...this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I have never seen the movie as bad as the 80s Z-grade movies I watched on USA Up All Night. I'd rather sit through Guccione's integrated version of Calibula than endure this nauseatingly mindless trash again. The Blair Witch Project is the epitome of the independent filmmaking method that gleefully indulges in the four-letter word to cover up the fact that whenever the dialogues and ideas fizzle out, there always come the obligatory obscene and vulgar language in practically every line of dialogue to make up for the lack of substance and quality. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with the level of profanity as long as the movie is interesting and balanced. But this movie went so far as to get on my nerves and made me so angry I wanted to unleash the fury on the videotape as soon as it ejects from the VCR after the movie ends.The reason why BWP was made is simple: two amateur filmmakers kicked around the idea, recruited the young people and loaned them with the cameras to go into the woods to make a psychologically scary movie. The result is a mind-numbingly tedious exercise in self-indulgence and bad attitude all the way. This is the reason why I found the movie less scary and more irritating. Heather was so gratingly annoying I wanted to kill her onscreen. I literally had to beg for Joshua and Michael to die quickly and painlessly because they holler and scream and cuss at each other ALL THE TIME after the first half hour. At least they deserve the fateful death in the movie, but the fact that never cease to amaze me is that the so-called actors who relies on improvision comprising mostly of ""J***s C****t! F**k! S**t!"" are still alive and kicking. What astounds me is that this overblown, overhyped and overrated film made big bucks at the B.O. and the filmmakers are laughing all the way to the bank. I hope and pray that they (and the filmmaking duo and the Artisan execs) will never work in Hollywood again because of this travesty that undermines the importance of reasonable quality and instills the repetitive use of the F-word and the abuse of the Lord's (whoever the Lord is, depending on your view and belief) name legitimate to make the product even more compelling.

Some people I know were bored out of their minds and sickened by the camera work. Others, like me, lost sleep. For weeks. And, while I dislike branding an entire species, I still honestly feel that those who despise this film have no idea what imagination really is or are far too weaned on slasher garbage. Because this is the most terrifying thing I've ever seen, and because it accomplishes this by revealing absolutely nothing. You all know it backwards, of course. Let me just add that even the disagreeable elements, like Heather's annoying as hell character, came through as utterly real. Too bad that nothing good followed this because the BWP was as devastating a masterwork as you're ever gonna get for about 30K. Or a lot more. PS What was fun was asking cynical friends who trashed it, Well, what would YOU have done? One guy told me he would've simply started running. Nobody else had any suggestions at all.

But what i got was a boring, headache-inducing, unscary piece of crap. It takes an hour into the only 86 minute film for anything the least bit interesting to happen. The constantly shaking camera gave me a huge head-ache. There was nothing really scary about it. A couple of noises and the three idiots going around in circles is not scary. Speaking of the three idiots, the acting was weak and all they did was scream at each other and the darkness.

344,dalton2,Just pure morbidity is what keeps us watching this,6,31 October 1999,"This is an amateur film. It's simple. It's just like a documentary. When we watch this ""film"", we feel a strange morbid curiosity on what's appearing on the screen, very similar to a voyeur's curiosity. I knew it was a fiction, but I tried to believe it was real (that's what it was supposedly made for, wasn't it?). Once I found myself believing what I was watching, I entered into the atmosphere, and this is what I found: morbidity, just that. Ah, and lots of boring minutes of footage, which will scare us only if we think that they are real footage images, where everything could happen as they are real.All in all, this is my conclusion: This isn't a horror movie, the same way that porno movies aren't erotic films. I could call this a ""hardcore horror film"", and I find this idea pretty disturbing. I can't imagine what kind of films are to come in this line but with higher budgets.

After all the hype, the good press, and the other reviews available, I really wanted for this film to somehow profoundly affect me, either by scaring the living crud out of me, or to give something to me that no other film has been able to do in the past.This film, sadly, does not deliver.There is absolutely nothing that distinguishes this film from any other horror genre fare.  There's some tension, that's well produced as you hope to discover what it is that's going on, but in the end that's all there is--tension.This could have been so much better.  For all the hype, this SHOULD have been so much better.  As an avid moviegoer perhaps I'm jaded, but I just do not see what the big deal is with The Blair Witch Project.  When reviewing a movie for the IMDB, I have the duty to make an accurate assessment, sometimes I have to take a bit longer to come to my senses and resist the urge to issue forth praise that is unwarranted (in my opinion). Most of the positive feedback this film has garnered is just that: unwarranted priase.Anyone truly scared by this film has either a weak constitution or has never seen some of the truly great films of the horror genre.  To those people, I suggest (strongly) that you hit the local video store more often.

346,GuyCC,More of a terror experience than a movie.,8,4 August 1999,"Instead of giving a ""this movie is a must see, go see it now"" kind of review, I'm just going to give a brief overview of what seeing this movie was like for me:The opening scenes and the first few days of their documentary: The filmmakers are typical 20-somethings.  ""My friends and I act a lot like this"", I thought to myself.  Right down to how I videotape everything and annoy my friends by doing so.  The search for Blair Witch landmarks had an ""everyday"" feeling to any camping trip.The filmmakers get lost: I can't say I've ever been lost in the woods, but I could relate to the frustration of walking in circles trying to find a way out of a place.  The filmmakers' sarcasm and anger with each other seemed natural for the situation.The night incidents: Every night was worse than the one before, and the point where the filmmakers ran from the tent with Heather trying to understand what was out there was a tense moment.  I felt a very uneasy feeling during the scene because I couldn't see what was out there, but I knew something was.*SPOILER ALERT FOR THE NEXT PARAGRAPH*Josh disappears: When Heather and Mike wake up and see that Josh isn't there anymore, I knew that something happened, but what and when and how?  I couldn't tell.  That was the worst part of the situation.  The witch's ""gifts"" about Josh's fate were unnerving.  Mike and Heather were now realizing that they were part of a game now and were being hunted down.
Heather's close-up: I understood with Heather's apology to the parents of three filmmakers that that she, as well as I, knew that their time was short and the game was almost over.  This is the shot that represents so much of the ""Blair Witch"" images that you see, and is one of the most saddening moments because of its finality.The final scenes: I refuse to give anything away, but during those last few moments, I felt my heart start really pumping in my chest and chills go through my body.  I was open-mouthed with nervousness and shock until the credits rolled.  A powerful, terrifying ending scene.At home: After the movie, I went home.  I went outside to look for my dog. I have a small patch of wooded area in my backyard.  In calling my dog, and going into my backyard, my stomach knotted tightly with apprehension.  I almost left ""Sparky"" outside.  It's only a movie, isn't it?This isn't a standard horror movie by any means.  There isn't a hockey-masked, knived hand lunatic waiting in the shadows, accompanied by scary music to build up to the moment.  This is the boogeyman.  This is the creature under your bed.  This is the campfire story.  This is the thing that goes bump in the night.  The creature is never seen, but imagination makes the creature more terrifying than any special effects person could generate. Forget practically every horror movie you've seen.  If you want to be scared on a pure primal level, see this.  This movie deserves every bit of recognition and credit it gets, and while I'm not looking forward to the countless string of rip-offs that with try to capitalize on its success (It happened to ""Scream""), this is the original, and this is the one to remember.  There's no climatic Hollywood showdown.  The trio finds themselves in something that is way over their heads, and the supernatural leads them to their fate.  Anyone who doesn't see this, is denying themselves an amazing film experience, but the reviews are true.  This is truly a frightening film.... but on a different kind of level.",The Blair Witch Project

348,paulo20,A Tale of Three Idiots or Why TBWP doesn't work...,3,11 August 1999,"...at least for me. [WARNING: POST CONTAINS SPOILERS]First, to be fair, I thought the three actors (Heather, Josh and Mike playing Heather, Josh and Mike) did well with what they had to work with (i.e. next to nothing); I honestly think they did the best they could. Yeah, they were grating with their constant bitching and cussing and whining, but they had to make up this s**t as they went along (and they only got $1000 bucks each), so I can't really find fault there.  I also thought that the film did well in building up suspense... ...unfortunately, that's part of the reason the film doesn't work, because it doesn't pay off.  I kept something really terrifying, but the film just didn't deliver.  But more on that later...The first and foremost reason why BWP doesn't work is that three students CONTINUED TO FILM TILL THE END.  I mean, this should tip off anyone who might have thought this was real that it was,in fact,not real; at all.  It shatters even the illusion of reality, and the characters' attempts to explain their continued filming don't hold water for me.  No rational person would film running scared in the night or alleged bits of Josh or while fearing they are lost.Which brings up the next reason why BWP fails: how could they possibly get lost in the first place?  Like they themselves said, the woods aren't that big.  They just walk in a straight line and eventually they'll get out. Yet they manage to walk around in circles.  Does the film explain this?  Not at all.  We can only vaguely infer (and it's a long shot) that the ""witch"" is making them lose directions.  But there's never any strong indication of this, unless those stick figures and rock piles are supposed to mean something.  Plus they had that compass!  Are we supposed to guess that maybe the witch threw their compass off?  That seems, to me, to be a heck of a lot to ask from the viewers.  So, anyway, the trio come round full circle to find that they've come upon the same log they'd already crossed over a creek(and they sure seem to cross a lot of them in this picture) in their southbound quest to get the heck out of the woods, which is in itself odd since you'd think they'd have recrossed it at some point and had some sense that they'd flipped directions.  But the main thing is why not follow that damn creek out of the stupid woods?  When Mike in a fit of semi-demented glee confesses he kicked that useless map (previously thought lost) into the creek, he unknowingly provided the clue to another ticket out of there. But, unfortunately, the three students are too unBELIEVABLY stupid to pick up on this (I have to believe that they are monumentally stupid, else I can't buy this at all).  But I willingly overlook this in the hopes of some big scary payoff at the end.Which brings me to the third reason why The Blair Witch Project is nothing more than a house of cards.  That payoff never comes.  It just doesn't happen.  What we get is a shot of Mike in the corner taking a leak, or at least it looks that way.  All that expectation I had building up got quickly deflated.  What's that about imagination?  I'm supposed to use my imagination?  Come up with my own vision of the witch?  Pfah, any schmoe can do that.  Let's see, she's supposed to be this hairy ghost woman whose feet never touch the ground and in the middle of the night, she snags Josh in the middle of the night.  Ooohh scary... but... what if it's not a witch.  I most certainly did NOT see a witch.  Not so much as one nose-wart.  Did you see a witch?  Then how the heck do you or I know it's a damned witch? What if it's aliens, who stake out the place, to observe the locals and notice three idiots stumbling about in the woods and decide to kidnap them for study or their own amusement.  Hey!  Maybe it was those aliens who screwed with their compass and made the poor fools lose their way.  Stupid?  Damn straight!  But the filmmakers have left such gaping holes for the audience (the AUDIENCE!) to fill that I or anyone else can come up with some crazy BS to fill in those huge blanks.  And no one can tell me I'm wrong because there is nothing to say that's so.  NOTHING.  If witches, why not aliens? Why not faeries from the magical land of Narnia?  Hey, didn't you say to use my imagination?  And I could go on, but man would it ever get stupid, but as it stands I'm left unsatisfied with the movie's conclusion.Some good examples of leaving the imagination to the viewer?  How about Jaws.  Steven Spielberg knew the power of not showing the shark.  We hardly see it, but we know it's there, because we've seen the damage it's done. Or take the Excorcist.  Sure we see that a little girl doing all those ghastly things.  But we never see the demon that possesses her, but we can only imagine what it would like if we could see it and it would no doubt scare the p**s out of us.  Because we have something solid, something strongly visual on which to base our fears.  That little packet that Heather found? What the hell was that?  Looked like it could have been teeth and possibly a tongue, but it also could have bits of porcelain and a chicken gizzard (and very well could have been).  It raises tension, but doesn't truly raise any hairs.  It tells me almost nothing.  It doesn't stack up against mangled corpses and little girls with heads that spin 360° .  What you can't see has to be balanced with something you can, and BWP simply doesn't provide enough.One last word on the theory that what you don't see is scarier that what you do.  I'm reminded of a story I read somewhere:  Some guy enters a graveyard to rob a grave or something.  When he tries to leave, however, he finds something has grabbed his coat.  In a superstitious frenzy, thinking the resident of the grave he just robbed has snagged his coat, he struggles to get free, never bothering to turn around.  He ultimately dies of fright. Turns out what's snagged his coat is a sword stuck in the ground.> Sometimes, that noise you hear in the night is some insect or bird, or maybe the wind flapping the shutters,10 or your cat screwing around in the basement.  Sometimes what you don't see turns out to be a sword stuck point down in the ground.  And sometimes what we do turns out to be some psycho trying to stick that sword between your ribs.Well, that's it.  I've said my piece.  You can say I'm talking BS and send me e-mail illustrating the point, but I doubt very much if you can convince me to fear the sham that is The Blair Witch Project.",The Blair Witch Project

Very few films prior had utilized the first-person-shooter aspect and I can think of no other film that successfully delivers the scare factor without any gore or ever showing any villains.I guess what it comes down to is which Horror camp you're in.

351,darin-wissbaum,Just follow the river will you...,8,3 March 2010,"By now I would think most people would know the story of the Blair Witch Project....But here is my take. This film has spawned several so called copies since its release in 1999. Examples would be, ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Paranormal Entity."" These films were in my opinion not as good as The Blair Witch, which was an original idea the time it was released. 3 young filmmakers, Jennifer, Mike and Josh go into the woods in Marlyland to shot a Documentary on the legend of the The Blair Witch. What happens is they come across an old cemetery and by accident knock over one of the grave stones. This lets loose the the Ghost of the witch. The three filmmakers then become lost and are haunted as they try to find their way out of the woods....ghostly sounds of children laughing and the sounds of footsteps around their tent terify them as they desperately try to find their way out. Despite all that is happening someone always seems to find time to film what is going on which leads to a lot of camera shake but this gives it realism and makes it truly scary.It was said earlier in the film that the place the 3 were going to make the documentary was up in the hills around Burkittsville, Maryland. As the filmmakers got lost you see a river in several shots and you wonder since water flows to its lowest point why not just follow the river down till you are out? This never seems to dawn on the filmmakers. Of course that would have ended the film...in any case this is still very good....",The Blair Witch Project
352,matlefebvre20,It works because it's real,9,28 July 2006,"The horror film market is probably one of the most popular these days in cinema. The main reason is that today's moviegoers and people in general always want to get more and more thrills and experiences that makes adrenaline climbing. Well, you might say that it's not really new, but others things are changing in today's film industry.I'd say that moviegoers aren't really sensitive to whether the movie is good or not, because they simply want the thrills. That's the reason why ridiculous horror/slasher films are created, such as ""Final Destination"" (and its sequels), ""Child's Play"" (and its sequels), and so on.However, major exceptions still exist and ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of them. ""Blair Witch"" is far from being an ordinary horror B-movie, or any parody of any genre. It's simply a pseudo-documentary about three film students who want to shoot their own documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch, but they inadvertently become the subject of a movie that they never wanted to shoot.The main reason that ""Blair Witch"" succeeds is because of its terrifying reality. The 'actors' aren't from Hollywood and they always seem to be playing the game during the 70 minutes that we see them. Heather, Josh and Michael are fairly convincing and not only in their scares. Yeah, the scary moments are the main part of the film and it's always great, but the interesting parts don't begin there. Just before they leave to the woods, we clearly see that they're real human beings. They have their own pre-shooting rituals (Heather drinks scotch because she's the director) and they have their own jokes, which do we might admit, are typical of people of their age.And when they notice that they 'lost' themselves, their reaction, their anger and their frustration don't leave any doubt about their sincerity. It's clearly evident when you see Josh fights Michael, because he let go the map and when Heather angers with Michael while she's taping, causing the image to muddle and shake.The way that this movie is shot is perhaps the most fascinating aspect of it. It's not in 35mm like in most of today's movies. It's shot alternatively between Hi-8 video and 16mm, which make the scenes even more real. We never see any of the events entirely from an external point of view, because we either switch from one of the students to another. This shooting process makes the movie even scarier and there's no let-down 'till the abrupt final scenes (before it switches to today's footage).Also a thumbs-up for the sound effects. Sometimes, we don't even see anything (because the camera light is off) and we're still scared, simply because of the sounds we hear. And that's maybe what's the scariest: the sounds. Just hearing the characters crying and shaking, the external cries of unknown people outside the tent and the sounds of the mysterious person who follow them in the night make the viewer shake as well.Hollywood filmmakers should learn a lesson here. When independent filmmakers shoot a $35,000-budget project that becomes a $150-million hit, there's definitely something to learn. It's not the budget that counts, it's the substance. Just do something that works and the moviegoers will come. And that's what ""Blair Witch"" producers understood. And it's the reason why it became one of the best horror films of the late 20th century. Along with ""The Shining"", ""Blair Witch"" is one of my all-time favorites.",The Blair Witch Project

354,darkjosh,Groundbreaking horror film that was done-in by overhyping,9,31 October 2000,"The Blair Witch Project is an inventive, often genuinely terrifying, and overall very effective documentary-like horror film about a group of student filmmakers who venture into the woods to explore the legend of the Blair Witch, which tells the story of a witch who lured children into her home and killed them.So, how does Blair Witch, a film with a very meager budget and a cast of three unknowns succeed in delivering a scarefest? It very skillfully uses the documentary feel, its amateur camerawork, and its sense of reality to plunge the viewer into its deep, dank woods.  The audience doesn't feel as if they're watching another contrived slasher flick that's been churned out by some Hollywood gore factory to bring in profits: instead, what we feel is genuineness, reality, and uncertainty as the three students' sanity unravels in the depths of the unknown.Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Mike Williams all do exceptional jobs of showing their terror onscreen, especially during the nightly ritualistic assaults around their campground.  Donahue, however, is the best of the group, and her final apology certainly makes chills run up and down your spine when she breathes, ""I'm scared to close my eyes. I'm scared to open them.""  Blair Witch accomplishes a feat that has become almost extinct in horror films: it makes us care about its characters and also offers some truly terrifying moments. When first released, there was so much hype regarding the fact that it was extremely unnerving and very scary - appetites whetted, audiences were expecting to see something totally mind-blowing, utterly terrifying, and completely overwhelming, but ultimately familiar horror film. They weren't prepared to never see any onscreen presence of evil, and when the film came to a close, many complained about its abruptness and what they viewed as an ultimately eventless, ""boring"" movie.Blair Witch, however, is a thoroughly original, effective psychological mind trip that plays on the greatest fear we all have: the fear of the unknown. With little gore and no onscreen presence of the 'monster', we feel more of The Blair Witch Project than we watch it.9 out of 10",The Blair Witch Project
355,Phantasm01,Must be seen with your mind's eye,10,9 August 2006,"To all of those folks out there that walked out of the theater wanting their money back because they didn't see a witch or blood or people being torn limb from limb, WAKE UP! In order for this movie to terrify you, you have to have an alert and productive mind. Remember Psycho? Did you actually see the lady in shower get stabbed? Did you see buckets of blood? Of course not but it scared you just the same.The Blair Witch Project used the same tactics. Three people wander off to get film on a legend that they've heard. The town of Burketsville had an unusually high death rate of young children for a time. After interviwing some of the locals, the film crew decides to venture into the woods to find the shack that the so-called Blair Witch was using. The crew gets lost and has to spend the night in the woods where something appears to be following them. Trying to descibe this film any further than that just wouldn't be helpful to you at this time. It is a story that reveals itself in the visual, not just auditorially.What could be scarier than being lost in the woods at night? The scariest things you can imagine are in your own mind. That's why kids are afraid of the dark. Their minds are young, fertile and active. They don't even know what they're afraid of, they just are. This film uses that same principle.Our minds have become lazy from having everything being presented to it on a silver platter. No time to think, just keep feeding it images so it doesn't have to do any work on it's own! I don't think I've ever seen a more frightening movie and I've seen them all. I love horror and I'm always fascinated by the many different ways that Hollywood comes up with to scare us.

356,poem,Realism - in a degree never seen before,9,2 December 1999,"Hard to say anything about this. Is it good ? Is it bad ? I don't know. I just know that I've sat during the movie nearly without any move, with full concentration, without thinking about anything else but the movie, what will happen next. It was so realistic. Is reality good or bad ? Does any of the ordinary categories for movies matter if its real, and not only a game ?This movie focuses enormously, nay in an ideal way, on the character development. There is no sudden change, no compression of the emotions, like normally in movies. Everything happens in a way and speed normal emotions of real people would develop. If the characters had changed very much, there had been a pause of some hours where they didn't used the camera. I repeat myself, everything here looks totally real. I've never seen that in this degree in a movie before. And I'm wondering why I've never missed that in all these comedies and tragedies and maladies (french: illnesses) I've seen before. So often I've called a movie ""realistic"" before, not knowing that it wasn't realistic at all, compared with this reference.This is not a horror movie. Read it again: this is not a horror movie. One could say much about the properties of all horror movies I've seen before, brutal, idiotic, boring, or sometimes funny, and some classical movies (such as Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)) even brilliant - but they where never, never realistic. I often cursed inside when I saw how illogical people behave in ordinary horror movies. Not here. No way. So at least if you're a fan of horror movies, you are not at all guaranteed to like this one, for its so different.The screen picture is often of very bad quality, especially in the night. Is this a fault or an advantage ? Of course, this is also realistic; the ears gets more informations what's happening than the eye in the night.  So what should I say ? Who could enjoy this movie ? I've no clue. I guess that many horror fans might even hate it. Everyone might hate it. But everyone might also love it. I've no clue, except that I think (I'm not finally sure!) I myself liked it.Will there ever be a movie like this so successful ? I think so. It has very big faults, but also big strengths, and I think its strength are the more important ones. Again, I'm not sure. I don't know if I've seen a revolution or a bad joke of a movie.",The Blair Witch Project

The plot of the movie itself interested me so much that I decided to watch it. The movie is about three young documentary makers who venture into the deadly woods in search of a local legend called ""The Blair Witch"". Before the start of the movie, a note appears which asserts to the viewer that the 3 students have disappeared in the woods and after one year, their video footage is received which is the movie itself.Since the entire movie is like an amateur video footage, it gives us a feel of the friendly videos we sometimes take with our friends with no camera focus, angles, lighting etc. The actors too had to be at their natural best, and they succeed in just playing ""lost"" rather than acting. Hence all expressions of anger, frustration, fear etc look very much real rather than made up. The ending of the movie is like a half-baked cake, it does not fully satisfy the viewer.

Its like watching three mice looking for the cheese at the end of a maze. If these three truly believe that there is an old hairy witch out to kill them wouldn't the obvious decision be to go after her? I mean there are 3 of you. Those are pretty good odds. Oh I forgot these three lack the intelligence of normal adults and so do anyone that enjoyed this joke of a movie. Give me 50 bucks and a video camera, I'll make you a movie that at least makes sense.",The Blair Witch Project

362,RunningFromSatan,The Blair Witch Project: horror that makes you think!,8,1 August 1999,"This movie has been hyped up as the scariest movie ever made.  Well, I wouldn't say scariest movie ever, but it was truly terrifying.  Yeah, the movie kind of dragged a little in the middle listening to the 3 filmmakers bicker, but the ending scene was very terrifying.  But, I liked this movie in a way because it made you think.  There wasn't a scantly-clad babysitter getting slashed and gutted on screen, but 3 filmmakers lost in the woods getting terrified by things that go bump in the night.  It's not what you see that scares you, but what's implied.  Also, it's very intelligent.  You need to pay attention to the interviews with the townsfolk and relate them to happenings in the movie.Also, I must warn you that if you get motion sickness fairly easily, take precaution because the camera is almost nonstop shakiness and I felt kind of nauseous by the end.If I had to pick between 1. horribly horrific scariness or 2. queasy, nauseous, I-think-I'm-gonna-barf scariness, I would pick the second.  Very scary and gut-wrenching, because my imagination made things way more horrible than ever.I won't be camping for a while, and my sister played a mean trick on me when she made that little stick-figure logo out of straw and stuck it in my bed while I was sleeping.

Its well put together, the plot is a very good one, the whole thing flows well, and Heather Donahue in particular shines. This became an instant favorite for me. I like the way the whole thing is handled. The scene sequences and how they're done work particularly well. The movie comes off in a very natural way. Its exactly what I would expect to happen if that sort of thing happened. Which makes its believable while you're into it. These folks set a standard here. Now no budget is no excuse for no quality.

After all these years, I still have trouble walking through the woods at night because of this movie. Even during daytime, thinking about this movie in the middle of the woods makes my heart beat faster. But does that make the movie any good?One of the positive things I can say about The Blair Witch Project is that it doesn't rely on jump scares, meaningless gore or silly characters like Freddy Krueger or Jason. It shows that it's possible to scare people without cheap tricks. There's also no unnecessary nudity, or any graphic sex scenes in it (the language is bad, though).The worst thing about the movie is that it's meaningless. We're just watching a bunch of people get lost in the woods, where they are finally killed off by something supernatural. We're not left with any hope when the incredibly scary credits roll.I guess the movie could serve as a terrifying warning against playing with the occult or paganism, but I can't really recommend it. There are better horror movies you could watch, like ""Whistle and I'll Come to You"" from 1968. Or even better; read the original story by M.R. James.",The Blair Witch Project

371,VikiLauda,"The birth of ""Found Footage""",6,12 March 2021,"It hardly needs saying that ""The Blair Witch Project"" sparked a flurry of ""found footage"" movies in the first part of the 2000's, some were good, some just ok & others were appallingly bad. TBW project itself is not a brilliant film but it should be called the pioneer of the genre which then became a household name.
Set in October 1994, it tells the story of a small team of three young investigators who are making a documentary on ""The Blair Witch"" legend in the woods of Maryland. On entering the woods they chat to two fishermen who tell the story of ""Coffin Rock"" where alleged human sacrifices were made which they film & chat about as they start to make camp for the night. The next day they continue into the woods, but tempers get freyed as they start to realise they are in fact lost...
This film actually works if you consider it to be an experimentle art house movie, because it is certainly not a mainstream horror movie. In fact horror fans like me will be appalled at the lack of horror in BWP as almost all the suspence is suggestive. Also be prepared for a film that is non scripted & contains annoying repeated phrase words, very bad camera work (pehaps this goes with the type of film this is) & unproffessional acting. This movie is unpolished, because it is supposed to be, as it's amature in it's conception. The main character, Heather is really annoying, as well as being loud, brash & bossy which makes her unrelatable & left me feeling sorry for the other two guys, who are both nastily hen-pecked. So much so I think they scarpered just to get away from Heathers whining!
Well for a movie that spawned a whole new genre in horror/suspence, you would be expecting it to be rated higher, but I think a 6 is fair. If you understand the genre, it is watchable, but mainstream horror fans should avoid this, as they will find it without substance & shallow. There are no special effects, no sound track & no visable antagonist. The BWP is simply a raw, bare bones movie making expierence, with s creepy romp in the woods as a back drop. It is also a short movie which I feel will keep people from being bored. It has minimal bad language, no nudity, no gore (beyond a blob of something) & no agenda, which I think is suitable for age 14 plus.",The Blair Witch Project
372,cinemel,"Eerie, but not very scary tale",1,10 August 1999,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is not the scariest movie. It isn't even scary. It is a bit eerie. However, it is so crudely filmed ($100,000 budget) to reflect its feeling as a student documentary film, that it works against itself. So much of the screen time is devoted to a black screen or shots of grass and trees shot with hand-held cameras, that it is just annoying. The most atmospheric thing about the film is the soundtrack composed of dialog and weird sound effects. The hype around the film's origins and promotion on the Internet is just that, hype. The movie just doesn't have much entertainment value. It is just a curiosity, and audiences are flocking to it just for that reason. I suspect they will be as disappointed as I was. The writers/directors, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, gave the gist of each day's shooting to the three actors who use their own names for their characters. They then just took the two cameras, one 16mm black & white and an RCA video camera, and improvised the dialog and action to fit the generalized plot of the day. The actors should be given screenplay credit. Their performances are natural and in its final sequence amazingly real. All of the film's creators will probably go on to more expensive productions in the near future. Possibly then their creativity and talent will be more fully realized.",The Blair Witch Project

For example, ""The Last Night at The Alamo,"" is probably the best example of the truly independent low budget film.""The Blair Witch Project,"" was certainly hyped and received a vast audience bored with Hollywood's crackerjack horror output. This movie certainly is different. Still though, it lacks what good film needs. Namely, the basics. Story, plot, character development, intrigue, and a slew of other basics are glossed over or are simply missing. To be fair though, these elements were not attempted, at least traditionally.This film most reminds me of George Lucas' original ""THX-1138"" (not the one with Duvall). It has a studentesque quality about it. I am left wondering what could be done with a remake. Of course, there will be one, but the cat is already out of the bag. Originality will be missing in the next installment.As cultural phenomenon, I can only guess at its success. The characters speak in a pseudo cool youth speak, in which the F word is noun, adjective, and verb,often in the same paragraph. Well, that may be fine if you live in the vernacular.  However, my own experience lends me to believe that only Eddie Murphy has met that task (i.e. ""Life"").While I can't recommend this film, I will admit that my skin did tingle on occasion.

375,el_monty_BCN,I wish I hadn't known,7,5 November 1999,"When Blair Witch was released in Europe, it was inevitable to go to see it with a high level of curiosity and expectations, given all the rave reviews and incredible box office numbers it got in the States. Unfortunately, one of the things we were hearing about it was not correct: that it was a horror movie.Because I don't think it is, or at least that it doesn't respond to the perceived conventions of that genre. Blair Witch IS a superb exercise of growing tension, suspense and anguish, with an increasingly oppressive atmosphere which gradually grips you and drags you into the nightmare that these three kids, normal people like you and me, suddenly find themselves in. You know as little as they do, and you don't need any more, because your imagination does the rest. And your perception of the film gets even better the more you think and reflect upon what you have seen. I was entirely satisfied. But this is undoubtedly an arthouse film, and it seems to me that many people had misguidedly gone to see it expecting a slick, popcorn-friendly, Kevin-Williamsonish scare-fest with lots of surprise shocks and a blood-drenched grand finale. Which it certainly is not. Therefore, I can understand why so many complain about it having disappointed them so much.For me, only one thing could have made it better: having been able to see it without knowing it was fake, like the first people who saw it in the States did. When I came out of the cinema, a couple of ladies behind me, who had somehow managed to avoid all the hype and press coverage, were asking with worried faces ""...but did they ever find the bodies?"".

376,eibon04,Unmemorable Movie,1,10 March 2000,"The makers of The Blair Witch Project have done a good job at pulling the wool over people's eyes making them think that this is actually good.  Just because a film was made for little money does not make it a great movie(it's not how much you spend but how much you put into a film).  This movie is inconclusive when judging the directors abilities as one horror movie hit does not make a great director.  I believe that the two directors have to do more films before passing judgement on how good they how.  I think it is silly to compare them with the likes of Wes Craven, John Carpenter, Tod Browning, and other great directors of horror films as The Blair Witch Project might be the only decent movie that they will ever make.One problem I have with the movie is there is nothing to remember.  There are no scenes or lines that stand out and make people remember it for.  The movie was like a one and a half hour whale watch trip(the experience was similar to attending a whale watch as a person starts to feel sick).  What I hate about this movie was that it seemed that the directors did not any artistic vision and this is the main problem of the film as I feel that nothing emotionlly was put into it(a bad thing is when two people direct as they have different styles while one director would use a style that the crew can get familar with).  BWP is not a scary movie and anyone who says so is not a real horror movie fan who've seen real horror films but mostly Johnny come latelys.  The success of this film worldwide proves that the human being are becoming more dumber and idiotic and that no one has any taste for great art anymore(we have mostly tase for art of mediocrity).

My first thought was: ""oh my god this is a fuc***g disgrace"". But last night it was on again and a friend said to me it was probably the most frightening thing of the 20th century. So i decided to watch it again.So i started watching it again. The first time i watched this is got up to the part where they see all the stick people hanging about. This time i watched it all the way through. And i loved it. Once it gets up to the bit with the stick people it starts to get scary. Like wheezing noises or children laughing in the middle of the night. When they lose one of their friends in th forest and find some of his shirt and blood things become really scary. The running about the house at the end is the scariest part right up until it's abrupt and disturbing ending.Although some people will be annoyed that you don't see the witch it seems more menacing if you don't. The good thing about TBWP is that it builds up until the abrupt end.",The Blair Witch Project
380,Denver53,"Not scary, but interesting",5,30 December 1999,"I'm beginning to believe there is a dividing line between those who liked TBWP and those who didn't that is often based on age. The post-25-year-olds seem to, for the most part, view the film as so-so and not scary. Many of the under-25 viewers like it very much and find it innovative and terrifying.I'm over 25, so you can guess where I fall on that continuum. Blair Witch was interesting primarily as a study of three people freaking out, not as a horror movie. Much has been written about the low budget and primitive technique. Yes, it is primitive, and that adds a certain mystique. It is like watching old home movies. It's so bad it is interesting to see how the filmakers will get a story across with so little apparent ability to do so. But to me, that isn't a point of contention. The quality of the film technique is what it is.The story itself is basic. Three young film students set out to do a documentary about a ghost legend. You don't learn much about the students beforehand, and they have little depth. Most of what you learn comes from watching the group dynamics of the threesome as their situation gets worse and each individual starts to break down. From that perspective, TBWP was interesting. It also gets very annoying, as they begin to yell at each other and become irrational over what appears to be simply noises in the woods and some related odd goings on.The lack of reasonable behavior by the threesome is what ultimately turned me off. I'll avoid giving away too much here, but will state a two examples:1. When the students become lost and lose the map, they show very little ability to reason out an escape route based on the direction of the creek and the position (east - west) of the sun. If they had a map before, and saw the creek on it, and then find the creek, how hard can it be to follow the creek in a direction that gets them to safety? Can't they remember what was on the map, at least the basics?2. The film lost all believability when the filmakers, especially the female star, continued to shoot video of what were supposed to be horrifying and sudden developments. I could see taping *after* the developments, when a little time had passed for the students to adjust. But *during*? I don't know about you, but if I find bloody remains the last thing I am doing as I find them is filming, and zooming in and out on them while also screaming my head off. That was the problem. How could a person be calm enough to film something frightening, while at the same time screaming and generally losing it in fear? It is hard to believe that one person is doing both simultaneously. And every time that happened, I remembered I was watching a movie, and these people weren't real, and anything that happened wasn't scary. I suppose if the camera were a small, helmet-mounted unit that taped automatically it would have worked better. But just a little.In the end, The Blair Witch Project was interesting but certainly not worth the hype. I wonder how many people have homemade ""story"" videos in their tape collections that include plots of the same quality? Probably a lot.",The Blair Witch Project

382,alexcomputerkid,We know we are going to get good horror films in the years to come but The Blair Witch Project will always be beside those at the top,10,4 November 2013,"""In October 1994, three film student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary...."" ""A year later their footage was found"" This great quote in short tells the details of the Blair Witch plot. It is a plot that like most horror films can be questioned. How can the woods be the only setting? What is the purpose to this? Could it really work with only three cast members? Taking this all together, still The Blair Witch Project is something we could never have experienced or predicted what it was going to be.By using a small budget of only $20,000 to $25,000 aside from the opening shots, The Blair Witch Project is set only in the woods. The setting of the woods helps this film break the norm for horror movies. The woods here have a strange eerie feel, and is very original. You have the feeling along with characters of never getting out and no doubt it will you make at wilderness quite differently.With the small budget, the film only needs three cast members. Heather (Heather Donahue) is the only girl of the group and really emerges as the leader as they try to get out of the woods. Mike (Michael Williams) is a character who becomes very creepy once the harmful effects in the woods prey on him. Josh (Joshua Leonard) is the quiet member of the group in this bad situation. The cast really works due to the good acting by actors who are unknowns who we don't recognize making it realistic.After a plot and story that seems like it can't get much better, the ending is one that REALLY can't much better. The ending comes out of nowhere as again it is in the woods and in a place that seems like it's in the middle of nowhere. It is a heart-pounding and very scary ending. The final shot is very clever as there are different possible theories raised about what just happened. This is one of the best endings in movie history, no doubt.The Blair Witch Project is not normal horror. It is horror that goes way above the normal common ground and makes it's own mark on the movie world. We know we are going to get good horror films in the years to come but The Blair Witch Project will always be beside those at the top.",The Blair Witch Project
383,punctate,A Cult Hit,10,10 August 1999,The Blair Witch Project is the latest cult film that claims to be the found footage of three missing filmmakers. Heather is making a documentary about the Blair Witch working with her is Josh and Mike. One the first day they go around interviewing people in the town. The next day it was off to the woods to shoot the documentary. The characters work well with each other at first. As time goes by the characters begin to argue when strange things are sighted like the piles of rocks. On the way back they don't seem to know quite where their heading. At night they are hearing weird sounds some of which sound like feet. This happens every night and each day the characters begin to breakdown. The scary thing about the movie is the fact at night we hear sounds but see nothing. The movie successfully keeps your heart pounding especially during the moments where the characters are panicking. The feel of the movie is real very real and that's what's also scary about it. The camera technology is cheap and that gives the film it's real life look. A great movie with a frightening ending. I give this movie 5/5. A very scary movie that is definitely worth checking out. Don't Go Into The Woods.,The Blair Witch Project

385,KillerLord,Intelligently Done Movie That Gives You Decent Goosebumps!,8,10 October 2008,"The movie ""Blair Witch Project"" is a remarkably well done movie. Now, I am slightly confused with my own statement here. Because, there is not much done in this movie. I shall elaborate on what I mean a bit later on. But let me briefly summarize that this movie is indeed a scary movie that does give you the scares and the goosebumps that one expects from a scary movie. But the beautiful part of this movie is that it does not give you typical ghosts, ghouls and monsters as found in this movie. It taps on the fact that you are more afraid of the unknown rather the known. And this is the greatest strength of the movie.The movie is about a collection of tapes. The movie starts out by stating that three kids had gone into a certain forest searching for what is simply known as the Blair Witch. They have never seen her but almost everybody has heard about her. The movie says that the kids were never found but their tapes were found and all we are shown in the movie is the tape recording of the adventure the kids went on. The movie does not have a cameraman. It is all recorded by the three kids who are the only major cast in this movie. Other people appear for only 2 or 3 minutes at the very beginning of the movie.There is a certain rumor surrounding this movie that it is real. Many people believe that the tapes are authentic. I recommend you read the detailed and elaborate article on www.wikipedia.org which clearly explains the methods adopted by the producers of this movie to advertise this movie. The producers actually placed advertisements reporting the three lead actors as missing. This has led many people to believe and also spread the rumor that Blair Witch project is real. Well, it is not. The movie's strength is that it shows you fear. The lead characters are scared of their experiences and fear shines on them. But if you have read about the movie in detail, you very well know that the fear on the characters' faces is genuine. They did go to the forest and instead of making them act, the director actually decided to scare them and thus the fear you see on their faces is genuine. So, for the genuine emotions of fear, frustration and tension you see on the characters, I'd prefer giving credit to the director. After all, he made the decision of making half of their experiences seem real to them. I don't know if it is a cruel way of making a movie but it works. The audience is scared and the movie is meant to do that. The most scary thing about the movie to me was the stick figures they find in the forest. This really heightens the overall tension in the movie. The characters have lost their way in the forest and are doing the balancing act between consoling each other and also taking out their anger on each other. Each blames the other for their state of misery. We get to see genuine anger, frustration, fear and eventual terror in this movie. A very ""well done"" movie indeed. Highly recommended for watching especially in the dark and preferably alone!",The Blair Witch Project
386,Primtime,Highly Overrated,5,12 August 1999,"With The Blair Witch Project, I have read and heard many an overrated reviews. This film simply isn't all that amazing. Rather than what others say about being shocked at the last ten minutes of the film or being scared throughout, it just doesn't ring true. What really got me was the fact so many people still sat in their chairs after the film was over. Someone was even crying. I haven't seen that kind of reaction to a film since ""Saving Private Ryan."" Even Eyes Wide Shut, which is a much better film had no one staying afterwards.One can talk of the raw emotion that this film conveys to the viewer. I have a problem with this though. Not enough of the film is seen on camera. During the late night scenes in which someone or something is moving around the tent, we never get to see the looks on the faces of the actors. A lot of emotion is heard, especially during the last quarter of the film, but since I couldn't see it happening, it all seemed rather phony to me.The fact that this film will in time become the most profitable of all time just goes to how much impact hype really has. There hasn't been a person who I talked to about this film that doesn't want to see it.

This film is definitely a rental.5/10 stars.",The Blair Witch Project
387,azeemnavarro,More than just marketing,9,14 August 2019,"We know how this movie came to theaters: with (maybe) the best marketing campaign of all time. An internet website, the directors listing the actors as missing, create a local legend... that's some of the tactics used to make viewers think that this movie was real. Because that, some people thought that what they saw on Blair Witch was real (sorry, I love the marketing for this, but that's not really intelligent). And that's also thanks to the found footage technique they implemented to make the film. This type of filmmaking wasn't really new, we have films like Cannibal Holocaust, Guinea Pig, The Last Broadcast...and though some of them made some noise, Blair Witch was the one that, for better or for worse, popularized the 'sub-genre'.
Now, what is Blair Witch about? Is about three not-so-likable student filmmakers that go on to woods to make a documentary about a legend know as the Blair Witch. And that, is the perfect setting for a movie of this type. With a budget so low, what we get is just scenes of mad people lost in the forest, trying to get out of there. And because of that, the movie has some pacing issues, and audiences that like to consume the McDonald's equivalent of horror movies, will hate this.
Our three main guys do a excelent job conducting the story, more if you consider some of the reactions are real or are improv. The way the movies was made, with the actors throwed in the woods with some provisions and directions of what to do and filmed, is very clever, the night scenes are amazing because of that, the actors were actually frightened, and you can tell that. And that ending, is very powerful, it's one of my favorites from any horror film.
Yes, Blair Witch is an example of how you shold promote your film, but if you actually look at the film, you will realize this is a masterful take on the mockumentary genre. Recommended for anyone that has pacience and can appreciate a slow burn.",The Blair Witch Project
388,great_sphinx_42,An Experiment In Fear,9,1 May 2001,"Hmm. Wow. What is there left to say? I've waited for most of the hype to die down to even add my comments for this movie to IMDB, and here they are:This is really a movie that has polarized a lot of people. Many love it and consider it the best thing since sliced bread, and plenty more absolutely hate it and call it tripe, drivel, awful, wretched, the worst ever, etc. (NOTE: as far as I'm concerned, the opinions of anyone calling any movie the best- or even more especially, the worst- movie ever are to be immediately disregarded.) Highly innovative in its way, it spawned many parodies and an interesting but inferior sort-of sequel. In the summer of Star Wars: Episode 1, this was the movie that originated several cultural symbols.
I saw this movie shortly after it opened in wide release. Sitting in a theater surrounded by my friends with popcorn in my lap and watching Mike and Heather run around some creepy old house, I felt for the first and last time in my adult life *real, creeping fear* when I myself was not in danger.Many have complained about the shaky-cam, the cussing, how nothing 'really happens', and that it's not scary. By and large, the camera is not *that* shaky, at least to the point where you can't understand why- they're tromping through the woods and they're scared half to death. I must not get queasy very easily, as I had no problem with it. As for the cussing- the lines were ad-libbed, the actors are college-age, and all three sound exactly like every American college student I've ever known. So maybe people have a problem with young peoples' language, but what else is new? That's not a flaw of the movie- it's realism and part of why so many more young people found TBWP scary.I think at least some of the dissention in opinions is caused by generational and cultural differences. My mother's friends told me it wasn't scary, but that 'Psycho' terrified them. 'Psycho', while interesting and a classic, is not the least bit scary to me. 'The Excorcist' has only a couple scenes that I find frightening, but my mom breaks out in goosebumps at the mere mention of it. The scariest thing I ever saw until I watched this movie was a reel in a collection of horror shorts: a woman walks into her house carrying groceries, drops her keys down her heating vent, bends down to try to get them, and something grabs her scarf. She struggles, but within a minute or two, she's drug down and strangled. The scarf goes slack, the woman is lying dead on her floor, and that's it.TBWP is about what you *can't see*, about how your fear of the unknown is so much worse than what the unknown could probably ever be. The characters were not even necessarily likable, but they were *familiar*- Heather is the girl I sit next to in film class who thinks she has all the answers. Their mundane existence, captured in the beginning of the film, roots them in reality. What happens to them is terrifying because they are so every day, so interchangable with millions of other college kids. And, finally, you never know whether the Witch exists or not. Everything that happens can be explained away by coincidence, pranksters, bats, hunger, exhaustion and imaginations run wild with fear- or you can choose not to explain them away.
Young Americans are not scared of much- school shootings can roll off us like water, the evil human beings inflict on each other is run-of-the-mill 6 o'clock news, we are raised in a culture that claims to worship a vengeful, elitist god while almost everyone is hypocritical and uses the power of spirituality as a way to abuse others. We are in information overload from birth. What we fear is not knowing. And in the Black Hills Woods of Maryland, just beyond the flashlight's reach, something is making strange and terrible noises- but we don't know what it is.",The Blair Witch Project
389,jdiz115,The worst Horror film ever with the best marketing team ever,1,8 June 2020,"Title pretty much says it all. It was marketed as being ""real"" and shills were HEAVILY involved with reviewing this film. Now this is the the worst Horror film and possibly one of the worst films ever made for 2 reasons. First, it's not a horror film. It's people walking in the woods who made a home video. Secondly, it spawned the worst trend ever in horror being the ""found footage"" subgenre. Now I admit found footage did land a few good films: Cloverfield probably the best of all, Chronicle, and as above so below to name a few. So this film is only ""good"" in the sense that actual competent filmmakers were able to raise the genre to its true potential. However, this genre became so commonplace because of the low cost of production and terrible filming being passed off as a ""film"". Thankfully this trend has pretty much died out and decent horror is being made again.",The Blair Witch Project

Heather Donahue delivered a fabulous performance, and ""Mike"" was very funny. However, I must say that as far as the documentary concept, and including several shots (like the final fall of the camera in the last scene) the film- makers              unashamedly RIPPED OFF the French                 film MAN BITES DOG (1992).That earlier film was about three independent film- makers who follow a murderer on his daily rounds. They soon get tired and frightened of him, and eventually their lighting man is killed. This scene includes a frantic chase up a flight of stairs in an abandoned warehouse, with displacement of sound due to the distance of the sound man. The scene then goes down the stairs into a dark basement, which is lit only by the new lighting man. The final scenes involve the death of all in the crew, including the cameraman, who falls to the ground at a tilted angle. The cam does not move, and we see the empty room, but not the killers. Now tell me if THAT'S not a rip- off.",The Blair Witch Project
391,jmerlino,Good concept. A lot of filler,5,2 December 2020,"I saw this movie in the theater when it came out. I think the story is interesting, and could have made for a decent movie. Unfortunately, a solid chunk of the movie is just running through the woods with a camera.There were four moments in the movie that I thought were really effective:1: At the beginning, they're interviewing a woman about the legend. As she speaks, her toddler kid keeps putting his hands over her mouth and saying ""mommy, no!"" (This was IMO, the best moment in the film)2. When the find the little bundle filled with twigs and teeth and stuff.3. The ""I'm so sorry"" scene (This one stayed with me for a couple of weeks)4. The guy standing in the corner at the very end.Also effective was the story in general. Setting out to debunk a local legend, but instead becoming part of it.What was not so effective was the camera work and acting. You can justify this any way you want, but the bottom line is, I didn't really care about these kids, and the ""scares"" (such as they were), weren't very scary.One has to give it credit for popularizing the ""found footage"" subgenre, which has given us some really good movies like The Poughkipsie Tapes.I give the crew credit for creating a phenomenon on a shoestring budget, but I have no interest in seeing it again, and can't really recommend it to anyone except for the most die hard horror fans, who, I'm sure, have already seen it.",The Blair Witch Project
392,Xophianic,"Not ""scary as hell"", but still good",9,6 February 2000,"I've never seen the tide turn on movie reviews before like I did in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. First, I heard this movie was the scariest movie since THE EXORCIST, then I heard it was the worst movie of the year. When people thought it might be real, they loved it. Then, when everyone found out it was fake, I heard all sorts of bad things about it.THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is about three young filmmakers, Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Josh Leonard (actors with same names as their characters), go out into the woods of Burkittesville, Maryland to do a documentary on the mythical Blair Witch. They are never found, but a year later their footage is discovered, and it seems to indicate that there really was a witch and it was stalking these three filmmakers.I did not find THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT especially scary, although it was rather spooky. I did think it was good, with an excellent and very original plot. The acting in this movie by the three young kids was very good, especially if the rumors about how they improvised most of it were true. The character development was well done, and you will often find yourself waiting for daylight along with the characters.Was this movie overhyped? A little, but I think if it wasn't that it wouldn't have been as successful, since the actors, writers and directors are relatively unknown. They did a very good job and I hope to see more works from them in the near future.Sure, some of the realism could've been better. Even I knew that they should've followed the stream out of the woods instead of going deeper into the forest. And if this was happening to me, I doubt I'd pick up the video camera and tape it all instead of running like hell. But it still worked. I think the scariest part is how you don't see as much as you hear, because often the sound is 10 times worse than the thing making the sound.This movie isn't too scary, but if you watch it in the middle of the night with all your lights off and alone, it will successfully freak you out.

393,flickjunkie-3,"Unique, Haunting and Original.",9,24 November 2000,"The Blair Witch Project is not your average horror film. I did not expect it to be what it was like, which was bad and differently shot. But, the way this film is shot isn't bad at all, and the film is actually a great surprise!The first few minutes are disorienting, deliberately shot with all the shakiness of raw footage from some backpacker's video diary. The actors, using their real names, swiftly establish soon-to-fray relationships: Heather (Donahue) is the director willing to suffer for her art who doesn't care if others suffer less willingly with her, cameraman Josh (Leonard) is the slacker-type along for the ride and sound technician Mike (Williams) is mostly concerned with making sure they get the rented equipment back on time. After interviewing a couple of locals about the legend, the foolhardy trio head into the woods, and everything starts to fall apart.Everything about this film is powerfully real, the performances are all very polished and excellent, Heather Donahue was amazing, she did not deserve her Razzie award, even though she got annoying, her performance still lives long in the memory. Mike Williams is frightfully good and Josh Leonard is towering. The directional debut from Edward Myrick and Eduardo Sachez leaves you wanting more, I can't wait until their next film. The screenplay is extremely unique and memorable, I have never seen a piece of writing that seems so realistic.Chillingly memorable and stunningly filmed, The Blair Witch Project has made it's place in film history as one of the most haunting films ever made.I rate The Blair Witch Project 8 out of 10.",The Blair Witch Project

These were cocky filmmakers who weren't worried. It was just going to be a weekend trip. If any of you have been camping before, I'm sure you can relate. As for the cel phone, did anyone think that maybe they couldn't afford one?As a guy who was a student filmmaker at one time, I can DEFINITELY relate to this. When you are in a film crew for a class you don't always have the luxury of knowing your crew-mates that well. You can't predict their responses to certain circumstances. I found the acting very realistic in this case. I thought back to my own film crew in jaded L.A. I honestly don't think that we would have fared much better.

397,~AleXa~,"A vain, unimaginative effort to spend as little money as possible to parody a documentary about a nonexistent urban legend.",3,8 June 2000,"The Blair Witch Project (1999) Reviewed January 3, 2014 after 2nd viewing (Blu-ray)A vain, unimaginative effort to spend as little money as possible to parody a documentary about a nonexistent urban legend.Where to start Well, I will preface my review with the following: The first time I saw this, I was scared out of my wits. Why you ask? Probably because I watched it at home in the dark late at night with no one else in the house, I was 16, and I had not discovered The X-Files yet (yes, it was out, but I did not start watching it until 3 months later). Now that I have a lot more knowledge, wisdom, and film expertise, I can see what a tragic cinematic failure it was.The characters have little to offer the film. We barely even relate to them. Heather starts off as this well-to-do, innocent, but headstrong and controlling film student and winds up a whimpering baby. She knows something is out there and her bright idea is to go check it out in the middle of the night with armed with nothing more than a camera and a flashlight? Not so bright OR believable. I grew up camping with my dad (yes, in a tent in the middle of nowhere) in far more remote and scarier places than this, and I can PROMISE you, if you hear a weird noise in the night, the ONLY natural reaction you would have is to a) run to the car and lock yourself in till morning, or if you don't have an easily accessible car, b) stay in the tent, pull the covers over your head, and pray for daylight. You do NOT go venturing out to ""see"" what it is when there is no ""seeing"" to be had, documentary or not. And her two supporting males? Let's put it this way: I only finally figured out who was Mike and who was Josh when Josh disappeared! They interchanged roles so much between the oversensitive asshole and the pacifist, I couldn't tell who was who, and I cared for neither. Part of the success of a film is portraying believable characters that the audience connects with, and all we're doing is screaming at the screen about how stupid they are. And yes, it's scary, but I kept being taken out of the film by Heather Donahue's OVER-acting. It was unnatural and you could feel it was forced, not gripping and intense the way it was supposed to come off.Plot you ask? What plot? It is nonexistent. So for starters, they never explain why they are trusting some guy they don't even know to go into the woods and camp to make a documentary in the first places. Then they complain about getting wet from crossing a creek What? And did no one else notice that in the beginning, they were only supposed to be out there for a weekend. I counted one night actually, and they got NOTHING. What was on the documentary? Like a few interviews from crazy locals, them in a motel room, them walking, and some rocks they found in a pile? That was in the first 20 minutes of the film they started to go back! Then as what little tension builds does, Heather suddenly decides there must be something in those bound twigs that appeared mysteriously on our doorstep in the middle of the night, so she unwraps it to find I still don't quite know what Fingers? She completely loses it and is hysterical, and yet we're supposed to believe she very rationally decides not to tell Mike? I understand why someone wouldn't—to keep him from panicking so that they both don't lose it—but she's not in her right mind!! That's the point isn't it?! Not to mention Mike just throws the map in the river cause he gets mad! If you're that paranoid about getting lost and that anal about getting back on time, that is the LAST thing you do. Just unbelievable all the way around.As for the director, he was obviously loony when he wrote and 'directed' this. I use the term loosely because he states he instructed them to film everything so that it appears as a documentary. The first 10 minutes are so boring you almost cut the film off. Then there's the matter of camera quality—I mean, come on--even in 1999 it was better than this. And what is with the constant switching from color to black and white? It only serves to distract the viewer and keep the focus off the story. Pick one and stick with it! In all seriousness, not to offer insult to the show in the last because I love it, but an episode of ""Ghost Adventures"" is far scarier than this, and at least its NOT fiction pretending to be fact! Each episode documents evidence, history, and fact at a REAL location about a REAL supernatural event. The LEAST the screenwriters could have done was develop a film based off an ACTUAL LEGEND. The lack thereof only serves its intended purpose of creating never- ending loopholes for the directors to do whatever they want and be as minimalist as possible. Their motto: Minimum input, maximum gain. Do NOT be fooled! This film is nothing more than a cheap trick to make a quick buck. I hate to say it, but Paranormal Activity (the first one) did it so much better. *I* could do better if I had a video camera and two friends dumb enough to follow me into the woods based on rumor. EPIC FAIL!!If you're looking for a thrilling supernatural movie, see The Sixth Sense, The Ring, The Mothman Prophecies, Saw, The Haunting, 1408, Devil, Signs, or Dream House.3.0 out of 10.0",The Blair Witch Project

It is very long, very boring and has not a single scare. It has obnoxious characters screaming at either nothing or bundles of sticks. If they're not screaming, they're swearing, if they're not swearing, they're crying. This might have been a genuine scary experience for the actors, but it wasn't for me. I felt bored and irritated. I have a very good imagination, but this film did not inspire it at all. The only reason I watched to the end was to find out if anything justified the hype. But nothing did. I was just relieved that all the screams had been quenched. There are some films I am prepared to give a second chance to, but this isn't one of them.

This is hilarious. I can't believe somebody really get scared by such a crappy movie. The movie of course has the usual ""true story"" sign, but this time we are brought the story itself as a footage. Yeah, what we see had really happened from what I understood. And the worst thing is that people had believe it 7 years ago and I still read posts about Blair Witch Project being an example of a really scary movie. There are even people who don't find it scary, but they like it. Otherwise, I can't explain that ending, this popularity and its sequel which I haven't seen and I don't intend to do it in this life. And the really really worst of all, is that people had believed it as I said. I guess that if I believed in this, I would have liked it. It is similar to My Little Eye which is a really good horror movie that made me look behind my back. We have stupid teens overacting, camera looking like a home video and some interviews with people convincing the audience and the teens themselves that this curse or whatever it is, really exist. Oh, and we have no themes and songs, cause it is supposed to be happening for real and 5 years later this tape is a movie that is supposed to scare us.This is basically The Blair Witch Project. I don't like the story, but I would have appreciated the try to be recreated with actors and normal camera with themes. It would have been stupid, but nothing stupid that tries to conquer the genre with its reality. This sucks. I got bored, I nearly fell asleep after 40 boring minutes and then I realized that whatever happens till the end of the movie, I would hate it and the movie I hate could be counted on the fingers of the persons involved with this story.

It is more about a bunch of incompetent university students swearing, yelling, and fighting than it was about a witch. While ""Patch Adams"" was much too polished a movie, this was much too raw. If they'd done a normal rather than documentary B-movie style and put in some more mature actors with cleaner dialogue who didn't spazz out every five minutes, it would have been much better.

Leaves the viewer hanging with ""wth WAS that thing"", and it's best that way, without revealing too many details about the perpetrator of all the terror. Gist of the story implies that ""it"" cannot be human or animal, but something else, probably inbetween the two, and that's what I liked best. Time looping, path looping, unexplained memory and object loss, random involuntary wondering in the maze that is the colorful American woods, all leading to the inevitable: Loss of sanity from scaring your living daylights from the terror of the unknown in more than one subtle way.

There's no one here to help you! We walked for 15 hours today, we ended up in the same place! There's no one here to help you, THAT'S your motivation! THAT'S YOUR MOTIVATION!"" - Josh Leonard (The Blair Witch Project)I absolutely love this movie, I remember when I first saw it, I was 10 years old, I turned the lights off, I was terrified, and I couldn't get the movie out of my head.This is a found footage movie (fake documentary) and you could say this one sparked the flame for how popular (depending on your perspective) they have become today. Ever since TBWP, I've been a sucker for found footage movies.When the movie starts, it is a slow burner, and some people may become bored, however, everything you're seeing from the start is absolutely necessary. The movie builds the story slowly from the three main characters perspective, all they're doing is making a college documentary about a folklore in the small town of Burkittsville Maryland, they give the audience information (that is crucial later on) about the murders of 7 children, minimal info on The Blair Witch legend, the ritualistic murders at Coffin Rock, and the belief from the towns people that there's something evil lurking in the woods.I enjoyed the three main characters performances, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael C. Williams aren't just playing characters, they're projecting 90% of themselves into the movie. A majority of the actor's performances where real and genuine, they were really out there in the woods (not actually lost), they actually argued with each other, Heather shed real tears, and their fear was pretty legit.My favorite scenes in the movie are: 1. Heather's Documentary Opening Cemetery Scene 2. The Interviewee's Story about the Rustin Parr murders 3. The description of the Coffin Rock Murders 4. Character's fighting about why the map was kicked into the creek 5. Discovery of Voodoo Stick Figures hanging on the trees 6. Night Time Chase 7. It's not the same log 8. Josh verbally abusing Heather 9. Cries for help heard in the distance during the night 10. Final Scene at Rustin Parr's houseTBWP is frightening, tense, haunting, eerie, and it builds and builds until the very last frame.By the end, some people may feel disappointed because nothing is exactly clear, it's a bit ambiguous, and it's left up to people's interpretation. Clearly, there is something supernatural happening, but as an audience member, you don't find any real concrete evidence to support the fact that there is a ghostly or supernatural presence lurking in the woods, all of the happening can easily be debunked as, there are people screwing with them, and Josh did it; The Blair Witch is clearly the one responsible for the happenings, but you never see her, and that pisses a lot of people off.I enjoy this movie because I get to use my imagination, I believe that the forces you can not see are the most threatening and entertaining for a horror movie. I love the abusive verbal behavior between the characters, it adds emotion, and empathy. The characters start off as happy go lucky individuals, they're very excited to go on this camping trip, but as the tension builds, they slowly start to verbally and physically tear each other apart, they break down and share real moments of fear, terror, turmoil, and sadness.TBWP is not for everyone (clearly), but I enjoy it because it feels real, and the realer it feels, the scarier it becomes.The movie could've been more of a character study mixed with horror, but I still enjoyed it for what it was, and that's pure unsympathetic non scripted non CGI-ed horror.

Look at Jeepers Creepers for god's sake! when we finally see the 'monster' it all becomes laughable!!!This is where the Blair Witch's success lies, in the imagination of the viewer. The last 20 minutes of this film, for me are almost unbearable. People complained about the 'shaky camera' effect, but that's what makes this film. It's the fact that we as a viewer are thrown around both visually and emotionally by the three characters.When they are attacked in their tent and they decide to run, that scene is soo effective because we never see what it is that's doing it! it's our own imaginations running riot with us.The three leads all behave and react well to their given situations, the girl being the lst to break down. Josh was great, he was both strong, and weak at the same time in the later scene's when the group had lost their way. Mike, was a pain at times, especially his OTT 'hammed up' confession that he destroyed the map. Fool! The fact that this film was marketed as a 'documentary' was also effective in obtaining interest.My only qualm? this film didn't work in the cinema's because we were all aware that we were watching a film. I guarantee, if you watch this on your home t.v. (preferably the smaller the better) then you will feel insecure. Oh, and watch it in the middle of the night. or maybe even in the woods. . .. . . . And the final reel!!! Ohmygod!!!The sequel!!!! laughable!!! utter trite!!! Why? Guess...'cos we 'see' everything!!! If you havn't got the imagination, then this film won't work for you! Go and watch Scream, where everything is laid out for you to see!",The Blair Witch Project
406,superboy478,A Genuine Horror Film,10,17 April 2002,"The Blair Witch Project was a box office hit at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and was hailed by critics and audiences alike. Eventhough it only grossed $12 million in production, it was one of the biggest box office hits of 1999.Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Micheal Williams are film students at Montgomary College in Maryland. They are given a project by their film professor to do a documentary about a legendary witch scandal that occured during the Colonial days. They travel to the small town of Burkitsville to interview the locals about what they know on the Blair Witch. After one day of filming, they decide to head up to Burkitsville's Black Forest where they choose to film at Coffin Rock and other locations. When they reach the forest, it starts out like a walk in the park when they stick to their path. But, as the story moves along, they go off their path which ends up getting them lost. As the nights go by, they hear noises that don't sound normal for camping, and when the sun rises, they discover new things outside their tent every morning when they wake up. Their trip turns into nothing but a pure nightmare in the Black Forest of Maryland. Their cameras never stop rolling.Produced and directed by Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick (Blair Witch 2), The Blair Witch Project is a very chilling and disturbing movie that will leave you breathless by the end. For sure though, it is a very good movie.Best Ages:    15 & Up!",The Blair Witch Project

Very few films disturb me to the point where five days after viewing the movie I am still sleeping with the lights on.  I think that the negative reviews of this film may have missed the point.  One reviewer said the logic was flawed, that the campers should have just followed the stream to civilization.  The point was the campers couldn't leave the woods no matter what they tried.  They were directed by forces beyond their control.  Unfortunately the ending was cryptic and therefore I feel a lot of the audience did not understand what they saw.  If you listened carefully to the commentary of the people in the town, the ending was truly the best part of the film and what made me go to Walmart for a night light.",The Blair Witch Project
408,lucianomarzo92,Hmmmm..,6,9 September 2009,"I saw this movie just yesterday. Wow. I had been wanting to see it for a while also. I appreciate the originality on the part of the filmmakers to shoot the movie with crude technology. I found that decision very creative on their part. It makes all of the footage seem real. It is probably the perfect way to film a movie like this, but I must say it kind of bothered me throughout the movie. The Blair Witch Project isn't exactly what you'd call a good horror movie. It lacks some of the qualities a lot of horror movies have, like jump scenes, a villain, and a dark atmosphere. It did have a moderately creepy atmosphere in some scenes, though. The Blair Witch Project is by no means a bad movie; it's just not exactly what you may expect. It's a little different. Most of the movie is centered around frustration and paranoia more than horror. The whole time I was watching the movie, I was waiting for something scary to happen. About 2/3 of the way through, I was thinking, ""Is this all? I thought this movie was supposed to be terrifying?"" The last 5 minutes kind of make up for the rest of it, though. The last few scenes may not be initially creepy like you might expect, but they are after you think about them for a while. Overall, I would say that this movie would be a little disappointing if you really wanted to watch something scary. There is not really anything that antagonizes the main characters except themselves. There isn't really a Blair witch. There are only stories of the Blair witch and encounters with things that may or may not be the Blair witch.",The Blair Witch Project

The way this film is shot is nauseating but once you're adjusted to it, you aren't going to be that sick during the movie. The decent into madness and scares are really effective and very real, which does make your skin crawl a little. The characters backstories aren't important seeing how they contribute to the movie fine. The pacing of the movie seems fine, a lot of things just seem fine. They don't switch anything up so I kinda see that as bland. Either way, this is a really revolutionary movie that is scary and grimy but can be nauseating and kinda bland at times as well. 7/10.",The Blair Witch Project

I had fallen asleep within the first 45 minutes. I had been extremely disappointed. Now, I had heard about how ""Paranormal Activity"" is one of the creepiest horror movies of the year. I thought that if I'm going to see ""Paranormal Activity,"" then I'd better watch this movie again in order to know what I'm in for. After a second viewing, I admit that ""The Blair Witch Project"" is absolutely one of the creepiest horror movies I've ever seen.Shot like footage, ""BWP"" follows three student filmmakers shooting a documentary: Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Mike Williams. Heather is the head director of a documentary about the infamous Blair Witch of Blair, Maryland. After many strange and eerie stories of the witch, including the tales of over seven children being kidnapped and found dead, the three teens are pretty skeptical that there really is any witch living in the woods of Burkitsville. As they venture into the woods to shoot their film, strange things happen, things that they never thought would happen. Things that are going to tear them apart emotionally. Heather, Josh, and Mike discover that the Blair Witch might be more than just a legend.""The Blair Witch Project"" opens as a seemingly ordinary documentary-style horror movie. But there is plenty to love about it. As the movie progresses, it unfolds with a horrifying tension, with an event just as frightening as the one before it. Also, the Burkitsville woods are a perfect atmosphere for the movie. The camera kept closing in on the cast, and it produced a strong feeling of claustrophobia. Whenever I heard a noise in the background, and one of the filmmakers would scream ""What the **** was that?!"", I kept turning my head back and forth to see if there was anything there. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a very good example of ""What you don't see is scarier than what you do see."" The movie gives excellent performances by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Mike Williams. The most iconic moment of the movie, with Heather turning on the camera and making a tearjerking apology to her family and the others, is one of the most heartbreaking moments of the movie.""The Blair Witch Project"" was a movie with a very low budget of 11,000 dollars. And after a lot of hype, audiences ran to the theaters and were scared out of their wits, bringing in over 5, million dollars in a weekend. The movie had beaten out the box-office record that was held by the horror classic ""Halloween."" This movie takes a rather simple premise and goes a long way with it. It's scary, eerie, claustrophobic, and leaves you on the edge of your seat. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is perfect psychological horror.P.S. Don't watch it at night. Plus, the climax is gut-wrenching.",The Blair Witch Project

412,Gjay2,the woods will never be the same again,10,17 May 2002,"A lot of people tell me that they did not find the blair witch project scary in anyway shape or form. I later found out that most of these people had seen it in the cinema so what do they expect. You can not be truly scared when you are surrounded by loads of other people, eating and coughing and walking in and out all the time. So i waited for it to come to video. And when it arrived, i rented it, went home, waited till midnight, closed one set of curtains, left another set open, turned off all the lights and plugged in my big headphones. Now that is the best way to view this film, because after it had finished, i found myself running up the stairs, straight into the bathroom just so i could lock the door behind me. The Blair Witch Project chilled me to the bone. When i was younger, i played a lot in my local woods, and sometimes i would be afraid of what lurked in them, so this film attacked that fear with a vengeance. The performances (improvisations) were very real, aswell as the atmosphere. The attitudes the three characters had were believable, very human unlike most other horror films. And with my headphones on, each footstep, shout and the quiet cracking of twigs could be heard, which made it more chilling, as it's the almost unhearable sounds which create the scares. So if you're gonna watch this movie, do it right, be brave and watch it on your own with the lights off. I think everyone who didn't like it would have a different perspective if they watched it like that.",The Blair Witch Project

Now in that aspect the film was truly trend-setting. Its story though original failed in many aspects. The film does a decent job in building tension as does its pacing, but for the most part this film only comes off as slightly creepy. A lot of the potential of this film is lost in its three amateur actors who do little but bicker, argue and fight throughout the length of the film. What made this film so immensely popular when it first came out was in its marketing. A lot of film goers at the time felt as though this film was actual true footage, when in turn it was just a low grade horror film. Though a nod has to be given to this film as it did create a new genre within film, that went on to span such films as Cloverfield and Chronicle. All in all for a horror film it misses its mark in some aspects but in others it does very well, which is in its pacing and its tension, but ultimately falls short, mostly in its conclusion, which leaves much to be desired.",The Blair Witch Project

Cons:  Proof that critical and popular moviegoing opinion can be quite absurd.The hype for this movie is quite absurd.Even the most respected film critics of professional and amatuer types drooled over this.Sadly so did a large portion of the public.The plot simply goes like this 3 filmmakers go into the woods to find the blair witch and they end up lost.This is one of the dumbest,most inept,boring movies of 1999.Sure blair witch isn't the only highly-hyped film of 1999 there are films like American Beauty,Three Kings,Being John Malkovich,Toy Story 2,The sixth sense,etc. were better than this movie.Even highly-hated films of 1999 like Pokemon the first movie,Baby Geniuses,Wild wild west were much better than this dreck.And no I'm not hating just because it doesn't have traditional scare tactics like big budget scares or cheaply made killers or just to sound different.I may be too nice for giving this film a 1 instead of a 0 but I find some of the intentional humor funny so it is at least worth a few chuckles.This film is purely for ""Arthouse"" fans only sure although I'm not a big fan of arthouse flicks there are plenty of good arthouse flicks out there.But needless to say THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM!Although it was more boring that irratating afterall this film could be fun if it were treated by the folks of MST3K.This film could've also been tolerable if they used the actual footage instead of this shotty re-make.Originality is not a bad thing. But this makes the concept of originality look like ""something nobody else was stupid to do"".Low-budget films can be good. Now I can't say this films budget should be bigger it just needs a better script.So please I know that films like Pokemon the first movie,Wild wild west,Star wars episode 1 are highly flashy but they are more entertaining than this thrash.Though it wasn't as bad as films like Very Bad Things and such but it was pretty close.After sitting through this film I actually felt sleepy so I guess it is at least good for some sleeping medicine.So please ignore the massive slobber over this and stay away from this unless you're a certain MST3K fan.So if you want to see a good critically aclaimmed flick see Toy story 2 or the sixth sense (which sadly didn't do as well as blair witch)or something like that.Hey say most of anything 1999 flick than this.(Sure films like ""Titanic"" and ""2001:A Space oydssey"" weren't all that much but they were better than this.)",The Blair Witch Project

Fortunately, there's no one ramming down my throat hyping the movie.  I've checked the Blair Witch website a little.  It sure has lots of amazing details.Anyway, onto the film itself.  The first half hour of the movie is disorienting what with the shaky handheld cam shots.  But this first half hour is essential to know the Blair Witch myth (wish I listened hard, heheh).  Then the next hour is where the transformation of the kids from happy, to whining annoyance uttering the F word plenty of times, and ultimately fear.I never got scared or made me think hard such as to lose sleep.  What it is, is simply an interesting way of making a movie.  That's it.  The actors don't have much of a script to work with and so most of the scenes are ad libbed.  And the story is constructed as a documentary.  At the end, you feel that you want to know more, but since it's a ""unfinished documentary"" the end is naturally abrupt.

Who would have thought three college kids being chased by an unseen ghost would have become one of the highest-grossing films of all time? The idea was so simple, almost quaint, I wish I'd thought of it. I'd be sitting in a hot tub in Aruba with Paris Hilton now . . . but that's a different story. This film struck a chord with the American public that's hard to identify. What did the Blair Witch represent? Was she nature, raped and despoiled by male-dominated American bourgeois society? Was she the Goddess of the Witches, Hecate, striking back for having been persecuted by Christianity? Or was the film itself an affirmation of Christian values, as so many horror films ironically are? Certainly the three student filmmakers come to grief after scoffing at the Bible-toting old woman's chilling tale of her own encounter with the Blair Witch. The film has obvious parallels with Stephen King's ""It"" and much of H.P. Lovecraft. Whatever. Anyone can make a movie, but not everyone can make a GOOD movie. ""The Blair Witch Project"" succeeded in part due to clever Internet hype, but largely due to the raw, cinema-verite film-making that imparted grisly authenticity to what otherwise might have been a cheesy exploitation film, and to the superb improvisational skills of three talented young character actors--Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard, and Mike Williams. We could identify with them thanks to their very ordinariness. They were everyone's son, daughter, boyfriend, brother, sister. Their plight reminded one of soldiers caught behind enemy lines in wartime . . . Ironically, the real Burkitville MD (yes, Virginia, there is a Burkitville) is close to the sight of some major Civil War battles. The bottom line is, it's a darn good film.",The Blair Witch Project

Oh sure, their special effects tend to go ""gross out"" and all, and they get a reaction from me, but as far as I'm concerned being grossed out is not the same thing as being terrified. Just because something looks or acts disgusting doesn't mean it frightens me. And to be frank, I've grown bored with the constant parade of ""horror"" movies coming out these days, and not just because I don't care for them... also because they don't frighten me. Enter THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, the first movie I've ever seen which terrified me so badly that I was unable to sleep for four nights! (It doesn't help that my apartment is currently in a cellar. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about.) This is a movie for, say, computer game fans who prefer thinking games to arcade style games, THIEF as opposed to QUAKE. This is very much a thinking person's movie, and those who (I hate to say it) don't have much imagination will get precious little out of it because they are the types who need to have their visuals spoonfed to them. I did have a few complaints about the film, but many were answered in the info provided by www.blairwitch.com. **The following are considered spoilers, if you prefer to see the film without knowing any background info first, please stop reading.** For example, I kept wondering why no one tried using any of the techniques of that ""lost in the woods"" book that was brought along. But then, I went to the webpage and read the personal diary that was there which said things like (paraphrased), ""Why can't I remember what I'm supposed to do after reading it so much in that book? Why isn't our compass working?"" The suggestion is that they've been put until a spell by the Blair Witch, and that it's slowly eating away at their logic...and maybe even screwing around with their compass? The only part which still makes me jump a little bit with suspicion is the idea of carrying the cameras and filming everything all the way to the very end of the film. While this is soothed a bit by the fact that the webpage's diary says (paraphrased again), ""I'm going to film everything that happens, so hopefully some good will come out of this..."" so it can be argued that the characters continued doing so in case they felt they'd need the filmed information in the future, I can't help but wish that, say, they had been equipped with those special cameras that mounts on one's head so they could have an excuse to forget the cameras were still rolling while everything was happening. That's the only slight damper on what is otherwise a brilliant film, and I for one am willing to suspend disbelief enough to enjoy such a great movie.

But when I was home again, alone in my room and heard any noise downstairs, I started liking it.After having seen Blair Witch Project, camping will never be the same. It is the same with surfing after Jaws. The thing I HATE about Blair Witch  is that there was a sequel. The sequel still is the worst piece of cr*p I have ever seen in my entire life. I recommend watching Blair Witch Project either in cinemas, or alone in a dark room. This film includes unbelievable psycho-terror, at least for me. I read many comments who claimed that this just was not scary, but it was. There have been scarier movies, definitely ( The Exorcist, The Sixth Sense, It ), but this is at least in the Top 10 of the scariest movies ever. You just have to want it to be scary.

It is the opposite of being scary, it is actually so boring it's sleep inducing.

There were details to rumors about a man who killed children. The question raised by that story is if he killed children two at a time how is it he killed seven kids? If he killed children two at a time he would have killed an even number of children. I have gone hiking, and exploring abandoned buildings and checked out supposed haunted places, I've never taken a video camera to make a documentary but otherwise this movie was entirely relatable to me and my personal life and yet the movie is so poorly done I had no connection to the movie or felt drawn into any of the scenes or story.",The Blair Witch Project

To clarify, I am not a horror movie fan, and have very specific labels for horror - paranormal horror, psychological horror, old school horror etc!I most certainly have this as psychological horror, it is to me the same style as Saw, as in it is written to build and test the boundaries of your mind and where and when you scare - it is different to me than paranormal horror, which are films like paranormal activity, or the ring, specifically designed to challenge your thoughts on ghosts from the outset, and hit a scare nerve intermittently, so that you struggle to forget!I felt it necessary to clear the above up, just so you understand my rationale for my review - basically I thought this was really rubbish, I practically skipped and danced through this, waiting for something to happen - BUT that's the point isn't it?! I saw this on a sunny Sunday afternoon, in my living room with a cup of coffee, it didn't even really entertain me, but it wouldn't, because this film was never designed to be watched at home in those circumstances, that is the point of it, your best viewing of this film would be in Delamere* Forest on a cold wintry night, with just a tent, torch and maybe a video camera but nothing else, save for food and drink, then watching it would likely have scared the bee Jesus out of me and that's why people in my opinion, including myself, struggle to understand how other's can rate it soo highly, because context is everything for this type of movie.There is no point me complaining about aspects of the film, because it was shot purposefully the way it was, with the hope true fans of the genre would watch it as intended and get it, it is for cult horror fans only.

It's original - definitely not your formulaic, Hollywood fare. Great atmosphere - the music is really frightening and the footage looks authentic. Good acting - from everyone but especially Heather. It's short - 80 minutes. The DVD package is excellent - the movie, director's commentary, various trailers, BW myth, TV documentary. The user interface is also well done (very spooky). BUT... nothing really happens. That may have been OK when no-one knew anything about it but now that some of the story has leaked out (like the fact that it was the producers who spooked the campers) then something was lost. You couldn't help think ""I know who put that stuff there"". So it's a victim of its own success.

Over and over again one keeps thinking: they're lost, they're hungry, they're scared; why do they keep the cameras running?  The answer of course is that there wouldn't be a film without it. I'd rank this a lot lower except that it does have the one great virtue of a mediocre ultra-low budget film--audacity.

The ending was the only truly scary part in the entire thing.  However, you just don't see what exactly happens to them as the camera just drops to the ground and the movie ends.  That kind of left me wanting for more.  I just think that this movie was merely more of 80 minutes comedy and drama, and 10 minutes horror...which hardly makes for a true horror film.  Oh well, at least I had a cute girl that was clinging on me.",The Blair Witch Project
429,HBeachBabe,"comments, pt. 2",4,23 August 1999,"Having already posted one review which could be seen as being ""negative"" (although not as much as many of the reviews here) I have become rather resentful at those who not only praise the film (to each his own) but also offer their interpretation as to why the rest of don't like it - because it lacks special effects and relies on our imagination which therefore must be lacking.As for the first, Sixth Sense was plenty scary without special effects.  I can enjoy a non-effect movie as long as there is something compelling going on.  Blair Witch was interesting but hardly compelling, and effects or not, there was *nothing* scary.  Not a single solitary moment of the film caused me to jump in my seat, to look over my shoulder or to instill a fear in me that wasn't already there.  Silence of the Lambs lacks special effects and except for a scene or two, doesn't have ""jump out at you"" scares yet is widely considered one of the scariest movies ever.  Why?  Because the audience is given just enough info to truly be frightened by the possibilities and the knowledge that something real is behind it all.  Blair Witch gives some hints of things to be frightened of, but nothing to indicate that something truly malevolent is taking place. 
As for the second.  My imagination is fine.  I'm a filmmaker myself.  When I go to a film I go to become involved in the filmmaker's imagination.  If the whole point of the film was simply to be scared by what I can imagine, why go to the movie?  I can sit at home and imagine some pretty scary stuff without spending $4.50.  ""Jaws"" left alot to the imagination but it also gave me enough to go on to fuel my imagination.  Blair Witch gave me nothing.  Not a hint, not a glimpse.  For all I know, the whole thing was a practical joke played on them by Mike, the movie not only doesn't offer any explanations it doesn't even offer any clues (and yes I know what the ending was supposed to be and that was hardly enough to validate any explanation from aliens to a ticked-off hermit).  I am left thinking that the filmmakers had nothing scary in mind... that it was their imagination that was lacking, not mine.  That they couldn't think of something sufficiently scary to match the build up so instead of going for the big climax, they just end it and then say ""imagine something scary here""  That's not filmmaking genius, that's a cop-out.  If Speilburg had *never* showed us the shark and instead left the possibility open that it wasn't a shark but perhaps a big p-o'd goldfish or maybe just a maniacal scuba diver or maybe (insert something you think is scary here) people would have been upset too.  Movie scares require something concrete to scare me.  There was nothing concrete in Blair Witch. The sticks & rocks set up a creepy atmosphere but are not scary by themselves. I have no problem with a movie that doesn't draw a straight line for me, that doesn't make all the connections explicit (Eyes Wide Shut for instance which requires active thought on the part of viewer and was thus not understood by most people) but if I'm to be left to connect the dots myself, you'd better at least give me the dots.If this film scared you, fine.  But for me it didn't and the film's supporters attempts to explain why it didn't scare me (usually in an insulting manner) simply don't hold water.",The Blair Witch Project
430,HBeachBabe,Check the web site first,4,6 August 1999,"I was so ready to be scared watching this film.  I had just seen Deep Blue Sea the day before (a far ""scary"" film in terms of shocks & thrills) and was thoroughly disappointed.  As an indy film maker, I could relate to the kids quest, and felt the acting (yes it is acting, the situation is *not* real) was wonderful.  This movie succeeds based on the audience identifying with them - that is, identifying with the feeling of being alone in the woods and have some very strange things going on.  However, while all if this is very effective in setting up a very creepy situation that gets eerier and wierder as the film progresses, there is no pay off at the end.  None of what happens amounts to anything.  We are told at the beginning that the kids are missing (and presumably dead) and really have no more information than that at the end.  The film would have been better served with some framing sequences that include the information included on the web site, which put the film in context and offers far more information on the Blair Witch and the mythology than the film has on its own.  The film alone is a serious let-down.  As part of a multi-media event (movie, web site, Sc-Fi channel documentary) it is an interesting, if ultimately pointless, exercise in creative film making.",The Blair Witch Project

The campers go from carefree arrogance and fun to utter, total fear in a matter of hours of recounting.The cabin, the symbols and dolls left outside were all quite eerie and the final chapter closes the movie abruptly and eerily.

Movies that have parodied this crappy movie do a better job of conveying fear. I understand the premise, of course. Make the movie appear like a home movie where some young people encounter some weird and horrific experiences. The problem is, most vacation home movies are more compelling and clever. Whenever there was a hint of tension, the actor would swear or scream, for lack of anything better they could think of.

They interview people and then go into woods where they get lost. Strange stuff starts happening. One of the strange things is they come to a tree that they had been at before, seemingly without turning around. Another is they hear noises that sound like sticks breaking at night.

I felt like this movie portrayed the hopelessness and fear that people in those situations must feel. There wasn't a moment that I didn't feel like I was there, along with the characters, feeling all their emotions.

440,lwjoslin,Fear itself,9,24 July 2002,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is a horror movie about fear itself.  Since fear is subjective, the movie is like a Rorschach ink-blot test: you'll either see something there or you won't.  My brother and I disagreed as to whether it was boring or terrifying.  We were both right: it bored him, and it terrified me.In the late '50's, Robert Bloch, in an essay titled ""The Clown at Midnite"" [sic], generally lamenting the state of horror movies at the time, posed the rhetorical question, ""What is a horror movie?""  It is, he said, a movie whose content horrifies.  Obvious, perhaps; but nonetheless, he said, studios had forgotten how to make them, opting instead for monster movies, sci-fi movies, big-bug movies, and mad-doctor movies, full of shock and ""gore"" moments (moments only, in those days), freighted with ""comic relief,"" saddled with the obligatory romantic subplot, and replete with ""latex false faces that wouldn't frighten a two-year-old.""  He concluded that there simply was no such thing any more as a movie made just to scare the hell out of you.Since then, there have been a few.  ""The Haunting"" (the 1963 original, not the execrable 1999 remake) was one; so was the (original) ""Night of the Living Dead"" and the (original) ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""  Three very different flicks, but all very frightening, and -- considering the red-meat subject matter of the last two -- quite restrained.  NOTLD and TCM were also low-budget indies, which added to their gritty credibility.Into the pantheon of low-budget/no-budget horror now goes ""The Blair Witch Project,"" a product of the thriving film industry of Maryland (which gave us the oeuvre of John Waters).  Minimalism at its minimal-est, BWP (these low-budget creepers always have ""mouthful"" titles best reduced to initials) is presented as a pseudo-documentary.  The premise is that, in October 1994, three student filmmakers set out into the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about a local legend, the malefic Blair Witch, a Colonial-era miscreant said to haunt the woods still.  (One is reminded of the Jersey Devil, the subject of a similar, slightly earlier, and even LOWER-budgeted movie, ""The Last Broadcast."")  The three kids were never seen again, but a year later, their footage was found.  And that is what we watch.Heather, Josh and Mike (the names of the actors as well as the characters) set out on this weekend camping trip as a lark.  But the fun dries up when they promptly get lost, and as the days drag on, are cold, hungry, tired, panic-stricken, getting on each other's nerves -- and stalked by an unseen presence.  As in, say, ""Rear Window,"" we the viewers are trapped along with the protagonists; as in, say, NOTLD, they start turning on each other.  And they learn too late that you can be young, hip, smart, and middle-class, living in a world of computers and fast food, and still --  when you're lost in a patch of woods you wouldn't have thought big enough to get lost in, in a part of the country long settled and urbanized, and just a few miles from DC -- find yourself prey to primal fears, mostly of the dark.  This is, as I said, an essay about fear itself.  No masked madman with a chainsaw is after these kids, no plague of flesh-eating zombies, no ghost -- maybe not even a witch.  But SOMETHING is out there; the kids aren't just scaring themselves, as it becomes agonizingly clear.Shot in color video and B&W 16mm film (the two cameras the kids lug with them), BWP is a technical oxymoron: credibly spontaneous (much of it was, in fact, ad-libbed), yet beautifully and effectively edited.  The one false note comes early on: one of the locals, an eccentric woman whom claims to have seen the witch, totes a huge Bible and wears a rosary (incorrectly) as a necklace.  She might as well wear a sign that says ""Religious Nutcase."" Pity she was rendered so stereotypically: in movies of this sort, with ill-advised questers heading into dangerous ground, there's usually a disreputable-looking eccentric warning them not to go.  So while this character belonged here and her eccentricity is a given, it's too bad that, in a flick of otherwise great verisimilitude, her phony props distract from her acceptable performance.The image that will long linger in mind comes near the film's end: Heather, taping herself in such closeup that we see her only from the nose up, whispers a panicky, tearful farewell and apology to her parents and those of her crewmates.  ""I'm scared to close my eyes...  I'm scared to open them... We're gonna die out here...""  Brrr!  Fear itself.",The Blair Witch Project
441,shrine-2,Gimmicky,3,23 December 1999,"Past the fact that the incessant profanity just about kills any feeling I might have for the desperate characters in ""The Blair Witch Project"" (I side with the people who view it this way:  Three pottymouths disappear off the face of the earth and good riddance.), one of the elements of a good thriller for me will always be the resourcefulness of the people who populate the story.  The point of this movie is that somehow these three unfortunates fall under some kind of parapsychological spell that disorients them to such an extent that they lose their way out of a touchy situation.  It's like an updated Hansel-and-Gretel story without the woodsman to save the wanderers from the wicked witch.  The reason why I have a hard time going with the premise of ""Blair Witch"" is that I cannot understand Heather's obsession with filming the event.  If I were bent on getting out of that blasted forest, I would not be carrying a camera around to film it.  I also would not be photographing an apology to my parents for putting myself in this desperate situation.  Frankly, I would be praying that God would get me out of that situation--and fast.  This is why I can't side with the people that find this movie haunting; the basic premise comes across as a gimmick--an intellectual conceit, and the potential power of it is lost on me.  The best thing I can say about this movie is that I expect the actress playing Heather to be a favorite for an Oscar nomination.  The legend and the history of the Blair Witch is a far more compelling story.  Catch the documentary on the SciFi channel.  I found it much scarier.",The Blair Witch Project

Anyone with access to a digital camera, computer and a simple editing program has the capacity to make a film.This particular piece, so roundly trashed by many, does have its own, odd, quirky points, moments that stand out and are now part of the horror iconography. While the detractors moan and groan, a simple tale from my own experience explains why I love this odd little thing.One of my supervisors overheard me enthusing about BWP. He chided me, as I am sure so many others will, about how ""bad"" the film was, how ""stupid"" and simply not scary. He went on in detail, and I responded simply ""to each their own,"" or some such. A few seconds afterwards, though, he pulled me aside and asked:""It wasn't ... REAL... was it?""See, one of the greatest things about BWP is its simplicity.
Once upon a time, two boys and a girl went into the dark forest, and were never heard from again. The stuff whispered around campfires, or cautionary tales told by grandmothers to correct the unruly child... the power is in the simplicity.Would that Hollywood could see the point... but I fear they are blinded to it... I have hope, though, because, as mentioned above, this is the future, I have the technology, and I can do it myself, should I so choose...

The former had a kicky trailer which the movie couldn't amount to and the latter was in need of script revisions and lots of them.But what separates these two examples from THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is that they were big budget ""event"" movies, STAR WARS especially. PROJECT, was a sleeper horror cheapie with a cool, innovative gimmick. It's supposedly the missing pieces of documentary footage left by a missing trio of filmmakers researching the legendary Blair Witch. The movie is pretty much segments of color video or black and white 8mm film. This is an interesting concept and a cool idea, but it doesn't make the movie especially scary.What attracted me to the movie in the first place was first the cool idea that attracted most film purists, and later on, the rumors I overheard. People running out of theaters and getting sick (due to, I later found out, the shaky camera movements).But watching PROJECT, especially near the end, I kept thinking of the ""directors"", who didn't seem to do much but edit the movie, since the talent had to shoot the film. I imagined them laughing and rolling in a big pile of money as we were getting jipped from a promising horror movie. All this movie turns out to be is a gimmicky pseudo-documentary with noises in the woods and missing campers.I realize that it's as hard to scare the bejesus out of an audience as much as it is to make them laugh out loud and hopefully break down to the floor. And due to that consideration, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is an average horror flick, which will probably be looked back as a classic like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, due to its clever style of using video and film and its dirt-cheap budget. The actors are good with their improvisations and the ending is a true chiller.If you are curious about the film, I guess it would be worth seeing.

I can remember the teaser trailer for BWP and remember thinking ""WHAT..WAS THAT"".. I was mortified. Later I learned that there were debates on whether it was actually real or not.. How f'ing scary is that? Even public news stations were conflicted in identifying it's authenticity. The buzz was because of the pre-meditated campaign that the creators easter egged around the internet, local TV stations, and faux-documentaries to really push the boundaries of a film that would freak out theatergoers around the world. The result? Panic attacks, people fleeing the theaters, afterglows of intense guilt for what they thought was a supernatural snuff film. People were in complete shock. This is also a result of the methodically torturous stress that was put on the cast. They were made to stay up without sleep, going into the woods at night blind and not exactly knowing just what to expect in the pitch dark woods. The fear and panic on the screen was certainly real, and that's why it's so effective: it's not the ""goul"" making howling badger noises. It's the faint sound of a crying baby, going in circles, time warping dizziness coming to life on screen before our eyes, forcing the viewer to fall into the pit of madness with the characters on screen. I can only recommend this movie to fans of the genre that don't get thrilled by body parts flying in the Saw series but rather the crowd that gets goosebumps from the like of The Babadook, The Changeling and Pulse.

BWP is, for me at least, one of the scariest movies of all time.  You have to pay attention, you have to think, you have to imagine.  The movie doesn't show us the witch for the same reason 2001 doesn't show us aliens and the original Jaws barely ever shows us the shark--your imagination is much more effective at creating those images than any special effects artist could ever be.  We live in an age where every movie plot point is so thoroughly explained that even the dullest audience member can follow the action and where special effects take the place of characterization.  It's incredibly refreshing when a rare movie like this one that actually respects its audience comes along.Maybe the problem is that the film respects its audience too much.  I guess people see the words ""scary as hell"" in the trailer and they go to the movie expecting to see blunt, frightening images.  But that's not the way BWP works, and those viewers just sit there waiting for some more traditional movie scare that never comes.  Or maybe they've never been out in the woods, and have no idea how incredibly creepy it can be out there at night.  Maybe they were too busy ruining the movie for everyone else, yawning and making jokes and obnoxiously asking if the movie was over yet, to be able to hear any of the dialogue.  Or maybe they just enjoy bashing successful, publicized movies because they want to feel different from everyone else.  I don't know.Too many people have the mistaken impression that a movie takes one form and that's it, that's all the movie is.  The Blair Witch Project is different. It's like a horror movie Mad Lib.

I was enjoying the build-up, getting all tensed up expecting a shocking ending but the final scenes were tame...and then the film ended suddenly, somehow not satisfying that craving for shock - that's what watching this film 15 years after the hype will do for you.You still get solid believable acting accurately conveying the rising fear of being lost in the woods (for those of you also with experience of wild camping). And it offers an interesting mythology, with one memorably-chilling scene involving kids' voices and tent-abuse.I never felt bored, but my partner did. So if you haven't seen it and enjoy the found-footage films I mentioned earlier then it's still recommended, just prepare yourself for a more subtle, less graphic experience (even less graphic than the minimalist Paranormal Activity 1).",The Blair Witch Project
454,MyDarkStar,"Hands down, the worst movie I have ever paid to see.",4,4 December 2001,"So I'm standing in line the day ""Blair Witch Project"" comes out with anticipation to see the horror movie that will be ""the next Exorcist"". I was excited, and filled with anticipation, because the previews were really interesting, and unlike anything I'd ever seen. I even bought into all the hype and visited the movie's web site before the movie, and read of the ""history"" of the ""Blair Witch"". So, I was ready.The movie starts. I'm not scared. The characters get lost in the forest. I'm not scared. The characters whine into the camera about being lost in the forest. I'm not scared. The characters find weird figures constructed in the forest. I'm not scared. Snot runs down the girl's face. I'M STILL NOT SCARED !!!! What I am is VERY bored !!!!!This movie is total and utter junk !!! Did people actually think this movie was scary ? Or did they just get nauseated by the bobbing hand-held camera like myself. I challenge anybody to point out one single solitary scary scene in this movie. The only thing that kept me from walking out of this movie (and I have NEVER done that in my life) was the anticipation of some amazingly scary ending. After all, there was absolutely nothing scary that had happened so far in this terrible excuse of a movie. Unfortunately, that ""amazing scary ending"" never came.I have two main regrets when it comes to this pathetic ""project"" : 1) I dropped $7.50 (along with about 2 hours of my life) on it  ; 2) IMDB does not have a ""0"" rating available for movies, so I had to settle for a ""1"". It doesn't even deserve that.I would write more terrible things about it, but that would be even more time I would be investing into this pathetic insult to human intelligence.Hands down, the worst movie I have ever paid to see.",The Blair Witch Project
455,TIALI,no Bang for my buck.,7,30 July 1999,"the Blair Witch Project was funnier than it was scary...not funny in a cynical I've-seen-it-all-you-can't-scare-me way, but funny with funny characters and dialogue.  the movie lacked a payoff....I thought the actors did a great job, but it was a movie.....even if the claim that this is found footage of a missing film crew, someone had to edit it into a film.....it ended like I was to believe that I was watching raw footage that was found later......but I couldn't believe that....so I never felt any terror or even more than apprehension, waiting for something to go ""boo!""  so I left wanting more...",The Blair Witch Project
456,vbz,Groundbreaking Film mortally hurt by excessive hype,10,28 December 1999,"A spit in every major Hollywood studio's face, to say the least, and the second film this summer to learn a lesson from MTV's atrocious programming and put it to superior, even revolutionary use. With ""Run Lola Run"" it was the relentless pace and non-dependence on dialogue which created a sublime effect, a near return to the silent era. ""Blair Witch"" took the channel's utterly false reality of home-video footage and documentary-style acting, transforming it into perhaps the most realistic falseness to ever grace the silver screen. The enormous buzz that surrounds this amazing horror movie (which never aspires to be more than a cheeky genre entry) has already started an undeserved yet equally strong backlash, mostly by jealous film-students at first, then by the spoiled masses which could not comprehend anything beyond Will Smith's special effects-ridden vehicles. Misunderstood both by the critics who hailed it as the next cineamtic movement and the audiences bombasted by the hype, ""Blair Witch"" should be taken at face value; although currently that is practically impossible to do. The degree of scariness in the exploits of three young idiots (types all too familliar to everyone who attended college) doomed to perish in the haunted Maryland woods will largely correspond to one's own level of sensitivity, but regardless of how frightened the film makes you, it amounts to an experience of gleeful delight,(akin to the great ""Evil Dead"" series minus the cartoonish gore), of taking part in something new and refreshing. Of course the overall execution is not totally original, deriving mainly from ""The Real World"" and an obscure 80's Vietnam flick called ""84 Charlie Mopic"", but what does it matter? Nothing, repeat NOTHING spurts out of the blue - (a classic case in point would be Tarantino inspired by Goddard and Melville inspired by Carol Reed and John Huston inspired by the 20's expressionist cinema and ""Public Enemy""). ""Blair Witch"", while not transcending its genre, still has a share of pure visual artistry, some probably unintentional. A certain beauty lies in the shots of Heather Donahue's white shape jetting through the dark forest, the ominous rays of sun glittering in the evening trees. The amateur feel the directors generate is but an expertly-crafted illusion and therein lies the film's ultimate pleasure.",The Blair Witch Project
457,TeaBunny,the most frightening movie ever,10,15 July 1999,"Perfect, solid, well-acted, original, horrifying, intelligent, scary, disturbing, makes you think for days, weeks, months, forever.

458,TeaBunny,one of the best horror films of all time,10,13 October 1999,"~spoilers~ Reasons why this movie is in my Top Five? The autumn woods, complete blackness, children laughing, branches cracking, the appearance of grave markers, dozens of stickmen in the trees, Mike screaming for Josh, crying, Josh howling in terror in the blackness, bloody teeth appearing out of nowhere, feeling alone, in the tent, dark, cold, hungry, what was that noise? We're gonna die out here.For the naysayers: I find that most people who complain about elements of the film don't seem to understand said elements. Heather screaming was annoying? She only screamed at the end of the film. Too many curses? Every ""R"" rated movie has curses, and this is how people in this situation would talk. They were stupid, and didn't do the ""smart"" thing? Like what? The point of them hiking South all day and ending up in the same place was to show you that there were supernatural elements involved. They were not getting out of those woods no matter what they did. ""Running like hell"" would not have helped. (running? would that have REALLY made a difference?) They kept their supplies and tried to keep their wits about them. They could not FIND the car. That was the point. They went into the house because they thought Josh was in there. Scared of piles of rocks? Well, yes... they were grave markers and they appeared outside their tent! Heather found Josh's bloody teeth wrapped in his shirt! Scared? How foolish of them!Originality, genuine creepiness, no need for traditional boring plot devices, no trendy Hollywood teens in tight shirts, no predictable writing. Just fresh original scares that will affect you for a long long time. This film began haunting me when I merely viewed the trailers several months ago on Haxan's Web site, I slept with the kitchen light on for 2 months, and since then I have been a proud Blairhead.",The Blair Witch Project

I saw it in the daytime on DVD :)The movie was interestingly done, it's as though you're actually watching an amateur student film. (A tad scratchy and repetitive in parts though) But honestly, again trust Hollywood to give Witches a bad name again ... When are they going to get it through their thick brick skulls that Witches and Pagans are Nature people that have always lived in Peace with Mother Earth? A movie about REAL witches is in order.Also, I felt it was the students' own fear that kept them trapped in the forest. The 'Blair Witch' or whatever evil spirit (real or imagined)that was there was obviously feeding from their fears and that is why they were trapped and none of them had the good sense to figure it out.A tad spooky in parts, but I was honestly more scared by ""Donald Duck's Halloween Special."" ...",The Blair Witch Project
460,JG2001,This movie will scare the hell out of you.,10,3 October 1999,"I can say without a doubt that The Blair Witch Project, beyond all the hype and the fact that it isn't real, is the scariest movie ever made. As the movie moves further along, the intensity will increase and keep increasing as if someone off screen were slowly turning a knob. It's hard to comment on this movie without giving to much away. As the film reached its climax, I was breathing hard and my heart felt like it was going to rip right out of my chest. When it was over, I was shaking all over, frightened out of my wits. It may sound silly, but that's what happened. It even reignited my fear of the dark. It's easy to make fun of the film from it's previews and the countless spoofs done on late night TV, but watch it and you'll probably be frightened too.",The Blair Witch Project

It had no intersting plot or actors or even worthviewing locations... yeah I know that it's an independent movie, but also is Reservoir Dogs, which I love... c'mon it's just not scary at all and has one of the crappiest endings i've seen.

462,koohii,I'm supposed to be scared by THIS???,2,20 August 2003,"I realize that this is one of those pop-culture movies that everyone is going to go see, just because. However, I can say that if you absolutely have to see this movie, pay as little as you possibly can to do so. Rent something else when you're at the video store, because chances are you're going to want to watch something else after about half an hour--maybe less.It amazes me that so many artsy-fartsy types are running at the mouth to praise this thing. OK, it was an independent film made with next to zero budget. OK, the actors were working improv without a script. Neither of those make this a good movie, or even an interesting movie. And granted, I am biased in that documentary is my least favorite style of filming.
The premise is that three film students are trying to make a documentary and get lost in the woods. There after someone/thing starts playing psychwarfare with them. Well, I'm not a film student, but there are two things I know to do when making a movie: Look up, and focus the damn camera! I also know how to point the camera at my face without giving it a view of the inside of my nostrils. The astounding stupidity of these people makes the movie so much worse.""Duh, we don't need a map!"" Anytime you're going camping off the main trails, the first thing you do is figure out exactly where you are going. Even if someone else is in charge, each individual should have a good idea of the geography.Another film theory nuisance: Color or Black&White. Choose!
I see little of interest or value to justify the praise this film is garnishing. I am not impressed. I am not scared. I am not enthused. I am not engrossed. In the end, I'm glad when the film is over, not because of a good ending, just because it is over.",The Blair Witch Project
463,nickthegun,"Whats all the hubbub, bub?",2,22 October 2002,"My official review of the Blair witch Project.I watched it again yesterday and it is still three of the most annoying half wits i have ever seen roaming around a wood for 90 mins, before getting whacked by a tramp.Could someone explain to me why this film is sooooo amazing? I grant you it's a great use of the budget', but so what? If I came across this on late night channel 4, I would have thought O.K student film. Annoying but has potential'. When it is putting itself up with the big boys it gets judged on its comparative merits. Which are very few. I was glad all three protagonists were murdered. I had so little sympathy for their whiny antics I felt like doing it myself. The acting was lame (But it was a low budget'. So what? They were still rubbish) and the ending was an anticlimax (albeit relief) to say the least.I have to say, though, I don't hate this film as much as I did. When Blair Witch mania hit I had every student and wannabe film critic telling me I had to see it' The indie film of the century' this'll show the big studios'. My personal backlash was so savage I couldn't have a conversation with anyone about it without shouting Your wrong! Its rubbish and you are stupid!'. But now I am calmer. But those who like it are still stupid. And as for those who say its one of the scariest films I have ever seen'",The Blair Witch Project

First time absolutely terrified me.Watching it in 2021, I'm surprised to report I find it just as chilling. It's the primal screams. The not knowing what's going on. Being persecuted for no good reason. The pleasure gained by some from the pain of others. The slow descent into despair and near lunacy. The verisimilitude that the cheapness of the production lends to it.It's good old-fashioned psychological horror with not a jump scare in sight and only the merest use of gore. Low budget always suits horror better when done well.",The Blair Witch Project
465,L_Miller,Did you hear something?,7,8 July 1999,"If that phrase makes your ears perk up and your heart pound a little, then you are a candidate for Blair Witch.Lots of people have written, so just a couple of comments:Don't expect Kubrick-esque composition or a Ry Cooder soundtrack; just a little story that touches most people in the small secret part of their brain that remembers when humans huddled around a fire and hoped those noises in the distance would pass them by.  Let's just say nobody's going to put the Blair Witch on a Taco Bell cup.Try and avoid the coverage before you see the movie. Particularly avoid film reviews and the '60 second movie' outfits of the world. You can still enjoy the film if you do read about it first (I did), but for maximum fear walk in with a blank slate.The JumpyCam[tm] is distracting, but necessary. Those who complain that the film 'looks cheap' should remember that it IS cheap; it was shot with rented equipment by three college kids stumbling around in the dark scared out of their minds.Before you do too many ""oh, well that's stupid"" comments about what these three kids do, remember that you're sitting in a nice warm theater and not out there alone in the dark. Who doesn't know someone (or is someone) who goes outside with a flashlight to check out a strange noise?  They make some mistakes, but ask yourself what you would do in that situation if you _didn't_ know your legacy was going to wind up buried under a cabin in the woods.I've heard talk of a sequel. Please, please don't do this. Don't ruin this little gem by trying to make it into a 'franchise'. Let it be a horrifying little slice of Americana and let it go at that. Please.Be careful about seeing this movie, because it is not easily forgotten.

466,ivony,It just creeps up on you...,8,21 May 2003,"When I first saw the previews for this movie, I didn't really know what to think, but I saw the website address flashed and decided to check it out. The website alone intrigued me and I really wanted to see this movie.  I still tried to go in without a lot of expectations...I hate spoiling a movie based on what I THINK it should be.  I'm glad I was able to do that since I ended up really enjoying this movie.Sure, there are some drawbacks to it:  the annoying Heather who can't stop screaming at everyone, the overuse of cuss words (but hey, they're college kids..I know I heard a LOT of that in college, so it really only added to the overall ""realness"" of it), and the unsteady camera work.  However, the unsteady camera movements I was able to deal with through its integration in the believability of the story of AMATEUR film makers out to explore the legend of the blair witch.  Anyone who makes home movies knows it can be difficult to keep a steady cam...especially when walking/running through the woods.  So, like I said, this really didn't detract too much from the overall experience.Now, all that negativity aside, I absolutely loved this movie.  The way it was done was so entirely different from the typical horror/slasher/thriller/etc movies.  Blair Witch was filmed as actual footage with little to no script whatsoever.  The storyline is slowly built up through interviews and conversations, allowing the viewer to get an idea of what is going on and what the young film makers are out to accomplish.  Once we are armed with this knowledge, creepy little inferences are made here and there building a nervousness that culminates in the final scenes.  It is incredible. 
I remember camping out in the woods of my backyard and fearing every little twig snap or the slightest sound.  Blair Witch brought me right back into those days.  Also, it was able to create a fear in me without having to hold my hand through the entire movie, and instead, letting my imagination run wild.  The best part being that fears were built withought ever having to really be shown anything.  All too often in movies the fear is lost once a film maker tries to show us what the ""monster"" or ""thing"" looks like...it just can't compare to what our mind's eye can depict.Overall, I give Blair Witch an 8 out of 10 stars.  If you can get past the sometimes nausea inducing camera work, you may find this is quite an interesting movie.",The Blair Witch Project

I realized that the final 5 minutes of the movie were really a lot more creepy than I thought while I watched.  I know it's been said, but the image in the room at the end of the film was truly chilling.  Oddly enough, I think this movie may be even better on video, in the dark and private confines of your living room, letting your imagination play without the disruption of bag candy and popcorn eating.  Really enjoyed the fact that the movie let you use your imagination instead of having the movie be your imagination.",The Blair Witch Project
468,Kelly G.,A new classic with only two minor flaws.,9,2 August 1999,"Since my comment will be buried under hundreds of others within weeks of it's posting, I'll keep it very brief.First of all, it's a classic. It met almost all of my expectations that the last three months of underground hype built up. Seeing this, I felt exhilarated that I was watching horror movie history unfold. It was kind of the equivalent of taking Mr. Peabody's Way-Back machine to the 60's to see the original ""Psycho"", or to the 70's to see ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".I only had two, VERY MINOR, problems.#1. The sound level. I know the directors wanted this to seem very real, and that digitizing the sound would have ruined the realism. But the movie was so quiet, I felt they lost an opportunity to utilize the sophisticated sound systems that most theatres have. The low volume also makes it possible to hear what other moviegoers are saying. I saw the movie in a packed house at midnight, and unfortunatly just a few jerk-off screen talkers who kept laughing at inappropriate moments almost totally ruined the vibe of the film. That's why I wanted it louder, I wanted something to drown them out.#2. I wanted a bit more back story. I knew that the web site to the film had lots of neat information about the town history of massacres, and how the tapes were found. To my surprise, almost none of that was in the film. Now I know that part of what makes this so scary is it's self-contained ambiguity. But I still wanted a little more near the beginning about the history of the town. The fact that the producers leaned too hard on the website for details was the one element of it's promotion I didn't care for.But as I said above, these are very minor quibbles that didn't keep me from enjoying what, ten years from now, will be considered to be a classic.",The Blair Witch Project

The Pol Pots, the Slobodan Milosevic's of the future. And here I have finally found the answer.People who like Blair Witch Project are a threat to society. They will accuse the nice, normal non-malevolent humans they share this earth with of not being as intelligent as they are. They will accuse them of lacking imagination. They will decide that all others are hopelessly brainwashed by the merciless manipulators of Hollywood.  They, their glorious selves, are ofcourse of sufficient mentality to be free of these pernicious horrors that afflict all others.It is only a matter of time until they try to obtain the power to decide who shall live and who shall die. And who shall be sent to re-education camps until they LIKE the Blair Witch Project. If you are one of these miserable people (such as Heather, Josh and Mike), please do all humankind a favor. Live your life, but make no attempt to obtain power of anykind. Love your families. Do not choose politics as a career.  Be kind to your parents as they age.  Do not become a teacher, a cop, a prison guard or a soldier.  Get a non-descript gentle job that aids society but generally is non-threatening, such as working for the Post Office.

473,kylopod,That was it?,6,26 October 2005,"One time as I entered a theater the usher was handing out 3D glasses for a short demonstration before the main film. After the previews finished and we were instructed to put the glasses on, there was a brief shot of a virtual theater in 3D, then it ended! Several members of the audience, including me, said in unison, ""That was it?""That more or less describes my feelings about ""The Blair Witch Project."" When it first came out in the summer of '99, a fellow told me that it was the scariest film he'd ever seen. That's what many critics had indicated as well. Since I love being scared, I eagerly went to the theater, thinking I was in for the experience of a lifetime.The movie tells the story of three college kids who do a research assignment, go on a long camping trip into the woods, and ultimately lose their way. As I watched the kids grow increasingly panicky and finally get separated, my interest began to perk...and then the movie just ended! I sat there in confusion. That was it? Where was the fear that everyone spoke about?My complaint is not that the film lacked violence. On the contrary, I'm genuinely tired of the sort of horror film where explicit gore substitutes for true terror. I believe that the most effective horror movies leave a lot to the imagination. Shortly after seeing ""The Blair Witch Project,"" I saw ""The Sixth Sense,"" which scared the pants off me without containing much explicit violence. A movie does not need violence in order to be scary, and, indeed, too much violence can detract from a movie's suspense. But one thing a good horror movie absolutely must do is establish a real threat, something that ""The Blair Witch Project"" does not do.In the early scenes, I was unable to make sense out of the local legends the kids were investigating. The stories that the residents tell are unconvincing and contradictory. One resident talks about seeing a ""white misty thing,"" another describes what he saw as ""an old woman whose feet never touched the ground."" This is the kind of naiveté associated with popular folklore like the Loch Ness Monster, and I could not connect any of it with the movie's later events.While we are told that the kids were never found, the footage presents no clear-cut evidence that anything actually happens in the woods, other than that the kids get lost. In one scene, Heather begins screaming frantically at something she finds in a pile of leaves. I later found out that she was supposed to have seen severed human parts, but that was far from clear to me. Fans somehow piece together the various sections of the film and concoct a coherent story of supernatural murder, but to me it looked more like a case of hysteria than an encounter with a Blair Witch.Despite my criticisms, this isn't a bad film. As a fake documentary, it is well-made. The kids look, talk, and act like real college students. While not scary, the film is far from boring. I enjoyed watching the story progress while giving the appearance of being something spontaneous.Curiously, the Razzie awards nominated both this film and Heather Donahue's performance as the worst of 1999, one of the few times I've disagreed with their selections. We tend to overlook how hard it is for actors to act like they're not acting. People who argue that Donahue's performance was over-the-top have never, I suspect, seen someone panic. There was not a moment in the film that felt wrong or fake to me. Perhaps the reason I didn't get scared is that I felt smarter than these characters, who behave in ways that I do not think I would have behaved in the same situation. But I still found their reactions plausible.If I was disappointed, it was only because the hype surrounding this film gave me a certain set of expectations, which failed to solidify. This movie was an early demonstration of the power of the Internet, a cheap $20,000 production that never would have attained so much popularity if not for a website that helped propagate the legend to the public as something real. It was more than just a film: it was an act of showmanship. This all amounted to an interesting demonstration, but not the sort of film I expect will endure.",The Blair Witch Project
474,nvillesanti,Blair will never let you go,9,10 April 2012,"I remember back in 1999, this film was marketed as a real event and that the events you were seeing were true and these people have actually disappeared. Of course, that wasn't the case but marketing it this way lured people to go see it, including me. Never have I seen such a film so original, that engaged me, and made me believe that what I was seeing was true since ""Cannibal Holocaust."" It is set in 1994 when a group of three student filmmakers were filming a documentary on a legendary witch known as Blair in Burkittsville, Maryland. As they go deeper into the woods they get lost and every night they hear strange sounds coming from the woods but they can't make what it is or where it comes from. As the days go by, they succumb in desperation as they can't find a way out of the dense woods. But even more horrifying is that someone or something is hunting them.After leaving the theater back in 1999, this movie would just not leave my mind for days. The acting was unbelievable, even more coming from unknown threesome of actors. It was shot in a first person point of view with the actors being the ones holding the camera giving it a new sense of realism, now this wasn't absolutely new style of filming. Cannibal Holocaust was filmed the same way but it hasn't been done in a long time. Also you never see what is hunting them; the movie forces the viewers to use their imagination and to fill in the gabs. Nowadays many movies try to copy the filming style of The Blair Witch but fall short. But what was even more amazing is that this little independent film, with a budget of nearly $30,000, earned over 240 million dollars at the box office. That is something you don't see every day.This film don't have the eye candy and gore other horror films have or elaborate setting or big names, it is simple, creative and extremely effective and I would dare say it is up there with films such as ""The Exorcist"" and ""Rosemary's Baby."" This film is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema and I strongly recommended it.",The Blair Witch Project
475,LT-10,Dissapointing And Not Scary,1,7 August 1999,"I am a 12 year old movie lover. I first heard of this film on Siskel & Ebert when they talked about the Sundance Film Festival. I really wanted to see it, could it be a movie that finally kept me up at night? The Exorcist couldn't do it but maybe this ""Scary as Hell"" movie could. I THINK NOT!!!! It started off so good with the interviews but it got messier ( camera wise) and all that happened was people running around saying ""Oh my god what the F*ck was that"". When all you heard was water dripping and sometimes someone laughing. Oh its such a good idea but its wasted! I really would love to make a movie like this but not screw it up! The ending when Heather and Michael were in the house was confusing. I dont wantt to give the ending away but was it the witch or that guy that killed 7 kids??? I hate how we never got to actually see what was chaseing these people! The acting though is really good, that would be the only really good thing in this movie.",The Blair Witch Project

There also are those who will claim the movie is not ""scary"" because it never shows what exactly is chasing/stalking the three students.  These type have missed the whole concept of the film.  The purpose is to confuse and disorient the viewer while showing the characters slowly breaking down into exhaustive fear.  The audience is never fully sure of what is happening and only sees a limited bit of the story through the lens of a camera focused as a point of view from whoever happens to be holding it at the time.  The audience is left with more questions than answers, but that seems to be the intent of the producers.It is the disorientation and limited visual information that help bring on the fear factor of the story.  The plot alone is weak, the dialogue is nothing special (it does appear to have been made up as the actors went along) and the cinematography is poor considering only the cameras' mounted lights or natural sun light were used.This movie works, though.",The Blair Witch Project

First of all, I did not like the characters. They were too cocky--I found myself rooting for the Blair Witch! The end did scare me, however. When Heather comes down the stairs and sees her friend standing in the corner, I gasped. That was the only scary part in this movie.I recommend people to see this movie because the idea is ingenious. A major motion picture shot on a minor budget. The concept is great, the film (I believe is 8mm) is great, and the story is pretty good.

Full marks to the writers/directors for originality. It certainly feels real, but simply isn't scary at all, only managing to be moderately suspenseful at times. It is films like this that remind me just how good Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" really is. There we have a film that masterfully builds up the suspense from beginning to end. ""The Blair Witch Project"" simply doesn't come close. A major disappointment and a film that suggests to me that all the critics that raved over the film and made it a must see film are really a bunch of wimps! 4/10",The Blair Witch Project
480,Sam_Gray,"a terrible film on several levels (sort of a spoiler, maybe)",2,3 February 2000,"I fail to understand the hype that surrounded this film when it was realized.  It's innovative in that no one has ever done a film like it, true, but that doesn't mean this innovation was a good idea.First, the idea that people thought the film was real disturbs me.  The fact that the end of the movie is immediately followed by the words ""Written and Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez"" should indicate that the story is fictitious.  And the film isn't even realistic anyway, not if you think about it.Case in point - I have heard the movie called a ""psychological masterpiece"" even though it is psychologically ridiculous.  Even though the characters are obviously in terrible danger, they continue to film what's happening to them.  One character thinly justifies this by saying that the camera filters reality and makes the situation seem less serious.  I don't buy that, especially not towards the end of the film when the characters know without doubt that something is out to get them.  The fact of the matter is that any real person probably would not only cease filming, but drop the camera all together and run.A further flaw of the film is its terrible dialogue and relative lack of characterization.  This problem is likely a function of the fact that the directors sent the actors out into the woods alone and allowed them to ""improvise.""  The end result is three one-sided characters that each possess only a single personality trait (for example, Heather is, shall we say, assertive - and nothing else).  Thus, the content of the dialogue amounts to: ""Goodness, this is weird.  Where's the car?""  Just add some cuss words. Oh, yeah, and someone ""kicks"" a map.What's worse is that the movie is anti-climatic.  Oh, it tries to climax, it just doesn't.  After about ninety or so minutes the film just sort of ends. And the scary part is supposed to be the unseen.  Whatever.  Maybe in some other movie.I'd give the Blair Witch Project a 2/10, but only because it at least isn't a cliche.  If you really want a good psychological horror, pick up the original Psycho instead.",The Blair Witch Project
481,yellowtail_tuna,We see things through the two shaky and grainy cameras,9,29 June 2020,"It is probably the most widely seen film that is in full found footage style, the style to pretend as if the event was accidentally recorded by the people involved, and later it was discovered by others.I imagine it must have been quite baffling experience for the audience in the theater at the time of its original release. How did they feel when the grainy amateur-quality footage was on the big screen and it contined for over 80 minutes?The plot is typical for horror movies. The main characters violate a taboo by intruding a forbbiden area only for their whimsical activity. We already know the result; they disappeared, probably died. Our interest is about how it happened.As they proceed into the woods, the mood is getting darker and darker, and they are gradually realising it has become too dangerous to enjoy thrill as they expected. They are encountering eerie stuff like cairns and stick figures. Tension between the three is rising. We see all the changes of situation through the two cameras. They are getting shaky and unstable, reflecting the holders' emotional state.At a first glance it may look like a tasteless jump scare film. But if you follow Heather's emotion, it turns out to be a story of regret and guilt. It culminates with the iconic close-up shot near the ending. I think it is very sincere and touching.",The Blair Witch Project
482,TheFinalAlias,If only negative ratings were possible.....,1,20 April 2009,"As anyone who has read my reviews for any length of time knows, I don't kiss ass when it comes to independent films. If it's a good film; I rate it accordingly, if it's a bad film; I do likewise. However....It's become one of my pet peeves that indie film fans demand that EVERY independent film be called nothing short of a masterpiece no matter how mundane it is, no compromise. It's this mentality that has resulted in my extreme dislike of indie films and their fans and filmmakers. Honestly; just because something was made without studio assistance and/or interference DOES NOT automatically make it a masterpiece, any more than having the hot new centerfold of-the-month makes the next Michael Bay film an Oscar contender. Yet, still the indie zombies insist that it does, supposedly this mentality comes from resenting Hollywood's excesses, such as taking away artistic control, bloated budgets, inattention to casting appropriate actors in favor of popular ones, and worst of all; annoying marketing campaigns. What BS.Indie films are guilty of many hypocrisies; but attacking marketing campaigns is their biggest; as endless marketing hype(along with pure stupidity)is the only reason anyone would have seen this clunker I'm currently reviewing.I can recall, quite vividly; the endless pop-up ads, the fan sites; official and(supposedly)unofficial, magazine articles, TV. specials, the merchandise, the relentless TV. commercials. Whew. The people who complain about the 'Dark Knight's marketing campaign just plain weren't ALIVE to not know the extent of this films marketing(which makes sense; since 99.9% of all the negative TDK reviews I've seen couldn't have been written by someone older than 5 or 8). TDK had NOTHING on this film's relentless marketing campaign.Trashing Hollywood for over hyping their products, then doing the same: that's the definition of hypocrisy. That alone would be justification enough to dislike TBWP and it's indie film moron cult and to call them hypocritical and give the film a 1 rating, even if it was a good movie, even if I had liked it.The fact that it also sucked as a film anyway just justifies my rating.The common defense is that this is some brilliant 'art-film' which introduced the concept of not showing the monster and leaving it to the imagination. BS. Val Lewton did the same thing a thousand times better during the '40's, with films which are classics of the genre: 'Cat People', 'The Seventh Victim'. etc. and in 1963; probably the best of all 'unseen' horror films; Robert Wise(a disciple of Lewton)'s 'The Haunting' was released; to borrow an indie film fan phrase: it PWNED 'Blair Witch'. All classics, all achieving their suspense without showing the monster. All before this film.But indie fans ignore all this; they claim those movies don't count because they are old and in black & white. Typical response from them, no respect for older film.As for the 'story' of this film and it's qualities; I wouldn't even give it a D if it was a student film. The device of not showing the monster comes off less as an artistic choice and more an excuse to film nothing but a couple of dumb-asses running around and passing it off as a film. I'll admit it's clever, heck, even Lewton originally adopted the device out of necessity, but he did it mostly because he recognized it's dramatic potential in the face of several alternatives. For the record, it is also a complete and utter rip-off of a much better film called 'The Last Broadcast', the difference being that there is a survivor. Really, otherwise it's the same damn thing, and it's the indie film fans who call Hollywood unoriginal(If only I could use the eye-roll emoticon).The story also sucks, 'Cannibal Holocaust' did the 'found footage' thing much better. The 'acting' is also awful; it's so forced you wonder if the witch is a legitimate legend even in the context of the story. The praise for characterization is true, though. I definitely felt something about the characters: I wanted all 3 of them dead within a minute. And even if, pray tell, the device of not showing the monster WAS original, or had been used well; does it REALLY matter if it's an awful film otherwise? Nope. At best, it just revives a long-dead gimmick.And for all the people who say it must be good because so many people thought it was real, let me ask you something: Have you ever heard the phrase 'Idiots will believe anything'? Grow up and watch some atmospheric, 'unseen' horror films that are actually good. This is no different than your usual incredibly stupid, vapid Hollywood slasher flick with annoying teenage victims, only without a slasher and not made by Hollywood, but still incredibly stupid , vapid and filled with annoying teenage victims.~",The Blair Witch Project

Like many people I believed this film was real. The way it was marketed gave it a sort of realism that no movie had ever done or has done sense. No one can capture the sort of realism that Blair Witch did. The creators took good care of their story, created an entire lore, bigger than the film itself and gives it a life of its own.

Undoubtedly inspiring to all, but sincerely not for everyone, the film is more than a horror film as it is barren of all gimmick and a real trail-blazer of the ""found-footage"" genre, the characters are so raw and believable that the audience almost feels unified with them in fleeing from something so frightening that it can't be felt or conquered, just simply acknowledged.

And if you are in a college film class, I think you would be deserving of all of the praise and accolades possible.  However, when you release that student film as a movie, then you are ripping off people to present it as a real movie.  There is about enough material for a good 20 - 30 minute film, maybe.  But, stretching this one act play into a movie made it tedious and redundant.  And while the idea is clever, it wears thin  when stretched out.

For the last two minutes of its 90 minute running time. These last moments are shot at breakneck speed, with little dialogue and the green glow that comes from using a video camera at night. If this part of the film was made into a five minute short it would be looking at an eight or nine out of ten. As it is, the rest of the film is so mind-numbingly awful that it's one of the few films I've given a one.This is not because of the cheapness of the film - cheap was the only real option for a film of this type, and picture quality should have no bearing on how good a film is. It's not because of the basic story - which is actually quite a good idea for a film. No, what really does The Blair Witch Project in is the terrible execution and annoying acting. During the day the three leads wander around a forest shouting at each other. At night they hear a tiny little sound then run around in the darkness screaming. And I'm talking complete and utter darkness. All there is consists of darkness and screaming. It's boring and not scary at all. And it goes on like this.Do not, under any circumstances, pay to watch this film. Wait until it's next on television and just watch the last few minutes. It's for your own good.

491,Z21708,A fantastic found footage horror flick,9,16 October 2020,"Let me get this out of the way. The scary part of this film isn't the witch, but rather the paranoia and unending stress and fear that the characters in this film experience. I first saw this film on Amazon Prime, and currently own it on DVD, and I love it. The characters are likable and feel quite realistic, and the best part of this film is that not much truly happens. It's not like Paranormal Activity where there is something supernatural going on, and the fear of that entity is driving them to insanity. However, I feel that the lack of any true supernatural occurrences except for a few key moments in the film adds to the suspense and the fact that these characters are being driven to near insanity by their own fear, stress, and anxiety of the fact they think there's something out there.If you saw this film back when it first came out (which I did not), you likely thought that the occurrences and events in this film actually happened, and this truly was a piece of found footage film. But I don't think that's the scary part of The Blair Witch Project. The scariest part, as I stated before, is the fear and anxiety the characters in this film experience even though there may not truly be anything out there.

Heather, Mike, and Josh of course, just happened to have their cameras running at the right times for us to get a full sense of the picture.

It was an odd experience for me since I just picked up Stephen King's THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON, a shorter novel about getting lost in the woods. Back to BWP.  The premise works.  What does not work is some of the irritating camera work, the fact that the girl (who is ""directing"" a documentary) does less directing than her crew, and the way that the BW is shown.

The movie could be made on an extremely tight budget.  The shaky camera work and poor film quality would actually do the film a service, by making it seem all the more genuine.  And, finally, the movie could rake in a fortune because, when you think about it, who doesn't like to hear a good ghost story, every so often?

It is true, there is little ""action"" in at least the first half of the movie. However, this is not meant to bore the audience but merely get under the character's skins. The great thing about the characters in Blair Witch, is that they are gritty, flawed people. They are not glamorous, sometimes not that likeable, like real life. The writers do not make any attempt for you to like them. This emphasises the fact they are real people and respond in a violent manner to an all-too real siuation.There is practically no gore in this movie. The script is very repetitive- but when does a 20th century young American talk like Macbeth? And the ""acting"" lacks dynamics.

That was a mediocre movie even, but this is simply a waste of time in my opinion! Watch the last 5-10 minutes or something and you won't waste the one and a half hour I did!

Just try to put yourself in the character's situation. You'd panic and lose your mind too.The movie consists of the ""real"" footage that was ""found"" in the woods, that involved three college students, Heather, Mike, and Josh, filming a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. First they interviewed several people. Then they headed out into the woods. When they got there, they lost the map, started freaking out, and everything went downhill from there. They found, and heard a lot of evidence that the Blair Witch might be out there. Soon, they realized they were being stalked by something, but they already became hopelessly lost, and scared. Soon, the camera fell over, and they disappeared.This movie is actually truly scary. Not because it shows jump-out surprises, or shocks, but the behavior of the characters is what's scary. ""How can you be scared by people being scared?"" said one comment. The answer is that it's not them being scared that scares us. It's the thought of what they're scared of. You never know what could be out there, and there's no way of finding out (the sequel ruined this). The movie was set up as a publicity stunt, and became an internet phenomenon. This movie cheesed off many film goers who were expecting to see a horror movie in the style of the ""Scream"" movies. I praise everyone who understands the greatness of this movie.By the way, the movie is very, very scary. When I saw it, I knew I would be disturbed, but this movie shattered my spirits for many months because it was so scary to me. The fact that the movie is COMPLETELY FICTIONAL, wasn't enough to cheer me up. Showing it to a friend was the only thing that could help me feel even a little better. What's weird is that I've almost never been scared by a movie before.No special effects, no gore, just shocking realism. If you don't appreciate that, I pity you. Go watch ""Scream"" (Good movie). That's REALLY scary. I give this movie 8/10.It is rated R for Language. Sex: 1/10 Violence: 3/10 Swearing: 10/10 Drugs: 3/10",The Blair Witch Project

That shows just how naive we were about the internet in the 90's. That can be the only explanation for how this movie made so much money, about $250 mil on a budget under $100,000. If I'd done some viral, guerilla marketing about a film I'd made of paint drying it might have made $100 mil at the time. There's little more to watch in this movie. There's nothing redeeming. The characters are not, they're thoroughly unlikeable. Despite the fact that this is suppose to be real (some people actually thought it was, which unbelievable to me), everything seems manufactured, and in the end nothing happens. Elementary school haunted houses create more tension and horror.

I watched this last night for the first time and can say for sure it was probably the most creepy movie I have ever seen. Who cares if it was a hoax its a great movie. The acting is almost impromptu which really adds to the greatness of this movie and gives it a genuine feel. The cameras that they used were used superbly and switching to a Black and White camera for night time usage was brilliant. There is no music in this movie which adds to the suspense of the evil chatterings that occur at night time. The ending of the film was amazing and the last 10 minutes or so will really scare the hell out of you. All in all a great film which everyone should watch. Its much better than the trashy horror thats out at the moment: ie Hostel! I still enjoy flicks like saw and saw 2 because they are a great concept but there not scary.

I tried to keep an open mind, ignoring people who were really scared by it, or adversely thought it was totally boring.  I really enjoyed it.The whole concept of the film is probably its best feature.  It was extremely well marketed, prompting some people to think that it was real footage.  You believed that you were watching three students lost in the woods, experiencing genuine fear and anger.  Anyone who has ever camped in a forest will relate to strange noises in the night, and how scary they can be. It isn't for the unimaginative, who has seen every scary gory horror flick, and wants to have everything laid out for them.  Your own imagination is what makes this film so frightening.  Aside from personal opinions on how scary it is, the concept is excellent.  Very original and simple.  One of the lowest budgeted films to come out this year, but very entertaining, proving that you don't need mega-bucks to tell a good story, or give people a few moments of terror.I was freaked out by it more than I realised.

The only thing left behind is this footage that they shot during their investigation. At least, that is what the filmmakers want us to believe in this cheaply shot, extremely monotonous effort. The films consists of ad-libbed footage from the actors who play the students and the result is a slightly creepy pseudo-documentary. The three young actors are believable, but the film gets fairly dull throughout, especially in the daylight scenes. The film is probably a better idea than film.",The Blair Witch Project

After that they decide to head south but they keep ending up back in the same place. The only thing is that this film has a slight suspenseful atmosphere but apart form that...nothing. I saw just about under half of the movie and i couldn't go on, it was so boring. What else I don't understand is that there are two guys and a girl in the forest. Obviously they're going to stressed. No sex? I mean come on, they had the best stress reliever right at their fingertips and nothing? Not even a kiss for fuc*s sake!No Horror, no sex...nothing.

At first I was a bit alarmed at being by myself in a dark theatre with a supposedly scary movie. I know realise the place was empty because word of mouth had already got around about what a dog this film is.Far from being scared, I was BORED, BORED, BORED. Three extremely annoying people walking around and around in circles getting nowhere for what seemed like an ETERNITY. At one stage I even shouted at the screen ""For God's sake, get on with it."" (It's amazing how brave being the only patron makes you.)And what about those three. They were so APPALLING I couldn't wait for whatever it was out there to start knocking them off. Especially that whiney woman.The final sequence redeemed things SLIGHTLY be being genuinely creepy, and it earns the 1 point I have awarded it.The makers traded so much on their independence and originality, but being independent is not a virtue in itself.

Let's not fool ourselves, by thinking that this is the best horror film since the ""Exorcist"". The whole film is based on the premise that it is supposed to be real. By taking this first step in your imagination, then you can begin to appreciate it. Most of the horror comes from our own imagination, hardly anything is spoon fed (the slasher movies comes to mind which are so graphic in detail, it leaves little to the imagination). You'll have to put the old grey matter in to first gear to try and step into the character's shoes. The film, if nothing else, is realistic. We see the three characters spiralling deeper and deeper into breakdown and insanity. Their ability to think logically is turned upside down as they get more and more lost in the woods. Strange sounds at night, wierd symbolic objects in the morning doesn't help their sanity much either. The ending is abrupt, and an anti-climax for sure. But the horror of the film doesn't start until you go home and think about the film.

You know from the get go that these people aren't going to make it out alive.  So the only thing that is left is the terror that these people have to endure.

So if you wanted to see this movie thinking a hockeymask-wearing maniac jumps from the bushes, lopping heads off with an axe, you've been heavily misinformed. You can't be cheated, nothing of the sort was ever stated in the ads. This is a movie about REAL terror, not about 7 foot mutes who get up after stabbing them 20 times with a pitch fork. Those who say they've never been remotely scared or at least feeling uneasy when hearing strange sounds in the woods at night, read no further. You don't really exist. I dare you to really watch this movie, try to experience it, and then go out in the woods at night and say you're totally cool when you hear children crying out in the dark, or twigs snapping all around you as if you're surrounded by a group of unknown animals or even humans.I must honestly say i knew about the hype when i saw this movie, and still wasn't disappointed, because once again, i KNEW there was going to be no Jason hiding in any barn waiting for an unsuspecting victim to foolishly come strolling in just to get spliced into ribbons of human flesh. I expected frustration, anger, fear, hysteria and downright TERROR. You know, the emotions real people have when in a situation like this. That's why the acting was perfect. These were real flesh and blood people who first got uneasy, then frustrated to getting more scared with each abnormal sound or found object. Real people yell at each other when frustrated and get hysterical when at the end of their emotional ropes. The photography and editing was perfect too. To people saying it was amateuristic: HELLO,WAKE UP! The whole idea of the movie is based on the premise of amateur filmmakers making the footage we, as an audience, see when they go into the woods. If these amateur filmmakers made professionally shot footage, then it would have been an amateuristic movie. The whole thing is brilliant. Right upto and including the nerve-wrecking ending. If you only have about 50.000 dollars to spend and want to make to make the best movie you can make with that kind of movie, this is how you make it.Remember: Godzilla cost over 100 million dollars.

It is a criminally underrated film, often critically snapped for being a giant cheap gimmick or scare tactic, also, the rather grim, terrifying and unrevealing conclusion left some disappointed. Yet having the mystery unrevealed is what makes this titles so compelling, what is hunting down these characters and why, what form does the presence take, what is the meaning of all these signs, rocks and symbols, it is this confusion that creates the claustrophobia and fear. that feeling of impending doom is maintained throughout the piece. The amateur actors are simply fantastic, applying Stanislavski method acting techniques to give their performances vivid realism. This film really has to be seen to be believed, just don't expect a blood bath, or an all out scare fest, this one is a pressure cooker of suspense, tension and claustrophobia, its a slow builder and requires a patient viewer.Verdict: Masterpiece",The Blair Witch Project

526,barfly99,"Flawed but clever, and provokes amusing criticism",6,30 May 2000,"TBWP has many flaws - the implausibility of some of the characters' behaviour, the irritation factor of watching people bicker for an hour, and so on. That said, it is an interesting little film with some clever touches (the interviewee's child covering her mother's mouth; the handprints in the house etc.). Scary? Not really, but then that couldn't be more subjective could it? THE EXORCIST had some people vomiting in the aisles yet it doesn't scare me at all (but the reverse could be true of another film). Anyway I personally I give TBWP six out of ten. What I find hilarious is the nature of the criticism this film has received since its release, which is almost as OTT as the hype that preceded it.Most of those people who insist that is the worst film ever made are as one-eyed as those who said a year ago that it was the best. I notice that the early comments on the IMDb were nearly all hysterically complimentary, and now they're nearly all hysterically savage. There's nothing like a good bandwagon to jump on is there? (Or did the film suddenly metamorphosize from a classic to a turkey sometime last autumn?) This isn't the worst film ever made; there are countless worse (see the IMDb's own ""100 worst"" list for some prime examples). Harbouring unfettered resentment at the film-makers because you've seen an over-hyped movie is hardly a platform for objective criticism. If anyone had seen a film of this standard on late night TV and not cared for it they'd have turned it off and forgotten about it, and certainly not worked themselves into a frenzy about how awful it was. I particularly enjoyed reading the comments of those BWP-haters on here who remarked upon the ""suckers"" and ""idiots"" who actually watched it (can you spot something of an own goal here?).The oft-repeated refrain that this film is ""cheap"" and ""amateurish"" beggars belief. Since it was made cheaply by then-amateurs, was hyped as a cheap film made by amateurs, and purports to be a cheap documentary made by amateurs, I would have thought its cheapness and amateurishness was rather to be expected. Given that the protagonists are supposed to be making little more than a home movie, the complaint about the jerky camera movements in this context is especially absurd - or would you have Heather & Co. set up dollies, cranes, and so on as they flee through the woods? If you've automatically got it in for this style of film-making (and you'd have to have been on Mars not to have known how TBWP was shot) why go and see it?THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT has actually gone up in my estimation because it's reminded me of the power of movies to provoke the audience, and the public reaction to this film has been priceless. My absolute favourite comment I keep reading is ""I could have made this!""

Some critics said that it's the scariest movie they've ever seen, even scarier than THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE EXORCIST.  Well, I wouldn't go THAT far.  This movie is extremely well-made and well-acted, and the filmmakers certainly deserve credit by stretching their shoestring budget extremely well.  The film is shot entirely with a video camera and a 16mm black and white film camera.  The woods where the three ambitious young filmmakers go to explore the Blair Witch legend are claustrophic and creepy.  The film borrows inspiration from many horror films such as THE EVIL DEAD, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, DELIVERANCE, FRIDAY THE 13TH, and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. The difference here is that there is virtually no blood or gore on display, which will no doubt disappoint some viewers.  The emphasis is on the characters' psychological and mental deterioration as they get lost deeper and deeper in the woods.  The only complaint I have about the film is that it doesn't really pay off by the conclusion.  It builds a reasonable amount of tension, especially during the nighttime scenes, and we keep waiting for some big revelation, and we don't really get it.  Time and again scenes keep building and toying with us, and we expect to jump out of seats by something scary, but it never happens.

Some of the post release hype was over the top.  Actually, the documentary on the film was probably the best part.The acting was pretty decent, but the way it was done sucked.  I couldn't like any of the characters.  I also hated the way that the entire movie was one screaming match followed by another.  There was too much yelling and screaming to keep my interest.  Plus, while not being a prude or anything, I've never been much of a fan of using the 'F' word in place of dialogue.

The filmmakers just tried too hard to make it look real. As a result, we do get some decent acting, but if you're looking for a real plot, look elsewhere. The story just rambles along at an extremely slow pace. We get mysteries throughout, and a few minor shudders, and there was a spookiness to the cinematography, but the way it was shot was just too claustrophobic to be compelling. As far as the story, it was basically a standard ""kids lost in the woods"" movie with all the clichés attached. They lose the map! They're going around in circles! Ooh, there are scary things happening outside the tent while they're sleeping! And those weird twig things! By the end of the movie, we're hungry for some kind of explanation as to what is going on. We never get it. What we get is an extremely cryptic ending that is too esoteric to make sense. I thought the sequel was supposed to explain what was going on?!? The sequel just went in a completely different direction, and it didn't make any sense either! By the way, I thought this was supposed to be a trilogy. Where's the third movie? Like I said, the acting isn't bad, but it's not great either; they actually look like film students doing a bad student film. The dialogue is awful. The movie is boring. And it doesn't make any sense. I think a lot of people were lulled in by that cutting-edge marketing gimmick, and maybe ended up confusing the gimmick for the movie itself. That's the only explanation I can see for people liking this movie. In my opinion, it was a con, and should have been a bomb. Instead, it was one of the most successful independent movies of all time, and because no real care went into the making, possibly the most profitable. I'm not going to down you if you liked this movie; I felt like I wasted my time watching it, and would have actually been angry if I had paid to see it in the theater.",The Blair Witch Project

What offended me is that they were stealing my money and underestimating my intelligence.  The reviewer who praised their marketing skills hit the nail right on the head.

I mean, that's the basic outline of the film, but, to me, ""The Blair Witch Project"" was more of a survive-in-the-middle-of-nowhere, distinctly amateurish indie flick.We never really get to know the three college kids (unless you count their foul-mouthed comments and antics as character development). And, come on, as a member of the so-called ""Generation X"" group of kids, would we really stand around and drool whenever we found out that there was no way out of here and that we were going to die? I don't think so. I think we would've put up a fight. We might not have won, but we would have certainly died trying.In short, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is sometimes eerie, but never scary. I suppose this is one of those movies that is meant to be more psychologically stirring than, say, the cat-jumps-out-from-the-corner genre filmmaking.

A year after their travel their footage was found, and the movie is their footage put together.'The Blair Witch Project' is a creepy psychological horror film. Stepping away from hack 'em up slasher movies, Blair Witch is more of a 'what was that noise?!' kind of film. Your imagination plays host a lot of the time. The more wild your imagination runs the more scared you get.And certainly it's not a 'jump out of your seat' scary film, its more of a 'jump out of your mind' film. During the film there were two scenes that were extremely creepy, but the ending is the best part (or worst depending on how you look at it!). Coming up to the end I was rather disturbed, but the final scenes tipped me over the edge. The final scene had me in tears I was so scared and disturbed, I was almost shaking.And through all the scares it actually contains quite a bit of humour. I was impressed with the three leads, all conveying a sense of terror in their own way. Heather is a really nice character, I would have like to have seen more of her.

And, of course, the fact that it seemed like anything could happen at any moment.I'm tired of these popcorn films, where you chow down and watch a show. I wanted a real movie going experience, and I got it with Blair Witch Project.But nothing like this can ever be made again, and the fact that this movie turned out well is also something that really was a miacle. Put people in the middle of the woods, with cameras, and little notes that were scripts, and hoping they could act well enough to keep us involved. It was really the three actors who should be appreciated, not the writers or the director.

I choose option two, since you have no idea what's hunting these kids you have to picture it yourself, and we got more fantasy then anyone else to create your own fear.You probably know the plot already, 3 Kids is making a documentary about the Blair Witch legend, before going out in the woods they gather up some info for the film, some people actually said they've seen the witch, and they make their own description,which you can picture yourself how the witch looks. They kids, or they are more like youngsters, go out in the forest. They go lost and seems to walk around in circle whatever they go, on the night they hear horrific sounds and it seems like they are not alone out there, someone or something is haunting them.I'm not the horror kind of guy, but i heard of this movie and i decided to have a look. I saw clips in 7 parts on you tube (kinda lame i know :P) but i decided not to pay for anything i haven't seen yet. It gives you the thought, what's hunting these kids and why? The entire movie is filmed with a hand cam, which is kinda confusing in some parts.Scary?

But, scary? No f***ing way!!!!!! The camerawork, the characters and the story were pretty realistic but not all of the time. The film was to short and didn't have, as far as I know, any real scary moments. The ending of the film was one of the worst and most sudden I've ever seen. I think it's unbelievable that this film has made so much money, all the hype made this movie seem one of the best ever made, but in essence it is a pretty big flop. It's amazing that I still give it a 6 out of a 10, but that's only because the style of the film is very original when compared with other movies and it has it's realistic moments.

543,SteakSalad_101,By far...the worst horror movie I've ever seen,1,22 April 2008,"I very, very rarely write reviews for films that I don't see in the theater. However, this is a gross exception. Now you may think I am writing this review because the film I saw was a spectacular piece of cinema, something worth drooling over, spending $20 on and watching every Friday night with a different group of friends. But noI am writing this review to tell you that if you ever so much as THINK of seeing it, I strongly recommend you to reconsider your decision.Those who know me, know I love a scary film. The original 'Saw' is the only horror movie I have seen that managed to scare me. I picked up The Blair Witch Project after it had been called the scariest film since the Exorcist, genuinely frightening, and among other critics' ravings, I knew I had to give it a shot. So I made myself some tea, some popcorn, and sat down in the middle of the night and put it into my DVD player to watch on my big projection screen TV. All alone with the Blair Witch Project. Some may say, quite a daring thing to do! I may say, quite a laughable thing to do. (that is, laughable in the sense of me thinking I actually was going to be scared.) The Blair Witch Project is 87 minutes of pieces of footage collected by three young adults who go filming a documentary on the Blair Witch legend deep in the woods of Maryland. After interviewing several locals about the legend, they trudge into the woods, only to become horribly lost. They begin seeing strange thingssticks that look like witches, babies crying out in the middle of the night, rocks that magically appear in piles outside their campsyou know. The stuff from your absolute scariest nightmares.So basically we have these three stupid people who DON'T stop cursing (130 F-bombs in one film) and these poor souls just can't find their way out of the woods. About 75% of the film is made up of footage of these people crossing streams while saying ""turnip! I hope I don't fall!"" and ""I thought we already WERE traveling south!"" The other 25% is made up of them crying during the night in their camps saying ""Jesus kissing Christ, what the kissing turnip was that?! turnip!"" While leaves rustle outside, rocks fall, and voices murmur. Then the morning comes. And they go back to crossing streams. Except this time, their map is gone. Ooh! The Blair Witch took the map! Getting scary, eh? Yeah, right. Then the night comes again. More ""turnip! ITS BACK! turnip! WHERE THE turnip IS JOSH?! turnip!"" Then the morning comes.you get the idea.I kept thinking ""This has GOT to get scarier, maybe the film hasn't gotten going yet."" I was saying that throughout the whole film. I was even saying it during the final scene, and then the credits came up, and I was like WTF? Is there more? Wow, guess not. To be honest, that's what the Blair Witch Project is. And I'm not being funny or making it seem dumb for the sake of this review's successI'm being completely serious.All three of the people are laughable. Heather Donahue, who is an actress I love the work of, is the only one who seems mildly genuinely unsettled. The other two just scream like idiots. And then more F-bombs are dropped. Give me a BREAK already.So yeah. Then we get to the final scenethey find a house in the woods. Pretty scary. They go in, they hear screams in the basement, and their cameras drop. THE END! Roll credits. I was thinking to myself, ""They just used an hour and a half of camera time for something that could've been shown in literally five minutes."" Now, I am not saying that the three people in this situation weren't scared, or wouldn't be scared. It's a pretty creepy set-up. But watching it on a screen? Bleh. It's just three stupid people who can't get out of the woods and who scream and curse at random noises they encounter. Last night I had a dream Nathan Radley from To Kill A Mockingbird snuck into my house, hacked my computer, and stole my kitchen table. And even that was scarier than this terrible movie. I'm not trying to be funny either.So, in conclusion: mix three stupid people, a big woods, 130 F-bombs, and a bunch of weird noises that don't make sense, and you've got yourself The Blair Witch Project. I mean come ongimme a break. Or, better yet, give YOURSELF a breakand never see this movie.Come on, filmmakers! Give me another 'Saw' to scare me! This is your best shot?",The Blair Witch Project

Unfortunately it's been overdone at this day in age, but this being the first film to attempt anything like this, it was pretty good.

Instead of trying to scare us with adding a musical score and countless jump scenes, it slowly builds and scares us with the possibility of what's out there. To me, that can be way scarier than actually seeing what's out there. For those of us that don't need gore in their horror movies, The Blair Witch Project is a real treat, and much better than most movies coming out today that pass as horror movies. For those that hate this movie simply because it's not real: Newsflash, most movies aren't real!

546,Habibi-Universe,"Do you believe in the ""Blair Witch""?",5,30 October 2020,"Well... that was rather unsatisfying.
'The Blair Witch Project' (1999) was directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez and it is about three film students vanishing after traveling into a Maryland forest to film a documentary on the local ""Blair Witch"" legend, leaving only their footage behind. This film basically started the whole ""found footage"" trend or at least popularized it as far as I know!How is this film? First of all, what was really striking to me, was that the film's runtime is only about 80 minutes which is very short for a feature film. Having said that, I would have probably cut the film down to about an hour to make it a bit fresher and tighter!A majority of this film takes place in the forest. I think it is very relatable that being in the forest while it's completely dark is a pretty scary and unsettling thought.
One thing that I definitely need to commend this film for, is that the characters are very well written.
Here we have a bunch of youngsters trying to make the next big thing happen, very quickly realize that they got themselves into a situation that they did not anticipate and therefore don't know how to deal with!
If you think that there are not those kind of people out there, then you have way too much faith in the human race!My big problem with this film is that, even though it is pretty entertaining, it is such an incredibly slow burn without anything really happening!
This film lacks substance!
In my opinion this horror picture doesn't do anything ground-breaking that I can appreciate. As far as the found footage usage is concerned, I can at least say that it makes the best possible use out of that specific film technique, a technique that I am generally speaking not a fan of.Overall, 'The Blair Witch Project' (1999) is a horror film that only fans of that particular style will gravitate towards!",The Blair Witch Project

It seemed to me that no one had any original ideas out there in movie land. Well, that's what I thought until I saw The Blair Witch Project. This isn't a movie, it's art. The characters in this film are all normal and believable, which has become a rarity in horror. The fact that this film is so real is what gives it it's greatest impact. The way the movie is shot through hand held cameras makes you feel as if you're there as all the events are unfolding. Will this movie scare you? That depends. If you're a true horror fan then you're going to get the most from this movie. The fear of the unknown is truly going to scare you. But if you're part of this whole ""Scream Generation"" of horror fans then you may not get everything this film has to offer.

I thought I was going to be one of those cynics, but after viewing, I was pleasantly surprised. Okay, so the hype may be excessive, and the editing was a bit too neat for it be considered ""real footage"", but overall it was a genuinely creepy, thoroughly fascinating and innovatively made film. It's not very scary, definitely not as terrifying as ""The Exorcist"", but it's harrowingly realistic footage style is a refreshing change from everyday blood-and-guts material. ""The Blair Witch Project"" has been called ""a masterpiece"" and ""brilliant"", I wouldn't go that far, but it's movie that definitely stands above the rest, proving that the most effective chills are through minimalism. The two eeriest parts for me were the ""What the f**k is that???!"" chase through the woods (which looked extremely menacing) and the very final scene, which was just chilling to bone. The performances by the three actors were impressive, especially Heather Donahue's. Although they are screaming hysterically at each other most of the time, we were still able understand perfectly why they were so angry and terrified. More information on the Blair witch would of made the movie a bit more clearer, we would of known what exactly was so horrific about her, the makers should of made Heather recite more passages out of her book. The famous ""I'm so sorry"" speech given by Heather near the end unfortunately had no effect on me, but I'm pretty sure it wigged out some people. So in all, ""The Blair Witch Project"" has a few flaws, but it's definitely a horror film worth seeing.",The Blair Witch Project

Now that the film is becoming more and more hyped, I KNOW that there is going to be some serious backlash about this film not being scary enough...but I've just got to say: ALLOW yourself to be sucked into the idea...you're lost in the middle of the woods...you hear voices and screaming outside of your tent...you get progressively more hungry, tired, and frantic as the days wear on and you lose hope...it's SCARY!!!

Now, granted, sitting in a movie theater surrounded by tons of people, knowing that I would be able to go out into the bright sunlight when the movie was over....yes, that makes the movie less scary. But the point for me was just the fact that these three kids just completely lose their minds and their humanity in the middle of the woods. Just think about it...these three kids disappear and then a year later you find their footage: it's not about scary stick figures hanging in trees or creepy voices in the middle of the night. It's about three kids completely losing their humanity and desperately searching for ANYTHING to cling to. I thought that the ending was terrifying. And I thought that it was terrifying not only due to the creepy situation they find themselves in at the end of the movie...but even more so because these kids were just sick with terror and had lost all hope!!!

At the end of the movie the audience sat for a moment in stunned silence not because they were scared to move but simply in the sudden realization that they had been victims of a massive marketing con-trick. In years to come people will remember how they were taken in by all the hype while the reviewers who hailed the movie as 'genuinely frightening and disturbing' will hang their heads in shameful embarrassment at the memory of how they were so easily duped. OK so the movie was 'original' but even an 'original' horror film should make you jump or at least leave you feeling uneasy. Does anyone really care what happens to these obnoxious, foul-mouthed young people. I was hoping the girl who led the expedition would be bumped off as quickly as possible, so that my ears could be spared her ranting. And are we seriously expected to believe that she would just carry on filming despite being scared to death and in a state of complete panic?

The creative team made a full on universe of a supernatural element happening in the real-world and was publicized as such. There were mockumentaries all over the television and internet before the movie was released saying it was ""authentic found-footage"" making this a ""snuff"" film.The lore in the documentaries almost make it must-see so that what happens in the film chills you to the bone as it all starts coming back to you. The acting in the documentaries are very convincing too as they had many talented people fabricate a mythological story that never existed.Cannibal Holocaust and the Last Broadcast came before this and are equally great faux found-footage films. All 3 should be praised.It's just an awful shame that this movie suffers because, during the giant influx of young youtubers reviewing films will never know the terror of the unknown questioning conventional human standards.The acting is entirely improvised with small clues by the crew harassing them at night and taking away their food for 8 days.

557,gardnernrg,The Blair Witch Project?,6,10 July 2020,"I'll start off by saying this. In no regards is this film bad. Absolutely not. This is a good film that still lives up to its hype, 21 years after release. It is a classic in the horror genre, that every horror fan needs to watch.That being said, this isn't a perfect film either. Many times throughout the film I found myself dozing off, as there wasn't much happening, and it wasn't integral to the storyline/plot. And while I'll rip on the found footage style right now, I'll praise it in a second. The sudden jumps in footage as the characters stopped recording and then resumed can be terribly confusing. I found myself once or twice chasing my tail trying to figure out what just happened. These are most of the bad things, and of course there are others, but these are the things that made me rate it 6.Now for the good things. Estimated $60,000. For instance, Jordan Peele's ""Us"" has an overall rating .4 higher than this. The budget for that? Estimated $20mil. For $60k this movie does so much! It delivers such an amazing performance for the little budget it had. Now, I said I'd get to the found footage style. I already ripped on that, now to praise. Coincidentally, they are kind of the same thing. The found footage style, where I found myself chasing my tail, was an incredible way t deliver this story. Earlier on, the characters are sane and have their wits about them. The storyline is clean and precise. Slowly as the movie progresses more and more sudden and big cuts/jumps come along, and almost simulate what the characters were feeling in that moment. For what this film promises, it delivers. A college film student documentary. Not professional acting, editing, shooting, etc. This film does what it says and does it in a great way. Has its flaws, but a good horror film nonetheless.",The Blair Witch Project
558,mcrpghk,A Brilliant and Terrifying Movie!,10,15 March 2021,"My first experience with this film was scary, I love horror movies and I always prefer something that scares me psychologically than free scares and that sense of threat that disappears as soon as we left the cinema or turned off the TV, and this movie managed to catch me in a unique way.His idea in his debut season was genius, nowadays it is already cliché to try to sell the film as ""fact-based"" to intimidate the viewer, the films of the saga ""The Conjuring"" that say it, monstrous nuns and a cursed room that invokes all kinds of evil creatures? Forget it, if I was in 1999 or found these recordings on some obscure internet site I would believe in the veracity of the recordings.All the propaganda and marketing behind the idea is what makes it so memorable and unique, something that couldn't be done these days without anyone discovering the scam in a week or two, even the Blair Witch Project website (Which remains active) is remarkably amateurish, which gives more veracity to the story of the lost young people who planned to make a documentary.Although the genre found footage is spent today, this film still remains well because most of the films that came later did not understand the basic principle of the genre, amateur recordings can not have quality, it is strange when we see a movie that uses the concept of amateur footage, but the quality of the camera is great, or the person who is filming seems a professional manipulating a Arriflex 535 , does not pass realism, taking away the immersion of the audience.In Blair Witch The Found Footage works because from the beginning it is already established that our protagonists are amateur filmmakers, thus showing that they already have a certain skill with the camera, besides the quality of the footage is very bad even for the time when the film was recorded (1994) either because their equipment was not the best or because the ""tapes found"" were deteriorated by the time.
The performances are perfect for the film, since none of the actors followed a script, but rather improvised their lines and actions, passing a real feeling that that recording really happened.But what's so scary about the movie? The fact that it could all be something real, the city is real, the citizens are real, the legend really exists in the city and the actors really entered that seemingly haunted forest, as much as it is a movie, anyone could have those ideas in real life (and in fact they had since the city turned into a baderna with a huge number of tourists visiting , whether to meet her, hunt the witch or look for those three lost young men).
Moreover at no time does the film explicitly show supernatural things happening, everything we see on screen could easily be effected by evil people, at the beginning of the project the citizens of the city themselves talk about some criminal cases that had occurred there a few years ago, including cases that correspond directly with the last minutes of the film.
Also, the actions of the protagonists are very real, how many times have we seen characters acting in the stupidest and most irrational way possible in horror movies? In this film, they act in a way that anyone could act on, especially in the state of madness, tiredness and fear that they were.This was one of the very few films that made me cover my face with fear, because as I had said earlier, everything we see on screen even though it is not real, is so well done that it would not be strange if it really was.",The Blair Witch Project
559,korch-3,"No slashers, no demons, just horror!",7,15 November 1999,"The Blair Witch Project is a throwback of sorts.  If you are looking for a slasher flick like Nightmare and Elm Street, or Hellraiser, prepared to be disappointed.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a psychological thriller along the lines of Psycho you will be pleasantly surprised.The Blair Witch is a breath of fresh air to a currently stale and predictable movie industry.  It is nice to see a film without a forced sexual relationship, and awful tag-lines do well in Hollywood.
This movie seems incredibly scary to me, because it is so realistic.  Not only because of the plot, but because of the style in which it was pieced together.  I could see myself in the same scenario as these three students lost in the woods.  Would I lose my cool?  Yes.  Would I start fearing for my life?  Yes.  And that is what makes this movie so interesting. I can see where many people have been and will continue to be ""fooled"" by the realism of this flick.  To this day I have co-workers, and friends trying to convince me that what happened was real.  I guess they are going to be surprised when they see one of the three student film-makers staring in the latest, summer blockbuster in the year 2000.",The Blair Witch Project
560,Artêmis,The biggest disappointment I had in my life,1,2 October 1999,"First of all, WARNING SOME SPOILERS IN THE COMMENTThe Blair Witch Project is for sure the stupidest movie I've seen in my life. I had listened and read a lot of good things and opinions about it and I was expecting something incredible and terrifying but what I found was one film less frightening than the Team Rocket in Pokémon, the purple Teletubbie and Dr. Evil in Austin Powers.I simply didn't fell scared in any moment. It's so silly. Only stupid Americans that believed this documentary was real liked it. It sucks!The unique moment I felt pleasure in watching this was when someone in the theatre, tired of Heather's screams (as all the audience), shouted ""SHUT UP"". Everybody laughed. After it, all the people (more than 150) in the theatre hooted when the credits appeared.I really can't believe how someone felt scared in this piece of c**p. It's boring and nothing happens. During the day they only walked and walked and during the night they had to turn off the camera for the witch not to know where they were.I really think that the problem is that there are very much stupid and ingenuous people in USA. How can someone believe all this was true? That's the only chance to like it. As all the people around the world know it's a silly and not creative story, I think The Blair Witch Project's average rating will fall. The worst is that as they wanted American people to believe in the story, they made everything so real that the movie got boring. And they never show the witch or killer or murderer, so the documentary looks really real. If you are supertitious, you can think that there's a witch in the forest. If you are not, it's possible for you to think that a crazy murderer is killing everybody. So all American people were able to believe in the documentary. How smart they are!I'm until not sure about my vote. I wanted to give it 1, but I'm thinking about 2. The end of the movie is a bit interesting and unusual although many people think the end is the worst part, it's the only bit I liked!In summary it's a horrible, silly, boring, slow and childish movie. And who said it's the best horror movie ever made should be arrested for offending Hitchcock and even Wes Craven!",The Blair Witch Project
561,ad2020,One of the most successful blunders of modern cinema!,5,7 December 2000,"Coming out of the theater when I saw this, I can honestly say I was sorely disappointed, I could visualize everybody who partook of this project hysterically prancing to the bank! Why do people like this so much? Yes,it's original,Yes, it's somewhat chilling (I imagine those who thought this was absolutely scary apparently are not familiar w/ the woods),but is it executed well? F--- no!! The acting was decent, I'll give it that, but it's very brain-dead as well as poorly written and edited, (don't even make me use spoilers!!) You know what, I will use SPOILERS since I'm at a loss for words right now:Am I supposed to believe that they will keep filming when it's obvious they lost all hope, even when they won't film any sex or any other obviously hilarious material that they can cut out for their presentation? It's like the cameras became welded to their heads towards the end, or as Dave Barry put it, mounted on the top of a hyper-active seal!!They did so great w/ the chase scene, they shouldn't have drug it so much past that (the only good scene, except for Heather's last apology, which was good by itself, horrid when tied in w/ this movie) The jerky camera was an awesome idea, but did there have to be so much of it? Sometimes less is more.And yes, if your going to camp out, have survival gear! And why can't they figure out that following a river works? But then again, they can't have intelligent conversation or keep their heads!Enough, it got a 5 for effort.",The Blair Witch Project
562,Nomad-7,I didn't get it.,5,19 April 2003,"I think I understand what the film makers were trying to do, but I don't think they did it. I was interested in the characters. I liked the handling of thedegradation of their personalities and their relationship, but it was hard to suspend my disbelief to the point that I could accept that they (the characters) continued filming their ""adventure."" It was a good try. Interesting try at the style, but I don't think they made it. It might just be me. Maybe I just didn't understand.",The Blair Witch Project

What I wish I had considered was how much I hate watching other people's home movies.  That's the problem with this film (other than that pesky it's-just-not-scary thing): rather than making me feel like I was there with the actors, I felt like I was in someone's living room watching their home movies of an outing that gets creepy towards the end, but never delivers any legitimate scares.  Most of the film involves character development that is agonizingly slow and annoying to boot.  Believable, yes, but not interesting, entertaining, or worth watching.

564,rookie-8,"Intense, Intense, Intense!!!!!",10,31 July 1999,"This movie is unsettling. The night scenes should have been longer and the sound could have been better, but that sense of impending doom is something that has carried over with me even the day after viewing the movie. The realism of the camera and the realism of the actors, who draw you into the woods with them and leave on you the dread so prevalent throughout the film, turns your stomach at times. A girl who viewed the movie right before I did vomited and had to leave. In fact, many people left the theatre before the end of the movie, right around the time Heather turned the camera on herself. This movie builds tension like none other I have ever seen. The beginning is funny and light hearted as the film makers interview locals, then it begins to turn around as the three go deeper and deeper into the woods without a real clue as to where they are going, then it just because disconcerting as the three realize the danger of the night. Anyone who has ever camped out will realize that this movie is the realization of all the horrors that cross your mind while pitching your tent. Walking out, I felt uneasy and the many pictures that will no doubt be talked about for years to come were running through my mind. (especially the last scene, which will go down in horror history as one of the classic scenes of all time)The two friends I went to go see it with left the theatre feeling disappointed, as they felt it just wasn't scary enough. The next day, both called me saying they couldn't sleep the night before, and all of a sudden the movie that had left them disappointed became, for them as it was for me, the first reason in a very long time to leave a light on at night. Don't get too into the hype so as to not allow yourself to appreciate the movie, but also don't listen to the negative reviews. I have found that 90% of those who hated the movie complained of not seeing the ""monster"", or that after viewing many a movie at film festivals (the red flag phrase for film students, or those who think they are film students) they weren't impressed at all. Those who like slasher movies will be bored and those who attend film school at NYU will be pissed they didn't think of it first.Those of us who still cringe when we see ""The Exorcist"", can barely watch the screen in ""Alien"", feel the chill on the back of our neck when the kid in ""The Shining"" recites RedRum over and over again, will love this movie. It will leave certain images in your head, certain ones that you will want to forget, and will leave you in your car, or in your house, realizing the truly freightening nature of this film. It is, in one word, intense.",The Blair Witch Project
565,rookie-8,Needed the Lights on,10,2 August 1999,"I grew up with scary movies. For some reason my parents, and my grandparents for that matter, thought it perfectly exceptable to show a young boy (I couldn't have been any older than 8 or 9 when I saw my first ""Friday the 13TH"" film) countless horror flicks that they were so engrossed in. By the time I saw ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" nothing was really all that scary. Yet, I have always found that the movies which leave the most fear behind are the ones with the least amount of gore and, more often than not, the least amount ""startle"" shots (Jason jumping out of the woods). The ""Exorcist"" is one of my favorite movies of all time, along with ""Alien"" and the ""Shining"" because of the sense of doom that each evoked in me. They were all terror driven movies, where the tension built and built without  relief until the final, classic scenes. It wasn't about  scaring someone for a moment, making them jump in there seat, but about truning a persons stomach inside out for more than an hour. Those movies caused people to squirm in their seat, to let out a soulful groan when a classic ""horror movie mistake"" was made, and to turn their face when the end was near because it was just to unsettling to see. That is why to me movies like the ones before mentioned, especially ""Exorcist"", are not merely horror classics but simply movie classics.This film was billed as the ""best horror film since the Exorcist"" and, as you might have guessed that line sparked my interest. After reading several very positive reviews billing ""The Blair Witch Project"" as the scariest movie ever, and reading several posts from internet users concuring, my interest was further heightened. But then the phrases like ""overhyped"" began to be shot around and word that many user comments on well known, and trusted movie sites were planted by the studio or friends of the actors began to be spread, making me doubt the effect of this movie. I usually end up hating overhyped movies (Godzilla being the king of this genre) and am not easily scared to begin with, thanks to my families deliquent childhood pratices (sorry mom:). When time came to finally see this movie I entered it with very mixed emotions, most leaning towards the negative side of the spectrum. I WAS WRONG!!!!!!!This movie is not only horrifying while watching it on the big screen, it is horrifying while driving home, walking to your home, looking out your window, or trying to go to sleep. It reaches you in so many different ways. I have read many people inferring to the ""unknown"" being the most frieghtening aspect of this film, and while I agree it is most unsettling, it is only a part of what makes this film work. The realism of the camera, which is shaky but does not draw away from what you are seeing, and the realism of the actors, who should all be nominated for Oscars, draw you into the woods. The instinctual fear of being lost in a foreign place without hope of being rescued quickly, the fear of unknown sounds and unknown forces at work all around you, the unsettling sight of people slowely losing their minds and their hope for survival, the nerve racking sound of people screaming and crying in absolute terror, and the fear of the dark all make this the most unsettling movie I have ever seen.This is a squirm in your seat, look away from the screen, and tell me when it is over movie. The entire film held for me the intensity of the moment Tom Skerrits character went to go look for the alien in the vents, or when the little boy in ""The Shining"" kept reciting RedRum over and over, or when Chrissy Watkins is attacked by Jaws in the very opening scene. Many people felt the same way, as most did not leave their seat for a few minutes after the film had completed, and some clapped while others just let out a sigh of relief. My two friends, two of the more skeptical friends I have who are not easily impressed, had good reviews after the movie was over, but changed them to great reviews the day after as neither one could get to sleep that night. I myself, mister Jason is funny and Freddy is a comedian, had to sleep with a light on and closed blinds and found myself very happy to have my girlfriend sleeping over the next night for not the normal reasons:) Don't miss this movie. Don't wait for it to come on video. Don't wait for the spoilers to come out. Go see it now and get scared. I rate it a 9 1/2 out of 10, only because I thought the night scenes could have been longer.",The Blair Witch Project
566,rookie-8,Stupid people don't like this movie,10,5 August 1999,"This is not a popular thing to say, as everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I didn't like Titanic at all, but I am obviously in the minority in my feelings. If you don't like a film that is your perogative and it is what makes this country great. However, having read the reviews on this site I have come to the conclusion that most people who hated this movie really do sound stupid while trying to explain why the film is so bad.Firstly, if you didn't like this film and you want to put your comments down, please do not start your summary off with "" The only thing scary about Blair is the price of admission"", or the even wittier "" Scary as hell!!!!!! That I paid 8 bucks to see it."" Almost everyone who did not like this movie started off with something of that nature, which was the first indication I had that people who hated this movie are, overall, stupid. If you do find it important to start off with comedy such as this, please also include you address and place of occupation so that I could find you and beat you. It is for your own good.
Secondly, if you have read anything about this film, ANYTHING AT ALL, you will know it is not a classic ""horror"" film. There are no ghouls or goblins to jump out after you. Jason isn't going to get you out by the Lake house and Freddy isn't going to come for you in dreams. This is a story that is scary because it is REAL!!!!! You can't see what is in the woods, you can't see what is stalking the students because THEY can't see what is stalking them. So many negative reviews have involved comments like ""I kept waiting to see the witch"" or ""how could it be scary when you never see anything."" One person even wrote, while commenting on how ""fake"" she believed the story was, that ""it made no sense for them to be screaming all the time."" If I was caught in the woods, or in my backyard for that matter, with something coming after me, I would scream all the time to. Just another ""stupid"" comment.But what makes it very apparent to me that those who hated this movie are just not that bright is the fact that everyone who has loved this movie and written about it has talked about imagination. This film is about putting yourself right into the action, right with the characters, at all times. The bickering, the yelling and the screaming, are all things that, in a situation of that nature would actually happen. The day scenes, save for a few discoveries, showed the other side of terror and that was the mental breakdown of all these characters. They gave up hope, they gave up any idea of living through what was happening to them, and that comes across on screen. For those of us who were able to put ourselves in the shoes of Heather, Josh and Mike, that part of the movie was just as frightening as anything else. The night scenes are scary because you cannot see what is out there. The sounds and voices are freaky and make anyone who has ever been in a house alone at night and heard the pipes grumble a bit squirm in their seat. I DIDN'T want to see what was out there because then that would defeat the purpose of the whole movie. It would defeat the purpose of letting the audiences imaginations (those of us who have them) run wild for an hour and a half only to show them the witch, or whatever it was that was stalking the students, right at the end. Its greatness was in allowing for everyone to come away from the movie with a different interpretation of what happened.Many will assume that this review, or comment more correctly, is the spawn of a stuck up elitest who takes pride in liking something that is not main stream. Nothing could be further from the truth, as most of the time I despise ARTS movies. I like big action, big explosions. Hell, one of my favorite nights during the week is when TNT does their ""Movies for Guys who Like movies"" thing, but this movie to me is a no brainer. (or maybe a brainer, as it seems those who have them love the film) The Exorcist, Alien, The Shining, and many other great horror movies fit into the Blair category. They scare you more with what is not seen than what is seen. They build tension, never letting up until the end, so the audience goes away just as scared as they were sitting in their seats. Movies like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, the seemingly popular horror of today, put in their horror as almost an afterthought. There is no tension built, there is no breaking down of the characters, there is no squirming in seats, only gore and shock and jokes. That might be horror, but it is not GREAT horror, as Blair Witch is. 
Those of you with imagination, go and be scared, be very scared. Those of you who fall into the category of ""nothing happened in this movie, it sucked so bad"", Freddy vs. Jason is in production and should be out next summer.",The Blair Witch Project

Instead of falling into the ""is it a true story or not"" debate, I knew how it was filmed, what it was about etc.  This spoiled what was an inventive if slow movie.The acting is brilliant and there's no doubt that the level of creativity and originality behind the film is first rate.  Unfortunately, when it comes down to it, Blair Witch has a couple of scary-ish moments.

569,deadkerouac,Generation Xers head into woods; we view excellent results,8,17 July 2000,"I saw this film last night, LONG after all the hype and reviews were made about it. I settled in with the right mood for any film: no expectations. If you expect too much, you may be let down (take note for any Kubrick film). I watched the entire film without interruption and came out with a great feeling. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one darn good movie.Many critics and moviegoers complained about the film for its length, its amateurish photography/editing, and its lack of adequate acting. I feel these things MADE THE MOVIE. First, the film has to be at most ninety minutes long: any more, and it would be too long and boring. Second, the amateur video take gives the audience the feel that they are actually in the woods, listening to the rippling water of the creek, snapping branches under their boots, and hearing things go bump in the night. I greatly admire the use of two video cameras (one black-and-white, the other color) to denote which character is shooting the film. Lastly, the incessant screaming of whiny Heather, the constant complaining of average-joe Mike, and the Dudley-Do-Rightness of Josh make for great acting. Yes, these are regular people and up-and-coming actors from your local community theater, but YOU KNOW THEM. You've met people like them.The biggest complaint, however, comes from the film's supposed ""lack"" of scary moments. This film reminds me of the classic horror film ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" and though not as gory and as shocking as that film, ""The Blair Witch Project"" shows just enough fright in the group's search for a way out of the woods, stalked by people and/or things they may never understand. In the older film, the long interval between opening credits and first gory act of violence is about thirty minutes long; it is even longer here, but the suspense/fright (just as in the older film) begins right from the opening credits: you just don't see it until the film's over. These are three people out to make a documentary in the woods with handheld camcorders--these are REAL PEOPLE. And GREAT ACTORS. Heather whines a lot and screams and reminds you of the girl you hate so much you fall in love with her. Her screams sound real, her cries are genuine, and she is DEEPLY DEEPLY sorry for bringing the others into the woods in order to film her documentary.I really dig the beginning. It seems so real to me I may delve into my old home movies for nostalgia. Heather and Josh pick up Mike, then go to the store for supplies. This opening sequence really packs a punch. These are three Generation Xers out for a camping trip. We all know what happens to them, but we're glued to the screen, intent to know what actually happens.The interviews give us some detail into the Blair Witch legend, but most of the audience is too busy thinking about the actual trek into the woods that they don't listen. This is wrong. Listening is good. The interviews, which also sound real and not rehearsed in any way, are like movie reviews: the critics tell you what they saw, but mostly they don't want to ruin it for you...unless they hated it.And that's what I'll do. I won't ruin it for you. 8/10.",The Blair Witch Project

571,ozymandiaskingofkings,"Badly made, badly acted and about as scary as a boy scout camping trip.",1,20 October 2009,"It's not often I say this, but i hate this film. It's a boring, badly written, badly made piece of crap posing as an arty verite style film, and has it's status purely due to hype and clever marketing gimmickry. Most of the action is plot less, just some morons bumbling round some woods. I mean, I used to go camping in woods with my dad all the time, it's not an especially scary environment for me. Plus: it's some damn woods, not the Amazon jungle. There's bound to be other people there and it's not exactly going to be hard to find your way out. It's just not believable. And most of the film is just them lost in some woods, it's not exciting, it's just something that happens thats inconvenient. It's like making a horror film about missing a bus, or something.Unlike films such as Deliverance or Eden Lake, I never actually felt the protagonists were in any actual danger. Sure the odd creepy thing happens, but apart from the end (which I admit was great) scary stuff is few and far between and as for the documentary aspect, surely the point of a documentary is you shoot the interesting/relevant stuff. Their rationale for continuing to film was nowhere near as persuasive as the one in REC.I guess the main reason I didn't like the film was that I really didn't care about any of the characters. Heather just spent all her time whining/crying, whereas the two guys had almost no personality at all. I really wasn't bothered what happened to them. And there just wasn't enough to hold my interest, the ideas ran out as soon as they entered the woods. Not enough happened to sustain my interest and given the film was only 80 minutes long, thats really saying something. It felt to me like a film school short that had been expanded to me, rather than a fully rounded film.A good comparison is The Evil Dead where the direction and camera work served to create tension. In Blair Witch is looks in parts like they just ran aimlessly round some woods with a camera, while in Raimi's film the camera also prowls around and snakes along the ground, but it serves a purpose in doing so, offering a perspective of the entity that haunts the woods. In Blair Witch, the trouble isn't subtlety, it's that we don't see ANYTHING remotely frightening, not even glimpsed.It isn't like Rosemary's Baby where the questions of what is supernatural and what is just coincidence/imagination pervade throughout the film but are finally resolved, there is a frustrating lack of closure. Sure, you could say it's just being left open to interpretation, but there are so few clues/pieces of information in the film with which the audience can gain any understanding, I just see it as sloppy writing. It started brilliantly, the interviews with the townspeople seemingly foreshadowing a much better film which ultimately never materialises, but doesn't build on that. I don't want to see a lot of hokey special effects of anything, but I did expect to see more horrific things happening than just three irritating people walking round a wood for what felt like forever.I don't expect people to go watch clichéd slashers and remakes. I hate those movies too. But there are a great many better horror films out there than this one and it mystifies me why this one was singled out for so much acclaim. OK, so the 90s being a rubbish overall decade for horror probably helped Blair Witch and the verite style is cool to begin with, but the whole thing is underplotted and thinks it's much smarter than it is. It substitutes incoherence for a plot and screaming/bickering for intelligent dialogue and effective character development. This film is sort of like the emperor with no clothes. Everyone is told of it's brilliance, and people follow suit without really stepping back and looking how it works as a film, as a narrative work or a genre piece. The truth is, it doesn't work well as either.",The Blair Witch Project

This simple truth has finally been exploited to(almost)maximum effect and create a truly gripping movie.Blair Witch Project is a brilliantly conceived and executed filmthat unfortunately cuts itself too short just as it's momentum finally starts to build to a fever pitch. The situation for the three protagonists gets increasingly desperate and weird and genuinely scary but the climax is overly abrupt to say the least and leaves the viewer distinctly unsatisfied(although the last shot is haunting). The film also spends too much time concentrating on the three tired young filmmakers bickering amongst each other and basically breaking down mentally(although the actors all give very impressive performances-It's easy to forget that this is a movie and not a documentary while you're watching it). These scenes are very well done but go on too long and it's nothing you haven't seen in Deliverance. They detract from the overall impact in the long run.

The creators really put forth much time and effort to create an atmosphere that seems believable,what with the newscasts,interviews,photographic evidence,and the Blair Witch website. Finally the film itself is a masterful achievement. Kudos must go to the trio of Heather,Joshua,and Michael.

575,averjee,"Terrifically creative, creepy",10,24 July 1999,"Rarely has a movie left so much to the imagination of the viewer, and been content to show the audience so little on screen. The scariest minutes of the film are spent with nothing but darkened, blurry images on the screen, and the audience listening raptly to the noises on the audio: the scrambling of the protagonists, their frightened queries, or the ominous howling and cackling that haunts them.the minimalist approach is devastatingly effective. The ending is a little weak, lacking the big payoff one expects after such a terrific build-up; nevertheless, this is indeed one of the most suspenseful, chilling and disturbing films you'll see in your lifetime.A 10 out of 10.",The Blair Witch Project

Where is the involvement? Where is the identification?

Get a clue here morons. The first one wasn't near scary. Whoever thought this movie was scary is phsycotic. Halloween was better than this. This movie was a piece of crap. It had a lame plot, bad acting, bad everything. Here is the plot: They go into the woods for a school documentary. They get lost because one of the morons throws their map in the river on purpose, maybe it wasn't purposely. It's been a while since the first time I saw it. It will be the last time I see it too. What was all the hype about? They get lost in the woods, and someone is trying to kill them. I give this movie 0/10. Maybe I'll give it a one for the ending.

580,Susie-7,Wow.,8,23 August 1999,"First, I'd like to say that there are spoilers in this review, although I will warn again right before I give them.This movie scared the crap out of me, which is very unusual.  I am usually only creeped out if I watch a movie at home alone in the dark in the middle of the night; in this case, I saw the movie with friends in a crowded theatre and it was still light out when we exited the theatre.  Admittedly, I wasn't petrified at first.  When we really got scared was when we were walking back to our hotel (as we were visiting a friend of mine) in an area that seemed to have an aversion to street lights.  It was very dark and it did not help that we were walking by bushes.  We were all totally freaked out and kept looking around behind us.  We had the last scene of the movie stuck in our heads, and it stayed there.  I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that I had to leave a light on when I went to sleep.  I haven't done that since I was 7 and saw an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, where the almost-final image of a girl hung outside on the door of her home stayed with me for days.  Any movie that can have this kind of an effect on me is pretty unusual.  Even now, when I'm thinking about the final scene of this movie, I am getting somewhat creeped out.  The movie was highly disturbing, simply because it seemed so real and we DON'T actually know what happened. I am also with the group that thinks the acting was good; I think that in many cases they weren't acting.  For example [WARNING: spoilers ahead!!!], when that one guy disappeared in the middle of the night, I would not be surprised at all if the other two did not know that was going to happen. Likewise, at the very end of the film, I wouldn't be surprised if the girl didn't know when she'd enter the basement, Mike would be standing in the corner.  It really seemed to me like she was having a massive panic attack, at more than one point in the movie.In any case, I highly recommend this film to anyone that wants to be scared out of their wits.",The Blair Witch Project
581,POG-2,Not really worth it,4,4 January 2000,"I voted 5 in this case because it's neither good nor bad for me. I think the three actors did a good job and I guess the audience does get the impression this really is a documentary. So I have to give the directors credits for this as well.  But I believe the main credit they should get is for hyping this film up so much. I tend to be an easily frightened person, but I wasn't frightened by this although I can well imagine I would be if I were one of those characters. The characters got on my nerves after a while and you just waited for them to be dead (which is clear from the beginning) so you can leave. I also had the impression that many people in the audience were disappointed by the ending. Probably the expectations were too high. I don't think many of the people liked it that evening when I saw it.",The Blair Witch Project

583,RueMorgue,The most misunderstood movie in horror history. (POSSIBLE Spoilers).,9,29 May 2000,"Note:  This comment MAY contain spoilers, depending on your point of view. If you haven't seen TBWP, and don't know the background of the film, STOP reading NOW.There isn't much to say about this film that hasn't already been said. Everybody and his brother (or sister, as the case may be) has made and reiterated their point about this film.  But the fact remains, that this low-budget wonder turned box-office hit is a scary movie.Myself, I watched this movie at home, with all the lights turned off, and the volume turned up high.  I didn't watch it alone, however, and now I wish I did.  The main problem with my viewing of the film was that I had already heard all the hype, and as much as I tried to stay away from it, I knew most of the background of this film.  That is another thing I regret.The fact is, I believe that if one views this movie as it was intended to be viewed, with no background knowledge, it will scare the daylights out of the viewer.  It is a classic terror film.  I know there are many who would disagree with me.While I do not believe that this film can be ranked up with previous horror hits such as The Exorcist, the result was the same in many movie theaters in North America.  People complained of dizziness, nausea, and some had to leave the theater early because they couldn't take it any more.  The same thing happened with The Exorcist.  The symptoms from Blair were often the result of watching the shaky, multi-camera views, while The Exorcist was a blast of both imagery and sound that left the viewer reeling in his/her seat.  The result of the whole experience, agree with me or not on both counts, was terror.There are those horror movie buffs out there, I'm sure, who complain that Blair was not classic horror, that the premise was faulty and the background was simply unbelievable.  Yet, I'm sure that these were people like me. They knew the background of the film, and were thus not affected as the writers, directors, and cast had originally intended.  I believe that if people saw this film as was meant to be, they would have been scared out of their wits.  I also think that many people, on examination of the film, downplayed how it made them feel.  In other words, the same people that say the film was terrible, probably sat in the theater and were scared themselves at some point during the film.Overall, I believe that this is the most misunderstood movie in horror history.  If it had been viewed by the masses as it was originally intended, it would have scared the pants off almost anybody.  I know it scared me... even though I already knew what it was all about.  As I have said in the past, any movie that can make me think when it is over, is one that I enjoy. This movie will leave many questions in your mind, but as I said before, only if viewed as it was originally intended.My Rating:  9/10",The Blair Witch Project

Completely devoid of content and purpose, this is the film to watch when you have no stereotypically shallow teenagers around to swear at you and talk about getting drunk or stoned. It will fill that void for 90 minutes, while subtly creating a greater void in your appreciation of art that may haunt you for the rest of your life. Yes, this film terrified me, but not because it was a frightening horror film. It is an archetypical example of big business (in this case Artisan Entertainment) manufacturing social reality for profit. And that is truly terrifying.I can only recommend The Blair Witch Project to psychologists and others who study the manufacture of social reality (research Artisan's marketing campaign first or you'll likely find the film itself excruciatingly tedious). In this regard alone does The Blair Witch Project offer any significance. May it quickly be forgotten, and may big business and government never learn the lessons it teaches.",The Blair Witch Project
587,mylucylumpkins,What do I like to do on Sundays? Watch horror films from my childhood!,9,7 September 2014,"The reason I enjoyed this film in it original theatrical release and continue to enjoy it today can be summed up by one childhood story. A friend at the time had an uncle who was on the police force. After we saw the film and debated about its authenticity he claimed that, although we live no where close to where the film takes place, he had seen the official police records of this incident. He was a police officer and I had no reason to doubt him, but it was really the film that sold me on the idea that it was all found footage and that these folks were really dead. Of course latter I realized the truth, but to be caught in the Blair Witch whirlwind was fantastic! People always try to look back at the excitement they had for this film, and others like it, and belittle the film because of the hype. This film really did live up to the hype for me. Of course there were problems, but it was the first successful film of it's kind. I still feel like it is the best found footage film to date and I can attribute some of that to the hype surrounding it. Just to point out a few things to address common issues with the film: the acting is exactly where it should be. These people are clearly not reading from a script, and although people criticize their improvisational skills, they are believable as average people. Another issue that people have is that a person being so concerned with getting lost kicks the map into the river. He gives a very valid human explanation, the map wasn't doing anything to help them, and he just got mad and kicked it into the stream. Of course it was stupid, but for that reason I find it believable. The last is the idea that when in trouble, people will stop filming and the fact that the whole thing is supposedly on film is ridiculous. My answer to this is simple, people film life threatening situations so that if they survive they have proof and can relive it. If you don't believe me, look into how many people film tsunamis, or tornadoes, or robberies, or anything else that may have killed them.",The Blair Witch Project

They deserve kudos for that, not jealousy. This movie makes it because it's so different than other movies. It's nifty and enjoyable.

And the idea of making a movie as-if it was made by amateurs and real.But that is probably the problem of this movie too, if you see it in a Sneak Preview - and you never heard anything of it before - you might think it's scary because it APPEARS real to you.

Things like: ""You didn't even get to see the witch"" (exactly, the filmmakers decided to plant the horror in the viewer's minds, rather than directly under the camera, it's called subtlety-look it up); and ""what's so scary about a bunch of sticks and rocks"" (gee, nothing in and of themselves, why don't you try placing them within the context of the storyline?); and, ""Why didn't these morons just follow the stream back to civilization""(they did, and they ended up right back where they had started....There was a WITCH in the woods with them, you know, supernatural forces keeping them there, no matter what they did)...and don't even get me started on the folks that complain bitterly about the low budget aspects of the whole enterprise, as if said-budget is a filmic crime in and of itself.

595,aschachte,Not a bad job considering the budget,2,25 November 2006,"Spoilers First off, I applaud them for making lots of money with no real investment. A hoax like this can only be done once. There were a couple of nice touches in the movie, like them trying to follow a stream and winding up in the same spot. That's freaky. Also, good acting. But the effects were extremely cheesy, like the four guys beating the sides of tent. Was I really supposed to think it was anything else? Maybe it's because this movie never really ""took me there"". At least with the Ninth Gate, I could suspend disbelief long enough to accept the idea that the three books really are evil and the hero's life might have been in danger a few times, but not here. Also you never actually see the Blair Witch. It's kind of like making a song about a Teenage Wasteland and calling it Baba O'Reilly. Where is Baba O'Reilly? You might say the Witch is invisible to explain her pronounced absence. Ah, but then how did they have an old drawing of the Witch in that book? Hmn? Also the editing was impossible. If you're recording the same thing with two separate cameras, you will get the same action twice from two separate perspectives, not a smoothly-edited single thread of continuity. I especially chuckled when the one guy was talking into one camera and his voice carried over flawlessly into the footage of the other camera, all supposedly unedited. That was really obvious. By editing it professionally, it lost any credibility it might have had in my mind. And why did they go in that house anyway? How stupid was that? To make matters worse, they made a companion video for this movie (before Blair Witch 2) that you could rent, supposedly of ""newly-discovered"" video. At least they threw it in free when I rented Blair Witch. It was the one guy and the girl sitting in the tent saying things like, ""Wow, that was a lot of weird stuff that happened today, huh?"" ""Did you ever figure out what those twig figures were?"" ""No. I never saw nuthin' like that. Crazy, huh?"" This companion movie was obviously shot with a different camera than either of the ones used in making Blair Witch, making it an even more obvious fake, and it was twice as boring.While we're at it, didn't they film the inside of the Witch's house? If real, the cameras should still be in there. Who discovered the film without getting killed by the Witch? There was absolutely no way for me to get into the illusion of this movie with so many flaws continually shouting at me that it was a hoax. They might as well have put that kid from The Last Action Hero in here saying over and over, ""It's just a movie. It's not real."" It astounds me to think that some people actually thought it was a true documentary. On the scary scale, 1 to 10, I give this a 2, only for the few freaky (but not really scary) scenes.

596,pgear83,Terrifying,9,24 July 2007,"The horror genre is one that has long been prone to extremes without much real impact. From the excessive gory schlock of the 70's and 80's to the overused CGI effects of today and even to the new and disturbing ""torture porn"" sub-genre, it is a type of movie that has historically relied on quantity over quality.The Blair Witch Project defies every bad cliché of the genre and as such is one of the few genuinely, viscerally frightening films. It relies less on its visuals than on the lack of visuals. The filmmakers understand and tap into the most primal of human fears - that of the unknown.The film begins by setting up the fictional local folklore of the Blair Witch by 'interviewing' residents of the town. With their stories now in the minds of the characters (and the viewers) the films proceeds into the woods. The sense of isolation is tangible. The film is shot with hand-held cameras, either devoid of color or else in dreary, bleached out colors, adding to the atmosphere.Isolated in the woods, seemingly simple things become terrifying. If you can suspend disbelief you will never be more frightened of a pile of rocks or stick figures hung in trees or strange sounds in the dark. The perspective is often in the first-person, allowing the audience to identify with the characters. Your senses become sharpened with fright as your eyes and ears strain to catch some fleeting glimpse of the ghoul that is haunting those woods.The Blair Witch Project is perhaps the most profitable movie ever made and is a prime example of what can be done by skilled filmmakers who just keep it simple. 9/10",The Blair Witch Project

My guess is that most watched it at home with the lights on and a couple of their friends near by. This is a scary and innovative movie. What makes it scary is that it is different from 99% of other horror movies. In most standard horror movies you have a Freddy or Jason to embody terror or evil. You see Michael Myers an you know he is evil and supposed to be scary. However, real terror is terror you cannot see and that is what is so brilliant about this film. The Blair Witch is a mystery and she leaves our imagination to decide so much. I am a creative person with quite the imagination.

Maybe if you believed that these film students really died, and that they where killed by a real witch, it could have been scary. But since this is obviously not the case, because the Blair Witch legends was invented for this movie, this is not a factor for me. Some of the people I saw it with was very scared, when I was bored? They at least had some fun out of it. Except for the last three minutes nothing happens!I think it was a great stunt, to convince America that this was a true story, and the best thing that came out of this movie, must have been all the stuff on the net. That the only commercials was on the net was very smart.

This film knows.,10,6 August 1999,"If I asked any horror film connoiseur what the single greatest moment of any horror film is, I would certainly hope the answer would, almost unanimously, be the infamous Shower Scene from ""Psycho,"" by Alfred Hitchcock.  Why bring this up in a review of ""The Blair Witch Project, "" you ask?  Because there is something that Hitchcock understood and is evident in everything he did, especially this particular scene.  What this great genius of cinema understood (and many other filmmakers, such as Wes Craven, have forgotten) is that what is truly frightening on screen is not what is seen by the audience, but what is not seen.I'd like to personally thank Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez for not only making a modern film masterpiece, but for helping movie-goers remember what it's truly like to be scared.  Not just grossed out, mind you, but truly sincerely scared out of our minds.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" has done just that, and has done so with startling originality and what I feel is true genius.  While other films may garner more critical acclaim or Oscar nominations, I know of no other film that is as original or as creative as this masterpiece.  Finally, somebody has remembered what Hitchcock learned, and has made this marvel out of it.One truly sad thing about ""The Blair Witch Project"" is that it is much too simple and risky for Hollywood.  This film could only have been made independently with first time directors and actors, people who are willing to try anything, and don't know any better.**** out of ****.",The Blair Witch Project
604,maerte,There's one thing you can learn...,8,15 December 1999,Don't forget a reserve map.But let's be serious. Those who made this film successfully create the appearance of authenticity although they cheat the viewer a little bit (remember when Heather reads passages out of a book the sound is continuous and but the footage has been cut)They managed to scare the audience considerably and it was amazing how the actors played the enmity and the closeness the protagonists experienced under the great distress.One of the most interesting films of the nineties (9/10),The Blair Witch Project
605,Manna-2,A Complete Waste of Time!,1,27 August 1999,"The Blair Witch Project is for those who do not like to think. Any true horror fan will be let down by this complete piece of garbage. For one: Don't bother seeing this in the theater, it's completely filmed in 16MM and has no widescreen ratio. Secondly, the acting is truly the worst I've ever seen. Lastly, the film is about as scary as Disney's ""Watcher in the Woods!"" Filled with nothing but profanity, this film offers little else. I was in line with the rest at the movie theater demanded my money back, thank GOD I got it.",The Blair Witch Project
606,Budd-5,A gem,9,29 October 1999,"The directors of the Blair Witch Project possess a directing tool that most horror directors (and most cinema patrons these days) lack: patience. Most horror movies have a scare at the beginning that unsettle the audience. We see a glimpse of the murderer; we get an unsurprising shock; some famous actor gets killed off. We are then forced to sit through a number of requisite shocks before the unoriginal conclusion.The Blair Witch Project opens with a smiling cast and a happy village. It delays its scares; instead it builds up the tension. What the directors are aiming to do is build up the tension to an extreme and then scare the pants off the audience by the finale. It works miraculously.The three actors are enormously effective. Heather Donahue possibly the standout. They are not only acting but they are filming the entire footage and though their camerawork is shaky, the same cannot be said for the actors. We're told that they ad-libbed every line, well if that's the case they are not only wonderful actors, they are quite competent in the writing department. Heather's confession; Josh guilt-tripping Heather and Michael's slow but affecting character build up is tremendously effective.But this is the director's show. They have said publicly that they were the Blair Witch. Though they never touched the cameras, they focused the storyline onto its gripping end.I was surprised by the reaction leaving the cinema. Most people didn't like it. If you're expecting a shock a minute you will be disappointed but this is a gem of a film. I loved every second especially the kiss-off. I'm writing this review 4 hours later and my heart is still pounding.",The Blair Witch Project

Everytime this movie comes up in conversation people say the acting was bad, it was in black and white, the cinematography was non existant, you never saw the witch, and so on and so on. If any of those elements were different the movie wouldn't have been what it was supposed to be about. It would have ruined the entire production. The actors weren't actors. The shakey filming made the film seen more amateur. And you never saw the witch because how could you? The students filming the documentary had no idea what was after them. How could you know more than they knew? You watched the film through their eyes. There was no second or third party in this film. You only saw what they saw and that's it. If there was a script, you saw the witch, and the film looked professional it would have been completely pointless. This is a great little film. But no one watches it the way it was intended.",The Blair Witch Project

610,Oceans17,Morons willingly run into a scary forest and toss common sense away,5,21 August 2007,"I give this film a pass (just 5) because it managed to scare me (at a purely psychological level) towards the end. But the sheer stupidity of the characters is simply impossible to swallow: one of them throws the map, which in their situation is like a parachutist throwing his parachute. And, worst, when they are walking in circles, they don't think that they could just follow the river, which by the laws of physics flows downward and therefore would lead them somewhere. They could follow the river downwards, until they arrive to the sea or to civilization, or upwards, until they reach a high point from which they could see their surroundings. There's no excuse to walk in circles when there's a river in sight.I admit that the shot of the upper half of the actress' face is pretty effective, but an inspired shot does not a good film make.Pair this with ""Mindhunters"" and watch both if you think that the ""play"" button is at the same time the ""turn off"" button for your brain.

Everybody's anticipating the moment where the witch reveals itself or something like that. Not that I have a problem with that, it's just that it's really anticipating the very ending, or when the witch takes Josh. The thing is, that stuff doesn't happen 'til about the very end of the film. This kind of bothers me, because the rest of the movie is kind of boring. Besides when they find the weird signs and stuff, there isn't much to this film besides the end. And by the way, please don't say this is actually ""real footage"", because it's not.

How can I be scared at something so patently unrealistic?  If this were truly realistic, the footage would have ended about an hour into the movie, at the point where the three film makers decide their lives are more important than camera equipment, ditch the backpacks, and hike non-stop, day and night, south and/or east until they get to civilization.  They have a compass. They have legs.  Make use of them.  Don't stop every night and invite the evil right up to your doorstep.  Maryland's just not that big, and there's plenty of populous all around it.  Go towards it, all the time.  And take a cell phone while you're at it, just for emergencies.  A creative idea, to be sure (though not necessarily as original as previously thought, cf. The Last Broadcast), and the first half-hour or so is promising, but the stunning stupidity of the characters made the last hour of the movie just an irritating joke.We give a pass to most movies, especially horror movies, when they're unrealistic, because we know they're fictions trying to pass themselves off as reality.  But Blair Witch tries to pass itself off as the reality itself, as a documentary, and in so doing sets a higher standard of realism for itself.

Saying it was worth the wait is something of an understatement.  The hype and myths surrounding this modern horror masterpiece are, for once, understandable and well-founded.  I have often been downright terrified by watching horror films alone at home on video (Repulsion, Halloween, and The Haunting - the old one - are three that readily come to mind), but this was the first instance where I was absolutely terrified in an actual theatre.  The pace of the film is masterful, letting us relax and laugh fairly often near the beginning, then slowly and inexorably tightening its grip until the absolutely terrifying final moments.

It was a completely pointless idiotic waste of time with no redeeming qualities, if there was a zero rating, this would definitely be down there, but they don't let us have any fun. I don't even remember what it was about, and while, yes, I did have a pretty bad seizure from the camera shots which can't be helping my memory much, I doubt I'd remember much anyway.

Instead of sitting there like the passive sponges most of us become when going to the movies we are actually expected be become involved. Take a leap of faith& belief and delve into this movie. With out the overpowering effects and music score most movies rely on to scare' you, if you still have an imagination left what is implied becomes a hundred times scarier than anything offered up by Hollywood in the last 30 years.Filmed on video and 16mm black & white, this film is exactly what the horror genre needs in a time reminiscent of the early 1980s slasher onslaught. The Blair Witch Project has no knife wielding maniacs, no deoxyribonucleic acid altered monsters, and no real bloodshed onscreen. We see what the three film makers see as they make their way through the deep, dank woods in search of a legendary witch. A guaranteed cult classic, Blair Witch has Heather, Mike, and Josh heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of Maryland looking for the Blair Witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills. For most of the film, it is very unclear. The beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are experiencing the supernatural, being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople, or just completely out of their minds.If you are a seasoned veteran of the horror cinema, The Blair Witch Project may be less frightening than for someone who has not seen many scary movies. You will have to respect it's originality, and it's manipulation of our deepest fears. At times the film really makes you feel the sense of dread the film makers are experiencing.Many have complained about the shaky camera, the cussing, how no scenes really happen, and that it's not scary. By and large, the camera is not that shaky, at least to the point where you can't understand why they are tromping through the woods and they are scared half to death. I must not get queasy very easily, as I had no problem with it. As for the cussing the lines were improvised, the actors are college age, and all three sound exactly like every American college student.At a time when digital techniques can show us almost anything, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a reminder that what really scares us is the stuff we can't see.

The makers of this film went to so much trouble, in fact, to make it seem real, that even given that I knew it was just a movie, I had to reconvince myself it wasn't real after viewing the film and checking out the web site.  To be sure:  it's nice to believe it's real if you want to get really, really scared.  As a movie, though?  Mediocre.  They could have done more with the legend to build up the plot, without taking away from the ""real"" aspect one bit.  The footage they include doesn't include enough interviews or background to be pieced into a true documentary anyway.  I wasn't quite as afraid as I wanted to be, in all honesty.  If people try to copy this idea, however, they will FAIL.  This is the type of thing that can only be done once successfully.

Although it didn't live up to all the hype (most movies rarely do), I thought it was a solid, well-made film.  Forget the taglines of Scariest Movie Ever' because that's really far from the truth.It is on the other hand very unnerving at times and the final scene is particularly eerie.  The performances from the three leads are very convincing, its not pretty to watch, but they do act as though they are genuinely terrified, there is none of the `what would we do if this were a scary movie' Scream' cockiness here and that makes the performances more believable.I'm just waiting for the all too predictable backlash against the picture, just like the audience did at the Liverpool cinema I attended, who were obviously expecting a Friday the 13th' style bloodbath.If you are looking for something different from a film, forget everything you've seen or read and check out The Blair Witch Project'.",The Blair Witch Project

The independent film community should be proud of this accomplishment. the tension that develops is realistically portrayed, but the ending doesn't hit as hard as I thought it would.

This isn't a slasher film full of blood guts and gore, it's something entirely different, it's frightening. This movie relies on building bone chilling suspense that your own imagination supplies for you, probably more frightening than anything the movie industry could supply you with. You see everything the three film makers in the movie see and you hear what they hear and no more. What you don't see is always more frightening than what you do. It's the unknown that is terrifying and all through this movie you have to contend with the unknown. You never know what is going to happen next. You know that something will but never what. The only contrived aspect of this movie is that these three kids would continue to film through everything that they are experiencing.

At that time, though I had not seen it, I had the feeling that that ""The Blair Witch Project"" perhaps was somewhat of an imitation of that movie. After just watching Blair Witch Project, I wish to apologize to director Weir for even trying to make a comparison. The only commonality was the permanent disappearance of the actors in both films. The truly splendid ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" was a small sensuous masterpiece with scenery and musical score that brought chills of emotion. ""Blair Witch"" was a non-masterpiece of hype. Tell everyone how frightening it is, so they will have to feel frightened. Tell everyone it is as scary as ""The Exorcist"" and they will feel guilty if they are not as scared. Tell everyone that this movie was made in only eight days, so they will think--""How incredible"" Enough said on that subject. As for hand held cameras, the producers and directors need to take a lesson from some of the Danish film producers who produced ""Mifune"" and are dedicated to the use of hand held cameras with a flair and verve that this film could never have.

Universal's coffee bill must be higher than what the budget was for this film. I feel that this was the birth of the psychological horror film.What also helped this was the fact that the actors used their real names in the film, and the website that accompanied it helped to create the illusion that this incident portrayed in the film was a true event.Fabulous acting (and REAL snot coming out of Heather Donahue's nose in that heartbreaking famous scene), great shots and eerie locations also help to boost the scariness of TBWP.Definitely a film you must see before you die.10/10.",The Blair Witch Project

631,ashturner-79373,"Worthy of respect, but not really a good film experience.",5,12 March 2019,"There's something about this film that stops it working for me, and I think it's probably the pacing - let me clarify. I think the performances from Heather Donahue and Joshua Leonard are good (though Mike Williams relies a lot on pantomime stuff like rocking back and forth or laughing manically), and the interviews at the start all feel genuine aside from the fishermen. The premise of recovered footage (à la ""Cannibal Holocaust (1980)) from a student documentary about an urban legend is fine too.But it's the way the plot unfolds as drama about getting lost in the woods that's the problem. There really isn't much variety in watching people argue about who lost the map, or why Heather is still filming, in between scenes of inane conversation about burgers and getting your shoes wet. It all comes down to people talking in the woods, except half the time it's filler dialogue and the other half it's just swearing and shouting.I can at least respect it for being one of a few films to really treat the found footage style seriously. The audio seems to be recorded from one microphone, so half the dialogue is inaudible, and the camerawork is often shaky and imprecise. While these can be good ways of conveying that this is genuine, raw footage, they also limit your film, and a savvier FF film would find ways of working in spite of those limitations.One way this film does at least accomplish that is via its filming style, in which the actors were given cameras and told to basically shoot the film themselves using a vague plot outline. It would've been better, though, if the plot were less padded and there were some variety in the visuals other than leaves, twigs and faces. Attempts at social commentary about Heather using a camera to distance herself from reality don't help.For a film that's trying to look like real footage, the end product feels distinctly unnatural and messy, almost like it was just improvised by a bunch of people in the woods...5/10.",The Blair Witch Project

633,RobT-2,The filmmakers refuse to pay their dues...,9,3 November 1999,"...so we, the viewers, have to pay them instead.  That, I think, lies at the heart of the many chants of ""worst movie ever made"" from BWP's detractors. It's also one of the reasons the film will stay in the heads of its fans for days, and why those fans won't shut up about it.The problem is that not everyone is used to art which doesn't readily explain itself, which makes the viewer work at interpreting it.  Two practitioners of this type of art in other fields are the writer William S. Burroughs and the composer John Cage.  Some famous movies which do the same kind of thing are ""L'Avventura"", ""Last Year at Marienbad"", ""8 1/2"", and ""Blow-Up"".  Some people can't stand these films, others can't live without them.  What they have in common with BWP is that they put the viewers' minds to work, filling in the deliberate gaps in the plot and unexplained areas. While a lot of people dote on films like this that ""make them think"", others don't appreciate being put to work when they've come to be entertained.A better precedent for BWP is ""David Holzman's Diary"", which purports to be a young filmmaker's attempt to turn his life into a film (and which also aroused strong negative reactions from viewers who felt cheated by its not being ""real"").  Some have asked why the students kept filming after losing all control over events.  The answer is that, like David Holzman, they found the act of recording their experience on film was the only way to impose order and meaning upon the experience.Alfred Hitchcock, I think, said something to the effect that drama was just real life ""with all the dull parts removed.""  BWP does have some admittedly dull parts, and its detractors have seized upon these as proof of its badness.  Others have cited the repetitive dialogue, and the arguments that run in as many circles as the students themselves.  One could also argue, though, that these devices enhance the veracity of the film (at least on an emotional level--we all know it's not ""real"", right?).  Along with the fact that almost all the shots are point-of-view, they give the impression of actually being inside the film while it's happening.  This is another reason the film arouses so much enthusiasm.While remarkable in its own way, too much has been made of BWP's Web-driven publicity campaign.  If anything, the hype might have been too effective, in that it attracted (along with the curious film intellectuals) a number of people unsympathetic to this type of film.  On the bright side, it seems to have swept in quite a few people who, without knowing it, have been waiting all their lives to see something like this.  This is the kind of fan most likely to declare BWP their all-time favorite film, the best horror film since ""The Exorcist"", etc.  One hopes they will get equal enjoyment out of Burroughs, Cage, and ""L'Avventura""!For my part, I admit I don't see many regular horror films (though in retrospect I'm reminded that many landmarks of the genre, including ""Cat People"", ""Psycho"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", and ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" were also made on low budgets, if not micro-budgets), but do enjoy art that makes the viewer work a little.  I enjoyed BWP for all the reasons listed above, along with several images and sequences I expect to stay with me a long time.  Like a dog trying to get the last bit of meat off a bone, my mind keeps worrying at these scenes, trying to impose meaning on it all.This reminds me of how a conventionally-trained classical violinist tried out an avant-garde piece by Charles Ives and hated it, saying that if you swallowed something that disagreed with you, you could take something to get rid of it, but that he (the violinist) couldn't get these awful sounds out of his ears.  I wonder if some of the negative reactions to BWP might come from people unwillingly carrying it in their heads for days, weeks, maybe even months.BWP isn't my favorite film of all time, but I prefer it to all the other films I've seen so far this year.  I can imagine seeing better films this year, but the filmmakers are going to have to work a little to please me. (Heh, heh.)",The Blair Witch Project

The only good thing about this movie is that it's less than ninety minutes long. What's next: ""Watching Paint Dry"" starring Andy Kaufman? (Oh yeah, that annoying idiot is dead).

But seeing all of the background content (from the web site and so on) and then seeing it again thinking it really would be a documentary from the heart of horror, I can definitely recommend it.It's not a great movie in itself, but if you go to see it and think ""OK, this was what *really* happened"", it's a really chilling experience.As many others have commented, you don't need a huge special effects budget to make a chilling horror movie.As far as plot goes, it's not too creative - but the end was satisfyingly suspensive.This movie is best experienced in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest, so go buy a portable TV and VCR.

I had not the pleasure but the brilliance of this film was still apparent. Sure this is a one-off movie which can never be bettered if imitated but this is without doubt the film of a generation. All those blood-scary movies we watched as kids where the thought of seeing Jason killing the women with a shovel are gone, the scare is in your mind not in your sight.

638,Sheepi,AN UNQUESTIONED MASTERPIECE.... here's why,10,29 January 2000,"OK, first about all the very different opinions people have been having. The people who didn't like this movie have absolutely NO imaginations whatsoever!! So if you are a teenager who wants lame special effects to give you the picture, or if you just have no imagination, you'll hate this movie. You HAVE to have a good imagination; there are never any special effects in this movie.I LOVE this movie because of the lack of special effects. I'll tell you a horror movie that REALLY SUCKS: Scream ! What a piece of crap!
*NOW FOR THE SUMMARY/OPINIONS:*Blair Witch Project is a realistically portrayed movie about three cussing teens who go into the woods together. They become lost, and things take a very frightening turn...           *maybe a slight spoiler* the ending is a total surprise, but if you listen closely, there are hints towards this ending in the beginning. This movie gave me nightmares. It was incredibly scary, the best horror movie I've EVER seen. In short, you MUST see this movie!! Perfect 10/10.",The Blair Witch Project
639,horrorflicklover,"Unique, Intriguing, Suspenseful",10,28 October 2013,"Maybe I don't get the critics of this movie. I think we can all agree that by the late 1980's, the horror genre was beaten to death. Scream eventually came along in the mid-90's and gave it the shot in the arm that it needed. However, soon after the genre was flooded again with much lesser films cashing in on Scream's success. So what was the Blair Witch Project? A very different horror film indeed. While not the first of the found footage genre, it made a much larger impact than previous movies of the sub-genre had. And like Scream before it, it gave something fresh and original to the horror film scene. Isn't that what we wanted all along? By 1990, slasher flicks were a dime a dozen. Same in 1999 with the films that followed Scream. Blair Witch went in to an entirely different direction. Sure, it was proposed before Scream (and filmed the following year of it's release), however, it came at a great time. Just as horror movies were yet again becoming tired parodies of themselves. I don't even know why we need to put spoilers, seeing as just about everyone whose heard of the film knows how it ends. But know this: If you're expecting a bogeyman to jump out at you, then you'll be disappointed. If that's what you must have in a horror film, then keep going. Blair Witch operates largely on the elements of intrigue and suspense. Suspense, intrigue, both important elements to any great horror film (like Halloween). But unlike many of these films, there is no bogeyman on screen. Everything is left open to interpretation, with the general idea being the same. You clearly see these things happen in Blair Witch, but you have no real idea why they're happening, or who's responsible. You're not given an answer, you're not given violence and gore, you're not given big, on-screen effects, you never even see the antagonist's face. But you are given clues, ways to connect the dots.But THAT is just what made this film great. It was a solid, original idea that was executed remarkably. It didn't follow a typical formula, but why should that matter? If this film couldn't be enjoyed for what it was, then it's not the fault of the film. Because it's simply not a bad movie. To dislike it because it wasn't well-written, executed, or interesting, I can understand. But if that's what you think, then are we even talking about the same film here?It doesn't have the typical ending, or the typical ""bad guy jumps out at you"" moment. But it's a sure horror thriller, and the rhyme and reason is all made obvious if you've paid attention throughout.The Blair Witch Project is a classic. A movie that laid the groundwork for mainstream acceptance of it's sub-genre, and became a masterpiece of it's main genre in it's own right. This is a must-see for any horror fan.",The Blair Witch Project
640,somlaign1,"Boring, boring boring. Did I say boring?",1,18 July 2018,"I agree with another reviewer. This movie is soooo boring, it's just these 3 people wandering around the woods acting scared. You literally see nothing happening, just some moments where you think something is going to happen but then nothing, back to the 3 people being scared and breathing and crying into the camera. The hype for this movie is really when it was thought to have been based on a ""true"" documentary. Otherwise, it's really just pointless amateur video recording like the ones you do for drama class. I think ""Naked and Afraid"" is way more exciting, and I've never seen it, it just has to be because this is the most boring movie EVER.",The Blair Witch Project
641,jcook56050,Documentary gives it a 3,3,11 August 2009,"Honestly, at some age many of us are scared of going into the woods. But, for those of us who have been there at night with some preparation, it's really not that scary. The creatures come out to do what evolution and nature have given them the tools to do. In the winter, it's quiet, peaceful, and no senseless screaming. I kept watching and watching expecting someone in this acting group to calm down, look around them, assess their situation, and do something about saving what would have otherwise been a nice little outing. Alas, these bimbos kept whipping themselves into a self induced psychological frenzy; you know, the type that might get people killed. The real torture for me was trying to stay with the film until the end.That said, I do recognize the elements of film making here that may have appealed to the, supposedly, young audience that fed the hype machine. ""The Blair Witch"" breaks several of the cardinal rules that ran Hollywood motion pictures since the early history of film. Yet, the fact that it hyped its way to a huge profit will be the only footnote listed in the history books. It just doesn't stand up to good storytelling.Finally, one last observation. I gave this movie a 3 for one reason; I found the documentary about the Blair Witch Legend to be passable. However, for those of us from Tennessee, the parallels and similarity to our ""Bell Witch Legend"" is so obvious it's almost insulting. But, take heart. No one in Hollywood has yet made a passable film of our legend yet.I read today that the producers have announced they may make a sequel to the film. Be careful when you go back into the woods guys.

642,jordman10,Nightmarish and truly frightening genius,10,26 July 2006,"These filmmakers know what is truly frightening. People don't get it. People can not watch a movie and put themselves into a scenario and imagine how terrifying it would be to be hopelessly lost, having your friend disappear mysteriously and be awoken late in the night by his futile cries for help and knowing there is nothing you can do, and most terrifying of all being stalked by what you can't see. People don't like this movie because it forces you to reach into the deepest part of your mind and imagine what is stalking you. If you don't know what it is, you can imagine anything. That is what makes this movie so terrifying. This is brilliant and very well done. ***** out of ***** and for all you dumb mother F****** who don't like this movie.

One minute you're driving along, the next you're in shock lying on the side of the road, pinned under your car, horribly injured, dying.Really, it's the scariest f___ing thing imaginable.

645,delbomber,"""Eeriest"" rather than ""scariest"" movie ever made",8,1 August 1999,"Has there ever been so much hype for such a low-budget film? This film may have gotten a bigger push than any other low-budget movie in cinematic history, and in the end I believe it was hurt by this.Not only was it being billed as ""the scariest movie ever"" but there were also rumors that these events actually occurred, and the film had been pieced together from actual footage (which is not true, of course). Whether or not the legend is real, I don't know, but it seemed real enough, where one might believe it actually happened. I felt the three actors involved were practically flawless, giving some of the most realistic performances I have ever seen; the fact that they ad-libbed all their lines must have helped them in this respect, but nonetheless they were excellent.The problem I had with the film is that it isn't scary enough; there were more scenes where I found myself laughing than feeling scared, which was not the intent of the directors. It WAS eerie, I have no qualms about that, but it had the potential to be terrifying without wandering into the realm of ""campiness,"" and with a little more substance than innuendo it would have truly been a masterpiece (perhaps if they heard chanting at night instead of the all encompassing wood-snapping sound it would have been more effective at conveying the intense fear the characters must have felt which, judging by people's comments around me after it was over, was not accomplished). What is meant to be inferred or imagined is almost always more frightening than anything that can be portrayed on screen, but even the subtleties were TOO subtle, and they should have been a bit more graphic.The conclusion of the film was terrifying and it wasn't until then that I felt truly frightened. There is something intrinsically creepy about the woods, but I think the film-makers relied to much upon that assumption.",The Blair Witch Project
646,dynagirl,Hansel & Gretel revisited with terrifying realism,10,1 August 1999,"The Blair Witch Project was, without a doubt, one of the most intense films produced in a very long time. It's documentary style not only gave it a real feel, but also allowed the audience to experience the entire story first hand. As the characters spiral into terror of unimaginable proportions, you take the journey right along with them.Story and character development are superb and the acting is surprisingly realistic. You'll actually have to remind yourself that it isn't a true story. But the nicest thing about this creepy little film is how much is left to your own imagination. With the massive budgets of most commercial films, we're so used to ""seeing"" everything that nothing shocks the average movie goer anymore.

647,jcpdiesel21,A very original scary movie,7,5 September 1999,"I loved the concept of this movie: three filmmakers who intend to film a documentary and end up getting lost and tormented by the Blair Witch.  And the fact that the entire premise was made up is very cool.  The filmmakers of this movie were very clever in coming up with an idea that no one else has.  Unfortunately, many clones will probably result because of all of the success the movie has had.  All of the hype that surrounded this movie drove me to see it.  I am a big fan of scary movies and wanted to see what made this movie so different from the rest of the pack.  I appreciate the fright factor in the film.  The fact that there is no bad guy is a very different concept and a chilling one at that.  In all of the scary movies that I've seen there is a bad guy who invades your thoughts and you end up thinking about that night in your darkened bedroom.  But in this movie there was no bad guy... which seemed to me to be ten times scarier.  While I was watching the movie, I anticipated much more than was shown to me on the screen.  I kept waiting for something to happen... yet hardly anything did.  Here I can see why people did not like the movie.  The element of the movie is suspense, but in our society we are used to thrills and chills and immediate action.  The ending had my friends and me arguing for weeks.  Ambiguous endings can be good for a film.  In that way, you can put your own spin on what just happened on the screen.  When the movie ended, I was initially disappointed.  But this is one movie that gets under your skin with its unanswered questions.  You think about it more and more and wonder what really happened out there in the woods.

The bad thing about it is that I heard too much about it! I heard that the directors made all the tricks, and that the actors were improvising, that sometimes when you are watching the movie, you are thinking what were really those people thinking? The scary part is that they really were there, that the trees aren't fake and that when they run, they really run, and that when they are hungry they really are. I have to recommend the movie though, because is a good movie to watch. if you are tired of Hollywood, and if you are tired of movies in general, becuase you think they all look the same.

649,kevdoggy,Genius at work here...,9,4 August 2001,"This is a wonderfully-crafted film, and it shows how much (or little) money matters in filmmaking.One way to tell how good a script is, is how UNSCRIPTED the dialogue sounds. I'm still not sure ""Blair Witch Project"" operated on much of a script; I do know that regardless, the story moved along masterfully.I had heard that in early screenings, audiences who didn't know better really believed the film to be true, and were genuinely horrified.The true genius of this film is THAT I KNEW IT WAS FAKE, AND WAS STILL TRULY FRIGHTENED BY IT. (I'm a grown man not usually affected by such things.)
After first seeing this film, I used it as a yardstick when judging people I had just met.  I asked them if they had seen it, and asked them what they thought of it.Those that saw it and enjoyed it on some level, I decided, had some imagination and were people I wanted to know.  Those that disliked (or hated) it, were not the type I wanted to hang around with.Maybe it's TV, maybe its technology, maybe it's the lack of reading and education in our country, but there's a real dearth of imaginative people in the U.S.It's a shame.",The Blair Witch Project

Sadly, the film is ALMOST as scary as a particularly good segment on ""The Simpson's Treehouse of Horror"", and offers practically no entertainment value. The improvised dialogue is witless and unimaginative, and the shaky hand-held camera work would give Michael Bay motion sickness. The performances are inconsistent, thought Heather Donahue's believable work is the highlight of the film.Overall, I cannot stress clearly enough that ""The Blair Witch Project"" is just not scary.

651,manalone923,The biggest marketing scam in movie history. Only people who get scared by OTHER people being scared will like this crap.,1,1 December 2003,"This was a marketing scam that worked... plain and simple. And if you allow me the lengthy explanation, I hope you'll see legitamite reasons why I think it is an utter waste of time. If you don't want to read and either love BWP or instead want something that doesn't suck, go watch ""The Last Broadcast"". It's similar, came first, is better acted, and has an actual ending that makes sense.The BWP began with a huge ad campaign, in the form of allegedly ""true"" documents and paranoia propaganda that took major advantage of the internet community. It got people out in droves to see what this thing really was. And what it was was an hour and a half of kids with a camera, walking in circles through the woods, working themselves into a paranoid frenzy while building to a climax (spoiler next) that literally delivers nothing.(Spoiler end.) The premise, and what the online campaign hinted as being true, is this: A small town legend, the Blair Witch, is terrorizing a town and abducting children. Three stupid teens go into the woods armed with a camera and try to film / find evidence of this, and are never heard from again. Their videotape surfaces, and what is on it is mysterious.Now here's the literal truth of what happened: The two creators of this ""film"" built a long, slow consumer awareness program by leaking supposedly legitamite details of the Blair Witch incidents, like fictitous police reports and interviews. Over several months, people were hearing about the Blair Witch case with the overwhelming sense that it was all real. Then the ""film"" was released in theaters and included what was supposedly the non-fiction video documentary of three kids who disappeared while looking in those woods. The lines of fantasy and reality had been effectively blurred, and people came out in droves to see what was really going on.
Seeing as how the actors in the ""film"" were on Jay Leno that very weekend, I was readily aware that it wasn't real. But I went anyway, out of curiosity. I thoroughly, thoroughly despised what I saw. I didn't have high hopes, since I hadn't yet read the much more entertaining web site stuff. But I was so angry that at the end of the ""film"", I loudly said ""Bulls***! I want my 7 bucks back!"" And was met with rousing applause, and yes, a few boos.I'm a patient man, and very tolerant. I've seen subtitled, three hour long black and white foreign films. Ever heard of the 50 hour ""Three Kingdoms"" chinese hitorical series? Yeah, I sat through that. I liked Titanic. And I've seen horror movies including Dawn of the Dead, House of 1000 Corpses, the Sixth Sense, Nosferatu, the black and white Frankenstein and Draculas, and even comparably modern junk like the Scream trilogy. And aside from Scream 3, I loved all of it. But with the Blair Witch Project, I was simply offended. I fell victim to a marketing scam, and the fact that some people still call it genius burns me to this day.This is why. The ""movie"", viewed as itself, is utter garbage. For the fans out there, what are you gauging the movie by? The acting? The plot? The PACING!? Three kids whine, nitpick, argue, and cry throughout the vast majority of it all. There's a scene when the most annoying character, the woman (she's that hideous nose / eye creature you see on the box and probably think is the Blair Witch) breaks down in hysterical, overacted tears simply because the team has made a circle and is crossing the same log they've already crossed. And if you don't mind, here's a spoiler so be prepared: There is no Blair Witch. You see nothing on camera. You hear some noises, see strange clues like wooden sticks. And at the end, during a scene that should have been halfway through the ""movie"", you see a creepy house with some blood on it. Then the movie ends. Period. I do not exagerrate. And I don't HAVE to see something to enjoy it. Jeez, 1997's ""Contact"" was great, for example. But when you build up a movie like this, can you not put SOMETHING up there to qualify my time?(spoiler done) But you see, we're supposed to buy all that because it's a masterful example of anticipation, suspense, and power of suggestion over visuals, harkening back to the old days when stuff didn't have to be flashy and obvious to be frightening. Well, no, sorry. There is nothing frightening about kids in a tent, crying and shivering, and saying they've heard things. (Poss. Spoiler:) It's a ghost story with no payoff. They, and we, see and hear nothing to suggest anything more horrible than common woodland noises at night. (Spoiler end) The kids work themselves up like schoolchildren and start freaking out so badly that they frighten themselves beyond belief, at nothing. That isn't scary, suspenseful, or playing on my natural fears. If I got afraid just because I saw other people terrified of whatever it was that they were imagining, I would have been a basket case in grade school. And even if scared people WERE enough to scare me, it's still a wash because the majority of the ""movie"" takes place in the daytime, where nothing of importance happens. I go on vacations to other countries and tape less daytime commonalities than these idiots. And Yeah, if a ten minute argument over someone losing the map is scary, then I guess I've just been spoiled by GOOD films like Psycho and The Thing.And these kids are just horrible to begin with. They're the most annoying bunch I've ever heard, and I was hoping halfway through that the girl would just die to move the plot. But instead, we get lots of arguing, lots of wandering, lots of hysteria, and a few hints of plot like finding an unidentified bloody cloth one morning.Here, in its simplicity, is why this ""movie"" does not deliver. 1: If it's viewed on its own, without external knowledge of promotional material, the movie is baseless, without support, and with no closure or explanation. Without background information it's a pointless mess, so we must judge it by the material that got us interested in the first place- and that material was far more interesting. 2: If viewed as REAL, one must ignore the fact that it's well known as one of the most fiercely debated and famous films ever. But since the hook was that it might BE real, it's a waste. 3: If one watches it as a MOVIE to be entertained by, it's a dud due to horrible and annoying performances, no pacing or twists, and worst of all, no payoff. It winds up being an amateur film without music, lighting, or a good script.All I can say is that the fake case history that the creators came up with to sell this crap WAS intruiging, and was more interesting than the ""film"" by leaps and bounds. My cousin struggled to defend his like of the ""movie"" until finally deciding on a reason that satisfied him, and became the only explanation I could possibly buy: That Blair Witch was worth watching simply as a side bonus to the crafted material that he was more interested in. I don't want to insult the people who did like the ""film"", but if you did, that must mean it scared you. Well once you get over the fear, I ask you to watch it again a few times. WHAT scared you? What mood were you in, to where you were actually frightened? Was it simply not knowing what the kids would find? (Spoiler alert) Well now that you know you never see the supposed Witch or anything that is NOT possibly manmade, is it still scary? (Spoiler over).  I wasn't scared at all because I knew it was fictitous, and went anyway just to see what was supposedly so good. I was bitterly disappointed to see Blair Witch for what it was: Two guys who took advantage of the gullibility of the public, tempted them, played to their fear, and failed to deliver on a mental, intellectual, or even visual level. The only ""genius"" of the Blair Witch Project is, simply, how well it was used to scam the public. And I truly believe that the only people scared by this ""film"" are people like the kids IN it: People who are scared because it seems like they should be, without even any evidence to support the fear. Sure, you may watch the BWP thinking it'll be scary, and nervous in anticipation of what you might see. But by the end, what did you ACTUALLY see? Don't you feel cheated?
Well if not, what scared you is called mass hysteria, and it worked decades ago with War of the Worlds...Which wasn't even an intentional scam. Oh yeah, it was free too.",The Blair Witch Project
652,DiCaprio74,No.,5,28 May 2015,"I feel as though this movie had gotten gassed too much. Yes, it was one of the first documentary style horror films that was evolving around the supernatural beings. However, it was also one of the worst. The acting in this was simply annoying. I understand that it was supposed to be some type of found footage of some sort and as though they all disappeared and some hikers found this tape and decided to edit it and put it out to the public, but it was trying too hard to focus on them being themselves that there was no type of acting ability within it at all. This movie was only given a 5/10 solely because it was the first of its kind. Yet, everything else about this film, was not as good as everyone had claimed it to be. In my opinion, if you would like to see where all of the present day 'documentary style footage' originated, I would watch this film just to get some history down packed.

Its real brillianceAnd also i dont beleive on ratings, how could great horror movie of all time has only 6.4 rating because people who rate it doesn't like horror movie i think. So dont trust on rating. 
And also this movie and some other horror movies made me believe that if horror movie has rating above 6 its truly good its like having a rating of 10. I love3eeeeeee this movie",The Blair Witch Project

This time you see nothing, no ugly faces, no bad guy seen, no river of blood filling the screen. It's your task to put a face to the danger the kids are facing... and if you come into the plot, they will be your own fears who will appear. This is what I like of this movie: it is your mind who frightens yourself.I understand why some people did not like this movie when they saw it, but for me it was really scary. Frightening enough to look for that little pile of stones in front of my bedroom when I woke up next morning :-) In short, a good movie, and people intelligent enough to raise the interest about it.

There is no fear like that of the unknown. Add in hopelessness, despair and an inability to instantly remove onesself from a situation, I really don't see what could be more frightening, nor could I imagine a film that portrays these feelings any better.",The Blair Witch Project

That said, I don't think I have ever looked so forward to a movie and been so disappointed. I can't believe that this was the movie that everyone has said is the scariest movie ever made, they are still having nightmares, can't walk in the woods in broad daylight, etc. I went expecting to be scared out of my wits. I made my husband go with me, I was so scared beforehand. (I am actually scared quite easily.) There was no need--I could've watched this alone, at midnight.  Like I said, I did like the movie.  I just don't understand what is supposed to be so terrifying about it. It was a really clever concept and was actually quite enjoyable.  And mind you, the things in the trees, the bundles of sticks, and the end (although very ambiguous)were really creepy. But people actually think this is scarier than ""The Exorcist""?  Please.  I will recommend it to my friends but I will tell them not to take a change of underwear.  They won't need it.",The Blair Witch Project

660,nimstic,One of the most frightening films ever,8,31 October 2013,"This movie is serious business, very frightening experience to say the least. Since I am someone who always wanted to make a documentary of my own, I could relate to it more but I am pretty sure, all of us film ourselves during such expeditions these days. The film triumphs in two areas. One in consuming your entire attention span to travel with these three characters, the other in presenting it to you in a more believable, frightening manner (pieced through amateur footage) This movie is an influential work because it then spawned a slew of similarly made movies (although Cannibal Holocaust was made earlier, this seemed more real and entertaining to this day and age). I thoroughly enjoyed the horror aspect of this movie, and I am not someone who finds horror movies very shaking (Except for The Exorcist, of course) but this was quite scary. I felt mind- numbing frustration in situations when the main characters' spirit & tolerance started to decline, and slowly begin to realize how meek, insignificant we are if we are not part of our society or within our comfort zone or left it the dark with an unknown fear factor, with very crazy things happening around you but you can't see or tell what it is. The makers manage to infuse terror in a very natural way too, that's the main success feature of the film. I feel sorry for some viewers in this forum who couldn't enjoy the film because they were trying to make 'sense' out of the characters shooting such frightening situations, calling it unrealistic etc. Probably why IMDb has a low rating for this movie too. It never bothered me, my suggestion is either you don't notice it/disregard it OR you look at film as their passion, or something humans can do in hopeless situations (ie, if I know my fate is sealed in such a terrifying situation, I would consider filming myself so that the world gets to know what happened to me someday, now that I can't save myself anymore). Watch the early interviews with locals carefully (real people) for you to understand the ending very well. Excellent movie. Definitely goes down as one of my all favourites. Cannot think of a major flaw.",The Blair Witch Project
661,LessThanPaddy,Criminally underrated.,10,18 May 2017,"I say 'criminally underrated' because there seem to be two schools of thought concerning this movie. The first appreciate how much this film does with so little resources, i.e. these people take the time to enjoy it and become engrossed throughout by the well structured tension... The second school switch off early because of the lack of a horrific CGI witch flying around tearing people apart for the sake of it, thus dubbing it as 'boring' because 'nothing happens'... i.e. those people don't appreciate how this film rejects visuals in favour of a well-thought out developed story.Blair Witch Project (BWP), is absolute minimalist genius when you consider how little happens in it... yet so much happens! It's a slow build up of tension based around reasonable sounding lore in an environment that we could all imagine ourselves being in. Horror films have regressed so much in recent years, mainly because jump scares become too commonplace to be scary, the visuals are too far-fetched and the back stories are horribly written. BWP addresses all of these by putting the audience into such a real scenario, at no point is there any hard evidence of the supernatural...and it is that very insecurity that keeps things interesting!You need only read the wealth of trivia to appreciate what the writers and actors went through to make this all happen. One piece of trivia claims that we were supposed to get a flash of the Blair Witch herself at one point for a brief moment but due to a cameraman error this didn't happen... personally I think it's better that way and always believed that part of the mystery was not being able to see her.Found footage films haven't had a good hit in a while, personally I don't think any could top this one. Say what you like about all the fancy visuals in Cloverfield, they just can't give you what the BWP provides...

While the plot is fairly original and the film is atmospheric I find it impossible to relate to or sympathise with the characters.

Just another ""Scream""-type movie. All hype and no chills.Boy was I wrong! This movie has it all. It would make Hitchcock proud, and I hope it makes Wes Craven really ashamed!!! Cause while Mr. Craven has spent his entire life on making the chills with SFX, he's forgotten the rule that nothing is scarier than what you cannot see, what's all inside your head, sounds coming from everywhere and nowhere, and the stories that scared the wits out of you when you were a child.

664,H Lime-2,Disappointing but not a total loss.,6,5 August 1999,"Hi All!I finally got to see BWP & I have to say I was disappointed.  My biggest problems with it included: 1) The actors, whom I felt just weren't that good (""Mike"" was OK, ""Heather"" was variable, & ""Josh"" was annoying); 2) The characters, who tended to act in such a way as to best advance the plot--sitting & sulking when they should be getting the heck out of there, and getting helplessly lost in the middle of the crowded eastern seaboard. I mean, even a tenderfoot like me knows to follow a creek downstream to find civilization.  And why didn't they bring a cell phone--a necessity for camping out in the 90's?; 3) The technical qualities in some instances--the sounds the characters heard, for example, were muddy & indistinct, at least in the theatre in which I saw the film.  All these things detracted from the ability of this viewer to suspend disbelief, something very important for a horror film.On the other hand, I did like the jumpy camera work & the fact that the characters weren't very sympathetic people since those things *helped* the reality of the film.  And the townsfolk who appeared at the start of the film were pretty good, especially the little girl who helped add to the anticipation of scariness.  What she did looked so unscripted that it seemed really creepy.  In sum, I think BWP is similar to the Exorcist--a not that scary movie which drives people crazy due to their expectations of being scared.  Maybe the sequel will be better.p.s. In fairness, I should note that I saw the movie in a theatre with a bunch of chatty, restless people & that didn't help my enjoyment of the film.  But I don't think my opinion would have been much different had I seen it under better circumstances.  I would say that this may make better viewing on video than in the movies.",The Blair Witch Project

Horror for the senses & Imagination, not cheap thrills.",10,1 August 1999,"Without compare, this low-budget thriller is in a close run with THE EXORCIST in my ""scariest movies of all time,"" and the only reason it doesn't beat out THE EXORCIST is because imo it's not as ""real"" and disturbing spiritually.  It is, however, a terrifying experience which I think is sure to set a new precedent for Hollywood scare-fests (or atleast I hope so).Simply, most of what happens with TBWP doesn't happen on the screen at all. I hate to burst your bubble, but if you go to this flick expecting to see some mean and evil looking ""witch,"" forget it.  The movie has barely anything to do with witches in the typical Hollywood sense of the word (nevermind the real sense of the word).  Neither will you find teenagers being axed to death during or after having sex, scantily clad cheerleaders fending off chainsaw welding maniacs wearing pig heads, psychotic transvestites with machetes bent on hacking apart those who jilted them, buckets of blood, HP Lovecraftian creatures lurking in shadows and beneath damp graveyards or any of the other stuff your USED to seeing on the silver screen these days being billed as ""horror.""  What you will discover is yourself immersed in the experience of the movie, like a cinematic funhouse where most of the horror is supplies by your imagination spurred by slight visual and mostly aural screen cues.  For the most part, not much happens on the screen... but the suggestion that there's something exceptionally horrific and inherently diabolical will ignite your imagination to fill in the blanks with a host of horrors individually suited for each theatergoer.  Now those are some noteworthy special effects!I won't give away any of the plot.  I won't tell you what finally happens at the end (?) of the film, suffice to say that I sat there with my jaw open staring at the screen in near shock.  And something else happened in the nearly 3/4 full theater which hasn't happened in a long time (and I'm a pretty regular theatergoer)... the audience was DEAD SILENT.  I could hear the breaths of those around me, sharp intakes, gasps, heart-pounding heavy inhales... this movie gripped the audience and held it quiet and interested.  There were some minor scenes where the tension was allowed to vent a bit, but for the most part it was a slow boil toward a crescendo which was unlike most any other movie I could mention to compare.This film is innovative by design.  Everything from the actors to the presentation to the marketing was a refreshing wind to this summer's movie calender.  It's ironic that perhaps the lowest budget film I've seen thus far this summer is perhaps the best.  It is perhaps best successful because it really does draw the viewer into the picture like the best campfire ghost story.FOUR STARS, no disappointment, this film lives up to the hype.

It's the kind of movie best enjoyed on the first viewing, like THE RING or MEMENTO; analyze it to heavily and you ruin some of the thrills. The concept of a completely staged documentary is, of course, not new. The best example, and the one that BLAIR WITCH most resembles, is an excellent French film called MAN BITES DOG; the latter is a much better film, but BLAIR WITCH pulls off its premise more realistically than any other ""mockumentary"" I've ever seen. Talented but completely unknown actors man the cameras and much of the sound effects throughout the film, while simultaneously remaining in character enough to improvise as each new terror is presented to them. Of course, they knew it was all staged, but the verisimilitude achieved in the film cannot be denied. Shooting in ""real time"" and actually depriving the actors of food and rest, as well as scripted lines and any cognizance of plot direction, it is easy to see how writer/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez managed to perpetrate this ingenious hoax to the point where audiences were actually terrified.

I tried to exercise some control by looking away from the screen but my eyes were drawn back there because I wanted to see what was going on!  I thought that I might see something that the characters didn't.  Considering that I knew the premise beforehand, I was astounded at how much of a rise the movie got out of me, and I must admit that I bought the whole thing.

The few scary scenes are hardly unsettling or truly scary, although there is a *slight* creep out factor in them.Since most of the movie does not attempt to be scary, there are a few good laughs in it. Actually the comic parts of it are better at being funny than the scary parts are at being scary.**ALSO** Some people are going to see this movie under the impression that it is real footage that was found ...or that it was a shot by shot remake of real footage that was found...Which is not true!

677,Dwayans,A good creepy little chiller,7,5 August 1999,"Notice i said CHILLER, 'cause this movie or docu-horror pic, leaves chills down your spine long after the movie is done. It is well done and original. You actually FEEL what the characters are feeling, and also it helps that at the fact the actors in here are obviously not well known. That even helps the audience identify with the characters. I also think that most of the dialogue leading up to 2nd day in the woods, was actually good. Some others didn't think so, or at least focused more on thre profanity, which was used quite frequently LATER on in the film.However I must say, it scares you more in the mind, but any visual scares acre more chilling than terorizing, especially for the ""main-stream"" audience. Actually the ""main-stream"" audience would probably be dissapointed at not only the fact it operates at a low budget, but also that it is filmed in documentary style, and has alot running and screaming at things that you can't even see. Besides that I think it was a well made movie, which u could feel the terror the characters went through as they search for the Blair Witch. Its scares might even fall short for one or two scenes(which i won't explain)cause i and my sister who i took with me, found ourselves laughing.

681,LnineB,The originator in so many ways.,8,7 December 2020,"This film will always be one of the most inventive and original horror films in my book. Although it wasn't the first found footage film, it definitely set off the trend of so many followers for the next two decades. In addition to that , this film will also be known as the film that probably had the most inventive marketing strategies ever. It literally went viral before anyone even knew the term or anyone even knew that such a thing could be accomplished with the internet. With all of that said, the film is constantly knocked by horror fans for not being ""scary"" or not realistic or ""cheesy"". To me the film shows how anyone can execute a powerfully suspenseful story with little to no violence and a very low budget. It all starts with the acting. The performances by the actors in this film are absolutely remarkable. I was 14 when I first saw it and literally still thought it was ""real"" when I went to the theater to see it. This was accomplished by the believable and realistic performances by everyone , especially the lead female. The story is simple but down right scary and honestly would've held its own as just a survivalist film. This leads to my only gripe with the film and that's the fact that it really didn't need to develop, the supernatural and/or murderer plot beyond what it did in the beginning. It really only served the purpose of giving others a reason to hate on it. Just being lost in the woods is scary enough and to me the director did an amazing job of creating an extreme level of intensity just with that part of the story. The ending was open ended enough to send chills down your spine, once again without showing any blood or gore. It's affective with just atmosphere and acting. Like I said earlier , some people really hate this film but what I find interesting is that many people who hate it love films that were obviously influenced by it.

When something strange begins to happend we witness a slow disintegration of the characters as they try to deal with what is happening to them. I felt I would behave in exactly the same way as the characters in the film and this allowed me to be drawn into the story. This film does not have any soundtrack or traditional camera trickery used in typical movies. If you go in expecting The Exorcist you will be disappointed, but if you are prepared to forget that the story is not true and allow yourself to be drawn in then you begin to experience the terror I felt while watching this film.I don't think it will stand up to too many repeated viewings as the film relies on suspense, more so than most films, and an element of that is always lost when you know what is going to happen.",The Blair Witch Project

684,Lamprey,"Overrated, but worth seeing for horror fans.",1,31 July 1999,"There are two ways to look at this movie: as entertainment, and in terms of it's importance.  As entertainment it is passable, but the importance of BWP is very great.  Hopefully this movie will encourage others to make movies that rely on similar scare strategies.  What this movie has is atmosphere. It doesn't use loud blares of music and expensive special effects to scare the audience.  You know what I'm taking about: Jan De Bont.  Compared to recent remake of The Haunting, Blair Witch is a masterpiece.Yet as I said, as entertainment BWP is only passable.  It is a repetitive bore, with a few scary scenes near the end.  The final moments leave a LOT to be desired.  A lot of people complain about gore in horror movies, but here it would have helped.  Without it, the movie seemed like just a bunch of kids running about in the woods trying to make a scary movie.  If we had actually seen, say, a glimpse of Josh, it would have worked wonders for the movie.  I also did not like the use of the second camera, as at the end we are not seeing the actual footage, but edited footage to heighten tension. Considering the movie is desperately trying to be realistic, this completely shattered the believability of the last scene.Furthermore, the sound effects could have been equalized or something to make them more audible.  This is supposed to be realistic, but so much so that the audience can barely hear the sounds.  As it is, the sounds of Josh in the distance are drowned out by the footsteps and breathing of the other actors.Sadly, the audience I saw this with did NOT like the movie.  The film makers tried hard, but ultimately their low budget and unwillingness to use some special effects hurt the movie.  It might have made them money.  That is another story.  The Haunting made 33 million on openeing weekend.  What does that tell you?  These movies are all hype folks; the true judgement is what you thought of it yourself, how it made *you* feel.Heather Donahue could be in line for an Oscar nom with this one, even though the 'script' was overdone.  Despite this, she did great in her part.In the end, I don't know how this movie got so hyped, or got so many great reviews.  This is definitely not the most original movie I have seen, either.  Cannibal Holocaust, for instance, was in the same vein, and more disturbing.

Others say it's movies that mess with your mind (The Shining,), and others will say it's how much a movie startles you and makes you jump to the ceiling (can't think of one off hand).But real horror, is the type we cannot see.  It's the type that we leave to our imagination because we know that there could be any number of possibilites, and some of those can be so horrific, it gives you chills just thinking about it.  As is the case with The Blair Witch Project.  I saw the film in a packed movie theater and I've never seen a film captivate a group of people this big the way it did.  I'm talking about that everyone in the place was dead freakin' silent.  My heart was up into my throat by the time the movie ended.  I didn't jump, I didn't get grossed out, I just thought about the movie for hours after seeing it, and didn't sleep well at all that night.  Any horror movie that scares the living daylights out of me the way The Blair Witch Project did, is an absolute 10 in my book.  It's like not wanting to ride the rollercoaster, and then riding it and then saying you want to go on again.Take dramamime before seeing it, or if not, just look away from the screen every so often because the herky-jerky home video style filming will make you a bit queasy.  This movie deserves several mentions at the Academy Awards.  If not, then chalk up another injustice in the film industry.  If you happen to wait for home video to watch this, turn the lights off, and watch it by yourself.  The full effect of this masterpiece will be felt all the more.",The Blair Witch Project
686,Lucian-3,A great film that makes a sad comment on modern film-goers,9,4 August 1999,"As excellent as The Blair Witch Project is I am saddened by those who fail to appreciate it.  The era of postmodern film has gone on so long that audience members have lost the ability to empathize with characters on screen.  Movie makers have made their self-referential little jokes and reminded movie goers ""it's just a movie"" for so long now that people forget how to look at a movie as if it were real event.  BWP's attempt to create a hyper-realistic movie experience is sabotaged by those who choose to deride the film (out loud, in the theatre) simply because they have been so conditioned by CGI, soundtracks and big name stars they're no longer capable, or perhaps are afraid, to have a genuine emotional experience at a film.",The Blair Witch Project
687,Oriel,Beware the hype,6,5 August 1999,"I hate to leave myself open to the charge of being a wet blanket, but I've waited in vain to see someone else point out that this movie may well disappoint those who, like myself, had their expectations raised out of all proportion by the tremendous hype.  I'll say first off that BWP is well made, with convincing performances and a truly terrifying last 2-3 minutes. Otherwise, I found it a disappointment.Because so many reviews have hailed this as a deeply terrifying movie, I was actually afraid to go see it, being something of a wimp.  I need not have worried:  the film is tense, yes, even unpleasantly so, but the characters were not likeable enough to inspire great concern on my part, and the incidents that should have been frightening merely inspired interest and mild curiosity.  The one judicious use of gore was genuinely creepy and well executed (as it were), and, as I've mentioned, the final sequence is deeply scary. I think, though, that the much-lauded absence of Hollywood fakery actually worked against this film's effectiveness with me.  The hand-held cameras actually made the entire film seem more artificial instead of more realistic, so that I was constantly aware that this was, indeed, only a film.  This is a shame, since the situation is so promising and truly ought to have given me the shivers.  I offer my experience not to put down the many who have found the film everything it's cracked up to be, but only to suggest that for some--not all--viewers, it may not live up to their expectations.  I wish it had lived up to mine.",The Blair Witch Project
688,jeff-201,Wow.,8,2 August 1999,"I honestly don't know what to say about this film. So why am I writing, you ask? Because this film is possibly the best one I have seen in years. It is confusing, jaded, jarring, thrilling, and mystifying. The acting is superb, the production even better. Even an experienced film student walks away from The Blair Witch Project unsure of the true nature of the images on the screen. The barrier between fiction and non-fiction is truly tampered and disguised. And after much debate with many skeptics and cynics and filmmakers, I can only say that the only conclusion we have reached is that if it is crafted fiction - it is a supreme example of how a filmmaker can control sight and sound. And, of course, if it is non-fiction...See it. It charmed and scared me.",The Blair Witch Project

The film I saw wasn't scary in any aspect. Yes, there were a few creepy moments and nice build up at the end, but is there anything truly scary about this film?  No.  I honestly cannot fathom why people are calling this the scariest movie in history.  Most of the film was watching these people walk through the woods.  There was a chance for them to build psychological terror of being lost in the woods, but that was put on the back burner in favor showing night time events where nothing materializes.  I was highly disappointed in what I saw as false advertising for this film.",The Blair Witch Project
690,BigFlax,Boring and not scary,1,24 August 1999,"It seems that many people, including most reviewers, consider ""The Blair Witch Project"" to be one of the scariest horror movies ever and just a darn good movie in general.  Having seen it, I can't for the life of me figure out why.Not only is it not even remotely scary even in the parts where it should be the scariest, but it's unbearably boring and the camera work nauseates.I'll grant that a film that is supposedly pieced together from random footage shot in the woods is going to have camera work that looks like that, and that without all the aimless walking around and yelling, the movie would only be about 20 minutes long.  But I'm sorry, I just couldn't take it.  It was hands down one of the few movies I've ever seen where I actually contemplated walking out of the theater.  And the only reason I didn't was because I was curious as to what the ending was.  But it was almost not worth staying.Bottom line: not scary, not thrilling, not exciting, not even interesting. Only the acting, quite good for the fact that it was totally improvised, deserves to be commended.  F",The Blair Witch Project
691,folkie-imdb,lost in the woods at night,9,10 August 1999,"Blair Witch is a great show that succeeds despite its problems.Problems: The hand-held camera jostles irritatingly in the opening, but that allows you to better ignore the subdued bouncing that is often present later in the film.  Probably the dumbest thing in the film is that the film-makers always keep shooting film or video.  Personally, I would have been more impressed if most of the shots were less carefully framed, shot from the hip as it were, suggesting that the camera was being used more as a light source than as a recorder of events.  While I was able to suspend disbelief *while I watched*, the thought of all that running around (without tripping) while a camera is plastered to one's eye boggles the mind.  I was also p***ed that the trio mentioned following a stream but decided instead to completely rely on their obviously non-functional compass.Succeeds: All that aside, I loved this show (nine out of ten).  Woods don't scare me.  Lost in the woods doesn't scare me.  The woods at night doesn't scare me.  But oooooo I'd be scared if it went on for days and nights and days and nights and something/someone maybe? was stalking me.  I've been too tired to think straight.  I can empathise.  Ever see ""Things to do in Denver when you're Dead""  Remember the guy who decides to stay awake several days, waiting for the assassin?  That's the last half hour of Blair Witch.  I was expecting the trio to turn on each other at any moment.  And Heather? Loved her acting.  First time I can remember an actress allowing her voice to break while screaming -- it's bad for your voice, hurts, and pretty well nobody does it.  But it sounds so much more authentic.  That's the neat thing about this film -- it feels authentic.  I believed in these people. I was glad when the film ended.  I was tired of being scared.",The Blair Witch Project
692,twltzone,"Disney's ""Escape From Witch Mountain"" was better.",6,30 July 1999,"Trust me!!! This movie is not what you think it is. Interesting idea, but not scary or even suspenseful.  However, I think they have created an entertaining film, but its just not scary.The type of people who will think ""Blair Witch Project"" is scary are people who are afraid to watch programs that start off with: ""WARNING This program contains graphic images of a violent nature. It may not me suitable for all audiences.""I'm a big fan of the ""less is more"" school of thought, but this just didn't do it for me. I'll stick to Hitchcock and Rod Serling for that inspiration.Horror? NO WAY!!! Psychological Thriller? I think not! But entertaining: Yes. If you want to see an entertaining film then watch ""The Blair Witch Project."" However, if you want to see a scary movie then go rent Disney's ""Escape From Witch Mountain"" because its a lot scarier!!!",The Blair Witch Project
693,Bob-562,"Not as frightening as all the hype would have it, this is a fun and clever film nonetheless.",9,4 August 1999,"""The Blair Witch Project"" uses its shoestring budget to great advantage: without relying on expensive special effects, it forces the audience to use its imagination in confronting, along with the three filmmakers, the terrors of the unknown.  Hollywood today feels compelled to SHOW everything onscreen, to go for the cheap & easy shock.  This film relies on a well-honed script, very convincing acting (the actors seem ""real""), and taut direction that causes the audience to genuinely feel for, and empathize with, the woebegone filmmakers.  We've all been afraid of the dark, and this film builds its suspense on this premise.  The only downside for me about the film is that it could have left the mystery more ambiguous; i.e., I thought it emphasized too much that the mystery was genuinely supernatural, rather than manufactured (a prank by outsiders that got out of hand).  Other than that, I thought it was quite a good film.  Bravo!",The Blair Witch Project
694,delbruk,supernatural?,1,18 September 1999,after seeing the film and attempting to decipher the media hype surrounding it I have come to the conclusion that this film was nothing more than a staged advertising scheme designed to show that with enough media attention any piece of garbage on film could be sold to the public. They have succeeded.,The Blair Witch Project
695,MissTRious,"Oh dear, what a disappointment !",2,1 November 1999,"I think the most horrify aspect of this film was the cost of admission to the Cinema. I found it rambling, pointless and predictable. I must salute the creators for the wonderful hype and mystery that really was a work of art !To say the characters were 2 dimensional would be to reward them with too much depth. Three US college kids were always going to find it hard to connect with a UK audience but these three managed to make it damn near impossible!The ONLY time of tension for me was the un-steady-cam run from the tent into the dark, but 5 minutes does not make a suspenseful movie.Anyway, I was very disappointed with the film in general and the end in particular.

Maybe it is the age difference (I'm 39), but I didn't have any sympathy for the characters.  Their total lack of preparation, and misplaced confidence to near arrogance just blew it for me.

697,sleons,Only for peasants!,1,11 April 2012,I love horror movies and I recently had the chance to watch this one. It is admirable to make a low budget film a main stream thing. I think this film is an achievement in its publicity. But as a movie it's a complete piece of crap. In order for you to be scared by this movie you must be like a XII century peasant.Nothing really happens in the film. If you are afraid of people standing in a corner you'll be pissing your pants at the end. Unfortunately I need something happening for a horror movie to work its magic on me. Crappy cinematography just doesn't cut it for me.note: I also hate Paranormal Activity. In both cases (PA and BWP) I've met people who think they are real documentaries (this people are complete morons).,The Blair Witch Project
698,diegoavilarodriguez,this movie needs a remake... BADLY!!!!,1,20 December 2008,"OK, I have to be honest here, I saw this movie when I was 6 years old and later on watched it again to remember what was so bad about this movie... and now I remember why I hate this movie so much. First the bad things on this movie, this movie is so low budget that the whole documentary-like style of the camera had to obligatory cause they couldn't afford any camera men(though that style did change the world of movie making). Next, the plot, wow lost in the woods how original, that was seen in Friday the 13th so the whole lost in the woods things isn't so original, now the reason why they are lost in the woods was original but worst part of this film is the fact that it builds suspense for nothing(like the scene when they ran out of the tent, screaming and scared, suspenseful but not scary cause you don't even know what they running from.)For all I care it could be Bigfoot attacking them. Now the main thing people say about why this movie was so great was because they claim that the movie activates their ""imagination"", and I think that means that this movie leaves out so many unanswered questions that to them it's fun to fill in the blanks, of course not like the movie disappearance in which they leave out so many blanks it makes the movie awful, well that wasn't the case with the Blair witch project, but still even if it is fun to fill in the blanks with this film that is no excuse for the people who don't like to fill in the blanks, so to me it sounds like people like this movie because it basically wastes their time. And now we come to the center question of this film which is: Why did they not show the witch?! Now if they had shown the witch, I would just recommend you rent this movie but no, this movie is like a nightmare on elm street without Freddy Krueger, you wait around for something to happen, and when they finally come the ending the idiot chick drops the camera which honestly is a disappointment, you expect something creepy and all that, when nothing really happens at all, and really if a 6 year old doesn't get scared watching this film how can an entire nation get scared over some movie which is nothing more than a publicity stunt to gain quick cash. Alright, now though the whole movie was a waste of time there is the upside of the fact that this movie did have an original storyline and did have the potential to be a horror classic, but of course it was not a true horror classic, now this movie is like the Hulk which was a good idea pretty much screwed up so this film needs a remake seriously and it needs it right now.",The Blair Witch Project

Its just that most of the time it was them going endless cycles in the woods.I know all the blair witch stuff was suppose to be in your imagination, but there was barely any time to imagine because it was pretty much just those three people argueing anyway.WARNING SPOILER:It got the most interesting at the end and the creepiest too when you see that guy in the corner(who was dead) of the house they found",The Blair Witch Project

I was truly scared when I looked at my ticket stub. I will never get that 86 minutes of my life back.They should have shot blanks at us during the movie. At least then, I'd actually be scared.

I found all of the actors very convincing, and the point-of-view camera work really puts you into the action.  The last sequence, with its chilling final shot, is unequaled in all of movie history. This is truly a landmark film, something that must be seen in the theater, and shouldn't be missed by anyone.",The Blair Witch Project
711,TechnicallyTwisted,A testament to no-budget film-making,8,12 September 1999,"This film has maybe been one of the most hated 100 million dollar grosses in history.  Before seeing this movie one should know absolutely nothing about it.  Not even what the critics have said.  It is a very creepy film.  I for one loved it.  I love the fact that it had virtually no-budget and it has made tons of money.  It deserves it.  It provides more atmosphere and creepiness than any horror film released this decade.  The way it is presented, as the footage taken by 3 missing film-makers, is so simple yet pure genius.  I've heard people complain that anyone with a video camera could have made this.  This is true, but those people didn't and these people did.  They had the idea and those who criticize it are just displaying their jealousy that they didn't think of it first.  An instant classic whether you like it or not.",The Blair Witch Project

713,ElectricWarlock,A brilliant horror movie,10,5 March 2013,"This is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The main reason I love it is because it leaves everything up to the imagination of the viewer. It doesn't show you the villain (whoever or whatever it may be), so you have to decide for yourself what is happening. This film gives the viewer just as large of a role in the film as it does with the characters. I can't think of many films that do that, so this film is truly one of a kind. If you don't have an imagination and like to have every detail of a film spoonfed to you, this film is not the one for you. This is a horror film that actually requires the viewer to think, and not all viewers like to do that, so that's one of the main reasons many seem to dislike it.This film doesn't need cheap gore, brutal death scenes, tasteless nudity, or even overly loud jump scares. It relies solely on suspense and atmosphere. Every moment of the film captures the viewer's interest and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what is going to happen next. The amount of tension this film builds is horrifying. There is a brooding atmosphere that permeates the entire film. The second you see the characters, you can sense that something bad is going to happen and you dread it. You really feel sorry for the characters and sympathize with the situation they're going through. This is due to the amazing performances from Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard. You can't tell they're acting at all. It seems as if they're truly in danger.If you like subtle, intelligent horror films that are truly about being scary rather than blood, gore, and loud noises, this is the film for you. If not, then perhaps you would be better off watching something else.",The Blair Witch Project
714,cjh668908,There's nothing worse than shaky camcorder footage,1,27 February 2013,"This ""movie"" is a ""documentary"" about the so-called Blair witch legend. It was marketed and hyped up as a true story, that three teenagers went into the woods in search of the Blair witch in October 1994 and never returned. Then their camcorder footage was found a year later.The whole idea behind this movie was to scare its audience with the concept of making the audience get frightened of things they don't see. It's called psychological horror. Other horror movies of the past have accomplished this goal. The Haunting (1963) is a perfect example. The Haunting was a professionally made movie with a musical score, the whole nine yards. In contrast, The Blair Witch Project was filmed with a camcorder and a shaky one at that. There is no music in the film. It's raw. It has a skeletal budget. It has the sounds of the day and the sounds of the night and the sounds of profane teenagers. It's basically a ""reality"" film about some teens who are lost in the woods in search of a legendary witch that supposedly lives there. The fact that they're looking for a witch and lost at the same time makes them increasingly frightened and frustrated as the movie progresses.The main problem I have with this film is that the footage is so shaky and amateur-ish. This movie is unwatchable. It'll make you dizzy and give you a headache. It's fine to use a camcorder. I thought it was a unique way to film a documentary ""movie"". But at least make the footage watchable. I can understand the camera shaking at times when the kids are running away from something that's scaring them, but to have shaky footage when they're just sitting around and talking or when planning their trip is really inexcusable. If I want to watch really bad and I mean REALLY bad and shaky camcorder footage, I can watch any one of the countless lame and shaky videos that people I know have made throughout the years. I don't know what's so hard about keeping a steady camera. This film would have been better if the camera-work was better. Instead of feeling scared, I found myself being distracted by the terrible camera-work and feeling dizzy with a headache, also. The bad camera-work robbed me of any scared feeling I was supposed to have when watching this film.",The Blair Witch Project

716,dermottferry,scariest film ever,7,10 January 2008,"Forget Halloween. Forget Scream. Forget even the Exorcist. This is the best Horror film ever made, quite simply because, whether you like to admit it or not, it creeps you out.I remember the night my brother and cousin went to see it in the cinema, and afterwards, my cousin who is in his twenties, didn't want to walk home by himself.This is a film that takes one of the most obvious horror stereotypes- the big bad witch- removes all the cheesiness of 90% of the horrors we see nowadays- and replaces it with a brilliantly made movie that scared the bejesus outta me.Its simple really- three film makers- Heather, Josh, and Mike- make their way into the woods to make a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch.What begins as an enjoyable film making experience quickly turns into something different as they face a terrifying experience, lost in the woods with SOMETHING after them.What I liked most about the film is that its shot in a documentary style, every moment of their terrifying experience is seen first hand. The two directors promoted the film by saying it was real footage- and you forget at times that its just a film.There are some real terrifying moments. The discovery of that now famous Blair Witch symbol hanging from the trees, to the tent shaking, and then the final scene in the house.I believe that this is how a horror film should be made. No big breasted dumbass running up the stairs instead of the safety of the front door to escape the clutches of a crazed serial killer. What the directors have done here is they have taken a genuine fear for some people- lost in the woods- and played on it in the scariest way possible.I don't think that this film has the rating it deserves on IMDb.

 Typical gen X solipsism. Someone that suggestible could actually work themselves into fear over...nothing. And they do, because you can see all the terrified ones that thought it was great. But if you don't create the delusion...well, you see the rest of the reviews. There's nothing there. They seem to recover though, if you look at the movie's ratings trend.

It will scare the pants off of you, but only if you let it.  Seeing the website ahead of time works.But if you're like me and didn't see the site, the very style of the movie will draw you in.  It's a Real World-cum-documentary device that's used, and it's used to perfection.  The point of view of the movie gives us an almost intrusive angle on the entire story.  Instead of giving us detailed bios on the characters, the movie lets its own technique draw us in.  Brilliant. (If you NEED detailed bios, or anything of the sort, see the site.)The whole thing is eerie.  The images from the film are with me a week after seeing it, and it scared me quite nicely.  There are people who don't get it, don't understand it, or simply don't like the way the movie ""looked"". Great.  Go see something flashy, then.

Supposedly shot for less than the price of a car, unknown actors, POV camcorder work, no musical score... a very gutsy and ambitious project. The film was marketed brilliantly.  Everyone wondered, ""Is it real?""  Enough so that every show was a sellout while in limited release.  And slowly, the hype kept building... ""The greatest horror movie since THE EXORCIST.""Don't believe the hype.  For all its originality and ambition, it's a disappointing scare.  Too few heart-thumping moments.  It's a story more about how not to get lost in the woods than about any witch or ghost.  I understand the concept: don't let the audience know anything more than the characters.  Use sparse sounds and suggestions; let the audience's imagination do the rest.  But here's the problem with that: there's no payoff.  You're left TOO MUCH to your own imagination.  A fleeting glimpse of SOMETHING in the last camera shot is all it would have taken to satisfy me (and most of the audience, judging by the reaction I heard in the theatre).It's a brilliantly shot film.

There are no cheap scares or really jump out of your seats moments. Gore is almost totally nonexistent. Instead the movie is almost two stories. First, the story during the day about three college students who are lost in the woods and the dynamics as they slowly disintegrate as a group and as individuals. Second, the story at night where something is sitting just beyond the range of their cameras and lights hunting them. Blair Witch, like Night of the Living Dead, focuses more on the group dynamics than on the horror that lurks outside. It isn't clear which is more frightening- the unseen witch or the slow descent to madness of the individuals. The first person point of view created by viewing the ""documentary"" footage really puts you into the setting and leaves you straining to see what lies in the dark just like the characters do in the film.  It is a startling vision and one very much worth watching if you are looking for horror along the lines of Night of the Living Dead, Psycho, or The Thing- horror that is more psychological than visual.",The Blair Witch Project

Like The Exorcist, The Big Lebowski and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Blair Witch falls into this category. I loved it, but I heard a lot of people in the cinema mumbling things like 'that was shit' when it finished.  It was probably over hyped as 'the scariest film ever' which it is not.  In any case, though, no one can deny that you can't help thinking about it constantly the rest of the night after watching it.

All the movements of the camera in the film made me sick, not to mention how horribly BAD the movie itself is. Come on, all those stories in the horror movies doesn't really exist! They are just like that-movie. And when you mix it with total reality, it doesn't work. If they shot a few more glimpses of the witch, it might be better. All the made -up things in it is just ridiculous. This IS original, but it's not scary at all (or at least, not a bit scarier than any other horror movies). This creativity should be put somewhere else, not on the big screen. If you want good horror, don't waste your time and money on this movie .

726,scotty12,good idea ruined by unsympathetic characters,5,30 November 2000,"The hype is right - this movie does bring something new (or at least forgotten for about 40 years) back to horror movies - scaring the viewer by tapping into their own fears.  That can't be done by special effects.  They take you away from reality.  The best scary movies are believable because you can feel yourself in the situation.  So it doesn't actually matter whether or not you know the story is real - it works because you can very easily imagine it could be.I liked the camerawork, the grainy film, the clever tricks like switching from b/w to colour & back, pointing the camera at the ground while you hear weird noises.  But while the actors were good in their parts, what makes you not care about the film as you otherwise would is the unlikeability of the main characters.  It's a fine idea of the breakdown of relationships under pressure, and it's fair enough to show the actors shouting and arguing at each other as well as their situation.  But we got too much of this, actually they were pretty much fighting with each other the entire time. This made them unlikeable ultimately - we should have seen some warmer aspects of their characters.And hey, I don't mind a bit of bad language when characters are under real pressure, but it should be used sparingly or else they're just unpleasant, brutish, and you can't care about them as you want to.  These guys (all three including the girl) were shown to be swearing the whole movie, even before any scary or pressure situations - they could hardly utter a single sentence without it!  Realistic?  You don't get this level of bad language even in settings where you would more likely expect it (eg the Godfather, Reservoir Dogs).  That made them too unsympathetic, and for a real scare you SHOULD care about at least some of the characters.Overall - good horror movie, but could have been quite a bit better.  I'd put it definitely outside my personal top 100 movies, maybe around number 200 or so.",The Blair Witch Project

This movie is really disappointing (I`m polite). First, it`s not scary at all. The script wanted carefully to follow the rule `do not show the monster to be scary` but what it obtains is that it doesn`t show ANYTHING worth watching. Second, the interesting idea of the story is the part we all saw in the trailers and commercials. The story in the film adds a little more and not always unexpected: in conclusion BORING. Third, the camera work, in the attempt to appear `real`, is unpleasant (most scenes are shot while walking or running and this causes something like the sea-sickness). If I can forgive the neorealistic movies, the intellectual French movies, the Danish DOGMA movement for this is only because they can offer something back and the naive camera work adds something to the overall art of the movie. But here? The post-movie question was: are we really all stupid to be cheated by a commercial? The answer was: yes. But only this time.It`s another proof that a good (excellent) marketing is enough to make money in this business.

729,ian_bell,"If you go down to the woods, PLEASE take more than one camera",6,30 May 2010,"After seeing this film way back when it was released I came out of the theatre struck dumb and feeling rather nauseous. Not due to anything horrifying up on the screen - if only there had been - but simply down to the jerky and repetitive camera-work.Blair Witch is an admirable idea, yet the directors stick too rigidly to their premise. By using one camera they induced seasickness in me, and no doubt a good many other people going by the comments at IMDb. To provoke fear you often have to create a sense of scale and movement - think Jaws, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Psycho to name but three. Fear is just as much about open spaces and a sense of isolation as it is about dark corners and close-ups. Clearly the premise of the film - three film students, missing for five years - demanded certain limits on the storytelling, yet sometimes you have more to play with than you realise. If the story is that compelling, and in fairness the Blair Witch idea was good, no matter what the vengeful critics say, then you wonder how much better this film might have been had suddenly a second camera appeared, tracking the threesome through the woods. Told lucidly enough, the audience would probably not even question it.Some of the reviewers of this film have been harsh to put it mildly. No, it's not a great horror film, but it is an important one if for no other reason than it shows what can be done with basic equipment and a few thousand dollars.As I write this review, some ten years or so after seeing Blair Witch for the first time, we are in the middle of a recession, yet what d'you know, James Cameron has just spent $300million making Avatar, some ten years after spending $180million to make Titanic.Perhaps what's really bugged the film industry, and even some of the audience, is that two young film-makers found a way to dwarf the mega budget releases of Hollywood with a film that made more money than 90% of Hollywood, yet for no more than thirty thousand dollars.Blair Witch is not great, but it does have something important to say; namely that you don't HAVE to have a $300million budget in order to make a hit film these days. That surely, is reason to be hopeful.",The Blair Witch Project
730,Sabrz,The Ultimate Suspense Thriller,10,31 May 2009,"The Blair Witch Project is possibly the best horror movie in terms of suspense. It keeps your eyes glued to the screen as the suspense rarely lets up. It is truly a spectacular horror movie as it will definitely frighten you and at the same time keep you interested.The Blair Witch Project is about 3 teens who go off into the woods searching for a legendary creature called the Blair Witch which is supposed to haunt the nearby woods. The students never come back. However a year after their disappearance, their footage is found. The movie is the entire footage that the 3 students shot.There are many elements that make the film so great. The most obvious one is that the students become lost in the woods. Being lost in the woods is bad enough. But when you have unexplained elements plaguing you while you are lost that takes it to a whole new level.Another element that increases the fear is the many things we do not know. We all have a fear of the unknown and this movie plays into that strongly. So many eerie things happen to the students that they are unable to explain. The fact that we never see the antagonist or the witch adds to the creepy sensation and builds up the fear.The best element of the movie is the perspective the viewer sees it from. Since the entire movie is from the view of the camera the students carry, the viewer sees and experiences everything from the point of view of the characters. So in a sense we get to go through what the characters do.Overall the movie keeps up the suspense as viewers never know what to expect. By day we follow the teens as they walk through the woods in an attempt to find civilization. Along the way they find more supernatural elements that challenge their sanity. At night unearthly sounds are heard beyond the light of their campfire.The Blair Witch Project is not the typical horror movie in that it is all about suspense rather then being pursued by someone. There is no doubt someone or something is stalking the students. But unlike most horror movies this movie is more about agonizing suspense and the unexplained rather then stopping an antagonist or killer. It is that that makes it such a suspenseful and fantastic horror movie. The Blair Witch Project is one of the best horror movies and I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone regardless of whether you like horror movies or not. No matter your preference the movie will not disappoint you.",The Blair Witch Project

732,moviedude-72,A petrifying nightmare...,7,11 August 2006,"PLOT: In October of 1994, three film students travel to Maryland to make a film about a local urban legend coined as the Blair Witch, equipped with a camera, tents and very little communication with the outside world. After days in the Maryland woods, things begin to appear outside their tent (i.e. stones and sticks) and strange noises occur during the cold nights. Eventually, they disappear, and a year later their footage is found, pieced together it becomes....The Blair Witch Project.During the scariest of The Blair Witch Project moments we see nothing at all; the screen is pitch black. What we hear are the panicked voices of the film crew while outside their tent things go bump in the night. The combination of the distant noises and the raw fear in the voices will throw a chill into anyone's blood. The success of the film is not of blood, gore, nor is it special effects, but of the suggestion that something evil and supernatural occupies the dark shadows in the Maryland woods, and we can easily be terrified of them without ever having to see them. By using hand-held cameras and invigorating impromptu, there is a feeling of real life that accompanies these people on their journey, something sinister.The directors, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez are genuine and talented. And its even more perfect that they had a tight budget, because the poor camera work makes it all seem like a documentary, like its all real. (no wonder people are still asking questions like ""is this real?"") The cast does a credible job, more or less playing themselves. Heather Donahue is a strong and determine character, and gives the film's most powerful performance (particularly in the film's most intense scene towards the end, which will stick in your mind). However, there's little noticeable difference between Josh and Mike. Both actors manage to make their characters seem like real people...but they are real people we never know anything about.Overall, the central question of any horror film is: Is the movie scary? With The Blair Witch Project, the answer is undoubtedly, yes! It's certainly a welcome departure from the modern horror film, which have all too often replaced terror with mere gore (not realizing that disgust makes a pitiful substitute for fear). The Blair Witch Project is atmospheric, creepy and very unsettling. It may start off slow (particularly for modern audiences who are use to non stop gore), but the movie becomes more unsettling the longer it goes on, and builds up to one terrifying, devastatingly effective climax.9.3/10 See It If You Liked: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Cannibal Holocaust (1980)",The Blair Witch Project
733,Soucriant,Fear of the Unknown,9,31 October 2008,"The Blair Witch Project came out of nowhere for me. I was young when it was released, thus, all of the marketing and hype went over my head. I didn't see this film until long after the buzz had died down, about three or four years ago.Even then, I knew The Blair Witch was something special. I was still relatively new to horror films, but I knew that nothing had been done quite like this before, and never so effectively.There are no Hollywood gimmicks and touches here. It's not glamorous, the characters aren't typical teens in Hollywood horror, their existence isn't to pad the body count. We see these three people go from confident and determined documentary makers to the brink of madness. We live through this with them, we are THERE with them in the woods, which is what makes their experiences, and ultimately their fate, that much more terrifying.I think the fear we all share as humans is not being able to see what is unsettling us. Things always seem much less frightening after you turn the light on, and in the daytime. In the dark, we are at our most vulnerable. We are essentially, blind. Couple that with the fear of being removed from our comfort zone and there you have it; the fear of the unknown.Someone or something is making those horrible sounds in the woods. Someone, or something left those pile of rocks outside the tent. Someone, or something led them to that house. Someone, or something was hunting them in those woods. But we can't see who or what. We're just like Mike and Heather. Blind.The severe backlash this film has received, has kept it from reaching it's true place amongst the horror greats, in my opinion. Some people scoff at the idea of The Blair Witch Project being listed as one of the greatest horror films of all time. ""The Shining"" was panned on its release. Over 25 years later, it's viewed as a classic.In years to come, I hope people look back at this film. I hope people study (or restudy, as may be the case) what makes it work so well. The Blair Witch Project has cemented its place in independent film-making history. My wish is that someday it receives the true recognition and status it deserves.We won't see anything like this again, this was catching lightning in a bottle. Those of you who feel that creeping fear in the pit of your stomach as Mike and Heather enter the house, know exactly what I'm talking about. To those of you who don't feel the panic, the helplessness of this situation, the pure FEAR in those woods, I can safely say, it's your loss.",The Blair Witch Project

It is a brilliant new approach to a tired genre that has issued forth from its withered loins such tiresome instances of schlock as the remake of ""The Haunting"" (the 1963 original was *amazing*, but the 1999 version was a joke) and ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"".This film isn't perfect, and I only gave it an eight, but if I were to rate it on sheer inventiveness and outright chutzpah, I would give it a *twelve* on a scale from one to ten.  While the movie doesn't exactly deliver on all the promises it makes, it delivers on quite a good number of them, yielding a raw, new, harrowing film ... so different from our usual movie-going experiences that it practically starts a whole new genre!If I had to compare it to other films (and this is hard) I'd have to say that it most resembles ""The Evil Dead"" in its inventiveness and brutal paranoia, and ""Seven"" in its gritty ""this is real life"" feel.Also worth mentioning is the clever ""is it real"" mythology that the marketing guys have built around this movie.  Go to http://www.blairwitch.com to see ""actual interviews"" with family members and a chronology of the Blair Witch.  Astonishing!I whole-heartedly recommend this film, flaws and all.

I know that of these people, 572 of them thought it was the scariest movie they'd ever seen, 8 didn't get it, and the rest hated it. I hope Haxan doesn't get mad at me...it's not even my tape!

Thanks to the unrelenting hype the movie is doing GREAT at the box office, but almost everyone hates it. Why? They were expecting a conventional horror movie with its quick fix of gore and shivers. BWP is a different thing:at first it left me completely cold. I liked the idea behind the project,but found it over-hyped. Then, a few hours later the full force of the film hit me like a bullet train. I was at a gig when I finally understood the final moments of the film:man, i felt goosebumps all over my body! And then, and then:other scenes,other moments jostle in my mind for attention since the day I saw this movie... watching the BWP is a very disturbing experience.

It wasn't because it was a bad movie though, it was because several jerks in the theater were making dumb-ass comments throughout.The Blair Witch Project is a movie that is based on mood, atmosphere, and suggestion.  When someone is sitting by you making stupid comments, this is ruined.A think there are two groups of people who have been bashing this movie, the teenagers who were looking for a gory, dead bodies everywhere, special effect laden, scare fest, and the people who might actually enjoy the movie if it wasn't for the first group ruining it.  Please, if you might be in the first group, either don't go or sit there quietly, because some of us actually want to enjoy the movie for what it is a suggestive work based on atmosphere and mood!I suggest that if you want to see the movie, you either wait until the crowds go down or go at twi-light when few other people are there.  This way you will be able to enjoy the movie fully.I went ahead and gave this movie a 9/10, something I rarely do (I try to keep my average vote around 5), because I could tell it was a very good movie, even with the jerks talking through the whole thing.",The Blair Witch Project

It seems more intelligent than your average fright-flick with the most haunting image being that of Mike, facing the wall (see it again and you'll see what I mean. Neat image huh?)and how power and trust can be diffused and eventually destroyed within a group. Sometimes team work doesn't work at times of high stress.But one thing bugs me. With all this technology at hand, couldn't these idiots manage a mobile phone between them.

Also I wanna say it's not a movie for film critics who judge on the story, directing etc..., it's not a movie like shawshank redemption or american beauty with an brilliant plot and meaning... This is a film to get u completely into the atmosphere of ""the unknown"", not a movie where the storie grabs u with your throat, the atmosphere, the feeling of being there yourself does this. Therefore many people will think it sux, because of the meaningless things you see on the screen. On the other hand I personally think this movie is pure class, the hype around it makes this movie certainly ""better"", just the thought ""did this really happened?"" grabs you, at least me. If u start watching the movie with the feeling of being unrealistic, fantasy etc... U will not enjoy it. Just sit back, and enjoy the amosphere of this awsome piece of independant filmmaking. It's original, thrilling, and its based on true facts. If u start watching the film with these three things in mind u will certainly enjoy it, others who take this movie down, are just not made for this. That's why it's an awsome or awfull movie.Well, I can say this movie is for me certainly an awsome piece of ""documentary""",The Blair Witch Project

The night I watched it, I was at a friend's house a few blocks away, and after watching it, I was too scared to go home.So, the movie only works if you don't know it's staged. If you're reading this, that means you know it's not real, so most probably you'll find the movie utterly boring. The reason this movie became a classic was because a lot of people didn't know it's not real when they watched it. It's a classic, but not a timeless classic.

Well, move over Ed Wood (thank God, he's not alive to see this) because the BWP has these 2 classics creamed for bad and tasteless.  As far as scary, Plan 9 at least shows who the villains are trying to take over the earth (so called ""Aliens"" dressed up in carhop uniforms)  As far as BWP is concerned, nothing is shown and the camerawork is sooo poor in quality, that a drunken alien could have done a better job with the quality of the filming.

750,deathscythe_42,Subtle but Chilling,8,22 July 2008,"This film, in my opinion, was not ""Scary as Hell"" as it said on the box. Instead, it was very subtle with the scares, yet creepy and suspenseful, and has you thinking (along with the characters) ""what the hell is going on?"" The film builds fairly slowly, but it's interesting. They set up the plot-line with some back story/myths about the blair witch, enough that you can figure out what's happening later on in the movie when you think back on it.The actors, I felt, gave very good and believable performances, as tensions built up throughout the movie.The movie culminates in a climax that is not terrifying, but is suspenseful and creepy, and leaves you with an overall movie experience that I would consider to be chilling.This is not a movie that you will watch and say ""That was so scary!"" It is, rather, a movie that you might say ""that wasn't that scary"" upon finishing it, but you won't want to think about for very long after you turn out the lights and attempt to go to sleep. It is easy to watch but sets a very creepy mood and may make you wonder what's really outside your tent next time you go camping.Overall I thought it was a pretty good movie. On one hand they could have made it a little scarier but on the other, had they made the scares less subtle it might have come off as cheesy or corny, and I'm pretty satisfied with the way it is. It's a fun movie to watch with your buddies when you're just hanging out and feel like watching a movie in the dark (it helps if you're sleeping in a camper as me and my friend were last night).

This is the reason why the movie stands out because it leaves aside all kind of Hollywood cheese. Also, it helps to make all scares psychological, leaving everything to the imagination of the viewer.The movie helped popularize the ""found footage"" style, which is its core; making you feel as lost, desperate, and frustrated as the characters.

It's a true story, at least to my knowledge. In the film, you don't see the witch. All you see is what you hear. You hear leaves rustle, someone screaming to the top of their lungs. It's the ""it"" factor in Blair Witch. But, if your a person that wants action and wants it quick, find another movie. The first 20 minutes is just the three friends asking questions to the towns people about the witch. BORE!! Later in the film, it gets scary.

It's basically a psychological suspense-thriller based on the unknown; the obvious occult bits simply appeal to our tendency to associate the unknown with the supernatural (for all I care the antagonists could be a bunch of downright sadistic and smart pranksters). So the expected chills were there, but they were mainly lurking in the back of my mind while I found myself thinking aloud over their actions (at one point I was laughing with ridicule at the whole situation; now *that* was truly terrifying). Ending smells slightly of a cop-out, but would make good fan-theory fodder.

She was said to have lured young children into her house and then to have slaughtered them. Three student filmmakers Heather Donahue, Mike Williams & Josh Leonard decided to make a documentary on the Blair Witch. Before the students went into the woods they interviewed many people asking them about what they know about the Blair witch. After all that they got their 2 8mm film cameras and headed deep in the woods. Along the way they encountered many attacks, especially at night. They are suspicious because after each attack they find rock piles around their tent. This leads up to the biggest movie of the 20th century. If you like a thrill or if you're a horror addict then this is right up your alley. The Blair Witch Project is not physically scary (you don't see anything that is scary) But it is Mentally scary (You see the expression on their faces and hear the sounds that they hear).

However, the amateur level of theatrics and ad-libbing take a major leap of imagination to overcome.  Michael Williams comes off best in the least showy role, with Heather Donohue and Joshua Leonard coming across as sophomore college drama students left too long to their own devices.  I understand it would be very difficult to develop any sense of plot and script when you leave it to the improvisational skills of untried talent, but perhaps a real script with improv touches would have resulted in a truly interesting horror flick.

As a result, people went to see the movie expecting to be frightened out of their mind. In a lot of cases, the film had trouble living up to these expectations. I feel this film has been treated incredibly unfairly by the public because it is a very scary movie. You find a lot of people didn't like it because you never actually see the witch.

767,coneill97,A Chillingly Realistic Found Footage Movie,7,24 October 2019,"What Blair Witch Project does so well, is create an unsettling, uncomfortable tone that lingers throughout the movie. There is a constant feeling of unease that takes place as soon as the three lead characters enter the woods.The film does a great job of making a tale about witchcraft feel so realistic. This is primarily due to the incredibly believable performances of the cast, especially the main three, who we spent much of the runtime with. They always feel like real people, and their frustrations and fights with one another never feel forced but feel as if the oppressive atmosphere of the woods is influencing their actions.The movie has an incredibly effective setup, with locals from the town telling stories of the Blair Witch legend. The fact that these stories feel like they're being told from the perspective of real people gives them a chilling quality.The low quality, found-footage documentary style also adds to the grounded tone. It does not feel like a conventional movie due to the lack of a narrative structure or musical score. The occasional use of a 16mm black and white cameras is very effective in adding a chilling quality to the film, especially the daytime scenes in the woods.The use of sounds in this film is incredible. A lot of this movie takes place at night with a blank black screen, where we can hear only distant noises. By not showing us anything, it allows the audience to imagine what is out there in the woods, which makes it even scarier. This also applies to the Blair Witch, who we never see throughout the movie at all. Our imagination is more terrifying than anything that could have been put on screen. Despite not appearing, her presence is felt throughout.The final ten minutes of this movie is genuinely terrifying, with simple images such as children's handprints on the walls of the abandoned house in the woods, sticking with the viewer long after the film ends. And while it does end very abruptly, the final shot is very unsettling and gets under your skin.While the sense of realism created by the filmmakers works so effectively throughout the movie, it also has its negatives. By creating such realistic and believable central characters, they become unremarkable and uninteresting with minimal characterisation. This is only a minor flaw, however in an otherwise excellent horror movie.",The Blair Witch Project

But for my Mrs and I, the only reactions that ""Blair Witch"" was able to create in us were tedium, as well as my wife becoming nauseous from the constantly jerky camera movement, which was the major defining feature of the movie's purely amateurish photography. I wouldn't dignify that ""camerawork"" by calling it cinematography.Some people who tend to overrate ""Blair Witch"", try to claim that in order for audience members to be able to perceive the supposedly authentic horror and terror of the flick, those viewers must be able to effectively use their own imaginations to fully appreciate the film. But that's just pure BS, folks! Because with ""Blair Witch's"" middle school level of overacting, and its crude photographic technique, in order for my imagination (which is quite good) to really succeed at helping the movie create an actual sense of terror, I'd have to work as hard at exercising my imagination, as would be required for me imagining that Megan Fox is actually treating me to some nice oral sex, right now!BTW, without me presenting any specific spoilers here, let me quote an actually HONEST professional review of ""The Blair Witch Project"" that comes directly from the 1651 page ""2007 DVD & Video Guide"", by Mick Martin and Marsha Porter.
Here's their entire capsule review of ""The Blair Witch Project"", as it appears on page 114 of that handy & informative volume, about movies available on video.
""A fiendishly clever publicity campaign fueled the release of this ultra-low budget quickie, which turned out to be one of the biggest swindles ever perpetrated on unsuspecting movie audiences. This ""faux documentary"" about three young filmmakers who meet an uncertain fate while investigating an old legend in the Maryland woods, fails to deliver, on all counts.""So, as many readers will have already surmised, from the description of ""The Blair Witch Project"", provided in that DVD/movie guide, the authors of that book gave ""Blair Witch"" their LOWEST rating, which is their classification of TURKEY, that's reserved for really poor movies. And honestly, if IMDb's ratings included a ZERO STAR rating, that's precisely what I'd assign to crap like ""The Blair Witch Project""!!",The Blair Witch Project
769,scottiejarrett7,A frightening outing? Nope. Outed as boring and poorly executed.,1,3 July 2015,"Ugh! No thanx to ""Blair Witch"" for the continuing onslaught of ""found footage"" films. ""Found footage"" - alias shaky, misdirected, often incomprehensible filming with no attempt to portray the action clearly. This contrivance must save a lot of money since it provides an excuse to delete a competent cinematographer from the budget. ""Blair Witch"" took a truly compelling notion and turned it into an unscary, unprofessional so-called horror movie. The characters are annoying brats. Lost in the woods, maybe something is after them. Who cares what happens to them? Good thing we don't care, since their fates are left to the imagination. There's NO witch in ""Blair Witch"" and the result is not bewitching. The greatest mystery in this non-horror film is that Roger Ebert rated it 4 stars. He even applauded its ""rock-bottom production values."" I don't find those pathetic values admirable. If zero star(s) were possible, it would be zero. To give it a rating, I give it 1 star. One star means ""rambling, boring non-effort, not worth watching.""",The Blair Witch Project
770,robastyk,Over-rated Schlock,1,17 January 2010,"When this movie came out I listened to the hype for quite a while. I've loved horror movies most of my life though I gave up on them when they sank into special-effects gore-fests and expressions of very personal paranoia in the 1980s. I finally gave this film a try when it came to a second run house in my city that charged 99 cents per ticket. One can see anything for 99 cents. When I left, the manager asked what I'd thought of the movie. He knew that I was a regular and that I liked films generally. I told him I thought he owed me at least 98 cents.In summary, a group of young people with video equipment wander out into the woods on the Maryland/West Virginia border. To characterize their combined I.Q.'s as ""super 8"" would be too generous. The area in which they get lost in the woods is rural but not the Amazonian rain forest or the wastes of Siberia. Walking for less than an hour in any direction would bring them to a road, a task that is far from impossible to accomplish. Still they get lost. Once they are lost they descend into fear and get, as if such a thing were possible, even stupider. In the end the alleged Blair Witch does us all the great service of removing these self-indulgent idiots from the gene pool. The really bad news is that the witch takes about 90 minutes to accomplish that removal. She's just too darned slow.This movie does not have the utterly misguided and endearing incompetence that make Ed Wood's films like Plan 9 From Outer Space a guilty pleasure. It's not even worth renting for the pleasure of throwing popcorn at the screen.",The Blair Witch Project
771,SunnySonnie,Don't waste your time,1,29 April 2020,"Honestly, I only watched it,because of the recently made game of the story, and I was curious what was the fuss about it. I still don't understand why it get a 6.5 rating in here.
So, the camera work was pretty much disturbing tho,that every time when something interesting suppose to happen, they just pulled the camera from the spot, and showed the ground or the edge of sthing. I know that in the story the kids were filming, and I did accept that all the camera job were shaky and my stomac went upside down even in front of my tv screen. But the characters were dumb af, and the whole story was..boring, and the ending is lame. So in my opinion, just do not waste your time, there are much more vetter ones than this. Cheers.",The Blair Witch Project
772,gro,Stone Soup,5,11 August 1999,"The Blair Witch Project deserves an A as film class final project. The concept is good. The throwback to the pre-special effects days where the imagination was loosed to create horror/fear is fine.  As entertainment a C is much closer. The ""forest"" has been great in myth and literature as a frightening place where trees blot out the sun and poor lost waifs wander. So how do we get stuck with this scrubby excuse of a forest? I've been lost in far scary forests and this one would have been a joke. Then we have the acting... There isn't much worse than reaching the end of a movie and the only remaining character is someone you hope dies quickly and painfully. Fortunately, from the beginning we knew all the characters had disappeared and were undoubtedly dead so we had little to stress over. It is just amazing how many people have seen this ""ink blot"" of a movie and managed to project their own imagined story lines, fears, stellar performances etc into it. I haven't been a fan of  all white or all black paintings that profess to have some deep insights into life.  It is commendable that with not much more than that the directors were able to catch an audience willing to fill in not only the details but all of the main ingredients.

773,Trooper8-2,A creepy and excellent movie,8,13 August 1999,"Simply put, this is not the scariest movie ever made.  I was hardly frightened out of my wits while watching it.  It did, however, create a truly creepy atmosphere, which is something few so-called horror movies ever do.  I really enjoyed this movie very much, even the parts that weren't at all creepy were very interesting and entertaining to me.  There is no doubt that a lot of people aren't going to like this movie, however.  I work at a movie theater and have talked to plenty of moviegoers who were disappointed. I have also talked to plenty who loved it as much as I did.  I would advise that you don't listen to what anybody else says and go see this movie for yourself.

774,Han-10,A new way in WITCH to see,9,8 August 1999,"Ah, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.A revolutionary film.  It tells a story the way no film ever has. Presented as a edited version of found footage, the filmmakers successfully created reality cinema.  Undoubtedly influenced (if even subconsciously) by ""Cops"" and the myriad other shows categorized as ""reality TV,"" BLAIR WITCH tells its story from a cameraman's perspective.  In this case, the cameramen are more than just voyeurs; they are active participants in the unfolding action.  We believe that they'd keep the cameras rolling to document their strange and terrifying predicament.  We believe the characters are real as the superlative three actors never slip up and remind us that it's just a movie.  We believe in the sounds coming from the woods, and we try to decipher them, to make sense of them.  We do this in spite of the fact the most of us know through reading articles that it was just the film's producers making scary noises.It's so easy to buy into THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT because it is a simulation of reality.  No music, no cutaways, no special effects, no professional photography.  No film conventions at all -- only ""home video"" conventions. It's a presentation of edited found footage left to us to determine what happened to this doomed threesome.  Like it or not, BLAIR WITCH has introduced a new way to believe in the movies.

778,aussiemiguel,Blair Witch comes out of the forest and takes over the world,9,15 October 1999,"Watching this movie is being part of a cultural phenomenom. The marketing created so much expectation that you just can't miss this great film. Making people think it was a real story was the best campaign they could have created. You already know what it's about: 3 kids get lost in the woods while shooting a documentary on the Blair Witch legend. And you know that since the budget was so limited, you can't expect to see a computer animated witch.But the film does deliver an eerie atmosphere. You can easily relate to this characters, just by remembering when you've been in the woods, or heard strange noises coming from the dark. And if you add the story of a haunting, you can feel the despair and fear of this three people.Many people have criticized the camera work, saying it's confusing and dark. And that's exactly what it's supposed to be. You're looking at the work of Heather, Josh and Mike, not a professional Discovery Channel documentary.The most important thing here is the psychological development of the characters. The way they react to the situation, the way they confront each other and start losing their sanity. The acting was amazing, specially when Heather asks for forgiveness.What would I change? Maybe the sound effects should be clearer, specially the first night they get haunted. It was hard to recognize the noises they were talking about. And maybe we should have seen a light, a mist, a glowing figure in the distance. Not an eye popping special effect, just a little touch of visual terror.But you can't miss The Blair Witch Project. Whether you like it or not, I'm sure we'll still be talking about it in the years to come. It'll be a trendsetter.",The Blair Witch Project
779,SkylessWing,Boo! Scared? You should be!,8,29 October 1999,"The Blair Witch Project is a truly scary mind trip of a movie. It is a movie that is best seen without listening to all the hype thats going on, and best watched alone or with your partner.The concept is simple, think Cannibal Holocaust, which the film makers admit as being inspirational. 3 college film makers enter a forest in Burkittsville to explain the legend of the Blair Witch. Legend has it that the forest is haunted and many children disappeared a century or 2 earlier.When in the forest, they get lost, how original. They are haunted, but the question is.... by what? Is it a ghost or is it some lunatic, theres a nice reference to Deliverance by one of the characters. What is certain is they don't make it out of the forest, as you are told from the beginning.What you are actually watching is the hours and hours of footage they managed to shoot which was found after they went missing, and edited down to 90 minutes.Thats the original bit, along with the fact that you are watching raw footage of what actually happened in real life. The actors were given little food and were told to go into the forest for a week, camping, no civilisation for the entire shoot. Each actor only had their lines given to them, no one knew how the others were going to respond. Thats scary enough, without the directors firing gunshots at 3 in the morning and making weird stick things to freak them out.By the end of the shoot the actors aren't just acting, its true emotion, they really are stressed out, they really are cold, and they really do want to get out of the damn forest.So sit back in the dark, switch the lights off and be scared.",The Blair Witch Project
780,BruceMc,"DON'T BE FOOLED: boring, annoying garbage",1,1 October 1999,"DO NOT BE FOOLED:  ""The Blair Witch Project"" is incredibly boring, isn't scary, and contains some of the worst acting you've ever seen.  Heather Donahue is the most annoying character to curse the screen since Jodi Thielan in ""Four Friends,"" more annoying, even, than Jar-Jar Binks.Everyone knows the story of ""Blair Witch Project"" by this time, due to all the hype and incessant promotion, so it's not worth the time to comment on.  What could have been an interesting little horror movie looks, instead, like a C- film student's thesis project.  The ""acting"" is loud, the characters are annoying, and the ""cinematography,"" if we can call it that, is worthless: since most of the ""scary parts"" happen at night, and most of the movie is shot on a hand-held video camera, there is very little that is actually visible.  That would be commendable, if the actors and sound were good enough to carry the story, but they're not.  (See ""Wait Until Dark"" if you want a good example of how this SHOULD work.)  Example:  Heather hears an unidentifiable sound and mutters to herself, ""What was that?  What was that sound?  Oh, God, I'm so scared!"" Ridiculous.  The filmmakers don't trust the audience to even figure out that they're supposed to be frightened.Additionally, the events that scare the characters aren't scary:  awakening to find a pile of rocks by the tent isn't scary.  Heather:  ""Oh, my God!  That pile of rocks wasn't there last night!  Who could have done that?""Also problematic is the fact that nothing happens for the first hour of the movie except the slackers get lost in the woods and whine a lot about how they hate each other.By now you've all heard that the end of the movie is ""truly frightening""; even if you find it frightening, it doesn't make up for the sleep-inducing first hour and 15 minutes.""The Blair Witch Project"" may be the stuff of nightmares, but only when you consider that the video will be out soon and that a sequel is in the works.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS INSIPID NONSENSE!",The Blair Witch Project

78/100It goes without saying that the freshness The Blair Witch Project radiates is, incontrovertibly, the film's mightiest aspect. That said, the film overlooks that need of going further with its narrative in order to be even more conspicuous, leaving me with a half-full bigger picture, leaving me half full in general....The taut notion the film manages to hold up until its very ending (which couldn't be any more divisive, by the way), make the film gripping enough to keep me tied up despite a lack of soundtrack and charming cinematography. It's almost as if the movie wants you to overlook it as an extant feature and more as some real-life event, achieving it almost entirely if it weren't for some bits of dialogue and post-production decisions.....Although it struggles to justify its runtime and plot decisions despite being so intentionally cursory, The Blair Witch Project's sense of natural divisiveness between whoever dares to watch it might probably justify why it feels as a particular treat to check out at this time of the year....",The Blair Witch Project

I had listened to all the hype that surrounded the film and fell into the trap of paying £5 to go into the cinema and be bored senseless for however long I had to suffer (I lost interest after about half and hour) This film in no way is scary, a few sticks and piece of marshmallow is not pants wettingingly horrible. I sat through the whole film expecting a scary bit. I even tried to ""let the fear wash over me"" what a laugh. This isn't even so bad it's good.Blair witch makes a joke of good horror films that have been made without having to use expensive special effects.

788,GradeZ,Innovative yet retro-horror film is the scariest film in years,10,30 April 1999,"There was something about those horror films of the seventies and early eighties set in the clandestine corridors of backwoods country.  Maybe it was the eerie rustling of the wind or the lifeless autumn leaves that provided the feeling of death and isolation.  This is the setting of The Blair Witch Project - a film that is based on the premise that it is the discovered footage shot by a team of amateur film makers investigating a piece of Maryland folklore. The team entered the woods and never came out.The most refreshing aspect of this horror masterpiece is that it understands the strength of subtlety.  This film more than any other in recent memory, exploits the power of suggestion and invokes the hidden fears that could only crawl from the darkest corners of our imagination.  It seems that the horror genre has been inundated with movies driven by special effects of late.  These films have forgotten that horror movies by nature are supposed to be, above all else, scary.  They should make our hearts jump and our skin crawl.  The Blair Witch Project does this.  It scares with its simplicity - using children's voices in the night, wooden figures hanging from twisted tree branches, and prolonged periods of darkness.Among truly scary films of the recent past (Black Christmas and the Exorcist are two), The Blair Witch Project is at the top.  Hopefully this film will remind horror filmmakers that the unknown is, more often than not, more terrifying than anything that can be captured by a camera.",The Blair Witch Project

Simplicity itself, this film taps into primal fears that mainstream horror directors apparently know nothing about.  When was the last time you were scared by some psycho slashing someone.  Sure, that can be entertaining in a shock value way, but shocking is not the same as primal fear.See this film in a quiet place with people you can trust not to interrupt and blab about ""what was that noise"", etc.  If this film earns any Oscars in the major categories, it will be a large step for the Academy's credibility, which is currently almost non-existent.Regarding the few negative reviews stated earlier:  Are you kidding? Anyone who loves movies enough to post reviews on the IMDb must certainly know enough to see this as one of the most unique and daring films to be released.   Ever.Shake off that movie complacency.

792,JaneDoe3,Excellent,9,17 August 1999,"The filmmakers painted themselves into an intriguing but quite confining premise, having to abide by certain rules in order to succeed:  The cast must be isolated and not allowed to escape, there must be a reason why these people would continue to record footage even after they've gone insane with fear, and there can't be any definitive resolution with regards to the antagonist. Despite having all these limitations to abide by, the film works.The directors cover their bases with a few obligatory yet adequate explanations. No, it won't ""scare the hell out of you"" as some have claimed. The day scenes are basically ""MTV's Real World Gets Lost in the Woods"", as we watch our protagonists slowly start to dissolve into panic and then madness. The suspense arrives in the night scenes, where the danger is unknown and unseen.  Watching (or often merely listening to) the events from the actor's POV makes for quite a powerful experience. The grainy, shaky footage adds an important element of mock authenticity. The performances are mostly solid all around, especially from Williams. Donohue does a good job of playing melodramatic during the so-called ""documentary"" sequences, making her ""normal"" performance seem that much more natural. Very effective.Because this scenario is portrayed so realistically, a large segment of the audience seems to disallow the usual generosity normally given to a film's artistic license.  Bruce Willis would never survive a fall from the top of an exploding skyscraper, of course, but we have to ignore that discrepancy in order to further the experience. It is a movie, after all.  And even though BLAIR WITCH is supposed to be ""real"", we have to give it the same amount of latitude.  Sure there are a few holes to contend with (why don't they just go to a stream and follow it?), and there's a little bit of overacting from Donohue towards the end. But the bottom line is that, aside from a few minor flaws, the limited concept could not have been executed any better.",The Blair Witch Project
793,Allen-31,A truly remarkable film,9,2 August 1999,"Finally saw the movie after reading about it, hearing about it, and yes I knew it was fiction.  It still sent my heart racing in several spots.  I wouldn't call it the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it ranked higher than most.  The tension was so raw, and the climax at the end was utterly convincing.  Horror?  Yes, but not the spoon-fed gimmicky horror of Scream or The Haunting.I know there will be a lot of people who won't get it.  People who haven't grown sick of Hollywood potty-training will not be able to appreciate something as inventive as this.  Ironically, you could criticize the film for not having much of a plot and that the characters don't act logically. But the film perfectly emulates real life which isn't plotted and people frequently aren't logical under such stress.  We can only make those criticisms because we are outside viewers.  To enjoy this film, you have can't set yourself ""above"" it an expect to be entertained.I saw the movie with a friend who found it plenty disturbing.  His summary was ""the perfect example of how three inexperienced people who have NO business being in the woods in the first place royally screw themselves over.""  I agree.  I almost burst into tears along with the students when they encountered the log crossing they'd been at earlier in the day and realized they'd been going in circles.  Witch legend or not, this should be a testament to anyone who wants to go jaunting off into the deep woods without any serious preparation or at least a local guide in an unfamiliar area.As for whatever was stalking them, well that was the truly disturbing part. The ending was terrifying, and utterly confusing at the same time.  Those who didn't like the ending well, the film said that these students disappeared and were never found.  It didn't say that they died, although I'm certain that's what happened to them.  People don't disappear and leave tidy explanations as to what happened to them.  I found myself haunted by this film long after I left the theater, and I had anxiety dreams about it all night.Bravo to Haxan Films.

There were about five other people there, but no one was sitting next to each other so you couldn't really tell there was anyone else inside. So it was the perfect atmosphere to see a scary movie.I don't think I have ever experienced anything more terrifying, more perfectly horrific than the Blair Witch Project. It was not only the scariest movie I've ever seen, but the scariest event of my life (I admit I've led a somewhat tame life). It felt like a three-hour movie; if it had gone on one more scene I would have walked out, that's how intense it was. It is a very different movie, what with the first-person style and hand-held cameras and four-letter words. People either loved this movie immensely, or hated it with a passion. I loved it, it was very effective for me. I think if you watch it in your living room with a bunch of your friends it's not going to work. You have to be able to lose yourself in it.

The mix of film and video footage, the total lack of music, and more than anything else the slow, inexorable, and painfully believable decline of Heather, Mike and Josh from cocky filmmakers into hunted animals make this one to see.Unlike recent movies which mistake splatters of gore for horror and suspense, the Blair Witch team remembered one simple fact of film making: fear is a very personal emotion.  By not directly showing the Blair Witch (or *whatever* was creeping out the characters), they knew your mind would make up something worse than anything they would have shown.Even Hitchcock would have been writhing uncomfortably in his sleep, and like most of the audience at the showing I went to, he probably would have probably gasped out loud at the ending.",The Blair Witch Project
797,waxwingslain77,One of the best horror movies ever; here's why:,10,5 April 2001,"SPOILER ALERT. Don't read this unless you have seen the film.""Blair Witch,"" very original but shot on a very low budget, with no star names, no standard glitter or spectacle is still an excellent film. In fact that is WHY it is excellent; it is original, it is completely non-Hollywood, the dialogue is so good that I felt drawn into the film as I watched it, something which rarely happens with me. In other words, because the three were saying EXACTLY the sort of things I would say in a similar situation, I ""felt"" this film potently.I love the constantly moving camera, said camera being the chief complaint from those who ""hated"" the film, I think the acting is flawless and the direction and photography make this movie REAL. And what a pleasure to see a horror movie without the cliche-ridden often stupid shock music most horror films have!I personally relate most to Mike. He is skeptical from the start, and I get the feeling he agreed with Heather and Josh out of boredom more than anything else. ""Thank you for the opportunity,"" Mike says to Heather and I hear a faint blend of reluctance and sarcasm almost at the film's start. Mike is the first to say ""we're lost,"" something I believe Heather and Josh also know, but don't want to admit.I would not have kicked the map into the creek, (even though the map really was worthless if you think about it,) but otherwise I would have been a near clone of the Mike character. Mike doesn't like the camera on him, and makes no bones about it. ""Shoot some ambiance!"" he says to Heather after she has yet again stuck her camera in his face. My reply would have been more curt than was Mike's. Mike is the most down-to-earth character in the film and I don't think it coincidence that Josh, not Mike or Heather, disappears first.But I like the other two as well. Heather is an archetypal film student know-it-all, right down to her arrogance. She is completely self-absorbed, (""I'd like to mark this occasion,"") she says acidly when Josh and Mike are complaining about moving on, and she lives to regret her stance. Josh later turns the camera on Heather, who, VERY SIGNIFICANTLY, says ""Are you expecting me to say something?"" She whines to Josh, even though she has practically rammed the camera into both Josh's and Mike's souls. When Josh really starts yelling at Heather, the bitter sarcasm he uses is most understandable. (I personally love it!)Josh is the first to entirely break down. This is completely unexpected, I was sure it would have been Mike. Josh puts on a convincing laid back facade but when things get bad, he's the first to crack. This was a brilliant stroke.""Blair Witch"" is a character study, if you'll pardon the expression. I was only scared once. (Those straw and twine symbols of hell in the trees, you know the scene.) Otherwise I was fascinated, and I have seen this rather short film several times. The dialogue, the characters, the moving camera; We KNOW something is going to happen. Indeed something does happen, in fact several things happen, one of them being an extremely well crafted film which contains MUCH more than meets the eye.I give ""Blair Witch"" a ten.",The Blair Witch Project

Proponents praise such things as 'creepiness', but I can think of numerous other films with better examples of this, notably 'Jacob's Ladder'. It was however a brilliant sell to the public, the genius in the marketing was in alluding that the story might be true. I'll admit that was what originally intrigued me.

802,eshaines,Fifteen Years Later: Not Terrible for a 60K Budget,7,5 June 2014,"I'm not sure what it is about this film that makes it interesting. By all accounts, it should be quite dull: much of it is shot in motion or out of focus by hand-held cameras, the dialogue is petty and tedious, there's an absence of sexual tension between the main characters, and much of what is feared throughout the film, while eerie, is merely suggestive of horror. Perhaps I am spoiled by modern day horror and suspense films, which are less understated, follow an explicit plot, and don't leave me wanting in terms of visual access. The ""agenda"" of this film is still fear —we are to believe that even after one or two centuries, the so-called ""Blair Witch"" still lives in those woods and is still out to kill, as evidenced by the eerie ending. An obscurity that doesn't ever quite seem resolved for me, and there is more than one, is what one man at the beginning of the ""documentary"" tells the filmmakers: that a man was found guilty of killing some children and confessed to the crime—are we to think that the witch possessed this killer? Or were these unrelated crimes that just happened to be occurring in the same geographical area? It also seems to me that all of the folklore and mythology surrounding the Blair Witch deaths pertain to attacks on children—with the one exception of the men tortured on that rock whose bodies later mysteriously disappear—why would the witch go after children for so many years but then in the modern day attack these three grown adults? It is a possible statement that these three filmmakers were so consumed by naiveté and child-like curiosity for the macabre, or a rather dumb, stop-at-nothing passion for art, that they were mistaken for children by the witch, or at least considered to be one in the same. Because really, what thinking, rational adult would so discredit a history of serial killings—just for the reason that its roots were non- scientifically explained—to put themselves in what would potentially be harm's way? Aren't there a million other things to explore and about which to write and direct films? Ridiculous. This is the second time I've seen this film, the first time being early in high school, for me about thirteen or fourteen years ago. I watched it the first time at night, at a friend's house, and when the movie was over and I had nearly peed myself in fear, never having seen any movie quite like it, she insisted we go to the local woodsy lake area to light some fireworks—naturally I was petrified, tried to convince everyone it was a bad idea, but ended up ignored, and went. That was the first night I forced myself, for my own sanity, to make a distinction between film-based fear projected onto reality, and reality itself. Why would a witch come out of the woods in the middle of Dallas, TX, where I was at the time, when the witch in this film haunts a forest in Maryland, I asked myself. And so I found my firmer footing. It is only now, thirteen years later, in revisiting the movie to see if I still found it as scary, that I have decided to reevaluate it. I guess I could've done without the foul-mouthed protagonist—why on earth would I empathize with this woman who doesn't know how to speak without dropping an 'f-bomb' every other word? Not that I have a big problem with cursing to convey a certain amount of anger or frustration—but to hear it constantly, it was as if she were beating me over the head with it. Her male counterparts were far better behaved and easier to stomach as characters. I think that what works about the film is the gradual decay in the lead characters' morale. They begin their adventure peppy, excited, naive, almost cocky—and by the end of the film disintegrate into panic, rage, fear, cynicism, and desperation. I still get a kick out of seeing that extreme close-up of the leading lady in her beanie, only half of her face visible, welling up with tears, whispering: ""I'm afraid to close my eyes, I'm afraid to open them...."" I think it's the first time in the movie one can really feel the film's trademark desperation and isolation these characters must have been internalizing as their project progressed. The movie's not perfect; there are some things I would've done differently: fewer, but more focused, less scattered interviews with locals (when in doubt, simplify, don't obscure your characters' motivations), interspersing steady cam shots with the hand-held, blurry ones—purely for palatability to the audience (you are trying to achieve the effect of a realistic out-in-the- woods experience, but isn't filmmaking just as much about satisfying an audience as pleasing the filmmaker?); some more clues as to what happened to Josh; and maybe, if the steady cam shots were included, when Mike drops the camera at the end, there would be a way to show the climax of the film without the girl having to pick up the camera herself and film—it is simply not believable that, in this state of panic, after having formally apologized to her and her colleagues' parents for her stubborn will to make this film, she would still want to film what was at that point a very desperate and unpleasant situation. For a budget of $60,000, I think they did a great job, though.Needless to say, I still won't be going on a hike in the unpaved, unmarked woods any time soon. In that regard, hats off to the writers and directors of this movie. Fifteen years later, and it still has that effect!",The Blair Witch Project

807,MrJoe1987,The cinematic equivalent of real-life dental torture...,1,1 February 2017,"Three vacuous pothead filmmakers get lost in the woods while filming a documentary about some long-dead, insane old broad who was apparently a witch, or something. Unfortunately, they never really elaborated so you're understanding of the antagonist ends by the time they walk into the woods like three giant, stoned turkeys. I guess we just get to make up the rest, ourselves. Use your imagination, folks.Anyway, they then get lost in the woods (boy, what a surprise) due to the fact that, in their boundless wisdom, they decide that it would be a good idea to trust in the acuity of the derpiest of all three of them (Heather) to perform land navigation for them, while having absolutely no understanding of land navigation, themselves, with one of them literally describing the map as being ""Greek"" to him.They wander around the woods for days with predictably spooky things happening to them that could, I guess, kinda, in some way, vaguely resemble things involving witchcraft (like I said; use your imagination) that escalates with every night that goes by. Apart from that we're treated to a farting-in-the-tent joke, a lot of yelling and arguing, an excessive, insipid and obnoxious use of profanity, and a lot completely uneventful meandering around the woods.There is a light at the end of the tunnel, however; they all die. You don't get to see what happens, but it can be assumed that their fearless leader gets cracked over the head with a blunt object. I found it ironic because, at that very moment, I was imagining myself creeping up behind her and doing the exact same thing just to stop her incessant screaming and whining. It wouldn't have been surprising if it turned out that the witch, or old woman, or ""crazy redneck,"" or Clinton voter, or, you know... whatever... had decided to kill her for the same reason.So, where am I going with all of this?

They could have had it compiled before or after the film itself and explain the story in more detail. Instead, the only parts of the legend that we know is what the kids in the movie tell us. Seeing the footage of the parents putting up missing flyers and talking about the search, including where and how they found the footage, would've made it much more disturbing. I noticed that the people who thought it was real true enjoyed the movie much more, so don't go telling your friends that it is fake. There was some fairly good acting in it, unfortunately, the guy who plays mike isnt the best, and his facade falls through during the scene where he reveals what he did with the map.

815,moviedeal22,boring until the last line of the movie,4,26 April 2000,"After reading some of the other viewer comments I've come to discover that the majority of this movie was either greatly disliked or ravingly praised. I felt that the people who udderly hated this movie probably were the ones that lived for special computerized effects and fancy blood and guts dramatic slashing and slaughter; hacking and killing scenes. But at the same time I also sensed that the people who undergoes this movie and reviewed it with enormously great amount of satisfaction were the ones that were open minded and they were probably also the ones to comment the movie as a grand horror and thriller movie. Hence the way it was categorized. And the acting? well lets just say its no ""Casablanca"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" but it was mostly spontaneous reflects. And I sure it was not only obvious to me that the actors/actresses were never given a script to read from.
I found the ""Blair Witch Project"" to be just a race through the woods. And one of the most realized point of this movie is the fact that one of the kids not only had camping experience, but hiking knowledge, map and compass understanding and skills as well. But under emotional and physical stress all those might have the chance to be forgotten. And still I feel that's a plot hole that should have been covered.my bottom line is: The ""Blair Witch Project"" is probably tied neck to neck with ""American Beauty"" as the most memorable movie of 1999. So therefore it definitely deserves as the very least to be seen just so you can say you viewed it.i gave this movie an 5/10 mainly based on the fact that it cheated people out of over 11 million dollars just in theatres when only about 60 thousand dollars were used at the expense of ""The Blair Witch Project"".Yes, I do recommend this movie, BUT at the same time , THANK YOU HOLLYWOOD!!!!",The Blair Witch Project
816,TrickyTheHorrorFreak,A unique study in terror that requires a little something from the viewer.,7,18 September 2006,"I really wanted to love ""The Blair Witch Project"" when I went to see it at the cinemas. I'd read the Internet hype after it came out in the U.S. back when not everyone realized it was fake. The reviews called it ""the scariest movie since the Exorcist!"" and stories of people screaming and crying in the cinemas really brought my expectations up to an unattainable height. I'd talked it up to myself as well as to friends and colleagues, telling them all that they had to go see it when it came out. But by the time it actually hit our shores (I'm an Aussie), everyone had been made aware that it was fake and all the magic of early reports had been replaced by negativity and mocking. But I lined up, paid my cash and went in to find out what it was all about.I must admit, that first sitting was the epitome of disappointment. The camera jumped all over the place and made me feel frustrated and a tad ill. The constant fighting of the characters got on my nerves more than a reality TV show. But the worst part of it was that I didn't find it at all to be scary. Here was this so-called holy grail of scary movies and people were actually laughing in the cinema rather than screaming. I walked out feeling completely let down after months of looking forward to the event.A couple of years later I decided to watch the movie on DVD. I picked a cold, dark night, turned all the lights out, took the phone off the hook and sat down on the couch. I'd made the decision that I was going to watch ""The Blair Witch Project"" the way the first viewers had seen it. Forgetting everything I'd ever heard about it, I would delve into it with a clean slate. I'm really glad I did! While I didn't completely freak out and lose my lunch in fear, I certainly found a new appreciation for it. In fact, if the viewer simply allows themselves to become involved in the situation on screen, it can become quite psychologically jarring. I really believe one of the reasons that so many hated the film, myself included, was due to both expectations and an inability to actually put themselves in the place of the actors. To actually experience the movie! It certainly didn't help that the audience I saw it with was laughing. If you can take that step, then ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a very effective and clever film. So the question is, is it OK to ask the audience to commit so much of themselves to a film for them to be able to have an emotional reaction (other than boredom). The more I think about it, the more I think the answer is yes. The problem has been created over an extended period of time, with more and more blockbuster movies that require nothing of the audience whatsoever. No thought, no belief, no experiencenothing! That being the case, when a movie such as this one comes around, it's understandable that people may just find it boring as they have lost the ability to actually ""experience"" it or in some cases, simply choose not to let themselves.No, I haven't done a complete turn around and gone from a Blair Witch basher to a Blair Witch lover. It's not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination. The epileptic camera movements still make it hard to watch, the inability to hear what's going on in the forest and some of the bickering still gets on my nerves. But I must admit it all makes it far more realistic and it's all very intentional to get the desired effect. The acting is actually pretty damn good. The fact is that in all likeliness, normal people would fight and cry and scream and carry on exactly the same way these guys do. There are moments of absolute terror in their voices and sheer emotion on their faces which is a credit to the actors. I can't say there's anything I could suggest they should have done differently that would make it any more realistic than it is and for that reason alone I consider the movie to be a success. It is a movie to be experienced alone in the dark though. Nothing else would do it justice.",The Blair Witch Project
817,mattwillandis,Time to set the record straight,8,18 November 2020,"Let's be honest, anybody who likes horror and didn't watch this film within its first two weeks in theaters likely has heard hype about this movie in some sense. I was no exception to this rule, and as I watched this film for the first time yesterday, and hadn't even existed when it was released, this film had twenty years of hype and expectations to meet for me. And while it is 100% true that hype will destroy a movie if too excessive, I must admit I can't say this film was hit by it too much. There are two problems that can befall upon older classic movies. One: either they become culturally irrelevant or made obsolete newer films (or to a lesser extent politically incorrect, like with ""gone with the wind"")(though I digress I still like that film), in story(for instance, a superhero movie from the forties will doubtfully get picked over a modern superhero film by someone) . Or two, the film becomes so old it is almost a foreign experience to watch (the technology, language, etc). To my knowledge, this film is very good at avoiding both problems. It is a very simple story, about kids lost in the woods, and possibly getting stalked by a witch, so it cleverly avoids problem one by by not having any added baggage to it's story and making what it DOES have in the story very good. And two, since the film is almost all in the woods, it's hard to find much technology to be confused by and the language is simple so it's not confusing either. Now admittedly it is ""filmed"" on old school cameras, which is admittedly a pretty big part of the movie, that being, the ""found footage"" aesthetic. But it would take two seconds to explain the cameras to someone else, so I don't find it a huge problem. Now that that's out of the way, let's get on to the actual movie. It's simplicity is it's biggest strength, and the camera grain adds another layer of fright to the movie. It has fantastic performances all around, and while a second viewing will not be nearly as frightening, it makes a very effective one-time horror film. One thing I must admit though, is that we never actually see the Blair witch. Now originally there was supposed to be a silhouette of her present in one of the scenes, but the camera angle didn't show her, and for reasons unknown to me, they never reshot the scene. While in some cases seeing the monster can be a downer or would lessen the film, with something like ""the Blair witch project"", I think it would've benefited from seeing her in some way. I don't mean like a full reveal, but a shadow, or a silhouette or a hand, just something to give the characters fears some legitimacy, would've been beneficial to the movie. Other than that, it's a good movie, and while not exactly enjoyable to watch because of how depressing and mean spirited it is, it's well made and was deserving of its praise.

819,bigdaddydave,fantastic for those with imaginations,9,22 October 2002,"(Spoilers)I really cant stand the opinion that this film is ""boring"" or ""not scary"" However, I have a theory on this.Everyone is familiar with the way films are now so ingrained in the public imagination that ""film conventions"" now provide basis for our reality, as opposed to reality.  Examples including space ship ""explosions"" that would, in fact, be silent implosions.
The same is true of horror, people think to now be scared you must JUMP and have some tangible monster.  This film completely goes against every corny horror film convention.  It is the anti-horror film (though not a parody)The genius of the film is that people are scared of walking through woods alone at night, and you don't know why.  So this film relates it to your fears and then places you in the middle, its all consuming, and you definitely feel you are there.Another criticism is of the ""whiney girl"" and the 2 students arguing. This was probably the most clever aspect.  The fact is people are scared of the unknown, and after the third night visit they know they are going to die, but heather only admits this 5 minutes before the end of the film.  They try to suppress   their emotions (as real people would) and tensions fray. This is also the only film I have ever seen where I could truly believe the actors were tired hungry and scared.I always argue with my friends about this film, , mainly about the action taken.  ""I would follow the river and run"" Would you?  Run alone through the woods? I wouldn't.  ""i wouldn't go in the house""  so you would leave josh? who is still alive?To summarise the film is scary genius, its simple tool is making it real to me, and every other imaginative person.  Do you like special effects and crap films? MATRIX! do you like something different, and terrifying? Blair Witch it is.I could have made this, so could you.  We didn't, I'm glad they did.",The Blair Witch Project

At the same time it is blood and gore-less. It is the best horror movie ever (before Psycho and Texas...)I guess it depends on your state of mind when you see it. If you really ""enter"" the movie and take it for real- it's the scariest movie ever (I could not walk up or a down a staircase for 2 months without getting flashbacks of the ending), if you for some reason do not, this movie sucks... Big Time. I will not write anything more about it. Just see it and see it while being in the right mood. For me it's NOT a popcorn flick where you talk with your friends while watching it. That won't work. If that's what you wan't rent Jason, Freddie or Michael Myers movies instead.ANY MORE HORRROR MOVIES LIKE THIS OUT THERE? /J",The Blair Witch Project
821,Enforcer686,Your reaction will depend on your imagination,7,4 July 2011,"If you have a rich, vivid imagination and a fascination with the subject matter, I think you'll enjoy this. This movie was somewhat of a pre-reality era movie in that I don't remember any other cinema movie of this style being popular before, and certainly not hyped as having real footage. I do not understand how an adult or even a teenager could be naive enough to believe this footage was real, but I guess that added to the thrill for many.Without question, not actually showing everything built suspense and mystery. The entire film would have collapsed like a house of cards if they had introduced a green skinned woman with a pointy hat at the end (LOL). Instead, we got a very cool ending. Along the way, you'll have to endure some overbearing acting by the female lead, but overall, this is worth watching at least once. You probably won't feel the need to watch it again after that for quite a long time, but it is an enjoyable experience nonetheless. It unfortunately typecast the actors (especially the female lead) forever as ""that guy/girl in Blair Witch"", but the men who made this film undoubtedly had no need to ever work again after this (budget $60,000 for a gross of $248 million, you do the math..).

822,nickcluxton,There are several ways to look at this one.,5,10 August 2012,"This is the film that inspired the 'home video' movies like Paranormal Activity and such, but unlike them, this is an original film. It doesn't follow the normal criteria of a horror film of any kind. Some argue that it goes back to older horror movies around the time period of Dracula and Frankenstein because it's not graphic or big on visuals, but it builds suspense throughout the whole film. If you like a typical horror movie, avoid this one. The main premise is consistent throughout as well, but there's no sign of a moving story, so again, it's based on your preference. Most of all, people seem to have strong opinions on how scary this movie is. If suspense and anticipation is what's scary for you, then you will have a great time. If you're more into action, visuals, and stories, avoid it. Personally, it's not my cup of tea.",The Blair Witch Project
823,lolbleachfan,"Original, creative and terrifying.",8,4 June 2013,"The Blair Witch Project is one of the best horror films ever made and one of my favourite films of all time.The story is that the film is supposed to be the found footage of three young film students that head to a rural town to film a documentary about a local myth of a witch that terrorised the town many years ago. They end up getting lost in the woods while being stalked by someone or something.The film entirely shot on video and cheap, black and white film supporting the feeling that the film is found footage and it works. Something about the look of it, and given the fact that the movie was made a very low budget and there is no music, gives it a sense of realism and a unique atmosphere.The acting is great, too. All the actors are very natural and, apart from the occasional one or two cheesy line, remain consistent throughout and giving a real sense of fear to the point where you feel like you are among this group and sharing the fear with them.However, one major complaint that I have is a lot of the time the camera is shaking all way too much to really make out what exactly is going on and is literally black at some points as in you cannot see a thing which is pretty annoying but not to the point where it is unwatchable. Another minor complaint is that sometimes you cannot hear what the characters are saying due to the limited range on the microphone on the cheap cameras they used but this only occurs a couple of times and, again, is bearable.Overall, a great film and a spooky experience that you will not soon forget.",The Blair Witch Project

Obviously we are dealing with a very low scare threshhold here as the only thing scary about this film is the sensationalized hype around it. What we basically have is a pretencious student film that thinks that jiggling the camera around and getting disjointed shots of the ground is scary and original. One can see this sort of thing nightly on reruns of America's Funniest Videos. The so called actors are obvious graduates of the MTV Real World School of Acting who feel that attitude and screaming constitutes acting. One could discuss the script if there was one but all appears to be made up as it goes along. The result is really a monumental bore that proves that the Hollywood Hype Machine is still running smoothly. If you want scary ""Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" or reruns of ""The Munsters"" fit the bill better than this home movie.",The Blair Witch Project
828,lot49,The Web site is more entertaining than the movie,1,7 August 1999,"After weeks of reading the hype about this independent film that supposedly impressed audiences at the Sundance Film Festival, I finally found time to see it in Colma, California a town in which the dead ""residents"" outnumber the living. After seeing this movie, I envied those dead people buried in the nearby cemeteries. They did not have to sit through 87 minutes of shaky handheld footage. Rather than a ghost story, the Blair Witch Project is largely a pseudo-documentary about three often-obnoxious Gen-Xers lost in the woods. We grasp their plight early in the film, so it's difficult to endure their bickering and histrionics after that point is made. By the time we arrive at the film's climax, most of us are glad to know that these tiresome filmmakers will be bound, tortured and disemboweled.The Blair Witch Project Web site actually contains more information than we see presented in the film. Web surfers are allowed to read the ""back-story"" of the Blair witch and her lingering hold on the Burkitsville community. I was hoping to see some standard ""talking head"" footage of the law enforcement officers and the private investigator who eventually located the personal effects of the missing filmmakers. I also expected interviews with the trio's grieving friends and relatives. While I normally dislike such cinematic cliches, in this instance, it would have been a relief.This film could easily be edited down to about twenty minutes of footage that could be presented as film clips within another documentary film about the filmmakers' disappearance (the film I expected to see).",The Blair Witch Project

No, I am not jaded by an over abundance of F/X dominated eye candy.  I have been hoping for horror films that relies more on the imagination then gore & computer graphics.This however is not it, I found it a chore to make my way though the thing. There was not a single frightening moment in the whole thing. I guess this might be impressive to people who have never gone deeper into the wild wood then a slightly ill kept city park.  My guess is that the conspiracy among critics wherein films are cut to bits as a way of teaching the company, or director or an actor in question a lesson.  I think this may have been the reverse, because it was made for a songthe critics have decided to prase it to the hilt. It amazes me that the public is falling for this!  I guess the American public is not as jaded as I thought. In the end, as someone who works in both education and media if these had been my students and they had made it out of those woods and I got a look at their unfocused effort with an audio track filled with the chant of ******** **** as this one was I would given them a solid F-.I nearly laughed out loud at the ending.",The Blair Witch Project

The movie is funny, very funny and entertaining but it is no where near the bottom of the top 20 horror movies of all time.  (The Lerprechaun movies scare me more than Blair Witch.)

If I had walked in filled with the hype machines workings, such as this being as scary as the Exorcist, then I probably would have been very, very disappointed.  However, I was told about the movie, its antics, its attempts at what I guess today is considered scary. 
I liked the movie a lot and I understand what is was trying to do and it was a valid attempt but it didn't work for me.  Trying to leave things to the imagination is fine but this movie is just plain vague.  Anyone can make this type of movie especially more so when you have very little money.  It was clever in its approach and again, I give it credit for what it attempted to do.  My major problem was the quality of the sound in the movie (After re-mixing was done by Artisan) which is pretty amazing for three ""students"" with basic equipment.  Plus, the lighting within the house was pretty darn good for one cam-corder to provide.  I mean that light even provided enough light for the hi 8 black and white to see very, very clearly.

It may have been the audience in the theatre that ruined it for me.  It's hard to be scared when the people in the theatre think that the whole thing is really funny, and the man sitting behind you specifically has a laugh like a braying donkey.  I am sure that had I been alone I would have been scared senseless.  As it is, the movie was damned creepy. 
I think the one thing that creeped me out the most was that child at the beginning.  The one that one of the people being interviewed is holding, remember her?  I want to know if the child was supposed to be saying 'No!' and covering her mother's mouth like that.  If so, get that kid into some classes immediately..she was a damned fine actress :)

835,R1OT,An emotional roller coaster ride,10,30 July 1999,"From all of the hype in the media concerning ""The Blair Witch Project"" (TBWP), I was hoping with all of my might that it just wasn't that ... hype.It was a small crowd (I saw a very early show), but from the second the film began, you could hear a pin drop in the theatre.  It's very uncommon nowadays to goto a movie and not hear anyone talking, murmuring, whispering. This was one of those times.TBWP scared me.  It was very easy to place myself in the woods with these kids, and to pretend I was one of their group.  My emotions went from slight laughter to concern to sorrow to anger to betrayal to fear over and over again.No movie has ever filled me with the suspense and the sheer fear of the dark like TBWP.  From beginning to end, I found myself not able to move, in fear I may miss something.When the film ended, everyone in the theatre just sat there; no one got up for at least 30 seconds.  Families and couples and friends all walked out not uttering a word to each other; it was like everyone was at a funeral and everyone's best friend was in the casket.I, myself, left the theatre in disbelief and somewhat mildly shocked.  If you can put yourself up there on the screen with the kids, you can actually feel their pain.  This film was WONDERFULLY done.I can honestly rate TBWP as one of the greatest horror/suspense films of the decade.  I will see it again; perhaps tonight. But I won't go to sleep in the woods.

The climax was well done and it did generate tension but the constantly shifting camera left me and my family pretty nauseated by about mid-film.  And I didn't even have any popcorn.  The good part of the film is that it broke a lot of rules that have governed cinematography for years.  The bad part is that it will more than likely become some sort of film cult classic without really deserving it.  I guess the part that bugged me the most was that I thought EVERYONE knew that if you are lost in the woods, follow the creek down stream until you hit some sort of civilization.

Some people in the theater were disappointed at the ending because the witch or whatever other horror was stalking the film students was never revealed. I thought the ending could have been a little better, but I liked the element of ambiguity and think that it adds to the terror of the movie. Being an avid woods man, I was annoyed with the stupidity of the students and how they handled their situation, but I guess it was necessary in order for the movie to work. Using the 16mm film added an incredible element of realism to the movie. This in my opinion was the movies strongest asset. The movie feels so believable  that many people in the theater actually thought they were watching real, authentic footage. The Blair Witch Project was an interesting movie, and if one allows themselves to become one of the campers and accept what is happening on screen, the movie is pretty darn chilling.",The Blair Witch Project

How scary can anything be in a crowded building in the middle of the afternoon? The next time I saw it was at home, at night, after having watched the 'Curse of the Blair Witch' back story mockumentary. It also helped that I live near the woods. This time, I saw how truly scary this film can be. Without the sound distortion of the theater's Surroundsound system, many of the scary sounds came through much more clearly. And seeing the back story helps you to see some of the supernatural aspects (that house at the end isn't even supposed to be there!).Seen the right way (at night, as close to alone as possible, near or in the woods if you can manage it), this is a horror masterpiece.",The Blair Witch Project

This movie is really different, it's not your Freddy or Jason or your leather face, it's not your Final Destination films or your Saw films. What made it so freaky was because it was just so different from other movies. You start to wonder during the film, ""What, this isn't real is it???"" As you might already know, the film is more of a documentary then it really is a movie. You don't know of the actors in the movie, nor the people and they seem so real. But also if you're planning to see this with your friends, don't. See it alone. Some movies are much more scarier seen alone, the Blair Witch Project it one of them. Not everyone is afraid of movies like these because they simply don't understand this type of horror. If you wanna be afraid of this movie be prepared to have scary things happen one step at a time.

I'm convinced that the characters in this movie are amongst the worst in horror movie history. They are more than agitating and all they do the whole movie is argue about a map. They just scream and scream and scream at each other and don't stop. It is infuriating to watch them for 1 and a half hours. The story also goes absolutely nowhere. It starts with somewhat of a promise, but when they go into the woods nothing happens for the rest of the movie(until the horrible last 5 minutes) They walk around lost in a forrest and whine(extensively about the map) and that's pretty much it. It is actually documented that the filmmakers ran out of ideas of what to do with the movie while filming and that the actors improvised most of the lines. You can completely tell because all they do for the runtime is have the same conversations over and over again. They just retread the same material repeatedly.

""The Blair Witch Project"" is so shockingly bad it could have been made by your ninth grade brother's friends on their first camping trip this summer.  Shot primarily with a poor quality video (which appears to pre-date steadyshot), ""Blair Witch"" should have had a hard time getting into student film and video festivals based on the poor visual and sound quality alone.  Instead, it has won prizes and accolades at both Cannes and Sundance, and has become the new indie darling of film critics most everywhere. But, ""Blair Witch"" is far scarier than many of the critics have even begun to hint at.  It's basically 80 minutes of watching amateurs stuck in flat woods, running in circles, with no concept of shot composition, no script, no performance talent, and absolutely no idea of what the hell they are doing.  This is the movie that puts the 'horror' in horrible.""Blair Witch"" is supposed to be about the making of a documentary.  Is this supposed to represent a documentary film crew? A girl who is a complete bitch, and two dweebs who act like whiny versions of Beavis and Butt-head. The interminable fits of yelling and screaming will have you bored stiff. Do stick figures made of wood, and the sounds of nearby ""filmmakers"" making funny noises in the woods give you the creeps?...if so, you might actually find this frightening.Well, as audiences everywhere are finding out (as Cinemascore is indicating), ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not a good film, and certainly not what they were told it would be.  Shame on critics making comparisons to horror classics like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Those were bold masterpieces of terror in which the scripts were solid before production began.  Jeez, even ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" was scarier than ""Blair Witch"" (if Jennifer Love's breasts get any bigger...)

853,gartner,Interesting concept; but not nearly up to the hype,4,7 August 1999,"I just saw the Blair Witch Project and must say that I was disappointed.My real disappointment is that I went into the film just hoping to be scared out of my wits. I found myself on the edge of my seat waiting for the moment when I would be so overtaken with fright that my stomach wouldn't be able to take it. That moment never came. Were there moments of great tension? Yes. Were some of the events in the film freaky? Certainly. Was it the greatest horror movie ever? Hardly.It was a very interesting concept, but in the end the most scary part of the film is that I found myself driving home woozy from the scattershot home video style.I would not advise anyone not to see the Blair Witch Project, but I would warn not to expect too much.",The Blair Witch Project

The ending is terrible and the film turns into a terrible campside story instead of possibly becominng an urban legend. Great idea, bad execution. There is about 10 -15 minutes of scenes that are worth watching. The film just like it's characters,  just keeps going in circles.

The performances were quite believable, which gives me the impression that the actors really were that scared. I don't quite know how to put into words just how good or scary this movie is. . .The review from the trailer that say ""the creepiest film since 'the Exorcist'!"" is quite an accurate one. . .In fact, if I may, I'd like to take it a step further and say that this movie is even scarier than ""the Exorcist"". Yes, you read right. This movie certainly is making me question my faith in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" as the best film ever made. I suppose I can't think of anything else to say about this movie. If you want a scare, you'll get it. If your in for a laugh...Well, you'll actually be able to get that too. Just not as much.

Looked incredibly like a documentary at the beginning, and the acting (if you could call it that) was extremely casual and real. Mike, Heather, and Josh formed a perfect disfunctional trio that could get at each other's throats if things went wrong. Before the scary stuff started, there were some real funny parts, i.e., ""If I heard a cackle I would have s*** my pants!"" The scariest part is when they heard they noises on the second and third nights. That really scared me. It was wierd how Mike went crazy and threw away the map. When Josh dissapeared, I knew that is was the beginning of the end. Everything became clear in the final seconds of the movie, and that made it so spooky.

By far my favorite part of this movie is the closeup of Heather Donahue's runny nose.  (I would like to see this movie become a cult classic like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", where you can go to the theater and throw rolls of toilet paper -- or, in the case of Heather Donahue, boxes of Kleenex.)

This movie has got to be one of the boringest,over-hyped films of all time.The acting sucked,the actress was a dog,no female titty shots or sex scenes to keep the audience interested.

It wasn't totally commercial (product placement, etc.) and upon it's release, without public knowledge that it was a totally fictional movie, actually scared the hell out of lots of people. I don't care if some say it's based on a true story. The movie is 100% fictional. I made films in college more than 30 years ago and always did well. The potential this movie had to be a knock out success was there. Soon after the trio gets lost, the movie loses it way. Then it gets irritating. Then if falls flat on it's face, or should I say, the camera falls and we are left to speculate. Was it the witch? Was it that psycho killer?... Who cares? I lost any sympathy for the characters when their only main response to the confusion was bitching and moaning and blaming each other and using the ""F..."" word with every breath. Here's some suggestions on what could have helped this movie immensely. 1.) A little more evidence of something out of the norm could be found in the mornings after they hear spooky sounds in the night. 2.) Heather doesn't sound so ridiculously sure of herself when the map just ain't cutting it. 3.) The trio spends some logical time discussing what they are experiencing, then turn on the camera and focus on one or more of them giving a speech in regards to it, referring to notes. I really can see this as a way to build the tension. 4.) A gradual unveiling of the trios growing insanity, that even though they are walking in generally the same direction, they are coming upon nothing; impossible. How could that be? And they would video each other commenting on it. Even in the midst of death, filmmakers in war zones are dedicated to their art! These college kids, the future leaders of society, are making a documentary. At least that's what they're supposed to be doing. Their emotional outbursts in this movie is going overboard. 5.) Why doesn't just one of them try to start a fire? That would get some rangers and more. 6.) A little nudity would have helped. Come on Heather, what else is there to do? 7.) A little more controlled handling of the video recorder would have been nice. The camera work was no better than a bunch of stoned high school kids screwing around. The movie had great potential, but it was as if the scriptwriter and/or filmmakers just ran out of ideas. Well, I know this is a good cheap formula for film-making, so I'll use it in the next film I make with my nephew. He'll be in college soon.

By the time this so called ""film"" was over, I was literally thinking ""Wow, I can't believe I actually just wasted an hour and a half of my life on that!""

871,HeroOfTheDay666,Possibly The Scariest Movie I've Ever Seen,10,18 July 2010,"When I heard about this movie, I had no idea what was so special about it. To me, it seemed like a cheesy low budget movie that had no scary elements to it. Just a bunch of teenagers running around with video cameras in the woods. The spoofs of this movie didn't help either. Last Halloween, I decided to rent this movie and watch it alone one night. I don't think I ever had such trouble sleeping as I did that night. This movie is defiantly one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. It's a rarity when a movie scares me at all, let alone follow me far after the screen is turned off. It's a shame to me that this movie is so underrated. It is unfortunate that people hate this movie because of its lack of special effects, music, and other elements of the modern horror movie (most of which i despise). Perhaps the reason most people did not enjoy this movie is because they actually need to use some brain power to grasp the true horror of this picture. Unlike most horror movies these days where producers use flashy gimmicks to distract viewers from a lack of plot or writing, the Blair Witch Project uses only reality and believable situations, leaving a raw, shocking experience for those intelligent enough to enjoy it. To me, the reason this movie is so successful is because of how real it feels, and that your imagination is left to do so much. The plot could easily of been based on a true story, and many people actually thought this movie was real at its release. Despite not being real or based on anything, it isn't preposterous to think something like this can happen. As you may of noticed, I haven't mentioned anything specific about the movie. This is because once you know the basic idea, thats all you need. Anything more is spoiler, and will ruin the experience. Just trust me, if you are sick of most horror movies, give this a shot. Watch it alone, at night, with the lights out. It's an experience you will never forget.",The Blair Witch Project

The ending is well done but very brutal at the same time, it ends in an abrupt way that frightens a lot of people and I know why! If you like character development and atmosphere movies then this is for you but if you're the one that will go for Halloween, Scream and Friday the 13th this is not for you.

All of the commercials and critic reviews made the movie sound like it was going to scare my pants off; how wrong I was.To make my review short: nothing really happens. I think Family Guy summed up this movie best when Bryan is a seeing eye dog for a blind man and he narrates ""There in the woods...nothing happens...there still in the woods, a girl is crying...uhm...nothing happens"" I could make an easy fortune narrating this movie for people who can not see very well; I could just say that they're just in the woods and I would have done my job. Some parts are a bit creepy...if you think that toilet paper roll ups hanging on a tree are the stuff of nightmares that is. Its so random, but not random in a good way like Monty Python. Typical scene ""Where we going?*camera off* I WANT TO GO HOME!"" The filming is creative but its just a bad conceptI remember being at the theater, sitting down, and the movie suddenly ends. Credits are rolling and I look around to see if anyone had left; most of the people were so utterly confused, they did not know what was going on. I thought maybe the credits were a trick.

There is nothing particularly ORIGINAL about ""Blar Witch"", although it is an unusual approach and one that is rarely done, let alone done well.However, the hype surrounding this movie leaves me baffled.  For one, it really hurt to know certain details beforehand (these details have been crammed down our throats via TV and radio for a month or so, now).  There are so few points in the movie where something creepy actually happens, that to know of them before the lights have even gone down strips them of any eeriness.  But more than that, it created expectations for this film which were unrealistic.  Is it a good film?  Yes, if you can technically call it a ""film"".  Is it a GREAT film?

Not being a fan of horror/thriller, I was quite worried that I'd be terrified, as EVERYONE I spoke with said the movie was very, very scary (my sister would not go camping after she saw it). Well, perhaps I'm jaded because I'm in my thirties, but there was only one point in the film where I was moderately startled. I was never terrified, or even remotely disturbed. While I understand the device of having the discovered footage that the three film makers shot on their quest for the witch, it was this very device that kept me too distanced to be scared. If you're really terrified by all the weird goings on and so on, I'm sorry, no matter how dedicated a film maker you are, you don't switch on your video camera. Obviously the film could not have been made without making this assumption, but I was never convinced that there was anything that scary, because the characters always had the presence of mind to turn their cameras on. Still, it's worth seeing if you're interested in how video looks blown up to 35 mm.

What this film does it bring a kind of mediocre Hitchcock to a young audience. The camera work is not subjective, its annoying. They want to do it in that style, fine, but have a Stead-i-Cam. Its not scary, is my biggest problem. We need a film like the Exorcist. As put in Entertainment Weekly ""A cat jumping from offscreen is scary, the Exorcist is so disturbing it will mess you up for months."" Rent that and then you will get it, or even Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it'll stick with you for a while. Currently, I would say Stigmata looks promising.Final Grade: DETENTION C-

It certainly shows what hype can do.  The story is only good for about 20 minutes, then you're just waiting for the end...nothing new happens after the first act.  The kids get lost and stay lost for the remaining 40 minutes.  The acting is not bad, but the characters are hateful people that you're sick of being with after about 1/2 hour.  The worst thing is that the film isn't scary!  It's hyped as a horror film, but there's no fear!  This is mostly due to the distracting camera work and the stupidity of the characters and their situation.  Anyone with half a brain could get out of that forest.  Because the characters are irritating, and stupid, you lose all sympathy with them, and then your suspension of disbelief goes away as well.

THIS REVIEW INCLUDES SPOILERS !!!This week-end, my girlfriend and I saw ""The Blair Witch"" project on French TV. I was very impatient to see it after all the hype and rave reviews it got when it was released. Dammit, it sucked. It really did. All you have in this movie is three idiots lost in the woods, screaming at each other. And that's it ! Only this. Nothing happens at all. Most of the time, the screen is just pitch-dark, or so obscure that you can't see anything. The plot, which relies on so-called realism is plain stupid. For instance, how come these guys didn't hire a guide to help them find their way in the forest ? And why the hell does one of the characters just throw away the map ? How come their camera's battery never runs out ? And when a person is about to die, does he/she really keep filming himself/herself without doing anything else ? The list could go on and on. Not only is this movie stupid and ridiculous but above all, it is boring, terribly boring. I mean it : don't expect this to frighten you. In my opinion, absolutely nothing can redeem this thing. And I can't possibly understand why some people acclaimed it and made it such a huge success. The original concept may have been good but the actual result is a complete failure.

And intentionally losing the map, the ONE source of information, left me with a feeling that they all truly deserved whatever fate befell them and that the human race would be a slightly better place without them contributing those defective genes to the gene pool.Additionally, i found the characters to be annoying, argumentative and having few redeeming qualities. PET PEEVE - WIPE YOUR NOSE !Initially i was going to rate this film a 2 because they did manage to make over 100 million dollars on this piece of tripe, which required a bit of marketing genius.

Fortunately i am not one of those people. this film is up their with the contenders of the worst horror films I've ever seen. I respect the fact that they tried summing new with a hand-held camera and to their credit it has not been used all that much in horror films during that time period. It tried being a horror film, however the film was a horror show rather than horror film. one of the main reasons i dislike this film is because its one big anti climax and the concluding part of the film is laughable.if you wanna watch a descent hand held film watch paranormal activity it much better and way more interesting than this.

What, the Sun makes circles in the sky? How dumb can you be? They are a group of teenagers with no survival experience so I guess it is normal that they behave like morons for most of the film, but where are their instincts? If there is something that can defeat fear, that is the auto-conservation instinct: that instinct can turn a damn coward into a hero. Something scares the s...t out of them every night and they don't bother to build anything that resembles a weapon? I thought that was one of those movies that are completely boring until the end and then the final scare makes your skin boil with goosebumps and you think ""It was only one scare in the whole crappy movie, but it was a damn good scare"".

No one has actually done anything like it before. But what is the main principle of this kind of pictures? Realism. We have to believe it's true, the camera is not outside of the story, taping it - it's basically one of the characters.
Hence we get what we get - this genre was in fact very timely. Being just a way of cinematography language nowadays it's completely left its predecessor, its founder behind.
The Blair Witch Project could only be made twenty years ago, when it was possible to make it look credible enough for us, viewers, even if just for a second to believe that this all might have actually been true (or forget it couldn't). It helped that the actors were all no-names and the Internet was long way from where it is now.

897,LuvzHorror,Unnerving!,8,7 October 2011,"As a major fan of the horror genre I heard about The Blair Witch project and simply HAD to go and see it! Thinking of myself as a hardened horror buff I was pretty sure that I'd enjoy every second, and I did, but I was terrified! The fact that I was heavily pregnant and had to return home to an empty house as my husband was working away should have been a deterrent, but I thought I'd be fine!My sister (who loathes horror movies with a passion) had seen Blair Witch the night before and said she was disappointed in it. She said it was over-hyped and simply not frightening. How wrong she was!The film starts with 3 student film makers, Heather, Josh and Mike, heading to Burketsville to make a documentary about the legend of The Blair Witch. They visit various sites of interest, speak to local people and hear the story of Rustin Parr. Parr was a local man who kidnapped, tortured and murdered 7 local children in the 40's. During his trial Parr claimed that he was possessed by the spirit of Elly Kedward, a woman burnt as a witch in the town of Blair. Burketsville was formerly known as Blair.The trio then head out into The Black Woods. They visit Coffin Rock, the site of the murder of 5 men. As the film progresses the students move further into the woods. Inevitably they become lost. What follows still scares me to this day. As fear takes over the sensibilities of the trio they begin to fight and argue with each other. Then, when night falls, strange happenings occur. Children are heard laughing, strange objects are left outside the tents. The students slowly descend into absolute terror. To go any further would mean including spoilers, which I always hate in a review. Needless to say the frustration of the students is passed on to the viewer. Shaky camera-work (this film being one of the first 'handheld camera' movies) only adds to the fear as we are unable to see what it is that is terrifying the students.I watched this film on the edge of my seat. On my return home I was physically afraid to be alone. I actually ended up staying the night at my parent's house! That's not to say that everyone will be afraid, judging by some of these reviews I think I must be an absolute coward for being scared by a film that some people have claimed made them fall asleep!But I will leave this review by saying one thing:I went into labour the next day - 3 weeks early!",The Blair Witch Project
898,se7endaze,Its uniqueness is more important that its quality....,8,19 June 2005,"Anyone who has even the slightest trouble with insomnia after seeing a horror movie should stay away from The Blair Witch Project--this film will creep under your skin and stay there for days. Credit for the effectiveness of this mock documentary goes to filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who armed three actors (Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Josh Leonard) with video equipment, camping supplies, and rough plot outlines. They then let the trio loose into the Maryland woods to improvise and shoot the entire film themselves as the filmmakers attempted to scare the crap out of them. Gimmicky, yes, but it worked For those of you who were under a rock when it first hit the theaters, The Blair Witch Project tracks the doomed quest of three film students shooting a documentary on the Burkittsville, Maryland, and legend of the Blair Witch. After filming some local yokels (and providing only scant background on the witch herself), the three, led by Heather (something of a witch herself), head into the woods for some on-location shooting. They're never seen again. What we see is a reconstruction of their ""found"" footage, edited to make a barely coherent narrative. After losing their way in the forest, whining soon gives way to real terror as the three find themselves stalked by unknown forces that leave piles of rocks outside their campsite and stick-figure art projects in the woods. The masterstroke of the film is that you never actually see what's menacing them; everything is implied, and there's no terror worse than that of the unknown. If you can wade through the tedious arguing--and the shaky, motion-sickness-inducing camera-work--you'll be rewarded with an oppressively sinister atmosphere and one of the most frightening denouements in horror-film history.The film does hold up. Its uniqueness is more important that its quality, but there's not a lot unique out there. This is one of those great Saturday-wanna-scare-the-crap-out-of-you-Night movies, a true ghost story I severely enjoyed this one",The Blair Witch Project

You really have to be awake the first 15 minutes of the film or you won't realize what your'e supposed to be scared off. The film tries to invent a revolutionary kind of method, which is to not have any music to try and scare the audience. Is that method good? Personally I don not like that. It collapses on it self trying to be a horror genre. There's nothing horrifying about it.Let's say that The Blair Witch Project is real and you find the video cameras, you must then wonder why they didn't stop recording while they were fighting.

EDIT
It was a bold movie that forever changed the way that movies were made. That's the line that we are often told about this movie and its mostly correct. It was somewhat bold, the idea of lost footage was not new, but it somehow caught the imagination of the public. It came out during a time when the genre of horror was starting to be reborn. The late 80's into the early 90's saw horror slip into one unforgettable trash movie after another. Then came Scream and everything changed. By the time this movie came around the public was ready for something new and they got it.The movie honestly is not that great. It has a somewhat weak story that would make for a great book more then a great movie. Something is out in the forrest and a group of filmmakers go out to do a documentary about it. The acting is all around awful at times. We don't see much of anything and the ending left so many wanting more. And that I think is the key to this movie. It gave us just enough that left us hungry for more. We wanted it to be real. Sure it was not the first movie to have the idea, but it was a movie that tapped into the public's love for lore of the unknown. We knew that it was not real but what if.I'm not sure if horror movies will ever go away. People love them and they make a lot of money for those in Hollywood. Scream night have awoken our current love of horror movies but it was in Blair Witch that it went from a killer with a knife to a force that you couldn't hide from.So should you see this? Yes. At least once. It took me almost 20 years to watch it. Was it great? No but it was still creepy. I happen to love folklore and then ideas in this movie tapped beautifully into that idea that there are things we can not explain. Watch it and then go camping and tell me that it doesn't make you stay up all night.",The Blair Witch Project

Well-deserved kudos to all involved because it did truly frighten me. I went to see this BY MYSELF on my 1/2 day off from work and, as Paula O'Keefe says in her user comment, I was *NOT* breathing during the tremendous final ten minutes (quote/un-quote).  I found myself holding my breath, seriously, during the whole last climax, which I believe was longer than ten minutes and I had to remind myself to physically breathe.I found this film terrifying because it left everything up to my imagination.  I do not consider myself creative, but when it comes to imagination for horror, I guess I have it!  I must agree with Rick Peach's user comment of ""The last shot of this film will be stuck in my head for years to come"" because it will be; it truly will be.  When I finally remembered the story and figured out why the last shot was done the way it was, BINGO ... I had trouble sleeping that night and I did have nightmares, I hate to admit!All in all, a wonderful movie that I look forward to dragging my husband to see with me.  I HAVE to see it again!

904,timskelly,Viewing conditions and state of mind are everything.,4,1 August 1999,"When there were only(!) 90 posting about this film there were only seven that did not range from from ""really scary"" to ""best film ever made!"" All seven disliked the film and four viewed it on video. I just came from a midnight screening that was packed with college students. I have to guess, but judging by the boos, hisses and only moderate applause, it was not seen by 90% of these viewers as ""the scariest movie ever made.""Viewing conditions and state of mind are everything. This (very well edited) film does not come to you, you have to go to it, almost literally. If you want to be scared, see it in a movie theater. Unlike most fright films, try to go when the theater is almost empty. Crowd reactions will take you ""out"" of the film. And I mean this in the best sense of the word, be naive. Any critical thought applied to The Blair Witch Project blasts through it like a searchlight through a tissue. What you will see then is a very thin excuse for a film.I would like to recommend that you find and rent a copy of ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" the original ""found footage"" horror documentary. Unfortunately, you probably won't find it, and if you did, the fake (human) and real (animal) butchery would definitely put you off. However, for the strong of stomach, that is a film that is not only disturbing in broad daylight, but also disturbs to instruct. Two things that The Blair Witch Project cannot claim for itself.In short, if you've never gotten over your childhood fears and are still afraid of the dark, even just a little, under the right conditions, Blair Witch is for you.Otherwise, skip it.",The Blair Witch Project
905,ScaryBoy,The best horror movie ever made,10,1 August 1999,"The above statement is no lie. The Blair Witch Project was absolutely magnificent from start to finish. It replaces Scream as my favorite horror movie, even though they are too totally different to compare to one another. The performances in Blair Witch are totally convincing and amazing. I have always heard the phrase ""Just keep telling yourself it's only a movie . .."", but I never really knew what that felt like -- until now. Seeing the looks on the actors' faces, it felt like you were there with them and you could totally identify with them. The three actors were excellent, with emotions ranging from humor to sorrow to sadness to fear to utmost horror. Heather Donahue especially does well with her character undergoing the most significant change, but Mike Williams and Josh Leonard are good too. The scares are more subtle in this film than in your usual thriller - there is no clanging musical score to let you know when the scares are coming. The uneasiness starts off slow, with the film throwing us off-balance early on with a great deal of humor. But gradually the terror becomes more and more apparent, and you feel more and more like grabbing hold of the nearest person and not letting go until it's all over. And what an ending - several people have said it's not clear enough what happens, but I disagree. I think it is good just the way it is. By the finale you are totally run ragged, and it ends perfectly. I think everyone should see this movie. Forget about the cliches of I Still Know What You Did Last Summer; the real deal in horror movies is this amazing film. 11/10",The Blair Witch Project

You can be sure that after seeing it will generate a great deal of thought and discussion with your friends.  One of my friends that I saw this movie with had to sit there until the ""All events in this movie are fictitious and any resemblance to real stuff is completely coincidental"" message appeared on the screen.

But ""Blair Witch"" is strictly an amateur affair from start to finish.  The characters were poorly developed and not the least appealing.  I didn't care what happened to them.

910,Transit,Innovative technique. Not quite as good as it could be done.,7,26 September 1999,"I spent a surprising amount of time trying to decide how I felt about this movie. It was not the scariest film of the year, nor even the scariest film of the month in which it was released, If you're looking for pure chills or something that will make you scream along with the protagonists, you won't find it here. It is, however, quite entertaining, and disturbing in a fashion that falls in the general realm of terror. The choice of storytelling medium is the instrumental deciding factor in making this film worth the price of admission (or of rental). It is such a total departure from typical Hollywood glamour and high tech fests that it imparts a deep sense of realism that could never be achieved by any other means, no matter how sophisticated the industry becomes. But the decision to use ""amateur footage"" as the sole medium for the storyline is paradoxically both the strong point and the greatest weakness of this film. First, the story couldn't work any other way without a serious rewrite. It would be too hokey any way but the way in which it's presented. But in the form of ""real life"" footage, it works. At times, the effort to make the footage look sufficiently amateurish to seem real is strained and in some cases overdone. At others, the very unprofessionalism is what makes it so moving. For instance, Heather's taped apology to their parents. Bad camera angle, no obvious makeup, bloodshot eyes, and a shot so unglamourous that even when you've read the disclaimer of fictionality, you still think for a moment... ""are you sure this isn't real?""But the most critical decision point is whether we believe that all of this would make it onto film. There is a pivotal scene in which Josh condemns Heather for ""still making movies"" when they are lost in the woods. She replies, tearfully, ""It's all I have, okay?"" Miss that scene, and you'll never stand any chance of believing that so much of this story ""realisticly"" made it onto film. Simply put, these are aspiring film makers whose life training has made it a deeply engrained habit to film everything. That's as close as you'll get to an explanation for the completeness of the film records here. Still, it's a tough sell. There are things you still can't believe got on film, yet without these scenes, the story would lose a lot in thetranslation. That's the double edged sword: show too much, you lose that natural realism, show too little, you lose the story itself. Clearly the film's producers were treading a thin line here.It worked. Just about. But there was still room for improvement.",The Blair Witch Project
911,Mike-646,This is one of the best movies of the year,10,12 August 1999,"Ok, so it wasn't as scary as everyone said it was.  But what WAS scary about this film was the way that each of the characters gradually (and with much realism) got more frightened, and started to lose it (also the ending was scary-wow!).  That was the scary aspect that the film was trying to show. But as I've realized, people either like this movie or hate it, which my friend did when we saw it.  Plus, many of the people in the theater were also upset after the viewing of the movie.

(In fact, a rewatched The Birds a few weeks ago, which, until now, was my favorite horror film.)  The documentary style is clever; it moves the story along and helps us see things through the characters eyes. The tension builds from nothing to extreme.  The fear it arouses comes entirely from that tension -- we never see what is out there, and there are no cheap scares from sudden surprises.I found this film to be totally engrossing.  My impression, moreover, is that everyone else in the full theater felt the same way.  I don't know if I've ever been in a movie theater that was so quite during and after a film.The only negative aspect of this experience for me (like someone else who posted comments here) is that it actually left me feeling queasy.

It avoids the cheesiness of other horror movies yet maintains the great nightmarish elements. When I went to see it everyone in the audience moaned after the movie was finished, most likely disgusted with the ending. I'm sure this was only so because people have grown accustomed to blood and guts and goo - the physical aspects of horror. ""The Blair Witch Project"" doesn't bother to utilize the physical elements, but rather take a different approach which appears much classier and to me makes the film come out better than any other horror film could. If you would like to see a classy, extremely well done horror film that will leave you dreaming nightmares for a fortnight, you should definitely see this movie.

It's been many a full moon since this filmlover has seen an audience so charged up that they literally were running into the theatre to grab a good seat. We were going to see something new, something different. Above all, we were going to experience a film which was ""Scary as Hell!""Instead, we got faux cinema verite with just a hint of Tobe Hooper.  Instead of shock we got a crock.  The cinematography, let's face it, was just plain poor.  The vaunted ""performances"" of the three leads were adequate acting-class improv.  The ending simply did nothing with the basic premise except to close it within the acceptable minimum running time.  As a fear-inducing entertainment, Blair Witch is dead on arrival.  When it opens wide this weekend, many an exhibitor will be deluged with demands for return of the ticket price.  Those reviewers and fans who suffer from the Emporer's New Clothes Complex (I believe this will be great, therefore it is!) are in for a mighty repudiation from the American filmgoing public, and Artisan, which artfully managed the hype-machine on this little movie, will be forced to pull the plug on any notion of mass-market success with this TBWP. This said, Blair Witch does work really well on one level.  As a metaphor for the ignorance and ineptitude of the American media covering any story of real importance, the film is, in fact, a powerful indictment. I do suspect this was the real intent of the filmakers, so blatant is this theme as the movie unreels.  But as a fearsome chiller-thriller of the psychological variety? Please.  For real films of this type, I refer the interested reader to Polanski's The Tenant, to Cronenberg's Videodrome, to M, Peeping Tom, or The (original) Haunting.  Blair Witch is worth seeing, but for none of the reasons put forth by its publicity campaign.  Filmgoers not conditioned to believe everything they hear will feel ripped off by Artisan, the Sundance crowd, and the filmakers themselves.To these, I have one last word:Booo!",The Blair Witch Project
915,HiPPieGiRl,It looks and feels real....that's the scary thing about,10,3 December 1999,"In Australia at midnight over 200 hundred people flocked the cinemas to be the first to see The Blair Witch. Alot of hype and anticipation was surrounding the movie and to me it lives up the hype!Never in my life have I seen a movie with such fear and unhappiness in someones eyes that it was enough to keep me awake all night.This movie was set around three student film makers who set out on a on - foot hike through the BLACK HILLS in Burketsville on a search for the Blair Witch formally known as Elli.It was a weekand journey planned out by director Heather Donahue , who was making a documentry about the Blair Witch. Little does she know she was filming her last days here on this Earth.Watching the movie without music or professional camera shots was a much more frightening way of watching three people being hunted by something unknown the camera. Every new shot something  different was saw or heard and as the nights dragged on, things became more scarier and more obvious.The ending was terrifying and left the audience speechless. The fact that these three students didn't know what to expect and weren't expecting anything that had happened to them for those five nights was the most real life encounting fear and angst that it felt incrediably real and terrifying to watch.I really really loved this movie and it is the best scary flick ever made. It's independent which amazes me more but it's a job well done. It was planned and organised very well. Thumbs up!It's about time a movie with a reality check was finally made!",The Blair Witch Project

I liked Mike and Heather. When they interviewed people at the beginning of the movie, it was kind of funny. But while they were in the woods, I wasn't scared at all. Not one bit.

918,Brundledan,"""MTV"" Horror...",3,13 November 1999,"...and that's not a compliment. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is right behind ""The Phantom Menace"" as the year's most overrated movie.It's hard to say what this movie's BIGGEST problem is, but we can start with the characters, a trio of whiny, self-absorbed idiots that will absolutely annoy the crap out of you. Watching these clowns from a first-person perspective is like watching a feature-length ""Real World"" episode (which is a terrifying proposition in itself). I, for one, was rooting for the witch, and it's hard to take the movie seriously when you WANT the ostensible heroes to die.Believability is also a huge problem, for one very simple reason: Nobody in their right mind would have continued filming as long as these people did. They just wouldn't, ESPECIALLY while running through the woods at NIGHT while in a state of complete panic. Now, this may sound like nitpicking, but in order for ""Blair Witch"" to work we've got to BELIEVE that we're watching actual footage, taken in a situation and a state of mind as horrific as the students were in. It is simply beyond belief that they would have the presence of mind to continue filming as their situation becomes a fight for survival.And overall the movie was - dare I say? - boring. Just plain dull. I wasn't drawn into the situation; I wasn't even remotely scared until the last five minutes (after which the movie just stops - it doesn't end, it just STOPS), mainly because I was so tired of listening to the annoying main characters bicker. This is a tiresome movie.Now, I know this is supposed the be the ""scariest movie of all time""; I know I probably missed the point, that these people were SUPPOSED to be annoying (in order to appear more ""real""); that the production values were supposed to be incredibly cheap (""reality"" again), and that the horror was supposed to be entirely SUGGESTED without us actually seeing anything scary, along with various other ""artistic"" reasons that filmmakers like this feed us when they don't really feel like actually making a horror movie. All I know is, ""Blair Witch"" is a waste of time. Go watch a movie that somebody actually put some effort into.",The Blair Witch Project
919,Brundledan,Remarkable...,3,9 January 2000,"...not the movie, the people COMMENTING on it. I've posted once before, but scrolling down, I see that there are STILL so many suckers who bought INTO this piece of garbage, I felt it necessary to reiterate a few key points, mainly:-""The Blair Witch Project"" is, hands down, one of THE WORST MOVIES EVER MADE. And yeah, I AM taking movies like ""I Spit On Your Grave"", ""Nail Gun Massacre"", and ""Robot Holocaust"" into consideration. When you have NO script (I still can't believe that), amateurish cinematography that prevents you from actually SEEING anything (""use your imagination"", the flick's fans bray, missing the point that when EVERYTHING is left to the imagination there's no point in SEEING the movie at all), ""actors"" whose best ad-libbing comes in the form of repetitive and offensive cursing, and a classic ""Ebert Situation"" - that the whole movie could have been over in fifteen minutes had the characters not been complete IDIOTS - this is to be expected.-That BWP made the kind of money it did is a damning indictment of the American filmgoer, and a tribute to the effectiveness of fake word-of-mouth. So many people believed this was real, or terrified themselves by putting themselves ""in the situation"". Three words: Follow the river. There; the whole movie is unnecessary. But the characters are so stupid that this sure-fire solution never occurs to them... and these are COLLEGE students? It's never a good sign when you WANT the heroes to die.-Most of the hype for this movie was fake, generated in spades via faux-amateurish Web sites and supposed ""fan"" reviews actually generated by the ""filmmakers"" and their friends. The glowing reviews? Fake (In fact, I'm willing to bet that half of the mini-reviews HERE are fakes - at least, the initial reviews; you'll notice that they soon become overwhelmingly negative, and that the people defending it become much fewer and farther between). While this practice is, of course, nothing new, I do not believe it has EVER worked as well as it has with ""Blair Witch Project"" - the Artisan spin machine must have gone into overdrive when the folks there saw what a hideously bad movie they had on their hands. They are to be commended for successfully deceiving so many people.To sum up: This entire movie is a sham, made by untalented hacks and deceptively promoted. If you thought this was a ""groundbreaking"" horror movie, then you obviously do not watch horror movies, nor are you aware of the elements that make a successful one (the reviewers who glowingly compare it to movies like ""Scream"" are proof of that). If you identified with the characters - if you liked the movie at all - then you're an idiot.",The Blair Witch Project

This is definitely a masterpiece! It's fantastic, innovative and thrilling to the bone. The ending is one of the best ever. I was sitting in a nearly full theater and all the time there were jokes and comments on the film, but at the end you could hear a needle fall on the floor, it was total silence.

921,rasmus-9,Very original... (possible spoilers),9,21 April 2000,"Before I saw this, I heard that this movie was supposed to be one of the scariest movies ever. So when I sat down with the movie, I was expecting a pretty scary movie.I think the movie is very original with the actors running around with the camera themselves and with no music of any kind.If I didn't know this was movie, I would have thought that this was real.In many ways this is truly a very scary movie. It's not shocking like your average Scream or Elm Street movie, but every minute of the movie has a very eerie feeling about it.It's just a shame, that some of the things in the movie is down right stupid. Firstly, if they lost the map, why didn't they just look at the filmed material where they actually filmed the map, it was clearly enough so you could navigate around with it. And throwing away the map was pretty stupid too, but that's a whole other thing.Secondly, the witch's (or whatever it was) ""spell"" couldn't possibly reach the whole forest. At some point they (if they hadn't changed directions, and stopped all the time) would have been far enough away to avoid the spell and get out of the forest.And another thing, it's pretty odd that Heather kept filming every time something scary was happening (like when the children attacked their tent). If I were attacked by something in the middle of the night I think I would do something else than film the whole damn thing. But apart from that, I think that this was a great movie. I really sat on the edge of my seat at many points (which doesn't happen very often).I highly recommend this movie.I rate this movie 8 out of 10",The Blair Witch Project

(if it was true); Swearing eventually takes your mind off the actual plot; The guy who throws the map in the water - even HE wouldn't have been that crazy; Make the bloody finger slightly more REAL; Why weren't they more worried about the guy who went missing? If they had showed us SOMETHING of the witch; In 'real life' they would have run out of batteries for the camera (plus if they had changed them why wasn't it recorded on the other video camera???).Those are all the suggestions I can think of at the moment.",The Blair Witch Project
923,wink_man01,"NOT for the ""MTV/Nintendo Generation""",8,29 May 2000,"First of all I really, really liked this movie. But then again I have an imagination. I thought this movie was the most thought and sensory invoking movie I've ever seen. No there aren't any quatrillion dollar special effects. The fear is much more cerebral. Anyone who has spent as much time as I have outdoors, knows how every breaking stick sounds like a gun shot, and every gust of wind sounds like an animal growl.If nothing else, the movie is brilliant as an experiment in human behavior. To watch how confusion, fear, hunger, exhaustion, and isolation will break a person down. during my days in the Army, I've spent weeks at a time in the jungles of Central America, and know what it's like to be lost and tired, and scarred. Try it some time.OK so the constant movement of the camera was a little much, but I never really noticed it much. If you go expecting a big James Cameron THX monster to pop out for a bunch of explosions, don't see it. Because you will be disappointed. That's why I say NOT for the MTV/Nintendo generation. There is no constant barage of light and sounds and explosions and music and CGI monsters and stuff to bombard the senses. You have to IMAGINE what it's like to hear something outside your tent at 4:00 in the morning.
If you want special effects go watch the next ready made block buster trillion dollar extraviganza. If you have an imagination, and would like to be genuinely scarred, see the Blair Witch Project. This is movie making stripped down to the basics. 8 out of 10 *'s",The Blair Witch Project

929,Prestige_Never_Pride,"Very Eerie, But Not Quite a Classic",7,10 November 2008,"This movie is overall very interesting. It would certainly fall into the horror genre, of course, but this is a different kind of horror movie. The story follows several college kids into Maryland's Black Hills Forest as they try to make a documentary about a Maryland witchcraft legend. However, the students ""go missing"", and their film footage is found a year later. Not a bad story line. The characters were very believable, considering that playing a movie like a true story isn't the easiest thing to do. The style of filming was, I think, what made the movie the most enjoyable. It was shot in the style of amateur-film-making, in that the quality was quite as sharp as ""real"" movies, and that the camera is bumped and shaken quite a bit. These factors made the story a little more believable, as horror movie plot lines are either believable or fake: there is no inbetween. I also love the absence of music throughout the movie, which added to the thrill. So, good characters, good concept, good style. That's what I can say about the movie that is positive.Now, what I can say about the movie that isn't so positive is the story in general (not to be confused with the plot line). It was very hard to follow overall. Ideas and characteristics that should have been explained better were very vague, and things that should have been clear were confusing. It wasn't a STRAIGHT ride all the way through the movie (movies rarely are), but it throws you off track instead. Basically, the beginning was good and well-defined, the middle was confusing and vague. The ending was about the best part of the movie. The instant the camera fell on that old, deserted, run-down house in the middle of the woods was definitely the high point. Then, it was an eerie, chilling roller- coaster ride to the very end, when Heather screams ""Josh!"", the camera falls to the ground, and all is silent. One really interesting thing about the plot is that you know the students died, but you don't know what killed them (yet it is, so people say, understood). It keeps viewers formulating their own ideas about what happened there, but it also leaves many very confused. Overall, good movie, good characters, good concept, but not too good of a buildup. Nice try, though. I would say that this is a movie for fans of ""traditional"" horror, suspense movies, and the supernatural. Or, if you happen to be bored on Halloween afternoon and are waiting for the ""slaughter"" movies to begin. Overall, not a bad horror film.7/10 bloody handprints.

There's a pile of pebbles outside my tent"", rather than screaming that you're all going to die and fumbling dramatically for a clean pair of underpants.

931,larma7,"Perhaps flawed, but still a masterpiece in horror and great filmmaking",9,10 July 2011,"Think of a time where you are sitting alone in the late hours of the night, preferably in an old house. You sit there quietly in the silent darkness before you start to hear unexplained creeks around the house, rustling of the tress in the wind outside, and all of a sudden, without any reason whatsoever, the tension inside you starts to build up, your mind at times causing your imagination to run wild. There is indeed a distinct level of creepiness that can occur being isolated in the quiet hours of night, and this is even amplified when outside, something which the characters of the ground-breaking horror film ""The Blair Witch Project"" have to face. And you face this creepiness, among other forms of terror, with them as you experience the film. Much has been made about the controversy of how people were literally duped into believing that these tapes were real footage, partially because the filmmakers apparently advertised it as being ""real."" It's also fairly understandable (although obviously unlikely under a critical light) to have possibly believed this because the production, despite the minuscule budget, is quite remarkable in how believable and convincing it is. Sure, the characters can be a bit obnoxious and heavy-handed at times, but the performances are very good. However, the main reason that the film works is that it takes a bit of an unconventional and refreshing approach in its attempt to scare its audience. ""The Blair Witch Project"" doesn't merely work on just realism to achieve its horror -- it is, in fact, most impressive in how it utilizes its setting to ultimate effect to create a subtly overbearing atmosphere that just continues to creep into the film.Part of the setting's effectiveness is that I deeply identify with the actual setting. Living in the United States and on the Pennsylvania/Maryland boundary line, I am extremely familiar with the type of woods the characters traverse. In fact, anyone who has lived in rural, forrest areas or who perhaps has experienced camping in the woods can probably relate. Additionally, I love films set in the wilderness, especially ones which heavily emphasize their environment in order to tell the story. This film is a perfect example. The cold and desolate nature of the forests help supplement the feeling of dread within the film. People have criticized this film as boring and that nothing happens. Ironically, a lot of the intrigue I find in the film is when supposedly nothing (visually) is happening. Visually, the film at times reaches the level of being entrancing. The endless shots staring into the woods -- staring into the darkness. What is heard, but what isn't seen. The silences. Yes, according to traditional narrative standards, barring a few encounters and events along the way, little to nothing (on the surface) actually happens. It's a film which works in tremendous restraint in showing very little, and instead allowing the audiences' own imagination to do the scaring. It's not horror that works on gore or masked murderers. It doesn't even work on being afraid of ghosts or monsters or the supernatural. It's the tremendous feeling of isolation and vulnerability in the cold, desolate forest. The feeling of being alone and lost and stalked. Consequently, because of the pseudo-documentary technique of telling the story (which some dismiss as being merely a gimmick), the film actually invites us to become more involved in the setting and immersed in the characters' immense frustration, panic, and terror in being lost, starving, and hunted. Not only is this despair felt psychologically within the conflict between the characters, but we also can share the characters' experiences just as they are. The film works on an interesting dynamic of putting the viewer as a central observer of the action, due to the filmmaking technique being used. Whenever the camera stares off into the distance, we stare with it. Whenever the characters become silent in order to listen, we listen with them. A brilliant sequence deep into the film has the characters stumble across these bizarre stick figures hanging from trees. On its own the images are quite eerie in the way they are photographed, but what makes the scene most disturbing is the characters' reaction to these stick figures. There isn't anything too inherently scary or disturbing about this scene if witnessed on its own. However, at this point of the film, the characters' and audience has already witnessed some creepy occurrences, and as an audience member you can connect with the feeling that the characters have of being lost and completely disoriented. So, furthermore, when the already growing insane characters' freak out over these relatively harmless stick figures, this allows the opportunity for the audience to become freaked out. After-all, sometimes there is nothing more unsettling then seeing other people freaked out. Here, the characters and audience feed off each other and experience things together. This is the ultimate goal of filmmaking, and it is achieved here so simply but at the same time so brilliantly. The scares are not created artificially, but come with context, and they are slowly built up through the setting, the atmosphere it creates, and the tension and emotions of the characters. The end result is at times intensely disturbing, exhausting, and mostly quite convincing.",The Blair Witch Project

This film takes the whole concept of movie making and rips its head off and craps down its neck. The ""artistic"" use of camera technique is just a way to say we know nothing about the rules of filming and have no concept of when it is applicable to ignore them.

Fear of being lost in the wilderness while being stalked by unseen enemies. Fear of the supernatural. Fear of old abandoned dwellings. This film deftly presses on these pressure points, and the result is a fairly frightening movie. The amateurish cast adds a bit of realism to the story, and is the reason for the big box office draw. The cadence of the story lacks consistency, but the last 5-10 minutes will have any but the most jaded horror fans on the end of their seats.

Let me tell you now; I'm a very squeamish and easily frightened viewer(I practically had a heart attack when a certain little girl crawled out of a certain TV-you know which movie I mean!) but this film did not have me diving behind the sofa cushions. Not even a little bit. It starts out good; the tension is there alright, but because it is set 'film documentary' style there is no atmospheric music to set the scene, which means any tension or atmosphere has to come from the actors. Maybe I'm missing the point, but a bunch of teenagers running around in pitch black woods whispering the 'f' word over and over-and yes folks, a good five minutes is spent where you can't see a darn thing and can only hear the sound effects as the kids drop the video camera and screech terrified obscenities to each other-doesn't really entertain me that much. Even then the volume had to be turned up ridiculously high just to hear what they were saying, then turned down again in disappointment as I realised I wasn't missing much. I found the scene where they emerge from their tents and practically have a hernia over some re-arranged twig formations more funny than ominous. Was anyone else willing the Blair Witch to pop out and say boo? Anything would have been less laughable than twig formations!! It is true that a good horror flick can entertain you not by what it shows, but by what it doesn't, but here is where the movie fails. Had the teens been stalked and chased down by an evil presence then it would have been frightening and entertaining, instead we have three college-age idiots lost in some woods and behaving like hysterical, well, college-age idiots. 'AHHH!! A re-arranged twig formation!!!' Please. Can you say 'low budget?' Give us viewers some credit! And I won't go into the disaster that was ending.

I have to add my vote to that with the further remark that there is little if no characterization in Blair Witch.  Not unless you like whining twenty-some-year-olds who adore using the ""f"" word a lot. 
About half way through, bored out of my mind, I not only was rooting for the witch, but feeling aggressive myself.  If there had been ""kill Heather"" or ""kill Josh"" buttons to push on my VCR, I would have punched them without an ounce of regret.The only good things going for Blair Witch is that it would be fairly creative for a high school class project (if it were one) and that it attempts to create suspense without all kinds of overblown special effects. Still, if the writers/directors/etc. had read an article or a book on how to create horror/suspense, they would have developed characters with which the audience could identify (I hate to think about who DOES identify with this bunch) and who have more of a personal stake in finding out about the legend of the witch.  If you're really curious, rent this for 99 cents like I did -- though you may still feel cheated.",The Blair Witch Project
939,halkyra,A movie that keeps going even after you leave..,4,18 July 1999,"It's hard to describe the disturbing feeling I had after leaving the Movie. The Blair Witch starts innocent enough but draws the audience into the story until you can share the terror with the main characters who are doomed from the start. Not a drop of blood or even a single glimpse of the witch, but its that, which is not shown which, is truly frightening. My parents couldn't take showers after Psycho now I could never go camping. The final moments of the movie will haunt you for a while. Don't go home alone. Trust me.",The Blair Witch Project
940,isaak-1,Evil Undefined,8,16 July 1999,Saw this film in the theatre today. Absolutely chilling. There is nothing to fear but what is in your head and that can be extremely disturbing. very original. The ending was stunning. highly recommended to all horror lovers.,The Blair Witch Project
941,Davo-CC,"Simplicty, brillance, effectiveness - a deadly combination",10,3 November 2003,"The Blair Witch Project is, in my humble opinion, a masterpiece of clever use of minimal resources, hype, selective leakage of information and superb disinformation that made a film that cost a pittance into a spectacular success.  It did this not by trying to defy its humble origins but indeed it played on them in the most effective way;  it used its amateur feel and low budget appearance to make it look all the more real and this was backed up by hyping people into believing that it was indeed real (at least for a time).Even when they realised that they had been `duped' so to speak they were intrigued (as was I) to find how this had been done to so many people so effectively.  The film came out very late in Australia (so we could cop the 2nd hand prints from the US) but I had purchased it on DVD from the US about two months before its theatrical release and had read a great deal about it and the hype surrounding it before even I saw it.It was intriguing to note the trickle of broken information that made it even here, others had heard this or that about this new film and many even believed it to be real - the thing was everyone wanted to see it very badly.Not everyone who saw it was effected by it - some didn't get it, some didn't like it, some weren't scared by it (one friend of mine borrowed the DVD and she watched it at midday with the lights all on and the windows open cuddled up with her border collie on the sofa;  she deliberately tried to minimise the scare impact, I tend to show it with all the lights off and around midnight!).Others had heard too much real information for the hype to have worked properly - but that's ok, I watched the film to see what they had tried to do and how they had tried to do it and I was enormously impressed by how someone took what they had and used simplicity and ingenuity to make something work so well.This is a film that is special in many ways, like Orson Wells' radio play of `War of the Worlds' and even Ghostwatch (1992) on the BBC, this film can lull the viewer into a sense of what they are seeing is real and even if you know it isn't in the proper environment it can still send chills down one's spine and leave the shattered illusions in their mind for days afterwards. It works on a minimalist approach not widely seen for a long time and they do it very very well;  indeed this was the first DVD I ever purchased and it is still one of my favourites.Not only is it a different type of horror film - it's a different type of film all together (from almost everything else I've seen) and in this day and age of repetition that's quite an achievement.It's a shame the sequel was just so bloody awful, it had none of the feeling or atmosphere of the original.",The Blair Witch Project
942,rsquires,Disappointed,5,1 August 1999,"Audience anticipation was high for this movie, and the ushers handed out barf-bags as (so they said) some 20 earlier viewers had thrown up from motion sickness.  For me and my brother though, this movie was pretty much a shoulder-shrugger.  I was simply not drawn into the action at all -- perhaps a teenage level of experience is required to identify with the characters -- and the camera movement had no effect on me, being an experienced 3D gamer. In any case, a yawner.rms rsquires@flash.net",The Blair Witch Project
943,Goose-30,How it was made is more interesting than the actual product.,4,5 August 1999,"This movie apparently lives up to the hype and scares the bejeebers out of some people. Personally, I wasn't impressed, and one kid in front of me got up after it was over and said ""it wasn't as good as I thought it'd be"" and all of his friends agreed. So be warned -- Your Mileage May Vary.I didn't find the characters sympathetic, and although believable, most of the time they were just plain annoying. If I had been with that group of people, I would've quietly slipped away and followed a river back to civilization and left them to wander around in circles and scream at each other like a bunch of idiots. The witch wants 'em? Great, she can keep 'em.However - the characters in this film are incidental to the overall concept, which is the real star of the show, and my central complaint. This isn't a great film - It's a great concept done in a mediocre way. Compare and contrast with, say, ""Silence of the Lambs"", which took a mediocre concept - a cannibal serial killer meets an attractive female FBI agent - and made it into something great. Most of what makes ""Lambs"" so effective is the character of Clarice, and how much we believe in her and like her.
These guys relied too heavily on their gimmick. The result is interesting and certainly worth seeing (it'll be better on video than in the theatre) but unfortunately, it's just not a great film.",The Blair Witch Project
944,randyk,Good try... but not quite.,7,22 July 1999,"I'll admit.  Horror movies are not my thing in general. Growing up I cut my teeth on H.P. Lovecraft and early Stephen King stories, and the terror those writers could induce far outweighed virtually everything I ever could see in a film.This movie was actually an excellent effort for first time film makers.  I think that the acting was well done, and the basic idea was good (others here have given examples showing it's hardly a new idea, however). This was hardly a terrifying movie, though. Creepy? Sure. Spooky? You bet. Good movie making? Perhaps. Out and out scary? Sorry.  I've spent a lot of time camping in some very out of the way places in the Appalachians, and I've seen some, to put it frankly, some ""whacked out s**t"" there.

The story idea is really great but the photography (video camera bouncing all over the place), the 'effects' and the acting (I was praying the Witch would get the woman just to shut her up) certainly leave something to be desired.

947,Headshot,Not As Original As It Sounds,2,17 July 1999,"Despite all the hype leading up to this film, I can't help but look forward to it.  Having been a producer of lots of low-budget television fare, and having worked on a LOT of public access shows, it always tickles me when someone manages to make something special on this kind of budget.Now, I haven't seen the film yet, but I'm looking forward to it.  My biggest gripe about the film so far, hype aside, is all the claims of this film not being like anything ever seen before.  This film was actually beaten to the punch by a remarkably similar, though less frightening film called, ""The Last Broadcast.""""Broadcast"" was originally shown in theaters nationwide in limited release in October, 1998...nearly a full year before ""Blair Witch"".  ""Broadcast"", too, dealt with amateur filmmakers working on a project in the woods who disappeared under ""mysterious"" circumstances, and was also shot on video as opposed to film.Where ""Blair Witch"" is a terrifying, horror mock-documentary, ""Broadcast's"" mock-documentary did not focus on mysterious sounds or shadows in the woods - it was more of an intriguing ""whodunnit"".  The fact that they are extremely similar may be due to simple fate and circumstance, but the fact remains that these two very similar films are separated by nearly a year, with ""Broadcast"" getting first blood.Which film is better?  I've seen ""Broadcast"", but the jury will still be out on ""Blair Witch"" until it comes out in wide release.  See both films for yourself, and you decide.  Until then, I'll keep waiting...and watching the shadows in the woods.",The Blair Witch Project
948,Headshot,"Suspenseful and scary, but hardly original",2,5 August 1999,"For those of you who went to see ""The Blair Witch Project"" and gasped in both horror and delight at how ""original"" it was...listen to this. 
I saw ""Blair Witch"", and thought that it was a fine bit of filmmaking.  It told it's story well, the performances were adequate, and the film was interesting visually.However.This film almost seems to rip it's plot element-for-element from another independent mock-documentary entitled, ""The Last Broadcast"" releasedlast year.  That story also involved a group of filmmakers who went out into the woods to shoot a documentary and were mysteriously murdered.  The film also made liberal use of ""documentary"" footage taken from video cameras to tell it's story.  The problem is that ""Last Broadcast"" was filmed and released nearly a full year before ""Blair Witch"".  In my opinion, ""Blair Witch"" is both a blatant rip-off of the same essential plot and construction used for ""Last Broadcast"", and that irks me.What irks me more is the fact that so many people have said over and over again just how ""original and inventive"" this film is.  I thought ""Blair Witch"" was merely adequate.  Where ""Last Broadcast"" was thoughtful and sneaky in it's approach, ""Blair Witch"" is loud and obvious.  I found many of the visuals used in ""Blair Witch"" to be remarkably similar to those used in ""Last Broadcast"", to the point where ""Blair Witch"" almost seems like a sequel or spin-off.In the end, there will be many copies of ""Blair Witch"" released by rival studios, trying to cash in on it's success.  But in my opinion, the producers of ""Blair Witch"" cheated.  ""Last Broadcast"" stands as my favorite between these two nearly identical films.",The Blair Witch Project
949,Headshot,I Still Know What the Blair Witch Did to Me Last Summer...,2,6 August 1999,"Okay.I've seen the hype.  I've seen the documentary on the Sci-Fi Channel.  I've seen the movie.  I've seen the movies that ""Blair Witch"" is either based on or similar to.  I've seen the reviews.  I've bitched about how similar it was to ""The Last Broadcast"".Now, the good things and a few more bitches.""Blair Witch"" was a creepy flick.  Heather Donahue did an EXCELLENT job. The lack of music score keeps you from becoming detached, and the fact it's on video leads you to fool yourself into thinking it's real (i.e. - film is fake, television is real).It was NOT an original movie, at least, not for an indie film or a public access project.  I've seen similar shows done on public access.  The producers of ""Blair Witch"" just used what they had to make a movie that would have required a MUCH larger budget otherwise.As a film, ""Blair Witch"" is adequate.  The only thing in this movie that made people queasy was motion sickness.  The movie starts off promisingly, moves along ploddingly, then lurches to a halt just when it's getting interesting. The ending, which is supposed to show us a hint of the terror that awaits our intrepid filmmakers, instead betrays the buildup the producers worked so hard to craft. I understand that it relates to something said earlier in the film, and that the ending is SUPPOSED to leave the fates of the characters to our imagination, but there's TOO much left to our imagination.  This film has no real conclusion, no real closure or satisfaction at the end.  Creepy? Maybe, maybe not.  I guess it depends on how easily frightened you are.  I found it to be obvious and unsatisfying.For those of you who say that the similarity between ""Blair Witch"" and ""The Last Broadcast"", a film nearly identical in it's story and motivation, is irrelevant and pointless...think again.  Most of what the critics who love this film have to say about ""Blair Witch"" is with regards to it's originality.  ""Last Broadcast"", whose tone is less eerie and more of a documentary, is superior in that it doesn't treat the viewer like a child. Small wonder that ""Blair Witch"" is so popular with the teen crowd.  Take away the claim that ""Blair Witch"" is an original idea, and you have a moderately scary supernatural suspense film.Check out ""Cannibal Holocaust"", ""The Last Broadcast"", and ""Man Bites Dog"" to see just how ""original"" this movie is.Don't get me wrong;  my last post notwithstanding, I thought that ""Blair Witch"" was just fine...but it was NOT original, it was NOT scary, and it was NOT worth the hour-and-a-half of my time, and the eight bucks I spent to see it.  If not for the hype on the Sci-Fi Channel, it would have gone straight to video.",The Blair Witch Project

And as I sat there, I found the movie enjoyable, somewhat suspenseful, interesting, but far from being the ""SCARIEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!"" That was, until the final scene. If you are paying attention to the movie, the final scene's resonnance is absolutely powerful. I made the mistake of going to the film, based on seeing ONE, I repeat ONE movie trailer, so I am not some cynnic jaded by the hype. My reaction was visceral. My body temperature dropped by a good 20 degrees and I was paranoid for a week. I believe that if people who dismiss the the film had watched it with an open mind, they would have found it as disturbing as those who enjoy the movie did. It is more a psychological time bomb than a film. I will be the first to admit that the film was not a constant terror-filled joy-ride through the darkness of our minds. But I could not imagine any other film that has finished with such a disturbing and thought provoking ending that treats the film-goer with the respect of not force-feeding everything to you.

I actually tried very hard to go to sleep during this movie just because I thought it might seem to be over a little faster. I absolutely did not buy in to the characters. I rooted for the witch, which to her credit never showed up in the film. Good move on her part. I wish I hadn't been there either.When they got to the map sequence, I actually wanted them all to die. I had absolutely no sympathy for these jerks. Yes, I know we are supposed to believe the ""witch"" caused all these things - loosing the map, walking in circles, etc. I just didn't buy it. What I did buy was a bunch of idiots went wandering around in the woods. There was no witch - these people were just too stupid to be allowed to live, and thankfully Darwinism kicked in before they polluted the gene pool further. I hope... I am absolutely serious when I say I was rooting for the witch, by the way, but she took too long.I was not scared at any point during this film. I was extremely irritated. I would have killed them myself. The only good thing about this movie is that it IS only 80 minutes long - which reduces the amount of time you have to endure. I have a good imagination, and like it when a talented director lets the action happen in my head as much as on the screen.

965,bakers4,Ultimate - almost like Val Lewton on steroids does Gen-X,10,18 June 2013,"Horror film has long faced a fork in its story-telling road, a choice of which way to go. Universal Studios went with fantasy as basis of horror, nightmarish monsters - visually striking makeup design and execution. Settings featured vaguely fictional European landscapes of a past century mostly, as imagined. At RKO, Val Lewton took the 'horror movie' idea into an opposite direction, with stories set in modern era, and often familiar non- fictional places (New York, etc). And as the source of fear and horror, the unseen - what might be lurking in shadows, things suggested without certainty, leaving doubt, room for the worst imaginings - namely, the stuff that scares us in real life.BLAIR WITCH would make Val Lewton smile. It offers no 'monster' or visual spectacle involving effects. Instead, fear emerges in a progression from the psychological to the supernatural, and with marvelous dramatic credibility. The film slowly builds intensity, and pulls it off with superb subtlety, from merest undercurrents of tension between characters who (in the scenario) are only just meeting, and with no prior acquaintance, team up to take on more than any of them are prepared for. Its pure story-telling, and brilliant as such. The 'script' (improv-based, I understand), actors and director deserve awards. If you've ever camped in woods, and heard the type sounds coming from various distances in the dark, you're well prepared for one level of scares in this film. But BLAIR WITCH hits its stride in a deepening progression of scare levels. It proceeds from frightening realities - (lost in the woods, a survival situation emerging) - to possibilities of harm to life and limb by human intent ('Deliverance'-style deep woods yokels suspected)) - to horror of supernatural scope and scale, undeniably evil and violent. Throughout the story arc, an air of doom gathers with increasing loss of control over circumstances the protagonists encounter, some just bad luck, others self-fostered. Indeed, the dysfunctional nature of peer relations and communication, is a foundation of everything that happens to our unfortunate principles. I've wondered if this ties in with the intensely negative reaction this film evokes for some - rightly puzzled at by various reviewers here more, shall we say - appreciative (or perceptive)? BLAIR WITCH panders to no pretensions, such as seem to preoccupy some tastes, and perhaps prejudice or constrain some reviews. BLAIR WITCH is a film with richness and many story aspects. But its not about whether its characters are suitably 'likeable' (as TV show film critics sometimes seem to expect), or proper 'role models' for any children in the audience, or ... etc. What this film does instead, is offer credible characters, whose tendencies we recognize from real life and don't necessarily admire. The movies is less about 'liking' its principals, than believing what we're seeing as shown and told. And instead of giving us cardboard 'good guys' or 'bad' it gives us people who seem very real, and for whom we're inclined to feel different things in turn. The film portrays its protagonists as neither reprehensible, nor charismatic, inviting us neither to love nor hate them - only to feel the terror they undergo, and without any distraction of 'not believable.' Indeed, there's a contagiously realistic emotional quality to Heather's loss of control when she screams, with neither her nor us knowing what it is she's facing. We don't have to know what's going on, to be scared by it - in fact, the greater the unknown factor, the more unleashed the imagination, the more bewildering the fear. This is an awesome movie for discriminating, mature, no-nonsense tastes in unique horror film approaches, to be savored and viewed over and again.Never before has the ""Lewton"" method - using shadows, the unseen, imagination taken past bounds of what's known, believed, imaginable, in context of things hinted at, power of suggestion etc. - been taken to such heights, and with such overwhelming effect. One of the greatest and most common weaknesses or failures of horror film, in general, is the lack of mental breakdown and stress that would probably occur in real life, if one were faced with some supernatural evil. Horror films most often dramatize only minimal psychological impact on their characters, after encounters with insurmountable horrors. Among BLAIR WITCH PROJECT's most admirable triumphs is its realistic depiction, and harnessing as an energy source driving story - of the toll taken upon the characters by the traumatic nature of the experience, as it unfolds, of their encounter with implacable horror. No spoiler to say they don't come back the same, I hope ... heh heh.",The Blair Witch Project

I knew I had seen Heather Donahue on the MTV Movie Awards, it wasn't just some look-a-like! Well I recommend this movie if you are looking for a scare!",The Blair Witch Project
967,falcolnpunch,If You Go Down To the Woods in the 90s...,8,21 January 2014,"The Blair Witch Project, the film that, more or less, created the Found Footage Horror sub-genre; paving the way for the likes of the Paranormal Activities, the RECs, and Cloverfield. But don't judge it on those (really quite average) movies, because The Blair Witch Project is extraordinarily terrifying. Even writing this now, reminiscing about the film is filling me with fear. It really is that scary.We join Heather, her friend Josh and Mike (hired because he can work a video camera) as they adventure in to the woods to find out more about the eponymous Blair Witch, aiming to make a cheap documentary type movie on the fairly blurred subject. As you can expect, things soon get creepy...Genre conventions pop up about the place from the off: unwitting teens, small town-folk, and so on, but it really just works as the characters (keeping their real life names as in Found Footage tradition) bicker and gradually break down from fear.And there's a lot of darkness. As the kids sit within their tent, in a hope that the creepy noises outside won't get them, we, the audience, are forced to watch a blank screen, just listening to growls outside and the scared banter inside. Just like Paranormal Activity, something the makers of that film quite right jumped on, your eyes dart around this screen, literally looking at nothing, as you wait, petrified, for something to jump out at you.And that's exactly where the film quite rightly collects its haters. Not full of conventional scares, you're supposed to believe in the characters' fears, their terror of what COULD be out there. You're tasked with believing in the possible evil out there, as opposed to bluntly throwing it at you. Yes, there are bits here and there, visible to us which are horrifying, but the real fear? Our fantastic imagination. Today, almost 15 years on, The Blair Witch Project may well be devalued by its less scary descendants (avoid Apollo 18 at all costs), and perhaps with repeat viewings it could easily become tame. But if today's Found Footage movies are Blair Witch's children, then TBWP is their far smarter, pitch black and, most importantly, scarier dad.Watch it with the lights off.Twitter: @JonnyJonJon1",The Blair Witch Project
968,arsonistheway,Gimicky,1,5 August 2014,"Let me sum up the whole movie for you. Some kids go into the woods to shoot a documentary and they die. That is the whole movie. Now just because a movie has this plot does not mean it will be bad because most horror movies have fairly simplistic plots and I like good horror movies. I will get this out of the way right now, I am 15 and if you are going to be the d*ck head who will not take my review seriously simply based on my age just go away. First of all, this movie is not nearly as ""innovative"" as so many people say. Cannibal Holocaust, The Texas Chainsaw massacre, and every film from the Dogme '95 movement used this sort of camera work to give the films a realistic feel. The real brilliance came from the marketing campaign because at the time of the film's release many people believed that this was an actual documentary and IMDb even said that the actors were dead, so many moviegoers were obviously scared even before they went to the theaters. The main problem is actually that this feels too much like a realistic paranormal documentary because this means we don't get to know very much about the characters, so now that we know these aren't real people we don't have much reason to care about them. Finally my biggest gripe is that nothing happens. There are no scares until the end and the only build up we get are a few interesting (yes, I said something positive) interviews with the people of the town this takes place in, so we have very little reason to suspect that the Blair Witch is real. I realize that this was scary back in the day with all of the build up and I don't want to destroy your good memories or viewing experience if the effect still remains with you. I just want to explain that in all honesty this movie has aged poorly and is on my sh*t list.",The Blair Witch Project
969,alfiemachin,"Creepy,Eerie,Terrifying and Original",8,5 November 2016,"The Blair witch Project is a new,experimental and in my personal opinion successfully executed film. It delves into the unexplored world of simplicity and complete hand-held camera shots which is very undermined by most horrors which rely heavily on dramatic music and unnecessary jump scares to force viewers admitting they were scared by at least one scene in the movie. The Blair witch Project has no jump scares. No intense and over the top music. No ridiculous CGI monsters or ghosts. And no fancy camera quality. The film scares you to bone with a terrifying story line without even revealing the witch cursing the forest, Clever uses of environment, noises and lighting. But the most scariest thing about this film is that it can very much be mistaken as potentially real due to its theme of basic raw footage filmed from the character's perspective. Besides a few scenes in which acting is poorly executed, the movie easily scared me with its amazing build up and simple yet effective use of paranormal activity occurring around the characters particularly at night. I find it easily understandable as to why some people may find this as a bad way of creating a movie. But if your'e searching for something new and different from every other horror out there this is certainly an option.",The Blair Witch Project
970,liamsroberts,Keeps you on the edge of your seat!,8,26 October 2017,"Blair Witch Project is about 3 people, Heather, Josh and Mike, documenting on the ""Blair Witch"" a tale well known by the town of Burkittsville. This film was the start of the Found Footage Horror movie genre. They use the found footage technique to try to make the movie more real and in this movie it is used very effectively. Once they first see the weird rock piles I was at the edge of my seat. This in my opinion is horror, it captures the fear of getting lost and knowing that something is watching you at all times. The scariest part of the movie is not knowing what is out there. You never see what is scaring them, you only hear noises and see the characters reactions and it adds more realism to the movie. But the last 5-10 minutes of the movie are terrifying. Once the words ""There's a house"" were said, stuff was gonna go down. Throughout the movie Josh goes missing and Heather and Mike start to go looking for him. They start hearing his voice from an abandoned house and they decide to enter, at night. Mike heads to the bottom floor and finds Josh getting killed by something (off camera) and his camera cuts off. Then it switches to Heather's camera and she heads downstairs. She then sees Mike facing the corner of the room not moving at all. Then Heather's camera is knocked over facing the floor and it ends. The reason Mike was facing the wall was that before they headed into the woods, they were talking to some town locals about the ""Blair Witch"" and one of the people said that the when someone sees the witch killing someone, they get put in a corner facing away and then after they get killed. That's what happened to Mike. He saw Josh getting killed so he got put in a corner. And Heather then saw Mike getting killed and so on. I don't think this movie is one of the best or one or over hyped. The camera quality hasn't dated that well in today's time and the films that came after this kind of make you disrespect this movie a little bit. It's really fun horror movie that is fun to watch with a group of friends.",The Blair Witch Project
971,hillalbens,A masterpiece. The whole movie is as you would've found it if they truly went missing,10,2 August 2019,"A masterpiece, to put it simply, and one of the most influential and iconic horror movies of all time. It's a disturbing film without any violence or any monsters.The naturalism of the actors is unrivaled. It's impossible to overstate how compelling each performance is. Our main character is a joy to behold in every scene, with the perfect tone and expression to accompany every word of dialog. Every minute she wasn't in frame speaking into the camera was a minute I wished she were. I could not imagine a better performance.The recurring sense of ""dread"" as each night falls, and the slow escalation of the threat, followed by the sudden release of tension at dawn, puts the viewer through an ordeal that you share with the characters. The film perfectly captures the feeling of being lost in the woods. The panic, the anxiety, and how easy it is to get turned around. On one of the final nights as the sun is setting, you can hear the desperation in Heather's voice as they know what's coming and are powerless to stop it.There couldn't have been a better ending. It's the stuff you don't see that makes this film so scary. Your own imagination is always more terrifying than anything on screen.The movie had perfect timing and excellent marketing. Came out when the internet was still the Wild Wild West. It was pretty difficult to prove or disprove anything quickly and search engines were still pretty primitive. The studio took advantage of this and as a result the movie had a lot of buildup. I dont' think anyone will ever be able to recreate that type of marketing again. If you tried that today you would have blog posts, articles, videos, tweets, tearing every aspect apart.",The Blair Witch Project
972,RWR,The success of Blair Witch demonstrates the power of media hype.,3,7 August 1999,"The success of The Blair Witch Project demonstrates the power of media hype.  These three verbally-challenged student filmmakers are among the least interesting film characters of the year.  Their quest for the Blair Witch lacks thrills or terror, largely because of the lack of exposition on the subject.  The nausea-inducing camera work is sophomoric and finally boring. I was ready to leave after the first half hour and had to fight to stay awake to the end of the film.  I wish I had taken thetime I wasted on this film to see Eyes Wide Shut for the fourth time.",The Blair Witch Project
973,manos,One benefit from this movie,1,27 October 1999,"The only thing I can truly be thankful for is, perhaps, the horror genre will finally move away from the hack & slash gore which has flooded the silver screen for the past 30 years with pale imitators of the original ""Night of the Living Dead"". As for ""The Blair Witch Project"" itself, the film is two-dimensional in both character and plot.  I couldn't help but to keep looking at my watch everytime a series of whiny exchanges between the three main characters kept repeating ad nauseam. Unfortunately, the public at large seldom allows themselves the opportunity to view older movies for the first time.  If you would like to see far superior films to ""The Blair Witch Project"", I would suggest you rent the original ""The Haunting"" from 1963 >""Curse of the Demon"" from 1957, ""Five Million Years to Earth"" from 1968, and ""Freaks"" from 1932. It's interesting to note that ""Freaks"" was originally panned by the critics and by the public as being depraved yet it is now regarded as a horror classic which was way ahead of its time. I would encourage you to pick up any of the above mentioned videos when you rent ""The Blair Witch Project"" for Halloween.  If you even get the slightest chill from viewing ""The Blair Witch Project"" you'll break out in goosebumps while seeing any of the older and far superior videos.",The Blair Witch Project

The worst part is having to sit there for 45 minutes waiting for something to happen while the main characters run around screeching at each other like insane twits.  I must admit I probably would have found it more realistic had the movie taken place in a location where it is actually possible to stay lost for more than two or three days like, say, Montana or Colorado, but Burkettesville, Maryland?

And as exit polls are indicating, a lot of us are really disappointed (60 percent of the 600 polled who said they ""couldn't wait to see movie,"" ended up giving the film a C, and those who were just accompanying their friends, and who, presumably, had no strong interest in the film, gave it an F).

What scares me about this movie is that there are people who think it is so good. Most of them seem to be critics. I certainly do not know anyone who has seen this movie who liked it. Of the eight people in the theater when I went in, three left before the end. I wish I had been so smart. In short, the movie was dull. Nothing happened. Three kids get lost and drop their cameras. The end. The concept was good. Nothing else was. Terrible script. Terrible camera work. Terrible lighting. Terrible actors. The best thing that could happen to the entire crew on this film is to be lost in the woods and never return.

983,Grifter84,Most frightening concept ever,10,24 June 1999,"Since I was a little boy (not so long ago, now that I think about it), I have always been afraid of being in the woods at night and this movie has managed to squashed any chance of me ever overcoming that phobia. It has accomplished the amazing feat of conveying the terrible essence of one of humanity's basest, most primitive and most overwhelming emotions: pure unadulterated terror. The makers of this film understand perfectly that what we can't see is a thousand times more petrifying than what we see acted out in front of us. While we may be a bit shocked by a shot of Jason slashing up a girl at a summer camp, it is only the fear of the unknown that can truly terrify a man. The human imagination will always be able to think of something more frightening than what can ever be shown on a movie screen, no matter how much gore is piled on. Give credit to the writer and director who have created what is undoubtedly one of the most original films of the decade, and most likely the scariest film that anyone will ever want to tremble through.I beg of you, do not see this movie unprepared. DO NOT BRING YOUNG CHILDREN TO THIS MOVIE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON GOING ON A CAMPING TRIP! I cannot emphasise enough that I am still having nightmares from this movie. Watch at you own risk.",The Blair Witch Project
984,zorchmag,"Pretty scary, but...",8,12 September 1999,"I went into this movie not knowing any of the (apparently quite extensive) backstory, or having been exposed to much of the (also apparently quite extensive) hype. The only reason I went was that my best friend who, unlike myself, actually enjoys horror movies, dragged me. I dislike horror movies; I do not enjoy being scared at all.That said, I found the film's execution to be extremely effective. It scared me a lot more than gallons of blood and incessant computer-generated special effects could have. The reason is that it had very little overt shock material. Instead, it built up a creepy atmosphere and let the audience' imagination fill in the blanks. The fact that it was filmed in a quasi-realistic manner, without any discernible production values, made willing suspension of disbelief that much easier. There was no soundtrack to remind you ""hey, this is a movie."" There were no special effects. The footage was not a perfect, obviously studio-polished product. It was essentially a 90-minute campfire ghost story.In short, I suspect that anyone with a functioning imagination will be frightened by this movie. Anyone who approaches it from a purely passive standpoint (""I'm not going to think at all while I watch this."") will not be scared, because the movie never actually shows anything scary; it just prods you into frightening yourself, which in the end is far more effective than if it had ended with some Lovecraftian horror popping out and devouring Our Heroes. There will always be someone out there who says ""Hmm... I always pictured Cthulhu as being more of a purplish colour."" However, by avoiding any direct encounter with the monster, no one is disappointed. Their imagination will come up with something that is frightening to them, without having to worry about what the filmmakers thought would look/sound/act scary.",The Blair Witch Project

Trashy because the camera work was worse than amateur it was appalling. Dull because the hack performances of the cast made me wince with embarrassment. The close up of our heroine desperately trying to squeeze out a tear as she farewells her family was painful. I was bored from the start of this collection of blurred, shaky, out of focus, unrelated and technically ghastly images.

I admit that it's (the idea behind the film) kind of creative, but since the movie wanted to ""simulate"" (this is NOT a true story by the way, I believe) what happened out there, the unprofessional shooting (camera moving so quickly and lots of temporarily black out) almost made this movie unwatchable. It was like you want to read a good written, creative novel (story) only to find that the font printed in this novel is SO SMALL and fuzzy that made the whole novel unreadable..I won't recommend this movie to anyone.

When you are in such a scary situation and knew that you were totally lost in a forrest (in real life), how could you still so calm to continue shooting the film?? ha, it's really a joke!!I really regret that I spent my money to see this movie, one of the worst movie that I ever saw in a theater and in years. :(",The Blair Witch Project

The Blair Witch Project is not a film for selfish people who just want to sit there and see a lot of special effects and people dying to feel terror, This is a totally empathic film, you have to get on the shoes of Heather, Mike and Josh to know what they're feeling, to feel the horror of the situation. Its a movie of everyones deepest fears, its about what terrify us, its about getting inside the Blair forest and share the desperation with Heather, Mike and Josh.  And let me tell you if you're willing to get inside this movie you will be scared as hell!!!.  The camera work it's essential to make you feel like you're watching your own video, something that could happen to you.  It's not about if the story is real or not, that has no importance couse The Blair Witch Project is not scary because of what you know, but of what you dont know, what you dont see, what you feel but can't explain. The witch is as real as our fears, and that's the greatness of the story.  I consider myself a horror films fan and I can say I have seen a lot of them, and believe me as I got deeper on the plot of the Blair Witch Project I started to feel this creepy feeling on the bottom of my stomach, that we horror fans love to feel but can't feel  to often. As I said before this is not a movie for everyone couse it's not a movie to see from the outside but from the inside, and believe me if you get inside it, this is truly one of the must terrifying films ever made!!

989,sorrow,Comments to potential viewers and disappointed viewers,10,9 August 1999,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of the best movies to come along this year for many reasons. It features some of the best acting that I have seen in a long time, is shot creatively, and presents thoroughly believable characters in a story that is character driven. Plus, this film manages to truly get under the skin, providing a creepy and tense emotional experience.Now here are some things that this movie does NOT offer:Unnecessary state-of-the-art special effectsScripted dialogues (neither the kind that are too stale and poorly written to be believable nor the kind that are too well-crafted or clever to seem real)Verbal masturbation by actors (i.e. - overacting, show-off acting, or any kind of acting not necessary to successfully portray a character)Cheap-thrillsGratuitous sexGratuitous violenceCardboard characters in a pre-packaged plot deviceHappy endings with ""closure""Spoon-fed entertainment with no thought or feeling
Unfortunately, the above list is what the average movie viewer wants, and when a film comes along that doesn't give them any such gratification, they tend to get lost.When one watches this movie or ANY movie for that fact, one should try to experience the film. Be there with the characters. That means no talking to your neighbor, no asking aloud what just happened (as if someone else _knows_ the answer), and no stepping outside of the film to sit safely in your chair. Concentrate on the events unfolding before you and give yourself over to what is precious about art: an emotional experience.If you let yourself go with this film, it _will_ work its magic on you.Does that mean you will jump out of your seat or get spooked?Doubtfully, though some people may. Most likely you will not have that kind of reaction - that is the fun roller-coaster kind of fear that audiences have come to expect from entertainment. This film is about real fear - the kind of disturbing emotional experience that comes from watching three individuals slowly transform into hysterical animals afraid of being trapped in a situation that is beyond their control.Why does it work? Not because of the fear of what's not on the screen, as many reviewers like to say. No, it works because - when you let yourself go with the film - the actors don't seem like actors performing for your entertainment; they seem like real individuals grappling with a horrifying situation.Anyone who gripes about why the filmmakers continue to film or why they do this or that is just actively trying to fault the film or isn't paying attention. Such a person is on some level resisting the experience of allowing himself to go with a very real and creepy film. The film explains that Heather is a film junkie who films everything compulsively. There are plenty of people who do this on trips. In addition, the film reveals that documenting everything is Heather's way of coping with a horrible situation.At several moments when it may seem silly to the third-party viewer that the cameras are still rolling, one must bare in mind that just because the camera is on doesn't mean that the cameraman is actively filming the events. The operator could have simply forgotten about the camera.Think about it: if you were filming something and were suddenly scared half-to-death, you wouldn't stop and turn the camera off; you would simply run, and that's exactly what happens in this film in many cases.At other times, the filmmakers continue filming in order to hold on to some sense of order in the chaos that has engulfed their reality. They are clinging desperately to one of the last remnants of the normal and modern world from which they have been separated by the increasingly menacing woods.""The Blair Witch Project"" is an intelligent and inventive film that demonstrates what filmmaking is all about: an emotional experience. When a viewer goes in merely expecting something safe and entertaining, he will be sorely disappointed by ""The Blair Witch Project"". Such a case is sad, for the viewer who allows himself to go with this film will experience a truly disturbing and rewarding piece of art.",The Blair Witch Project
990,g-man-22,The Scariest Movie in over a Decade,10,25 May 1999,"Some movies stick with you, difficult to shake for days, weeks, months afterwards.  ""BW"" is one of those films.  Directed by Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myrick (a swell couple'a guys, from the mere moments I had to chat with them prior to screening the film) in a pseudo-documentary style that's unlike anything you've ever seen, this is the easily the scariest film I've ever seen in a movie theater. ""Aliens"" and ""Jaws"" remain my two fave fright films (as well as Craven's original ""Nightmare""), but having not screened any of those in their original theater releases, I felt something after seeing ""BW"" akin to what audiences must've felt upon exiting the theater back in the 70's following Friedkin's ""Exorcist.""  The acting is top notch, save one argument scene by a river, and kudos in particular for Heather Donahue.  This film is most effective if you grew up in the midwest/east coast and remember those ""tell me a scary story"" campfire tales.  The film evokes an uncannily primal sense of fear through sparse visual trickery (none, really, which amounts to more style than any horror movie of the past decade, oddly enough).  Despite some spots that might be considered draggy or slow to some, this was a pleasant surprise, given the overhyped nature of other indie genre fare (""PI,"" ""Cube"") and anyone with a degree of patience will be immediately sucked in the moment the 3 characters enter the dense Maryland woods to unlock the secrets of the fabled Blair Witch.  Myrick and Sanchez are so good at scaring their audience with the most basic and rudimentary of aural/visual devices it's shocking nobody's thought of this sooner.  When the final credits rolled after the numbing final scene, the hair on the back of my neck literally stood up and I felt a twinge at the base of my spine that still hasn't worked itself out.

It's a thinking man's film...so is Blair Witch Project, the best Indy horror film of the 90's...oh and to those who think Evil Dead was the greatest thing since sliced bread...think again, it's just a bad ripoff of the Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, with alot more gore....gore isn't scary...a thinking movie is...Kudos to everyone involved with the Blair Witch Project...You guys took me back to when horror movies WERE scary!",The Blair Witch Project

I passionately hated it!Not that it was a bad film - maybe I just don't like horror films. But since we know going in that the three college filmmakers are doomed, it plays out more like a tragedy. Or a nightmare, especially towards the end as the lost & hungry & (supernaturally?) threatened students get what you knew was coming to them. (At least with Titanic we knew some people survived!)It wasn't really scary for me. More like relentlessly depressing, with a very disturbing ending. If you can get off on that, you'll like it. The premise is definitely inventive, and I thought they pulled it off well enough.

Especially the freaked out, albeit abrupt, ending. You actaully find yourself getting wrapped up in what these characters are going through. This movie does what every good movie should do, it entertains thoroughly and leaves the viewer wanting more. Not to mention it will scare the pants off of you!

998,Chasuk,Vastly Over-rated,1,17 October 2000,"I've loved horror films ever since I was a little boy.  I adored anything which starred Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Vincent Price, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Basil Rathbone, Lon Chaney or Lon Chaney Jr., or any of the other horror greats from my childhood.  I later loved Dark Shadows, Night Gallery, and Alfred Hitchcock.  I've never enjoyed ""splatter"" films, although I consider the first Halloween to be a minor masterpiece.However, I've seen only two films in my lifetime which actually scared me, and those were The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T., and the Seven Faces of Dr. Lao. I don't know why they frightened my little-boy self, but they did.Blair Witch was so unhorrifying that I thought at first that those who expressed fright were pulling my leg.  I didn't need to be told that it was a fake; apart from the fact that the F.B.I. would have confiscated the film, and the murders would have been famous, the public outcry of a filmed murder would have been as enormous as if a snuff film had been released.  That, and the fact that there are no witches, and never have been (the claims of wiccans and neo-pagans aside), totally devalues the film.Remember that Dracula and Frankenstein were fictions that were presented as such, so the standards of judging them are different.Okay, I'll confess that I found Jaws equally boring.  No, I'm not jaded, but Blair Witch never once induced the willing suspension of disbelief necessary for a horror film (or any other) to work.All in all, the biggest cinematic let-down I have ever experienced.",The Blair Witch Project
999,Chasuk,Most Over-hyped Movie I've Ever Seen,1,16 February 2001,"I've seen worse movies, but not many.  Yes, I like horror films.  Yes, I can distinguish cheap, sensationalistic splatter-horror from from the more chilling, show-less-and-frighten-more variety (and I prefer the latter to the former).I still hated Blair Witch.  I don't lack imagination, but this movie certainly did.  I've seen Tampax commercials that filled me with greater fear.  The film lacked wit, style, story, plot, suspense, or verve.  I don't need expensive cinematography or stellar acting, but a film does need something to redeem itself (other than a sophomoric, if marginally clever, idea), and this film did not have it.It is unfortunate that a bad movie has come to represent to many the epitome of independent cinema.  For a real horror masterpiece, see Ringu (The Ring), which, though it was probably filmed on a larger budget, worked because of talented direction and great storyline.",The Blair Witch Project
1000,eshy76,Nice and spooky,7,28 January 2000,"This was a very worthwhile movie, very different to the 'Scream' generation horror flicks. Instead of 'in your face' scares every two minutes, we were treated to a delicious psychological build up of unease, culminating in that wonderfully 'open to interpretation' ending. I agree that the main characters are sometimes 'stupid', but maybe that was because they're human? It's not the best horror film by any means, but a very notable addition to the genre. That it cost practically nothing to make goes to show that you don't need a $200 million budget to win at the box office....just a good idea and good execution.....(although a massive publicity campaign can help I suppose)....don't go and see it expecting to be scared every two seconds, go and be 'nicely' disturbed for 80 mins or so...",The Blair Witch Project

I know a lot of people hate this movie (and I mean a lot), but those people are just very close-minded.  You can't go into it thinking you're gonna see some witch chasing people around.  It's not like SCREAM or HALLOWEEN.  It's all in your mind.  And that's what makes it so scary!  You have to finish the story with your own mind.  Did they die?  What happened to them?

This helps to give the feeling that you are seeing the actual film the students took with them on their project. Unfortunately, it made friends get headaches and even slight bouts of travel sickness.However, their are many positive points about the movie. The acting is superb and the terror and horror of the situation can be felt throughout by the viewer, mostly without violence.Although I did not enjoy watching this movie very much, it is worthwhile watching; even to only hear about the legend of the Blair Witch.

1003,Dries Gevaert,This will psychologically kill you.,9,20 July 2000,"Whow. Most horror movies don't scare me, mostly because you just get scared for one moment (like when someone's walking into a dark hallway and the killer jumps in front of him), and because those movies are very often just one big cliché. But this really scared the s**t out of me. This is not jumping in front of someone and stabbing him, this is psychologically killing someone. Here's how you do that: First, scare the victims with some weird voodoo stuff they'd rather don't want to have anything to do with. Then torture them by taking away something they really need, their sleep for example, scare them so hard they live the whole day in fear of the night. And ultimately, literally scare them to death by letting them now there's no escape. They'll surely gonna go totally insane, and maybe they might kill themselves. If they don't you'll do it.`Finally an original concept in a movie, I haven't seen that for a long time. It's too bad that the geniuses who came up with this idea didn't get a bigger budget... Actually, it isn't, because being suck a low budget movie adds to the realism of this movie (it's supposed to be found footage so it's gotta be crappy). There's no other way of making this movie. It's great, and I think it's too bad that some people can't see that. They'll probably walk into the theater or the video store think they're gonna be amused (that's what most people think after 3 Screams, 2 Last Summers and dozens of other copies). But this is the type of movie that is made to crawl under your skin and eat you slowly from the inside out.Another thing that those people probably didn't like is that you don't know half the story. EVERY Hollywood movie has a complete story with a beginning, an ending and stuff happening in the middle, and the viewer sees everything. This movie is in fact not a movie, as the makers try to tell you that it's just a bunch of found footage put together. And of course the camera's not always running, so there's no continuous story. Which leaves you with some big holes to fill after the movie. One solution is the website that caused the hype when the movie was in theaters and which made me go hire the movie. But it doesn't answer all of your questions, in fact it just adds to the mystery of the whole thing.Acting. That would be nice in this movie, some people who could put down a credible personage (not someone famous, that would be real stupid, someone who is unknown and took acting classes). I think Heather is about the only one who really made me think that this was real (and that is what the movie is about, right?). Josh and Mikey overact most of the time. I noticed that if you watch the actors closely the movie seems less scary, probably because you see that they're just acting.The atmosphere created by the people who made this (actors, editors, directors, marketing guys and webmasters) is great, it crawls under your skin and makes the movie scare the hell out of you. That atmosphere is what made this 100,000 $ movie a million dollar blockbuster. Since there was no directing at all (the directors just sent the actors in the woods with their equipment and the script), s****y acting in some scenes, some dumb things in the story (map, runaway) and an empty feeling at the end, I rate this movie a 9/10",The Blair Witch Project

1008,richferrara,Zzzzzzzzz...,1,26 July 2001,"Okay.  So we've got these three film-school kids -- Heather Donahue as Heather, Josh Leonard as Josh, and Mike Williams as ... um ... oh yeah, Mike.  They go off into the woods to film a documentary about the Blair Witch (and if you haven't spent hours browsing the BWP website, you have absolutely no idea who the Blair Witch is or why anybody would be interested in her).  Instead, they get lost.  They wander around.  They wander around some more.  They scream, yell, and curse at each other.  They act like idiots.And, of course, they KEEP FILMING through all this, as I'm sure any three smart people would, because we all know that filming yourself getting lost is far more important than getting back to civilization.Eventually some weird stuff happens.  We don't know exactly what because nobody bothers to tell us.  Is it scary?  Well, I was kind of afraid that the herky-jerky camera motion would make me vomit in the theater, but other than that the film that TV promos called the ""scariest movie since The Exorcist"" didn't have one scary moment.I've heard it said that the filmmakers wanted to scare us by purposely not showing us everything.  Fine, but even if you don't show everything, you still have to show enough.  Take the movie ""Seven"".  You don't see the actual murders committed by John Doe, but by showing you the bodies and murder scenes, the director forces you to imagine their brutality.  ""Blair Witch"" doesn't give you any clue what's going on.  The only thing I was led to imagine during this movie was how else I could have spent 80 minutes.",The Blair Witch Project
1009,JetBanana,"With the right frame of mind, this is a truly horrifying film.",8,29 November 2007,"*Not quite sure if what i wrote about the ending could be considered a spoiler but i thought i should warn you anyways*I have to be totally honest, I have never really been scared by a movie ever in my life. I was sick of all these cheap horror flicks coming out that just have dark and ""creepy"" atmosphere, but nothing more than a few jumps that really try to scare you. But The Blair Witch Project, although very contemporary, may have been the most frightening movie i have ever seen. I mean this one truly scared me. Granted I'm already kind of afraid of the woods, but the concept and realism of the film really puts a fear into you as if you're living the experience with them. The key to watching and enjoying this movie is to make sure you're keeping an open mind and taking it for what it is. The film is trying to portray ""footage of three filmmakers who went missing in the woods"" and if you can imagine yourself being the one to find this footage, it can really scare you. Now keep in mind that this definitely is not your typical movie in the sense that there is no traditional introduction of characters, plot basis, and there is not much of a resolution. Although the ending does leave you with a certain uncertaincy that would not make the end as terrifying as it is if you had seen what they had seen. The sheer mystery surrounding the final moments of the rolling camera are what leaves you with the fear still dwelling inside and the idea of dread they must have felt. This is a movie that almost demands your participation in the sense that you need to be living the situation with the characters to get the full effect. So please don't sit there waiting to get scared the whole time, because if you're going to sit there and try to take it all in, it's not going to happen. So be attentive and don't expect to be at the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie; the movie is very real to life in that it's like day to day bickering of three filmmakers and their experience with the myth they are pursuing.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",The Blair Witch Project

1014,I_am_RenegadeX,Can't believe this only has a 6 right now!,7,23 January 2006,"TBWP is on TV right now as I type this, hence my curiosity to visit the IMDb to see what rating this film had. WOW.. shock, surprise.. it's only got a 6 star rating?! The votes obviously are largely skewed by the stupid sheep who believed the film was 'real' and bought into the marketing hype, then felt ripped off, and angry at the marketing hype around it once they realized that this was a mock-umentary.Take it for what it is.At the time (1999), it was somewhat unique in being entirely shot with a hand-held camera. While some people may the camera shaking, going out of focus and such annoying, it all adds to the 'realness' of the concept that you as a viewer are meant to be buying into. It's not fair to take away ratings points based on 'poor production quality', 'not many special effects', 'no big-name actors', or the way in which the film was marketed.Instead, the story is intriguing, and while it has its moments of 'less interesting' dialog, generally for much of the 84-minute running time, you are kept on the edge of your seat, or perhaps for some, hiding behind it! The premise of the film is simple, and so not much really happens (""it's about these kids who get lost in a scary forest"" - true), but that's exactly why TBWP works. The film didn't need to be complicated, and it isn't - all it needed was a few 'setbacks' or 'issues' for the kids come across, and the film delivers.On the downside, I do recall feeling at the time of my first viewing that the film was possibly too short, if anything. There are instances where you might say to yourself (or to others watching with you) ""they can't be that stupid, can they?"" -- but hey, the world is full of stupid people - and hey, not everyone goes to scouts and learns what you can do to help you get your bearings if you get lost in the woods..I gave the film a 7 out of 10, though I wish IMDb allowed 1/2-pts as I feel a 7.5 is where this film is at.

1015,pperot1-386-365016,"One of the GREATEST horror movies, EVER.",10,6 August 2021,"Maybe one of the greatest movies period, BWP is a cinematic masterpiece, easily in my top 10. If you have even the slightest bit of imagination, ignore the haters. 90 percent of those people were looking for your conventional horror movie: bs jump scares, gratuitous gore, and everything spelled out for them so they don't get the brain pain. I don't think that every indie film is great (far from it really). And I don't think a movie should get kudos just because it is original. But THIS indie film, and THIS original idea is just about perfect.I would consider myself a huge horror movie fan, and I've seen A LOT. But few movies, if any, have legitimately terrified me like this one. I'm a grown man and I get chills when I think of Josh's agonizing cries distantly in the forest, the bundle of sticks with his teeth in them, and most of all Mike standing in the corner. Hell, even the piles of rocks surrounding their tent when they wake up is creepy. And THAT'S one of the reasons why this movie is so great. All the people saying ""where the hell was the witch?????"" are missing the point of this psychological gem. A witch and concrete answers would have ruined this; the beauty is in the ambiguity. YOU decide what happened. The movie gives you exactly the right amount of tools to do so.If you still think this movie is lame, at least try your hardest to put yourself in their shoes. Just imagine being lost for days in alleged haunted woods. If that happened to you, that alone would be scary as hell. But then increasingly weird and unexplainable stuff keeps happening as you decend deeper and deeper into madness. The acting is actually terrific! Ok, I can see people getting annoyed at the high pitched irritating girl, and the up-nose crying shot is easily parodied. But everything they did was GENUINE. Hell, I'm not even that big of a fan of found footage movies, but this one actually almost makes you forget it's a movie.Screw the marketing campaign and faux documentaries. Screw the legacy and impact on horror movies BWP has had, starting a new sub-genre. Having such an impact makes it imprortant, but not necessarily good.

However, as all you horror heads out there know, you put yourself through this to discover that 5% of gold that gets released so rarely.The Blair Witch Project is a very welcome addition to that 5%. An ingenious idea well executed has produced one of the scariest experiences this 30 something year old has endured. Thanks to this film I am now officially scared of the dark and not ashamed to admit it.The uneasiness began to creep in when the locals were telling their tales of the Blair Witch legend, particularly the crazy old lady with her ""fur"" story. The documentary style was maintained with absolute perfection and hats off to the film makers for showing discipline and sticking to their original idea throughout.The woods are beautifully eerie, the soundtrack of indecipherable sounds, events that keep getting stranger and more terrifying as the film rolls on and the growing sense of desperation and hopelessness finally brings us to the perfect climax set in that run down house that is the stuff of my nightmares.I truly don't believe I'll ever be able to re-create the real terror I felt at the first viewing of this film and now I'm doomed to walk the earth fruitlessly trying for the rest of my days.",The Blair Witch Project

1021,filmdescriptions,I'm Glad I Never Get To See The Witch,6,15 March 2017,"I really like how this movie starts. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez did a good job with the realization of characters. Then providing us this absence of horror, adding some ""heyyahs"" in there. The town folk all seem out of there minds, circus-like, and seem to all know important facts about the ""The Blair Witch Project."" One guys says that a lot of people say the woods are ""all haunted,"" then takes it back and says there not. The part about the camera and how it works was a great add on. I like how they are all friends, too.   I'm just picturing these students getting together and saying, ""you guys want to go to the woods and make a really cool film."" The way this film starts out really makes the film fun and interesting. I know I already said that, but it does. It has a very simple compositional-style and flow too. Everyone is lost in this film, unfortunately, and cannot be found. - Because they were lost before, and now they decided to make a documentary about a WITCH.  Think of the joy of being in a really cool film, lol. Hell, I would have liked to do this project with them. And, I like how the light in this film bounces off things such as, the suns rays. Heather has a good voice for the main narrator of the project. Her take is, ""I don't know"" when asked if the witch exists. She is like the facilitator of a stupidity. The map adds a great conflict piece, a disappointment. I mean could this film be better? could it be set in a mental asylum? Myrick and Sanchez decide to add some good ideas in this film, like the rock piles, her puppy dog beanie, colors of the tent. You sense the discomfort of the actors. They should've brought some broccoli along. These people are film students, but did their teacher assign them to this group, or do these people randomly know each other? Do we actually get to see them light a fire? Just like we don't actually see what Heather sees. The film draws good comparisons to insanity vs. feeling fatigued in the woods, all while disorientation is setting in. Heather says that ""movies are all she has left."" So, we wonder what happened to her art before? We are not sure what is wrapped in the bundle wrapped with Josh's necklace. So the film end when Heather is knocked out by something we never get to see. We know that two cameras must have been recovered. Great found footage type film.",The Blair Witch Project
1022,PhillyBen,Great premise & great ending; otherwise flawed,7,4 November 2005,"I liked the Blair Witch Project, but I didn't love it. What I *did* love was the Blair Witch website that accompanied this film's release and also the mock-documentary that aired on the Sci Fi channel. If you read the website thoroughly and see the mock-documentary and THEN you watch the movie, it all adds up to a thoroughly frightening experience. Unfortunately, those extras were necessary because the movie itself left out a lot of crucial information vital to ""getting"" the full import of the story and imagery.Still, the film did tap into (and probably fed) the growing fascination with ""reality"" TV and films, and it used the trick on which camp ghost stories have always relied. It's really scary to be trapped in a place where something scary was REALLY supposed to have happened. Since most of us go into the woods at some point we can imagine how terrified the movie's kids must have been, and we can feel some of that terror ourselves if we think about the allegedly ""real"" imagery when we're out in the woods.One final note: the ""reality""-based scare tactic wasn't even all that original. In 1992 the BBC aired a mock documentary called ""Ghostwatch"" that pretended to be real, live-broadcast investigative journalism. Its shocking ending so terrified the television audience that it elicited hundreds of phone calls and was never aired again. THAT was a real landmark moment in mass media, right up there with Orson Welles' radio broadcast of ""War of the Worlds.""",The Blair Witch Project
1023,altheas-35492,Loved This Film Style,8,26 October 2017,I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It was very suspenseful and I liked that if was filmed so simply. It was first person and you really felt what the characters were feeling. The way he camera moved made you feel more a connection to the film and it almost felt like you were there with them. In my opinion this film was a suspense film. I don't consider it a horror movie because you never see any thing gory or demons or monsters. At the beginning of the movie a man explains how the Blair Witch kills people; she takes two people into the basement. She makes one person face the wall while she kills the other one and then she kills the next one. She didn't like to feel there eyes on her as she killed. When Heather walked into the basement she was knocked down and the camera was focused on Kevin standing in the corner. This suggests that Mike was being killed or had been killed and Mike was next. Presumably Heather would have had to have stood in the corner next and would have been killed after Josh was killed. This movie was one of my explains movies filmed in this style. I liked the way it made you feel connected to the characters and it made it more real and intense. After the filming ends I assume that Heather and Kevin would be killed. I'm very happy I watched this movie and hope to see the second on soon.,The Blair Witch Project
1024,jayboutilier,this crap at it's worst,1,5 December 2005,"I watched this the day me a few friends decided to go camping in the woods. i guess they thought it would scare me. no, honestly it bored me. i have and always will hate documentaries that want to be something that it will never amount to be. Horror movie? no, mock documentary about people with way too much time on their hands... yes OK, i admit, they didn't have much to work with, my suggestion is that if you don't have the money to make it then don't. they could have made something a little bit better, anything but this useless and moronic piece of boredom. it was original which is a plus, but it never goes anywhere with that except weird formations on the ground. don't waste your time on the sequel either, it may have a bigger budget, but it also has a huge cheese factor and the whole ""this movie makes no sense"" syndrome. if you want to watch a truly scary movie about camping then i suggest, Wrong Turn. it may not be exactly about camping but it does take place in the woods and it actually is very intense, something this movie lacks.",The Blair Witch Project
1025,tomferlito,The people rating this 10 have to be trolls,3,4 October 2020,"I had been meaning to watch this since it came out and I finally did - I was very disappointed. Yes, there is some minor suspense in what is not shown, but the vast majority of the film is populated with mundane scenes. The main character is annoying and practically unbearable at times which further added to the hassle of sitting through to the end. There is also hardly anything to it beyond the description - you can safely skip this movie without missing anything. Maybe it was groundbreaking in its day but I have trouble believing that too. Please look elsewhere for your Halloween selection.",The Blair Witch Project
1026,gorgeous_blackman,ending,7,18 August 2006,"This film needed a more climactic ending. When the kids first get to the house, I thought, ""nice touch."" But nothing that happens in the house is freakier or really much worse than what was happening before (except that the characters finally get killed, presumably). Say what you want about horror movies being freakier when you ""don't see"" the horror in question (although I would argue this is a formula invented in old horror movies by very artistic directors that does not work well in every situation)--but SOMETHING more needed to happen here--another person/thing in the house who we never FULLY see, for instance. Even a bit more of an extended shot of whatever had happened to Mike would have made this better.",The Blair Witch Project
1027,JonL-2,The scariest film I have ever seen,10,1 May 1999,"Literally. Any sense of humor melts away after the first 20 minutes of this film. The perspective of viewing the ""footage"" as if I was there makes for sheer nail-biting suspense. I was gripping the seat. My friend who attended was clutching his chest. The morning after I felt like I'd had a nightmare. Can my sanity stand to see it again?",The Blair Witch Project
1028,HarryC13,"The Witching Hour (well, 87 minutes)",9,20 August 1999,"I used to review books and movies professionally, so I hope my comments will add a few fresh perspectives.  First, let me say that it's obvious that this is not the kind of movie that everyone will like.  People biased against seeing horror films won't; people who want technical perfection in the filmmaking process won't; people who want an airtight and tightly wound plot won't.  And I agree that the film has its problems - lots of gratuitous profanity, a tendency to drag about two-thirds through, and some plot points that aren't entirely clear.  For example, I didn't tie in how some of the residents' brief comments in the beginning affected the movie's ending (and various other events).  But they do impact it.  Maybe I just need to be hit over the head, but I didn't get it the first time around.All that said:  I love `The Blair Witch Project.'  Took me two viewings to really appreciate it.  The first time, I found it fascinating  and the second time, I found it scary, especially when I `got' the ending. Scariest movie ever?  No.  But for a combination of scary and interestingly done, it scores big points.Unlike some reviewers, I found the acting very realistic.  Some of the negative reviews I've read cite problems:  The actors wouldn't have done this or that, usually.  One reviewer said student filmmakers are very savvy these days, and the filming wouldn't have been that rough around the edges. He said this totally spoiled the movie for him.  Lighten up  all fiction, and especially horror fiction, requires suspension of disbelief.  And horror films are notorious for having plot holes, unlikely things happening, and people going where they shouldn't.  In fact, in a lot of horror flicks, if people acted realistically there would be no plot!  And obviously fake studio-lot trees and dry-ice `fog' certainly didn't keep `The Wolf Man' from being a horror classic, at least not for me.I also disagree that finding out how the film was made or that it isn't a true story make it a lesser experience.  Sure didn't for me.   And I'm glad to see some other comments here that tell me I'm not the only one with the `hangover' effect  it ran across my mind for days after I saw it.  By the nature of its filming, Blair Witch gets a little vague in its plot sometimes, but it more than makes up for this with its freshness and genuine thrills.I also appreciate the intricate Internet and TV framework of mythology  what negative reviewers call `hype' -- that's been built up around the movie.  I think it's a stroke of genius.There's talk of a sequel.  Personally, I'd like to see a `prequel' built around the Blair Witch mythology created on the film's home page and in the Sci-Fi special, `Curse of the Blair Witch.'All in all, I'd rate this right up there with `The Exorcist' and the original version of `The Haunting' as the best of the post-1960 horror films.  Although each has its own special brand of horror, each keeps its place well secured in my memory.  As to those who are disappointed that they didn't `see the witch' or needed some presence to scare them, blame modern horror cinema for spoiling them with special effects and gore.  Those who don't like the film for these reasons would never `get' a classic ghost story.",The Blair Witch Project
1029,HarryC13,The Blair Witch Mystique: Fiction Well Done,9,26 August 1999,"Such a mystique surrounds ""The Blair Witch Project.""  I don't know why so many people are so hung up on the movie being ""real.""  So what if it's fiction?  It's well-done fiction.  It didn't take away from ""The Fly"" for me to know that giant mutant flies don't really exist ... nor did it take away from ""The Howling"" to know that werewolves don't exist.  Why all the squawking about this being truth rather than fiction?I think the fact that it's filmed with relatively primitive equipment, and in a ""realistic"" manner, contributes to some people's refusal to believe it's fabrication.  Also, while the Internet has hyped many a movie, ""Blair Witch"" makes more extensive use of this medium (and adds the ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" special on Sci-Fi.)  So some of the more gullible of us, thinking anything we read or see on TV must be true, believe it.I personally think it's somewhat frightening that we confuse the carefully done websites and the Sci-Fi special -- which dispense mythology specifically created to heighten the Blair Witch experience -- with factual news reporting.  Get a grip, people.  The websites and the special are absolutely BRILLIANT from the standpoint of adding to the feeling of realism surrounding the movie.Let's just recognize ""The Blair Witch Project"" for the groundbreaking, interesting, and scary movie it is.  That's sure enough for me!",The Blair Witch Project
1030,Novelty,Avoid at all cost!,1,3 March 2000,"Oh, my. I wasn't overly enthusiastic when I saw the trailer for this one, and I avoided it at the theaters. I'm glad I did, because it was absolutely appalling! I was really in the mood for a chill when I began watching BWP, but I soon started yawning. And there was no turning point, it just got worse and worse!  First of all, what's the point with this movie? To scare, would be the only possible answer (apart from making dollars). Well, I wasn't the least scared more than a few moments. The rest of the time was just a plain bore, and the climax of the movie is actually a big anticlimax. What about the script? Was there one, or was everything made up as they shot the movie? The lines were certainly not believable, and the actors didn't add anything to their roles. No soundtrack deepened the atmosphere, and the visuals were uninspiring; how many minutes of the movie were completely dark? Actually, I can't find one good thing to say about BWP, and that doesn't happen to me often. Even the Critters are more scary. This is a dull, tedious and unimaginative movie that should be avoided at all cost.",The Blair Witch Project

1034,Chris-369,Frightening.,9,15 September 1999,"What can be said about this film? If you are looking for instant scares (i.e. Scream, IKWYDLS) then this film is not for you.The clever aspect of this movie is that it is not overly scary as you actually watch it.  It is after the film has ended and you think back over what you have witnessed when it has its full effect.  The Blair Witch Project may well have you scared to get up in the night for weeks.The best way to describe this film would be to say that it does not offer you any relief from you fear.In the majority of horror or scary films,the viewer sucks their breath in and curses at the stupid person who is cautiously going up the stairs to investigate the scary noise that came from up there moments ago.  The viewer then breathes a sigh of relief when it is discovered that it was simple a cat knocking over a vase. TBWP does not offer you the chance to breathe that sigh of relief, you are simply left on edge because whatever is making the noise is left anonymous.The idea of leaving so many questions unanswered is genius.Look at it this way - when you wake up in the middle of the night and hear a strange noise you get scared, however you are relieved when you realise that it is simply your parents going to bed or the central heating going off. TBWP does not resolve your fear, you are left wondering what the noise was. To summarise; the noises you hear in the night are always more frightening that whatever is actually making them.",The Blair Witch Project
1035,Bingo84,Overhyped piece of garbage,1,26 September 1999,"This film has got to be one of the worst movies I've seen all year.  It is not the worst, though.  I hold that honor to the god-awful ""Baby Geniuses"".Anyway, the film was not the least bit scary (unless you are scared by piles of little rocks and the sounds of sticks being hit together).  I can't believe I sat through the whole movie.  I just kept thinking, 'o.k. it's gotta get better because of all the great reviews, especially the one that read 'Scary as Hell!.'   Alas, it wasn't.  What a waste.There are much better films that scare you that you never get to see the 'evil entity', so I don't buy the argument that says I have no imagination since I never saw the witch.  ""Evil Dead"" is still the best 'Horror in the Woods' movie and that film never showed the entity either.   And it was a million times scarier than this piece of overhyped trash. 
But the filmmakers made millions, so I guess their happy and my opinion doesn't mean squat, since they already got my 8 bucks.  I'm just gonna be more careful before I give any pseudo filmmakers my money again.  These guys don't need a class in marketing, but they do need a class in film making.",The Blair Witch Project
1036,Jackmaster,incredible. i've never been this scared during a movie,9,1 August 1999,"To anyone who plans on seeing this astounding movie: this film WILL stick with you. Particularly the ending. Consider yourself forewarned. It's been over 24 hours since I got out of the theater, and the final images are still burned indelibly into my memory. This was easily the most shiver-inducing, all-out frightening movie I've ever seen. There are no jump-out-of-your-seat scares, no shots of a slimy, ugly alien or any other cheap scare tactics: all that exists while this film runs is FEAR, nauseating, jaw-clenching, stoop-down-in-your-seat fear. I went in to the theater afraid that the film had been overhyped, that I wouldn't like it as much as I hoped I would, and, after about 20 minutes or a half hour, I thought that my worries were coming true. Then I realized that I was hoping, really hoping, that the scene wouldn't shift to night again. That's when I realized just how afraid I really was. The big reason that this film is so frightening is it's realism. In most movies you have to make an attempt to identify with the characters; in TBWP you have no choice. You become basically the fourth person,  and that prospect is what is truly scary: ""What if that was me up there?"" I shudder to think about it even now. I'm not even going to get started on the last 5-10 minutes of the film; I'll just leave it at the fact that I have never been as scared in a theater as I was at TBWP's conclusion. And I slept with the light on afterward. This is a brilliant, brilliant film.",The Blair Witch Project

1039,Ianfidel,Definitely worth seeing---but.....,8,25 July 1999,"While I really enjoyed watching The Blair Witch Project, the experience would have been far better in an empty theatre. To become completely absorbed in the events on screen, there really needs to be utter silence in the theatre.  Unfortunately, crowds in Baltimore haven't totally mastered the art of staying quiet during a film.  That said, Blair Witch works much better if you take the events onscreen as factual.  Actually, even knowing that it is fictional does not detract from the experience too much, but it's certainly far more frightening if taken as reality.  In some sense, the movie reminded me of Michael Powell's masterpiece Peeping Tom, made in the early sixties.  Both films were far more frightening in a psychologically realistic way than in a gore/shock way.  Blair Witch seemed as much a consideration of how we view films as an out and out horror film. It's quite short, and upon the fairly abrupt ending (which was perfectly fine by me), many people in the theatre said quite loudly, ""That's IT?!?"" Granted, it's impossible to escape idiots in society, but I would still highly recommend the film, only in a far more empty (or mature) theatre than the one in which I saw it.",The Blair Witch Project

1041,stumpf,Go and see it anyway,6,3 November 1999,"In my humble opinion this movie suffers in two respects because a) there's too much hype and b) to what film genre do you assign it?Forget about the hype and ask yourself a simple question.  Do you want to spend a few pounds/dollars watching a film probably unlike anything else you've seen? Be advised that it's not an ""in your face"" film.  Be advised that, like my wife, you may be physically sick during/after watching it (simply due to the ""authentic"" but shaky filming).It does not conform to the current label of horror.  Not one of your slash, cut, blood, spurt models.  Its not ghost or monster film either.It's a psychological journey with a twist.  The twist being ""we're pretty sure that ghost and ghouls don't exist and there's an explanation for everything........ well almost everything"".In commenting on this film most people have concentrated on the ""horror"" element.  Equally thought provoking for me is the degeneration of the characters who are unable to cross the short but elusive bridge back to civilisation.As an avid and regular cinema goer what pleased me is that it isn't another Hollywood jukebox film.  You know what I'm mean!  What do I fancy tonight? Action?  Then choose option A1, A2, A3 or A4.  Comedy?

Blair Witch will really give you the creeps, not just the ""loud noise out of nowhere"" rule, it will get you thinking.

This is a very well made, well acted, enjoyable movie that gets even better after you have a few hours to think and talk about it.I was quite pleasantly surprised at the very genuine humor that is evident throughout the first part of the film.  Then as the tone darkened and things began to go wrong, the movie kept me quite focused and frightened until the last scene (which was, by the way, PERFECTLY done).I really think that Blair Witch will do for the woods what Jaws did for the beach and Psycho did for seedy roadside motels and showers.  And I as I told my husband, I am NOT going camping any time soon.  Especially not anywhere near Maryland. grin",The Blair Witch Project
1044,Trans-2,"Objective, comprehensive review of The Blair Witch Project",8,8 August 1999,"Let me start by saying I've seen this movie twice and read at least one hundred user reviews to give me a perspective through other people's eyes. Quickly put, the idea of this movie is a low budget film where the three actors portray student film makers which also substitute as the camerapersons, while the two writer-directors are off eating lunch at Chi-Chi's (its a tough life).  The dialog was all improvised with no real script, except for the two writer-directors leaving general instructions in film canisters at strategic locations in the woods.  The acting was very good, although I don't know if you would call it ""acting"" per se (where everything is predetermined) as opposed to ""guided improvised method acting"" where the actors were more or less living the movie as it was happening (for instance, the writer-directors deliberately diminished their food supplies and made the scary noises at night, for the sake of realism).  For those who were distressed by the lack of a plot, consider that if you ever get lost in the woods, you will probably not have a plot either.I can see how people would view the acting as either fake or authentic; sometimes the characters seemed to be considerably more horrified of things than they should've been; however, the actual *manner* in which they acted horrified was quite authentic.  This is most true of Heather, the narrator and main protagonist of the film.  I believe the trick to enjoying this movie is to either A) believe the movie really happened, B) believe it is a mockumentary but see the acting as totally believable, or C) believe it is a mockumentary and forgive over-reactions when they occur.  If you fall into categories A or B, you're off to a running start.  If on the other hand you are a C person, to fully appreciate this movie you must willingly suspend your disbelief when Heather over-reacts, and assume that there was something really scary there instead of something not so scary.  I believe this flaw could've been corrected by using, say, blood splattered on the trees or something else which would've more strongly implied imminent violence without actually portraying it; however this would have forsaken the movie's ""no-gore"" concept.  The first time I watched it, I fell into the B category, but the second time I watched it I leaned towards C.  Nevertheless, the movie had even more of an effect on me the second time around.  Without my realizing it, my heart was pounding at the end, and that night my mind was irrationally convinced that the coat-hanger next to my bedroom door was a floating witch guarding the only exit so that I would not be able to escape. This movie flicked a switch somewhere in the back of my mind, convincing me despite my best rational efforts that evil things lurked in the dark recesses of my home.Another thing that might put unsuspecting viewers off is its differences in production values and approach to horror.  The most obvious are the ones afflicting all low budget movies: no money means unpolished lighting and camera work, cheap sets or costumes, no effects, etc.  One main difference I was pleased with is no score.  We had no music to take us by the hand and tell us when to feel what for who; our reactions to the events were thus more natural, a refreshing change.  The acting was improvised in a mostly relaxed manner, so we were spared the often- excessive melodrama of Hollywood-type productions.  The approach to horror was that of gradually increasing creepiness that gets under your skin, as opposed to ""Look!! I'm a scary monster!!"" and blood-and-guts scares.Heather bears the most responsibility and delivers the most dialog, sometimes becoming overly talkative as she tries to fill in all silences with narrative commentary.  I was also mildly annoyed at her occasional screech- screaming, but it was realistic and I would've been annoyed if I was there too.  There is also one scene where I really, really, really wanted to hand her a Kleenex.  As for comments about the level of swearing; I'm absolutely sure that neither of the three actors were even aware of their language until prudes pointed it out, since swearing profusely (especially in tense situations) is only natural for people this age.All in all, I was quite pleased.  I have heard that there are other similar indie productions (Cannibal Holocaust, The Last Broadcast, etc) that were made before this one, which are probably quite envious of this movie's success (this movie as it turns out is making thousands of times its cost in profit).  Despite its qualities and successes, I hope there are no sequels or prequels.  There is speculation as to if it will ignite a ""new"" style of horror film making.  PS: After reading all those other reviews, I have started to wonder... why is it that the entire theater always either ""laughs at the whole movie"" or ""come out scared sh**less"".",The Blair Witch Project
1045,RJL-3,Don't Read the Reviews,7,4 August 1999,To much hype.  Maybe if I wasn't aware that this was a fictional production or maybe if I ever really got lost in the woods I would have reacted differently.

Definitely do a matinee - you don't want these kids getting so rich they do a sequel.,The Blair Witch Project
1046,Lucian-4,"Creepy, funny, and different.",10,19 August 1999,"I don't know what the people who hated this movie were expecting.  I realize that it was over-hyped and all, but I just relaxed and went into an extremely crowded theater and enjoyed the movie.  I was absolutely drawn to the characters.  They reminded me of situations where I had been in close proximity with friends or acquaintances and we had gotten on each other's nerves.  It was totally believable and really hilarious the way though fought with each other.  I'll admit that sometimes, in the parts that were supposed to be scary, I started to giggle because the things they were saying were so funny.  But I thought that the filmmakers and actors did a fantastic job of creating a building sense of dread throughout the movie. There wasn't much of a plot, but there didn't need to be.  As a person who makes art and does a lot of writing, I know sometimes you want to tell a story and sometimes you just want to create a feeling.  The point of this movie was to get you acquainted with the characters and make you feel their emotions.  It wasn't the scariest thing in the world, but for what it accomplished, I can't fault it at all.  If you want gore or spooky special effects, there are plenty of options.  This movie offers something different.  I am so glad to see younger people do something so good and be financially rewarded for it.  And the last shot absolutely creeped me out.",The Blair Witch Project

If you are looking for originality, realism, or a truly gripping story line then go see 'The Blair Witch Project.'  This movie is completely different then any movie I have seen that was made in the past three decades.  The way that the movie allowed me to understand the characters, and understand that they were not very unlike myself allowed myself to pulled deep into the story as it developed in front of me.  I didn't realize how much I was into the movie until it started to build so much that I found my heart pounding even when nothing was currently happening.  It was like being on a train that was speeding up and there was nowhere I could go.

1048,whiskeyj,Next to 'Summer of Sam'... the worst movie of the Summer,1,2 August 1999,"The only thing frightening about this movie is I paid good money to see it. Let me sum it all up for you.  Three fools go out into the woods to find some evidence of the Blair Witch.  After a couple of days and nights they determine they are lost and cannot find their way out of the woods.  These three losers couldn't find their way out of a paper bag with both ends of it opened.  There was nothing in this supposed real footage to lead a rational mind to believe there was anything strange or unexplained going on out there in the woods. That three people could wander off into the woods, get lost, place the blame on each other, and begin seeing things which weren't there (nothing showed up on the film) is believable enough.  I believe what really happened is these three shot the video and film and left the video and film in the woods where an accomplice could find it.  Then playing on the old Blair Witch stories and their own staged disappearance (remember no one was able to find any trace of them, their camping gear or cameras) the video and film were sold to the movie makers and at last count this  no budget movie had made over $30M!",The Blair Witch Project

1050,Vegas-6,Still Shaking...,7,1 August 1999,"I've read some of the negative reviews for this film, and I can't believe they even exist. This is an incredible movie, perhaps the only movie to ever really /scare/ me. I'm a programmer by trade, and it is thus quite easy for me to dissociate myself from characters in a movie. I can look up there and see the characters of your average movie as fake. They appear to me as mere collections of pixels, slapped together on a piece of celluloid and displayed for my amusement. It was not this way with the Blair Witch Project. I saw this movie about 3 hours ago and I'm still scared senseless. I'm still shaking just a bit. I drank a couple shots of bourbon just to try to calm down. Nothing works. This movie is *that* scary. I don't know if it was faked or not, but if it was then I must say that it is a masterpiece. The characters are so afraid and their emotions are so real that even the most jaded among us can't help but empathize with them. And that, really, is the true power of this movie. It's not scary in the way that someone jumping from behind a door and saying 'BOO!' is scary. It's more the kind of scary you feel when you walk down a dark hallway and feel like someone is following you. Or the fear you feel while walking through an unfamiliar alley on a dark, cold night. It is primal fear, a fear which can't be shaken. A fear which is bred into you for your survival. That is the fear that this movie brings out in you. And that, good people, is one of the hardest fears to shake.",The Blair Witch Project

1052,Harry-115,"Outstanding indie, but doesn't live up to the hype...",6,5 August 1999,"This is a very good indie feature. It accomplishes what Hollywood is having a hard time doing (producing a genuinely creepy movie), and because it's making tens of millions, it will be analyzed to death, and elements from it will be recycled for years to come.Basically, the movie uses numerous means to manipulate the audience into feeling major anxiety - not the least of which is the jerky handi-cam shooting which can cause mild motion sickness. Once we're physically distressed, it's easier to work on our minds with the creepy bump-in-the-night psych. Very cool.Now, it's fine for an indie to be a one-trick pony, but this is not what I expect for seven bucks, so I hope the majors are taking notes (Spoilers ahead):More character development. Dump the stereotypical teenage arguing, high pitched whining and constant swearing - please! I'm not offended by language, but it gets old.Giving the audience credit for imagination is the best way to get scares, but hey, throw us a visual bone... a blur, a shadow, a distortion, a bush rustling, SOMETHING.The end was shocking in its abruptness, but I wouldn't have changed that. I do agree with a previous poster that there should have been wrapup... ""stock"" news footage of the house, and reporters interviewing people after the cameras and films were found (like in the newer TV trailers). The ending credits hit most of us in the face like a bucket of cold water, and there were groans all around in a theatre filled with teens and twenty-somethings.",The Blair Witch Project
1053,tippy-6,"Scary, only if you let it...",8,11 November 1999,"I have decided, after talking to several people about this film (I think of it more as a ""film"" than a movie), that there are basically two opinions: either ""It scared the hell out of me"" or ""I thought it was totally stupid."" I like to think that I enjoy engrossing myself in movies (er, films, I mean), so I happen to hold the former opinion.In trying to decide why this clear duality of opinions exists, I came to the conclusion that you have to let the movie scare you; you have to put yourself in the tent with these three, you have to imagine what it would be like to be totally lost in the woods with all sorts of creepy stuff happening around you. I think that those who didn't get scared by the movie either couldn't do that, for lack of imagination, or their subconscious wouldn't let them, as some sort of defense mechanism. I did notice that the older the person I talked to, the more likely they were to think it was stupid.And I'll be honest, for the first hour or so, I thought it was kind of dumb myself. I thought, rolling my eyes, that I was watching MTV's ""The Real World Goes Camping"", but my eyes stopped rolling when the noises at night began. I didn't even admit that I was scared by the movie until I was at home that night in a dark house, jumping at every little noise. When my cat knocked something off a shelf, I nearly had a heart attack...That's when I admitted to myself that this movie (or film, whatever) really scared me, and I truly enjoy being scared for the sake of entertainment. I definitely give it my recommendation, and I think you will be scared too, but only if you allow yourself to be scared by it.",The Blair Witch Project

Where should we start?  First, let's talk about the fact that they are in the woods forever and have unlimited battery power.   Or how about the fact that they manage to run with a tiny eyepiece on their eye through the woods. How about the fact that they seem to pick up every sound on their equipment and shoot oodles on a 16 mm camera (which takes huge spools of film for just 10 minutes worth of time).

I was expecting it the be a whole heapin' lot scarier than it actually was. At the time.As the months have gone by the intensity of the film has gnawed itself indelibly into my brain. Images and sounds around me constantly remind me of it - birds in trees, babies crying in echoing shopping centres, conversations on crackly mobile phones, playing Silent Hill on the playstation. And its all down to 5 minutes of film culminating in that terrifying final shot - that blurred, out of focus (nearly out of frame) image still sends shivers down my back.

There's nothing worse than a let down ending for a horror movie.There were moments in the movie where I thought it was going to go somewhere really terrifying; but in the end, it turns up that it's more like a haunted house, a little startling and scary while your experiencing it, but nothing to think about after it's over.The movie has a certain edge to it that is brought on by the manner of filming, and the looseness with the scripting, but those same points were also points of weakness at times.

Certainly there were imperfections, and at some points I couldn't help adding my own mst3k type comments, but considering the lack of money spent, I was very impressed by the amount of creep for the buck.

I thought it was awful, the worst movie ever made. I stumbled across the reviews on here one day, and, as usual, was just amazed at how many people claimed this was ""the scariest movie ever"". But, before putting in my two cents, I decided to give the film one last try. I watched it yet a third time, and my thoughts upon viewing it this one last time made me give it a rating of 5 - much higher than I'd planned.On some levels, The Blair Witch Project does work. There really are a few genuine moments where you sit back and think what-the-heck-is-going-on? Unfortunately, these moments are very few and far between, and interrupted by long sequences of painful boredom in which the three characters walk around and fight and talk about farting and kick maps into lakes and cause me, the viewer, painful boredom. And there are also a couple of moments of true hilarity, particularly the moment when Micheal tells his companions he kicked their map into the lake. I know that isn't supposed to be a comedic moment, but the acting is so bad that it comes across as just really, really funny.The film has some strong sequences. One being Heather's apology speech - you know the one I'm talking about. This comes across as very genuine and real. And of course, the ending was kinda nifty.So, all in all, The Blair Witch Project is worth a look. But it's definitely not the scariest movie ever.

I have seen it twice now, and I got more scared watching ""Junior"" with Schwarzenegger than I did watching ""The Blair Witch Project"". The biggest issue I have with this film is one I have with many sub-par horror flicks; the characters act totally irrational and stupid, and as the movie went on, I started cheering for whatever was hunting the characters. I felt no sympathy for them, and frankly could not wait for them to be punished for their stupidity. Examples: A) One of the characters purposely throws away their map. B) When they realize something is hunting them, they still continue log around all their equipment, in stead of discarding everything except the bare essentials in order to be able to move faster. C) The characters are scared out of their mind and they come to a house in ruins with strange figures outside it. In stead of bypassing it, they f_ucking go in. (At this point I not only wanted the thing to kill them, I wanted Jack Bauer to jump in and torture them first!) D) The whole time they are being hunted they never put down the camera. I know that the point-of-view thing is the whole concept of the movie, but it is just so unrealistic that a person in fear of his life will continue to film, in stead of picking up something to defend himself with.

In particular, I appreciate the film makers allowing the central enigma of the movie to remain intact. Peter Weir's in ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" makes a similar choice. It takes strength of character and confidence to make this kind of choice. It speaks reams about their potential.Already a thing of talk among independent filmfolk long before it hit theaters, BWP had poked itself into my consciousness a year or so ago. The buzz. The buzz! A website before it was a film. The website, itself, less a billboard than a computer game. The lore: Really cheaply made -- 60 grand, 25 grand, 10 grand! for crineoutloud -- the whole thing improved in the woods in eight wet and stinky days; they gave a trio of actors a couple of cameras and a DAT, led them on a scavenger hunt for clues, left sketchy notes and mind-screwed the cast into near-real fear and panic and late night woodland snipe-hunts. It was all so hip, so coolly generated, so clever. Forget that it had been done before. Forget ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" and others...this one had integrity and a kind of kick-ass honesty about it. Just following all the material about the film before it opened, you just knew that -- if successful -- it was going to be one of those demiurge filmevents that redefined the business and would spawn a thousand mini-urges flailing for a ride.The buzz and hype! And it's all true. There it is: kind of lovely and clever. It HAS integrity. You like those three people. You buy their weaknesses and still you like them because they're weak like you are weak. They're jerks, but still you like them because they're jerks like all of us.The actors are good, the self-revelatory stuff is honest -- forget how they did it. (John Ford gave Victor McLaglen the next day off and got him drunk as a skunk the night before the big trial scene in ""The Informer."" Crack of day the next day, Ford dragged McLaglen out of bed and shoved him in front of the camera. Sleep-stupid and whisky-blubbering, fuzz-gargling his lines, shaking all outside and in, McLaglen acted his way through the day and earned an Oscar for his hangover.)So there! Who cares how they got there, they got there!And there it was. The personal hype machine worked well for these guys, the short booking worked for them boosting their per screen opening to stratospheric levels.

A lot of bucks made for spending just enough in productions to peak curiosity. Kudos, wish I'da thought of it.

Not in Seneca Creek or Patapsco State Parks, safely just outside of Baltimore where this was filmed. Blair witch, bull. That was just the rantings of one scared individual in an attempt to avoid being executed for assisting in the murder of kids 65 years ago, and the really sick one behind it was one of the kids. If you're really interested in actual events or the history beyond the twisted fairy tales, look it up for yourself. But if you're not from around there, the spirits don't know you and you shouldn't be there, hanging out at night, treading on grounds that have become sacred to them, that contain their remains.

It's definitely one of the best horror movies I've ever seen, but I understand why a lot of people hate it. It's actually a psychological horror movie, that what really scares you is your imagination rather than what is shown on screen (unlike 99% of the movies we see around). It's very slow burn but it isn't boring. Do not expect to watch a lot of action or jump scares. The first 20 minutes serves to build up the mythology behind the Blair Witch, and the remaining hour it's all about these 3 people lost in the woods. It sounds boring but it's not. The movie keep your attention because these people are interesting and they really look like real people, people you can relate to, you root for them to survive. There is also a creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere during the whole movie that keep you with fear. It all seems real. You never know what really is haunting this people, it is the witch or is something else? It really scared me and I'm not a easy person to scare. I can count in my fingers the movies that scared me and Blair Witch is definitely one of them, specially the ending... The last 10 minutes are unforgettable. Scary, disturbing, tense, heart beating, edge of your seat type of ending. It's really the most scary part and the last shot still kills me till this day. It's impossible to watch The Blair Witch Project and simply forget. You will think about the ending for a long time definitely. It's all very subtle and creepy. The Blair Witch Project is a classic and it deserves to be watched by every horror fan. If you want to get scared, this is it, trust me. I don't know personally a single person who didn't get scared watching it. Go see it.",The Blair Witch Project
1079,jaysser,Not bad for suspense,6,23 April 2020,"The Blair Witch Project is quite the suspense. I would not say it is the scariest movie out there, but it can surely keep you on the edge at certain points. When a film triggers a set of emotions in you, that's how you know it was well-made. I particularly loved the performance, and I believe most of it was improvised. I did see some over-exaggeration at times, but nothing I was not expecting from a typical horror ambiance. An extra point goes for the actors' handling the cameras themselves. On the other hand, while suspense was the main element in the movie, I would have loved to see more frightening scenes, the ones that make you jump off the couch.",The Blair Witch Project

After watching a bunch of foul mouthed twenty something students walk around the woods with their camcorders, SUPPOSEDLY in search of a Witch, all we get is some running, screaming, and swearing. Where was the witch??? No witch. No witch? No witch. And the students are SUPPOSEDLY lost, walking in circles, unable to get out. Yeah... okay....how about following that damn river genius! Water flows out into a lake, perhaps? And then the ending. A boy is standing with his back turned, staring into the wall? The camera drops. Hahahhahahah.... So funny.Can I have my money back please? I was told that this movie was good. Why did I buy into this hoax. Please, save your money! This was one of the worst movies you'll ever see. Argh, I say!",The Blair Witch Project

I would've said less time, but I had hoped it'd get better by then. And the pile of rocks...OMG! To quote Bill Murray from Ghostbusters on book stacking, ""Yeah, nothing human could've done that.""This movie is proof that critics should not review horror.

I was excited about what happens in this movie and I thought this could be good horror movie but it wasn't... I was disappointed when I watched the movie. One of the parodys from this film in Scary Movie was funny. This movie has some power of horror but just a little bit. If you have seen this movie, what have you guys thought about it?

In fact that was the main reason I went to see it, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. So, as I left the Theadora 90 minutes later, I could not help to feel conflicted. Its not that I thought that The Blair Witch Project was a bad movie, Not at all. In fact there is some truly spooky things going on in this movie. The creepiness of the woods with all the wig snapping and such. The ""witch"" ramping up the psychological warfare on our three ""comrads""; this was quite effective movie making. I guess my problem with the movie was that I felt I wasted seven bucks on a fake documentary that pretends to be real that I already know is fake. Even If I didn't know this was a fake before hand, some of the acting is so over the top I could have figured it out easily. Is it just me or did Heather, Josh and Mike come off as thorougher unlikable? So much so that when they finally met they'r demise, my gut reaction was-""OH WELL."" I pariticulary found Heather a foul mouthed little snot. One more F bomb and I was going to reach into the screen and slap her face. All that said, this is still a not too bad movie. If you can get past the endlessly irritating ideologue, this film does have it moments.",The Blair Witch Project

Unfortunately, it left me hanging when I was expecting to be scared out of my wits. The abrupt ending didn't payoff nearly as well as I expected it to.It's really too bad. This could've been one of the great films if not for a lackluster climax. It's still a good film, but I've seen scarier. Much scarier.",The Blair Witch Project
1086,Larry-17,A very good film that might have been better...,8,4 August 1999,"Before anything else, let me say that I liked the film.    Nice concept. Well executed.   In particular, I appreciate that the film makers leave the central enigma of the movie intact.  Peter Weir's in ""Picnic at Hanging Rock""  makes a similar choice.  It takes strength of character and confidence to make this kind of choice.  It speaks reams about their potential.Already a thing of talk among independent filmfolk long before it hit theaters, BWP had poked itself into my consciousness a year or so ago.  The buzz.  The buzz!   A website before it was a film.  The website, itself, less a billboard than a computer game.   The lore:  Really cheaply made -- 60 grand, 25 grand, 10 grand! for crineoutloud -- the whole thing improved in the woods in eight wet and stinky days; they gave a trio of actors a couple of cameras and a DAT, led them on a scavenger hunt for clues, left sketchy notes and mind-screwed the cast into near-real fear and panic and late night woodland snipe-hunts.  It was all so hip, so coolly generated, so clever.   Forget that it had been done before.  Forget ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" and others...this one had integrity and a kind of kick-ass honesty about it. Just following all the material about the film before it opened, you just knew that -- if successful -- it was going to be one of those demiurge filmevents that redefined the business and would spawn a thousand mini-urges flailing for a ride.The buzz and hype!  And it's all true.  There it is: kind of lovely and clever.  It HAS integrity.   You like those three people.  You buy their weaknesses and still you like them because they're weak like you are weak. They're jerks, but still you like them because they're jerks like all of us.The actors are good, the self-revelatory stuff is honest -- forget how they did it.   (John Ford gave Victor McLaglen the next day off and got him drunk as a skunk the night before the big trial scene in ""The Informer.""  Crack of day the next day, Ford dragged McLaglen out of bed and shoved him in front of the camera.  Sleep-stupid and whisky-blubbering, fuzz-gargling his lines, shaking all outside and in, McLaglen acted his way through the day and earned an Oscar for his hangover.)So there!  Who cares how they got there, they got there!And there it was.  The personal hype machine worked well for these guys, the short booking worked for them boosting their per screen opening to stratospheric levels.  Great.I still went in thinking the movie was going to be just okay.  It was better.  It was very good.  They might have done a little more with the sound.  They might have built the tension a little more.  They might have paced it better.  They might have...  They could have-should have...Well.  It worked.I will say: I came out of the theater not frightened but moved.  I left the theater more impressed with the film makers than their film.   Ah, phooey! It was a good night out.It is, finally, a very good film that could have been better.",The Blair Witch Project
1087,Locdog07,Brilliant and much more than meets the eye,10,27 October 1999,"A lot of people who do badmouth this film haven't done any real research into the movie's background. It's just not enough to watch the movie in a theather and blocking your mind off from whatever happens on the screen so you can walk out and say ""That wasn't scary"". The whole point of the film is to be scared, it's a horror, so why not let it happen? A lot of these people might have actually been scared but not realized it. But I'm speculating.The film itself is incredible, a work of genius. It's inspired so many people to argue and debate over what actually happened to these three students, even though by now we all know it was fake. Those people who say ""It's dumb cause it wasn't real"", are they actually saying they wanted to see three students hunted down a probably murdered? So much effort went into making this film possible, some of which even came from the fans themself before the film was even released. I've done a lot of research into the film's background and secrets that I can't help but love it, and there are so many people who limit themselves to simply watching the film with a stone mind and not letting any of the imagination the movie creates seep into their brain.My second favorite film of all time, it will always be a classic to me.

The ending didn't leave you hanging, it just left you.  This was the first film I ever saw where the whole audience responded at the end with a collective ""You've gotta be kidding me, what the heck was that?"" Plenty of people have said it scared them away from camping, all it did for me was make me a little nauseated (The Blair Sick Project strikes again) and wish I still had the money I paid to see it.

I cannot remember a film being given more word of mouth negatives after many positive media reviews.  So after the hype had died I took the plunge. My bottom line is this. I felt scared while watching this film. The realistic cinematography draws you into the premise that you are watching a real documentary. This film hits the right note. It convinces. This is perhaps the number one goal for any film which wants to scare you. I give it a conservative 7 out of 10. Anyone who likes reading books will have the projective ability to feel the fear of the protagonists in this story.

1093,mmt02,Horror at its finest,10,2 August 1999,"[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]How many times have you heard a noise in the middle of the night and shivered in your bed? The fear of the unknown source of the noise chills your blood. That fear of the unknown is what makes The Blair Witch Project one of the greatest horror films.Only using a camcorder and a black and white 16mm held by the actors themselves, the film's subjective cinemtography heightens the atmosphere of fear. Many scenes at night nothing is visible but darkness. The soundtrack is filled with noises but the camera keeps jerking around; you can not find its source.The scene inside the house ( I won't say what happens there ) was filmed ingeniusly (if done on purpose). One character holds the camcorder, the only piece of equipment capable of recording sound, while the other has the 16mm which has no sound recording device. As the one with the camcorder runs down the stairs, the audience can only see what the 16mm sees as it is trying to follow the other person. The screams of the person with the 16mm can only be heard as distant screams through the camcorder's microphone. So the descent down the stairs has an eiry detachment that works extremely well.The Blair Witch Project shows that multi-million dollar budgets are not neccesary to make high quality films...",The Blair Witch Project

1099,beetree,"Very interesting, straight forward movie with some scares.",5,1 August 1999,"Yes, the movie was over-hyped, however, it delivers an original thriller that does kinda get to you after a while.The best concept film in a while;  The movie takes a basic horror concept that has been around for centuries (a witch or witch like being) and combines it with  simple, straight forward plot lines and dialog to make a very interesting film.Probably the only thing really scary about the film is that it does not give you anything NOT to believe.  There are no special effects or over-made monsters as the antithesis in the film.  The location could be Anywhere, USA and the cast made you believe what was happening.  All and all, you could almost believe that you were watching something that actually happened.Unfortunately, ALMOST is the key word.  The problem with the movie as a ""horror"" film is that you cannot suspend belief enough to really get scared. That is true in a sense of all horror films, but others have something PHYSICAL (like Michael Myers) that haunts you, even if you know it is not real.  Blair Witch Project delivers as a thriller that makes you wonder what will happen as the movie progresses, but leaves you ultimately unfulfilled. It HAD to end the way it did, you just wish it didnt.Overall, the film is worth seeing for the concept and as a good thriller... you may even get terrified if you can suspend your belief more than I.

It's VERY intense. There's a great deal of profanity. The movie is so true to reality that it's impossible to distinguish that it's really only a movie (or is it? you decide). The movie has no blood or gore (except for a very small bit of blood that totals no more than 30 seconds of camera time) and no music to lead you to fear - instead, it relies purely on psychological terror and one of humankind's biggest fears - being hunted. My suggestion if you're going to see this movie when it premiers - park your car in a dark, isolated spot. As you're struggling to get back to your car, you'll realize how scary a movie can really be. This movie is no less than excellent. It's put together well and it's unlike any horror movie ever made.

The first one doesn't have a happy end, the other one does. The idea of ""showing the students' filmed material"" as is is very effective in terms of creating terror among the spectators, and the result is purposedly shaky and non-professional, but unfortunately creates a lot of empty space, minutes of breathing into the microphone, panning of a forest without any signs of life (the trees included, due to the season). In Finland we have a theater/TV director called Jouko Turkka. His methods of making his actors act include (or rather: consist of) having them drool, make faces, sweat, shake their bodies and cry for extended periods of time, the story being of minimum importance. So, the BWP looks somewhat familiar to me. So familiar that I had to cut down some points.  But: the movie really is scary.

A common movie ploy is to have some sort of demon use its victim's innermost fears against them. In this case, however, it is not only the characters undergoing this, but also the audience.

I had a splitting headache by the end. If you tend to get motion sickness, you may wish to avoid this film.The Blair Witch Project represents the maximum result with a minimum budget. Unlike many low-budget films, it stays within its means. The film could not have been improved by putting more money into it. The acting was likewise very good.I'm not sure, however, that this was cut out to be a feature film. At 80 minutes it falls well short of full-length, but it felt more like 100 or 110 to me. The dialogue was repetitive, but little could be done to vary it. I would have enjoyed the film far more if it were 60 minutes. And maybe paired with another shorter film.I would also recommend not viewing this in the theater. The picture is filmed completely on videotape and 16mm, so the wide screen gives you no advantage. Unlike most horror films, The Blair Witch Project uses no shocking visual effects to frighten the audience. I found it difficult to be frightened by pure suspense in a crowded theater.

If you have that many issues that you have to keep coming back and re-insulting this movie, then maybe it touched a nerve and you just don't want to admit it.The Blair Witch Project is an experiment in fear. It gives the impression that three student filmmakers are going into the Maryland woods to film a documentary about a supposed witch that lived in the area many years ago. It is also insinuated that the witch influenced a serial killed in the '30s. Unfortunately for our clueless heroes, they get REALLY lost in the woods and spend a couple of days just wandering around. They have a compass, so it seems that the Witch is somehow causing them to walk in circles. As the intrepid trio travel through the woods, they find little ""gifts"" left behind by the Witch... piles of stones, little men made of sticks, and a rather nasty bundle with a soft, chewy center. A particularly scary part features an attack on the group's tent. Later, one of them vanishes in the night. The remaining two students finally end up at the house of the 30's serial killer...No spoilers. You'll have to see what happens for yourself.I'm not pretending that this is a major Hollywood release... less than $50,000 was spent on equipment and production. But this isn't meant to be high-budget. The movie looks exactly like it's supposed to... a student film that was edited together by people who found the ""lost"" footage after the students ""disappeared"". (I did think it was funny that some people thought this was real... the hype on the Sci Fi channel was great - it took quite a bit of convincing, plus video footage of the three actors alive and well on MTV, to show that they were still alive!)I think some people are angry at this film because they were expecting the next Exorcist or Poltergeist. Unless you're blind, it's blatantly obvious from the previews that the movie is shot with shaky cameras in a very ""real"" environment. If you came to this movie expecting something else, then you deserve to lose your $7.50.Also, I think people were really p***ed that they didn't get to see the Witch. In this age of CGI monstrosities and special effect-packed blockbusters, many movie-goers expect to see the monster all the time. If that's what you want, go rent The Haunting remake or Godzilla. I'd wager these same people would get upset at the original Haunting for not showing the ghosts. Maybe some of the people who hate this movie really WERE scared and it bothered them so much that they decided to pan the flick. Either way, I think it's worth giving this movie a chance... don't take it too seriously, though... it's a much better ride if you sit back and try to watch it with an open mind. Be prepared, because the ""action"" doesn't really kick in until halfway into the movie, and there isn't a whole lot of it. This is more of a suspense movie, not a slasher flick or an action horror movie.I've seen BWP twice in the theatre and once on video... and the last 5 minutes STILL gives me goosebumps.",The Blair Witch Project
1113,Robert Thompson,Truly frightening,10,26 May 2001,"I can see why so many people didn't like this movie and it was very interesting to hear other peoples comments as I left the Theatre. It seemed to me that it was mainly the younger audience did not get the movie or the concept behind it.I was truly frightened by this movie and I think this has a lot to do with my age. I was raised on a diet of old black and white Dracula movies and me and my sister used to sit up every Friday night, pillows ready to hide our faces, being scared stupid by these movies. Looking back at these movies now they are not vary scary but they are not graphic either. You only ever got to see some vague shadows and very little else. Every thing else was in you imagination.The Blair Witch Project has tapped into this fear very effectively. By not showing what is stalking our hapless adventures the directors are letting our imaginations run riot as to who or what is following them.I think younger viewers of this movie has been brought up watching films where every thing was shown and nothing was left up to the imagination. They wanted to be shown everything and were disappointed when they weren't.This movie is unique and could not be made in the same style again until this movie is a distant memory.If you like  to let you imagination take over from the movie makers this movie is for you. If you have no imagination and have to have everything served up to you on a platter,  don't bother. For me this is a 10/10",The Blair Witch Project

WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! I kept looking at my watch all the time. This movie doesn´t have any plot at all, the actors spend half of the time crying and the rest of it blaming each other for their terrible luck and yelling each other. The worst thing is that they are ""playing"" with a home-video camera, and they don´t really know how to use it (they keep pointing at the ground, then at the sky, then at the ground again...without even focusing), so after 15 minutes you feel kind of dizzy.I don´t know how this movie made so much money: probably, because they made a great web page, and everybody said ""Let´s go see it, they haven´t spent much money...""If you don´t want to bore yourself, check for another movie.",The Blair Witch Project

A friend of mine said that it looked like a scary movie so we went to see it together and I was very disappointed at what I saw. This movie really shouldn't even have been released to theatres nor direct to DVD or video for that matter, I think the proper place for it would have been on the internet because this peace of garbage does and did not deserve the exposure that it got.

a wonderful marketing campaign behind it, a chilling ending and great realism, but the film itself isn't that interesting.Once one starts looking into this this movie, it can really fall apart. One of the biggest flaws in the movie in my opinion is the characters we follow. They, aside from maybe Heather, are all dumb and unlikable, though they're actors give great performances. In my opinion, the film does drag, but the lore, as I said, has more impact than the actual movie. I love the ending, though.In retrospect, the movie itself isn't great, but it has creepy marketing and lore behind it. I think, if I were making it today, I'd of made it fifty minutes to an hour long and shown it at film festivals with all the same lore as the original.

But I was really impressed with both the idea and the execution; the acting, in my opinion, was wholly believable, and the ""documentary"" / ""found footage"" style was likewise quite well done.It wasn't until I saw this movie again that I realized how suspenseful it actually is (probably because I wasn't so concerned with the technical achievements the second time around)--no small task for a movie in this day and age of failed and, let's face it, mostly laughable horror flicks.It seems to me that this movie has become something of a whipping boy lately for those reviewers who wish to affect a certain neo-hipster attitude.  An Indie movie that achieved financial success?  Must really rot if the masses liked it.  Let's knock it down a peg.  Let's all come up with a really good line about camera shake and vomit.

MY MISTAKE -- it was a total waste of time!

For those who dislike this movie they can still go watch Friday the 13th part 26.This movie rocked because it made you think. There wasn't anything in this movie that wasn't plausible, that's the true appeal of this movie I think. It's very easy to imagine camping in a dark wood and not truly knowing what is out there. Seriously this movie was able to chill you using sticks and stones. There wasn't a need for a few gallons of fake blood, a cheesy soundtrack and an axe.I found myself dreading whenever night came.

Lets just say something like this did happen.  You'd be up and out of that wood before you could say brown trousers.  It's not something you'd stay for if you were actually there.

It was only after the success of The Blair Witch Project in 1999 that The Last Broadcast gained much publicity, likely due to some similarities between the two films' plot lines.The makers of The Blair Witch Project admitted to seeing The Last Broadcast before making their film during a 1999 interview with Diane Sawyer.

We know that they've gone in circles and we see them go crazy. The only confirmation of the witch that was needed was the ending. It's the story that they tell about the boys in the cabin.

It had such good potential: some amateur directors go into the woods to explore an urban legend. Brilliant. OK, sure, the camera is enough to make you projectile vomit in your seat but still, its good. It is undeniable that the first hour or so was good. Pretty freaky stuff, a lot of dark camera scenes. My only criticism with the first hour or so is the constant use of the word 'f*ck'. How is it possible to say 'f*ck' 133 times in the period of 86 minutes? Right, top rant over, we get to the final hurdle. They follow the sound of Josh's voice into a funny house. Was Heather deaf or just stupid? If she found his tongue and teeth wrapped up in a nice little package, why would you follow the supposed sound of his voice? No tongue, no noise. Simple.After stumbling around a house for a couple of minutes, they explore the attic and the basement where both cameras are dropped. What i fail to understand, however, is why Mike dropped his camera and how the hell they both died. So when Heather drops her camera, we see Mike standing in the corner of the room. What the hell? Nothing wrong with standing in the corner. He may have to come realise that he is, after all, a dunce. How would that kill you? And why would their bodies not be found? Maybe because nobody cared.Sure, it's easy to criticise and i probably wouldn't have come up with that idea in a million years, but if you're going to act on a good idea...do it well.In conclusion, it was a film with good potential but awful execution.",The Blair Witch Project
1132,ayed,Pseudo-documentary that is truly frightening,10,25 August 1999,"Let me preface these comments by saying that I have never been scared by a movie in my 20 years of viewing.  Sure, isolated moments in some of the more effective films of the horror genre have made me jump, but I have never experienced the growing dread and unease inspired by The Blair Witch Project.By now, the media-hype surrounding the unprecedented box-office success of this shoestring budget indie film has begun to overshadow the power of the pure film experience.  This is a shame.  I wish everyone could come to this film as I did -- unaware of the hype, knowing just the barest plot details. Add to that mix a quiet, respectful audience (though very near the theatre's 500 seat capacity) in a Maryland cinema.... and you would have the ideal ambiance for enjoying (is that the right word?) this film.  Too many people are going to see Blair Witch with their expectations artificially inflated and, inevitably, many of them will be disappointed because this film does NOT hold your hand in the typical Hollywood fashion, revealing all its secrets and tying the plot's threads into a neat package at film's end.To those of you who have yet to see the film, these words of advice: do not immerse yourself in the media coverage before you go.  Do not seek out the ""answers"" to the film's unresolved questions found on web pages and in the film's companion book.  The power of this movie is its ability to make you empathise with the fairly mundane yet primal emotions expressed by the actors.  As you follow the ""filmmakers"" on their journey into the woods, you feel the characters' frustration, confusion, disorientation, and, most importantly, fear of the unknown.  The tangible ""horrors"" of standard ""scary movies"" -- the killer in the hockey mask, the monster stalking the summer camp -- are constrained the moment their image appears on film.  Blair Witch proves (as do the perpetually disappointing adaptations of Stephen King's genuinely frightening novels) that hinted-at, suggested horrors fleshed out by the viewer's (or reader's) imagination are far more powerful than the best work of Hollywood's special effects teams.",The Blair Witch Project

What I disliked; a/ EVERYTHING ALMOST !!!!b/ No soundtrack - this is always bad for a film, they may have wanted it to be realistic but it had no depth to it.c/ The horror factor - Horror, Scary ??? - what are people on about when they say this is a scary film. It's truly depressing and disturbing, but why would anybody want to go to the cinema for those emotions, for a good fright, yes. But depression and disturbance is something we want NOTHING of in our lives.d/ The language and dialogue - This is REALLY were the film screwed up, I have no problem with the ""F"" word when used infrequent and for the right reasons, but the use in this film was appaling. At no point was the rest of the dialogue clever.e/ The filming - Good for about all of 5 minutes and then it just got clearly boring and messy.f/ The plot - Um... didn't have much of one really. The ideal of going into the woods for a project was ""different"" but the rest a What was the nonsense about a witch anyway, more likely it was just Josh fooling around with the kids, maybe they didn't even get killed. Maybe they just got lost and died of hunger in the end.Sorry, but this is THE worst film I have seen in a long, long time and I had to get this off my chest after returning from the cinema. Don't think I was the only one either, the cinema viewers seemed appaled that they had spent money on it.MORAL: Do not follow the hype, read about the film first, see if you REALLY think you will enjoy it, then go to the cinema.

So, there we were sitting in the theater waiting to be scared and it never happened. I guess I'm just jaded or something.  Now, I admire the film as innovative and different.  I am a huge fan of independent film.  And there were a couple of things that were creepy, but I really felt it didn't deliver.  I told this to a young friend of mine, and then he went to see it and was scared out of his wits!

Hey folks, it's a movie --  written by writers and those are actors.  I guess if it were real, it would truly be scary, but then we wouldn't be seeing it in a movie theater.

Unfortunately for the filmmakers, the scariness increases.. up until the very end (which to be honest freaked me out totally).  Overall this movie scares you .. but in a different way. It doesn't use the ""Hollywood Cheese Factor"" of constant blood and guts and special effects to do it. This time you're scared for real.",The Blair Witch Project
1147,Ike-18,The nightmare of Poe...,10,8 August 1999,"The Blair Witch Project is the most terrifying movie I have ever seen, if not the most horrifying movie ever made.  To try to describe in words such as soul-mortifying, heart-stopping, mind-paralyzing, would not do it justice.  It is something you must experience.  Now, I'm not going to spoil this movie for anyone who hasn't already seen it, but I am going to give you a few tips so you can better enjoy the movie.  First, it is essential that you listen to every bit of dialogue in the movie, especially the town interviews, otherwise you are not going to understand why the ending is so insanely frightening.  Second, go to this movie expecting to be scared and wanting to become part of the movie.  If you go trying to prove to everyone that you were not scared by the Blair Witch, then you'll do it, you won't be scared, and you'll have missed the opportunity of a lifetime to enjoy a truly awesome movie.  The Blair Witch Project is sheer creative genius. And the way it is filmed, although possible borrowed from other films, just adds to the complete madness.  It becomes all too real as we watch the decent into the malstorm of Heather, Josh, and Mike.  And the ending...well folks let's just say that I nearly deficated on myself right there in theatre. My girlfriend thought I was going to rip her arm off, I thought she was going to crush my fingers, and my heart thought it was going to rupture. Intense is not the word.  This movie is the nightmare of Edgar Allan freaking Poe or whoever else you want to compare it to.  And what makes it work is that you never know quite what's going on.  Stephen King once said in his book Danse Macbre that our imaginations are darker than any horror movie could envision.  That although we might be scared by something in a movie, it could have always been worse in our imagination.  Well, that's what makes this movie so flippin' freaky.  You are lead through a series of horrifying events where you are just as confused as the victimes and the climax is so viscious because you have been drug to the darkest corner of your soul and then......you're left there, forced to peer into the inky blackness and left with your mind writhing with fear, branded with the last scene like a hot iron.  ""Scary as Hell,"" as one critic said, may just be the understatement of the year.",The Blair Witch Project
1148,simone-18,Truly gripping!,8,20 May 2000,"Having missed this in the cinema, I sat down one Saturday night in the dark to see what all the fuss was about. I've read a collection of the opinion of others who appear to be totally split on this.The main reason to watch this is for its originality. It does capture the fear of the dark and requires your own imagination to work out what is happening. I have little idea what happened out there in the woods but I was sure as hell scared by it.A must see movie if only to make your own mind up about it. 8/10",The Blair Witch Project
1149,Fred-146,"A Brilliant, Original, Classic Horror Film",9,12 October 1999,"I just saw Blair Witch Project for the second time the other night and I was very surprised that the film had nearly the same effect on me as it did the first time I saw it. This is one of the most brilliant horror films I have ever seen!For those of you this movie is BAD, I think your reasons are unjustified. I'm going to list the many reasons why people thought this movie was bad.1. It was a home made movie-----The whole premise of this movie was to show the footage of three filmmakers who went into the woods and disappeared. The ads clearly said that this was ""their"" footage? What were you all expected. A glossy, high budget, special effects driven film, with lots of scary music and gore? Come on, these were film students!! The film remain true to that premise and did not deviate from it in any way. This was to look like a home video, and that made the film seem all the more real, therefore, much more effective.2. Those kids were so stupid....Oh, as opposed to those brilliant teenagers we see in movies like Friday the 13th, I Know What You Did..., and countless other slasher films? Give me a break!!! Heather, Josh, and Mike were about as naiive as you and I, but they certainly were not stupid!! Many said they should have carried a cell phone with them. How many people in 1994 had cell phones compared to how common it is today for people to have one? Some said they should have been better prepared for camping. Hello! If any of you who said that had an ATTENTION SPAN would have learned that Heather is the type of person who goes camping and is familiar with navigating her way through the woods. Most importantly, these kids would have found their way out of the woods if they were not scared out their minds!! They were researching a legend, that they apparently believed was not true. Nothing these kinds ever did made me want to shout ""STUPID! STUPID!"" at them. I however have wanted to do that to many of the characters in several films. Plus, the characters in most slasher films have a choice to what danger they put themselves in. They know a killer is on the loose. In Blair Witch, the kids were lost in the woods before they realized something unexpected was hunting them down.3. The acting was TERRIBLE!...There were many people who saw this film and thought it was real. Oh, but how could that happen if the acting was so bad? They should have known by that it was all fake, right? I think many of you have confused bad acting with ""raw acting"". The acting in this film wasn't meant to be dramatic, otherwise the film wouldn't have worked. The fact that the acting was so raw, made the film all the more realistic.4. Nothing ever happens in the movie, it's so boring....Apparently you who say this do not know how to use your imagination. Plenty happens in this film. Imagine how you would react if you heard strange noises in the form of laughing in the woods, or if someone was attacking your tent, or if you then found and area of the woods with all these occultic symbols, or if you heard your friend screaming in the woods and you were unable to help him, and then find parts of his body wrapped in his clothing...Many of these things gave me the chills becuase I was able to put myself in their shoes.5. They should run for their lives....What in the world do you think they were doing the whole movie?? They were walking, and running, and running, and going in circles and losing their mind. If you knew what it feels like to be lost, you'd understand that panic ensues and thinking your way out of a situation becomes harder and harder. And when they heard Josh's voice in the house I wasn't surprised they went in after him because that is something I would do in such a desperate situation.I guess many of you still need to the graphic violence and gore for a movie to entertain you and simply can't use your imaginations. Go on and continue to be entertained by the brainless horror films like Friday the 13th. I guess the Blair Witch Project is just way out of your league.This was one of the most original films of the decade and was so worthy of the hype. Many films used hype like TBWP. ""Psycho"" comes to mind as Hitchcock stated that NO ONE would be admitted after the beginning of the film. This sparked everyone's curioisity thinking that something happens at the beginning. There's nothing wrong with this as long as the film lives up to that hype. Psycho and Blair Witch both did that.Face it, Blair Witch Project will go down in movie history as one of the greatest horror films ever made along with Psycho, Halloween, The Exorcist, Jaws, Silence of the Lambs, Seven, and Scream. All of these films redefined the horror genre and expounded the limits of what horror films could do at that time.",The Blair Witch Project
1150,Jayster-5,An utter piece of overhyped trash!,1,22 December 1999,"""The Scariest Movie I've Ever Seen(???)"" Are you people serious!?  I guess I wasn't let in on the joke because this film was absolutely terrible! There were (and still are) a lot of stupid and gullible people out there who were suckered in by this turkey.  I can't believe so many people think this pseudo-documentary was authentic.  It's fiction, and it isn't even GOOD fiction.  What the hell is so scary about three stoned film students wandering around a forest?  I'm a horror movie buff, and after all the hooplah surrounding the Blair Witch Project I bought myself a copy when it was released on home video.  I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, and after viewing the tape only once I promptly ejected it from my VCR, set it on the floor, and stomped the cassette into pieces!  I WAS RIPPED OFF!! WHAT WAS THAT CRAP!!  Scary? What? Are you people all retarded??!!  There is absolutely nothing redeeming about Blair Witch, nothing!  It's isn't even worth another viewing for it's camp value, because it isn't even campy! Just what, may I ask, was so damn scary about it?  Was it the terrible camera work, the absence of logic?  The feeling of confusion and nausea? Was it the narcotic-induced panic of the 3 imbiscilic film students?  This is quite simply THE WORST movie I have EVER seen in my life!  Stay away, stay far away!",The Blair Witch Project
1151,Jack-182,Creepy ain't it?,10,4 July 1999,"I didn't know much about this movie when I first started watching it, at first I just thought it was about a boring documentary in which three slacker kids wanted to hit it big by making their story about a witch. I was frightfully surprised when I soon realized that their camping trip was soon to turn out for the worse.  After the movie was over and that last horrifying 10 minutes of the film was completed I found myself wondering if this was an actual tape from those three kids disappearance.  Thankfully this isn't an actual real tape but rather just a not so regular movie.  I saw the film about 2 days ago but the story line and plot are still very clear in my mind and still make me think that this could actually happen and that although just a story, it still makes me wonder what if...",The Blair Witch Project
1152,henny-4,"Interesting, but not scary.",8,1 February 2000,"An excellent example of how good a low-budget film can be, and that nobody needs to pay an actor $20 million to ensure big box-office.  An interesting way to make a film - taking your cast out into the woods and terrorising them, but it's a pity we didn't get to experience some of that as well.  I had heard so much about how frightening this film was, but found it about as scary as ""The Sound of Music"".  I'd be interested to see how the rumoured sequels turn out.",The Blair Witch Project
1153,Harvest-2,Be afraid...,10,19 July 1999,"Like most people now, I think I have become jaded to just about everything in movies.  Violence, sex, the monster popping up at an unexpected moment, it's all been done before.  The Blair Witch Project has none of that, and has only one scene that shows blood, but it is still the scariest film I have seen in over 10 years.  I don't know if I agree that it is the scariest movie of all time, as I can think of some notable exceptions that still get to me today, but it defintely ranks up there with films such as The Haunting, Night of the Living Dead, and The Exorcist.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has seen it, but I will say that at no time do you believe the people in the film are simply acting, and the power of suggestion, not the power of visuals, work to unsettle and frighten the watcher. Definitely go see this one in the theater, if you like to be scared, you will not be disappointed.",The Blair Witch Project
1154,Jazzman-17,Defines Fear,10,4 August 1999,Let me pose a question. What is more fearful? A noise in the dark or the thing that actually makes the noise? Usually the noise alone. I'm not too scared when i'm in my downstairs and i found out that the noise was really just one of my two birds munching some birdseed.This movie really digs deep into fear.  Most movies nowadays can't seem to scare the audience without shock music and 3000 gallons of fake blood.  This movie far surpasses others in the scaring department even though it has aprroxamtely 1/1000 the budget.  I watched this movie two days ago and the final scene still gives me chills. This movie though is definately not for the MTV generation of people who need an explosion or bloody corpse every minute(hey i'm saying that and i'm a teenager)The only real flaw in this movie is that we cannot really beleive that they would continue to film with all the paranoia in their minds by the end of the film.  This movie though really builds and the fear is not attained by jumping out of your seats. It's the sense of dread when you come home and wonder what that bump in the night was...,The Blair Witch Project

It reminded me of a home movie buff who never learned to keep the camera still, and then decided to splice all his out takes together rather than throw them away.  There was no plot, only some people who got lost, and had absolutely no surprise ending. I could have seen Runaway Bride, but I didn't have sense enough to walk out of this piece of trash, since I had heard that there was a surprise ending. There wasn't any.  It was worse than Xtro.

1157,Mthomas-5,Is this the movie I've been waiting all summer for?,6,19 July 1999,"Don't believe the hype. The Blair Witch Project was clever, I have to give it that, but there were just entirely too many cinematic screw-ups for me to give it anything more than a 6.  The filmmakers were so caught up in making this seem like authentic footage they went so far as to disregard the importance of decent sound...I might have been creeped out if I could actually make out some of the dialogue and the actors weren't hyperventilating over each other's lines.And what was up with that ending? Can we say anticlimactic?",The Blair Witch Project
1158,Djonn,Ingenious but flawed,7,4 August 1999,"WARNING: SPOILERS TO FOLLOWThis was a very cleverly made movie that suffers most from the limits of its own creativity.  The actors deserve enormous credit for their work -- the directors somewhat less, for seemingly falling in love with the gimmick and not stitching together the raw footage with a better-developed structure.Some of the extra-filmic Blair Witch background lore needed to make it into the movie proper; the hauntings don't make sense without it.  There are a couple of severe idiot-plot problems: why, oh why, do these three college kids not simply follow the creek, which has to come out someplace, and so escape the woods?  And why do Heather and Mike succumb to Horror Cliche Disease and go straight into the Creepy House From Nowhere, there to split up and ensure their imminent doom?  (They should have followed the inevitable path to the house down the hill into town.)It's also mildly odd that there's no sexual/physical chemistry between the characters, especially after Josh disappears and Heather and Mike are left to each other.  I am NOT talking about casual nookie or horizontal tango-ing here, but the sort of bonding-under-stress that frequently occurs in crisis situations such as that in the film.Criticisms notwithstanding, there's a lot to like about the movie (provided you can see it in a properly darkened theater; it *really* needs the blackest possible black to work at its best).  But it's not quite the groundbreaker the hype suggests.",The Blair Witch Project

And right when it STARTS getting even remotely scary, they cut it short.

It's got a lot of scary visuals... and I have heard that when people are looking back at it, they are very scared.  The same thing happens to me.

As a college project it is certainly a very good attempt and probably deserves a B+.  Too bad it has been hyped as something more.

Great cast, specially the female lead (whose ""I'm so sorry"" sequence is unforgettable) and very expert and inteligent construction of fear. Final ten minutes are hell on earth, specially the ending bit where... Along with ""Texas Chain Shaw Massacre"" and ""John Carpenter's Halloween"", ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a must. Unfortunatly, it will be seen by too many people because of the publicity, and it will be stupidly hated, parodied, clones, imitated and...sequeled. No matter what people say to you, rent it or buy it (on DVD, because of the ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" documentary), see it alone, in the dark, in late night, and willing to enjoy it.

1163,jiz-6,Booo...,5,27 March 2000,"...did I scare you?If I didn't then I don't rate BWP chances of doing so either.  In fact the only thing scary about this whole movie was that I paid to see it.  OK, may be I'm being harsh.  It was a really good idea.  But the execution of the concept was poor.  From what I can gather, the premise of the whole film is that it was meant to feel 'real', thus getting away from typical horror. Wonderful idea.  The problem with the film is than no one acts the way any normal human would act in a similar situation.  When totally lost in a big forest, don't just go marching in a general direction, follow the river, it's bound to lead somewhere.  I'm a city boy, but even I know to do that. When face with a big scary house with lots of weird stuff happening, don't go into the house for a quick viewing, run in the opposite direction at high speed.  Perhaps this is somewhat of a British view.  Generally when you wanderer any forest in the UK it will have some associated legend of ghosts, murderers or the like.  You just can't get scared about it. 
However, if the film-makers want to make people believe a story then make it 'real'.  Using camcorders and a documentary style, don't make it 'real', the characters make it 'real'.",The Blair Witch Project

It could have been a great film, too.Instead of making the most of the idea, there's far too much time spent on the extremely un-sympathetic characters arguing with each other.  I suppose this is meant to show their dawning fear and justify the incredibly stupid things they wind up doing (like not walking out of the woods...duh).

The movie was in no way scary, and it was only slightly eerie in the few scenes when the ""actors"" were not arguing.  I must compliment whoever marketed this movie.  He is a genius. He took one of the worst movies I have ever seen and made a craze out of it.  Not only did people race to the theater to see it, some people were so brainwashed by the marketing schemes that they still thought it was good after they say it.

Supremely tense, definitely, particularly in the scenes without light; and when reflecting on it afterwards the full impact of its chilling nature hit me more. It doesn't provide the shockfest that horror audiences want the most, though. However, I found it excellent as a psychological thriller. We get to watch as three ordinary people, complete with ordinary flaws that make them all the more believable, are exposed to extreme stress with inevitable consequences. Watching them break down, culminating in an incredible monologue by Heather, is a fascinating experience. The realism is also top notch; while others might decry the lack of any kind of polish, I reckon it's just that that makes it so intriguing. It could easily be real life that's being filmed, a premise aided by the very natural acting of the three main characters. Eerie, unsettling and very effective in its subtlety, this ranks as one of my favourite films and well worth watching.",The Blair Witch Project

When the movie was over, I saw many people laughing. I heard the person sitting behind me say that BWP was the least scariest movie he had ever seen. Even my friend who is scared of every horror movie possible was like, ""that was not scary at all."" The movie's desperate attempt to try and scare people just doesn't work. Oooooooo they hear sounds in the woods while they're sleeping. They see rocks at their camp that weren't there before. Oh my god, that's soooo scary. The only thing that should have scared those 3 people was when the other 2 found the guy's who disappeared tongue. Even when they found his tongue wasn't scary. It was just gross.

You have to give major props to a movie that doesn't make itself, but sits back and lets a movie be made.  Its' original in that no other movie has sent a buncha kids out in the woods with CAMCORDERS and seen what they get out of it.  No other movie has paid their stars in sandwiches. These props made what probably should've been a 3 or 4 movie a 6.",The Blair Witch Project
1179,AnimatriXZJ,A classic that brought on a new genre of film,10,24 August 2021,"The Blair Witch Project is an unsettling video-documentary and an excellent horror movie. This movie was one of the first films to bring on the ""found-footage"" genre in most movies today. The movie is filled with tension and the actors are excellent by making the film more ""real"" than you could imagine. Although it is not as scary as it is today, especially with the film being made on a small budget, The Blair Witch Project still holds up as tension-filled nightmare that terrified audiences worldwide all those years ago...",The Blair Witch Project
1180,homeofhalloween,Found footage gold,9,13 October 2021,This movie induces fear almost better than any other found footage film!They stick with a very basic premise and keep the monster (Witch) hidden throughout that only heightens the tension.When this was first released it marketing was outstanding. They fooled the world into believing that this was real found footage. So convincing that some of the casts family received condolence letters after its release.Despite us now knowing this is not the case this film still holds up and will for years to come. The reliance on only the actors ability and practical effects makes this almost a masterpiece.,The Blair Witch Project
1181,MASK Agent 703,"The true fear, is within ourselves",10,3 December 2001,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is not about drenching the audience with blood and gore, of terrorizing them through the film.  Well, okay, maybe the second one, but it's much more than a horror movie.  It is a crude but tolerable display of an emotion that each one of us holds dear in our hearts...fear.  Everyone fears something, no matter how big or small or important or insignificant it may be. This movie toys on that emotion to the fullest extent.  You do not watch ""The Blair Witch Project"", you feel it. We live in a world that is fully dominated by technology, and money.  With ""The Blair Witch Project"", that is not the case.  It was made on a shoestring budget, and used some of the simplest filmaking techniques around.  Yet, it shows us that no matter what we may see when it comes to horror, the greatest creator of fear is our own imaginations.  And in a day and age where technology is king, queen, prince, and the rest of the dynasty, ""The Blair Witch Project"" proves that the stuff out there that really scares the pants off of us is what we don't see.",The Blair Witch Project

The style of shooting was as expected, shaky hand held camera, which fitted the premise of the film, but you felt like you were watching an amateur film by school kids rather than actual footage of a real event which it was supposed to depict.Normally I expect a horror to get my heart racing a few times, and have some surprises, but the plot was too obvious, there were no surprises, nothing that would make you jump.I would not recommend this to any film buff, ignore the hype and skip this film.",The Blair Witch Project
1183,brumblebrumble1,Frightening to every normal human being,8,29 November 2011,"I must say it's amazing the huge number of negative reviews to this movie. They call it ""ridiculous"", ""poorly realized"", ""not frightening"", stuff like that. Well, I've got a challenge for all those extremely ""wise"" and ""all-experienced-in-horror-movies-and-cinema-making"" people. Why don't you all try go camping into the woods with your friends and watch this movie? Let's just see if in the end of the night you come here to IMDb bash on it and call it pathetic again? I highly doubt it because if you survive to that experience (like I did) without having a heart attack it will already be good. The movie is good, it gets you involved! Every second feels like you're part of the story. And people complain about irritating and hysterical characters? For Christ sake, they got lost on the woods and were being haunted, of course they were loosing it! I am an experienced backpacker myself and believe me, you wouldn't want to get lost in the woods, much less hear and see strange things! I remember once when me and my buddies were camping and started to hear some weird noises and everybody was getting crazy ... So the movie is perfect under that point of view. Under such circumstances, everybody would loose control. I think that people complaining about this are used to mega productions with super acting and directing technics and that kind of stuff. Under that prism, of course it is a very bad movie. The thing is, this flick was made to feel like it was a real thing happening to normal people and to put you on their eyes. That's the extraordinary thing of it and that's why it is so different of all the other movies! Every reaction seems like a reaction a normal person would take if it was on the same situation! Under that perspective, it was perfect.Conclusion: If you are expecting a super movie filled with great looking actors, a fabulous story line, Hollywood filming technics and that sort off stuff, don't see it, pop on your DVD anything of that Hollywood Zombie thrash that there is everywhere. On the other hand, if you are looking to get a huge thrill and to live a frightening episode like it was happening to you, then gather some friends on a country house and turn off the lights, believe me ... You. Will. Get. Scared!",The Blair Witch Project
1184,rosspatrick-26-445640,Only 90s kids will understand,10,20 April 2019,"TBWP polarises people and rightly so. The ""cheapness"" of the movie captures the tech available at the time and this shouldn't be a problem except it is to a generation of kids growing up with HD quality everything. Also to truly 'get' this movie you had to watch the movie around the time of release, there was a lot of really good fake promo plugging the film under the guise of news reports and documentary shorts. This was before the era of fake news, so it worked. So before watching this movie you really need to appreciate the time, the tech and the mentality of a 90s kid going in to see this. The Internet was just about working end of the 90s and there wasn't a great deal you were doing back then apart from sports, shopping and exploring places. This is why Blair witch hits home, for 90s kids all we had was exploring stuff and we couldn't even take decent pictures of it. I'm a pretty hardened horror fan but that end scene of the movie messed me up. It was great everything surrounding the movie was great, so before trying to pull this to pieces on an intellectual movie scholar level just remember if you aren't from that era you just aren't gonna get it.",The Blair Witch Project
1185,Vafthrudnir,Buffs vs. Afficionados: A Blair Witch Defense,8,4 March 2004,"A horror movie with less than an ounce of visible blood, where we never see or even learn beyond doubt what the ""killer"" is, and no teenage sex-kitten gets naked. That this movie has suffered vociferous opposition hardly surprises me. The simple fact is, it's extremely good, and the horror-movie industry will hardly suffer quality without a fight. Friends, the whole problem is that there are two species of us who watch horror movies. There are horror ""buffs"", who seek all the wrong things in movies. Gore, nudity, and triteness are the hallmark of the horror buff's tastes. They feel that ""horror"" comes from making an audience jump, as if the movie-maker's art were as simple as a well-timed M-80 in a quiet classroom, and prize ""fun"" over shivers. Then there are those other, rarer fans, the true horror ""afficionados"". We are the audience who, for whatever reason, enjoy being scared. Of a higher stripe than your rank-and-file ""buff"", we look for a movie to be creepy, disturbing, unsettling. We seek a smarter approach. Not that it must always be subtle; I have little doubt that The Exorcist approaches the top of most ""afficionado's"" lists. But, friends, there is true horror here, as opposed to your common slasher, which is targeted to audiences possessing the human sensitivity of a tombstone. The Blair Witch is the afficionado's dream. It achieves a level of absolute verisimilitude that makes suspension of disbelief almost *too* easy. By presenting itself as an ""artifact"", it takes itself out of the Land of Make Believe and intrudes itself (delightfully) into the viewer's world. The much-bemoaned dialogue is unsettling because it's *not* movie-dialogue at all; it's actually the way people in the really-for-real world speak. The piles of stone and strange twists in the trees are never really explained, nor should they be; we don't know what they are, but they appear tantalizingly realistic, mysterious and yet perfectly plausible; you could easily imagine that the whatever-is-out-there might leave signs exactly like that. And those wierd things in the branches do very much seem like they have a kind of wierd internal logic, like they *should* mean something. If it's never revealed, well, that's the magic of tease and misdirection, two of the most powerful weapons in the *real* horror-movie's arsenal. I'll concede, the movie was a fluke, and its gimmick can probably never be reproduced well without lapsing into imitation. But, to my mind, this what seperates ""us"" from ""them"". If the Blair Witch scared the livin' bejesus out of you, you have the imaginative engagement necessary for appreciation of the world's finest horror-movies. If not... go rent Freddy vs. Jason, little horror ""buff"".",The Blair Witch Project
1186,scoey,"Nothing really happens, nothing really matters, SPOILER?",1,8 August 2020,"How can you write a spoiler if what you're saying is that NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS FILM. Film is a visual medium and you must SHOW something happen for it to be a legitimate film.Though I walked out (one of only two films I ever walked out of) after the first 30 minutes passed with NOTHING AT ALL HAPPENING, I am confident in telling anyone reading this that, from everyone I have spoken to or read from, there is no witch, there is nothing scary, this is not a project, it is the beginning of the worst genre of film-making ever conceived. The ONLY things that could make ""found footage"" films worth watching would be if something interesting actually happens and if it is in VR so you can be in the experience yourself. When I asked someone who saw the film all the way through what he thought was scary about this, he said ""some people said the woods was haunted or cursed."" I asked point-blank ""Does anything scary actually happen? Does someone get harmed in some way?"" He said, ""Well, what's scary for some people isn't scary for others.""So, if a spoiler is telling people about what happens in the film, then I can't spoil it. Nothing at all happens. People wander around and get scared for no reason. They go into a wooded area that they heard was haunted or cursed, but it's nonsense. They just scare themselves over nothing at all and then the credits roll.

A movie that would never have come to be had Blair Witch not reworked the genre, yet a film that is cheap in comparison in strength of story, characters and realism. You cannot deny the impact this movie has had on others. The character development is intriguing and filled with mistrust. Heather is annoying but true to life, people are irritating and annoying at times:)The sound effects are subtle and create an isolation. The film gathers momentum and the fear of the dark really affect the viewer. The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't have a typical formula. It doesn't provide the viewer with any relief (cheap scares, cheap jokes that relieves the tension). Instead it constantly builds fear in the viewer with atmospheric sounds, visuals and the impending sense of tragedy. Nobody could honestly say they knew how this movie would play out. What sets this film apart from others are the empty surroundings. There have been many Horrors shot in woodland areas(mansions,cabins etc) but few entirely in the woods. The subject of witch craft was skillfully mastered. This film worked with a low budget where others would have failed.",The Blair Witch Project
1188,imcarl,Excellent Movie - if you can suspend you disbelief,9,10 March 2005,"I just rented this movie and was blown away. Using what I think was two camcorders, no special effects, no music and an under $50,000 dollar budget, three (probably more as well) filmmakers made a hair raising, wonderfully crafted movie that scares effortlessly without one single, scary scene. The premise starts with 3 students attempting to make a documentary on a local legend-The Blair Witch. They interview the local people living around and eventually go into the forest to search for a cemetery. They eventually get hopelessly lost and we see a wonderfully realistic transformation from hope, to anger, to sadness, to absolute desperacy. The acting is completely unscripted-and to a person who lives in movies where every line has five minutes of thought behind it, might find it a little one note, but if you can forget it's a movie, one will see it's an amazing performance. The characters truly develop and if any of you have been camping for a long time, it will feel very realistic. From bicker to tears everything works well. The premise behind the movie, is that you have to suspend your disbelief and doubts and accept that the everything is real, and further, immerse yourself in the experience and pretend that you are lost in the forest. If you enjoy movies that go to lengths to scare the apathetic viewer, you won't like this movie. It requires empathy and understanding, an once you can accept that, it will blow you away. And if you can, the movie can give a real tense scare and a wild adrenaline rush, without one scary scene.",The Blair Witch Project

They will say nothing ever happens and it's just ""annoying cameras jumping."" I suppose that's true. I think what makes this movie a success if my eyes is they built up the suspenseful moments without revealing anything.That's the secret to successful FF films. You don't need a huge budget, big cast, or even great lines.If you can build up the suspense, keep people anxiously watching, and keep the mystery thrilling/scary, you can achieve FF success.And Blair Witch Project does all of the above.

THIS movie is dark, creepy, and does NOT have a happy ending (yaay!) To truly understand this movie you really have to step back to 1999 (c.e.) and hear the rumors of ""the Blair Witch"" from friends, the fledgling internet (which has only a few hundred thousand indexed websites anyone really visits, not the billions of pages with youtube and myspace now. In fact, this movie WAS youtube. You see, we all heard the whisperings of some dumb kids who got lost in the forest and got killed. Then the Discovery channel had a special on ""The Blair Witch"" the day before the movie came out. THAT was what cemented the marketing. The problem with the (fake) ""documentary"" was hat it was just a little too transparent. It made you want to believe (like you might want to believe in happy, friendly aliens) but it just seemed a bit cheesy and fake. Then there was the website. It was an ""almost ran"" but the fact that they were selling Blair Witch merchandise BEFORE the movie opened almost killed the entire scam. So you sit down in your seat of a packed movie house and hear the nervous whispers of everyone else asking ""is this real?"" and then the movie starts - a real documentary. The rest is history. Shaky camera work that gives far too many people nausea, the sudden ending that shocks and angers people when hey realize they just got ""punked"" (before there was a ""Punked"" show). This is movie magic at a time when almost all competing movies were [...] formula - and let's not mention television. This movie shocked th public awake and almost - allllmost worked in a BIG way. If they had played their cards a bit closer to their vests and demanded the public believe, instead of hawking merchandise and fake documentaries for a few extra coins, they would have had a PT Barnum worth masterpiece scam on the public. Nonetheless, the movie cost nothing to make, sold for 2 million at Cannes I believe, and made TONS of money in the first two weeks before dropping off the radar and finally becoming a pariah. forget the sequel. The only value the sequel has is to show young filmmakers that YOU TOO can get funding for your second project sight-unseen, if your first project slaps the general public awake. And that is why this movie is priceless. Watching it on DVD you really lose a lot - kinda like watching the Woodtock (1969 - the REAL Woodstock) movie on DVD. If you weren't there, you really missed the whole point - sorry. But it is still a fun way to creep your friends out on a Saturday night.",The Blair Witch Project
1192,shivdas99,"Go for the experience, not the movie.",7,23 January 2008,"What makes this movie such a thrilling experience is the fact you never see the witch or mystical force in the forest playing tricks on these 3 students. You only see the tricks being played, and not consistently...but every now and then so it doesn't become repetitive but rather well timed and when you least expect or want it. The viewing through the camera gives it an unnerving realistic edge making you feel as if you are in the forest too or watching a real footage recorded by real people being tested, almost, by a real evil. All these factors collectively make the movie engaging, but not necessarily good. It is not the mark of a great movie at all, with the factors explain before acting almost comes at ease with almost able to play the part...the viewers aren't engaged with the actors necessarily but the whole array of noises, images and the general vibe the forest creates and vibe resulting from the relationship between the actors and the forest and 'witch'. This means sometimes the viewer will imagine noises which aren't even portrayed in the cinema. It is not really a movie in the sense of character and plot development, but rather an experiment to play on the audience. Perhaps that is why it is only just above an hour and nothing much really happens. The ending, itself, is also deliberately vague, giving open interpretation to the audience.

Quickly the scene changes and everything becomes very serious, you find these kids are hunted, and the fact that you don't hear a narrator or ever see the camera pull away to show you the whole story is very disturbing.  At no point in this story do you see limbs being cut off, or monsters in the dark, with beady eyes.

Period.  That's it.  With nothing to frame it, it tells us nothing.  Three people went into the woods and disappeared.  I knew that much from the commercials.  Are they dead? Are they captive somewhere?  Was it a witch who got them?  A homicidal maniac?  I still don't know.

I have never seen anything like it, and I hope I never do again.  Go see it with someone you like and trust.  It is worth the scare, I promise!",The Blair Witch Project
1209,Ben-162,Prepare to be disturbed,10,1 January 2000,"The Blair Witch is one of those rare occurances in cinema which manage to be much more than the sum of its parts.  A low budget film, shot by the actors on less-than-a-shoe-string managed to be one (after The Phantom Menace) of the most talked about films of the year. This film is not flawless, however. The arguments, although adding to the believability of the characters, do tend to grate after the first hour.  The loosing of the map incident seemed a very unlikely occurence considering the circumstances.  The main flaw however has to be the fact that filming is not a natural human response to extreme psycological trauma, and, although the film would be lacking somewhat if during moments of terror the camera was shut off, it would make more sense.  The ending it a major example of this which verges on the unbeleivable, even if one beleives that it is a way for the characters to psycologically distance themselves from their reality.
However, on the whole, the good points outweigh the bad.  The level of emmersion is unsurpassed - there has seldom been a film that (figurativly speaking, of course) skewers you, puts you in its mouth, chews thoughtfully and finally spits you out as well as this one - leaving you only with haunting images that stay with you for weeks, and the silent promise not to go camping again.  It deftly sidesteps the ironical slasher movie formula, and delivers its message not through flashy script or ""cheap"" shock tactics, but by getting inside your head and whispering; and by giving you icons and symbols (such as the wood itself - which it taken as a symbol life, and then stripped of it (like the children themselves) - no birds sing, no leaves grow.The Blair Witch is a fantastic movie, but, the fact that it is more disturbing than scary, means that the audience has to be able to let the Blair Witch work its voodoo without putting the brain onto automatic and expecting to be entertained; you are, unfortunatly (although it is a rarity in modern Cinema) required to watch it on a deeper level.",The Blair Witch Project
1210,MyJenny,Ignore the hype and enjoy the movie,8,30 August 1999,"Just to get it out of the way, this movie was NOT the scariest thing I've ever seen, the footage WAS nauseating to watch at times, and the dialogue was often limited.That being said, Blair Witch is a very creative movie, with the ability to get the adrenaline pumping as you watch it.  The tagline gives away the ending - after all, only the footage was found, right? - but I was still at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next.Many of the people leaving the theatre were complaining that it was boring, and that they expected a real ""horror"" film.  If what you're looking for is ""Scream,"" this isn't it.  Instead, it relies on creating a mood for the audience that encourages you to try to imagine yourself in the characters' places.  As for the dialogue, I thought it was extremely realistic, if not terribly original.  The acting was superb.  I found myself getting angry with Heather as she pranced around with her camera, and during the scene where they start to lose it at Mike, I could REALLY imagine the feelings they were having.If you haven't seen Blair Witch but plan to, just sit back and let the movie take you, and you'll probably enjoy it.

There they are three kids with cameras, in a search of the Loch Ness monster ! And by the way, they were lost and they were camping near a river.

With a budget of only 36000, this film was able to create a horrifying film.  This proves that money and special effects don't make the movie.  The Blair Witch Project is a story of three filmmakers, who are creating a documentary.  As their curiosity thickens, however, they find themselves lost in the forest of the Blair Witch.  Over the next few days, they realize that they may never find their way back, and gradually their optimism disappears.  The amazing part about this movie is how they are able to frighten you without even showing the Blair Witch, or having the villain pop out and scare you. In this film, the terror builds up gradually, instead of very quickly, and allows the fear within you build intensity.  The final scene of this film, to me is an interesting outcome, but I will leave you in suspense.Original, and very scary.........*******(7 stars of 10).",The Blair Witch Project

Not too much about the movie itself, but too much about how people perceived the movie.  The overwhelming number of people who were scared beyond any previous movie experience had set my expectations souring.  This emotional predisposition, coupled with the scattered facts that I did know about the movie, caused me to be on the edge of my seat before the movie even started.  I loved the concept of the movie, the filming style was creative and left plenty to the imagination and the acting was authentic and believable, but I was left flat on my face when looking to be scared out of my pants.

What makes it so horrifying is the unknown. This is the best advice I can give to a potential patron. Go see BWP before you know to much.

Withbasically no budget these guys made me terrified.

I think when most people are threatened with a ""force"" whether known or unknown they take on a defensive posture like fabricating some sort of a weapon or a pointy stick and maybe building a giant bonfire to scare away the ""boogie"" men?""The scariest movie ever?"" My fear level was on low simmer throughout the movie and maybe spiked up for a brief moment near the end. The overabuse of the shakiness of the camera was becoming trite 30 minutes into the movie. Uhh... yes, I get it, its an amateur videotape, just don't beat me over the head with this concept.

1222,jmb-9,The Poor Blair Witch,10,10 August 1999,"The early IMDb ratings for Blair Witch and the user comments were all enthusiastic and genuine. Then the media came along. Artisan claimed credit for everything (the website was better when Ed did it. At least the pictures loaded and the hyperlinks worked, which is more than I can say now...) the actors jumped in, and Dan and Ed began to look like mindless opportunists. Comments from viewers now are surprisingly negative..Well, God never intended everyone to see a movie like Blair Witch, just as not everyone should see Clerks, or Z (lo, these many years ago) or Dark City. We all enjoy different things, and some people really would prefer to see Runaway Bride, or The Thomas Crown Affair, or The Haunting, or Inspector Gadget.So, if some people are disappointed after seeing Blair, perhaps the hype and buzz did overcome the really brilliant little indie film and in doing so made it seem more universal than it is. That is unfortunate. However, I recently read that Hollywood insiders feel that hype on the Internet made Blair a hit, and that is unjust and false.Blair Witch is archetypal. It is what frightens you when you are babysitting at a strange house, in the woods. It is why you understand expressions like ""things that go bump in the night.""

The supposed raw video and audio footage from three missing film students who were lost in the woods while making a documentary about a Maryland witch.The first-person style -- we see only through the sometimes blurry, sometimes shaking camera lens -- adds to the rising terror of the three college students. It also makes the view almost claustrophobic as the trees always seem to be closing in -- especially at night.The movie beautifully builds the sense of dread and impending doom. We know what is going to happen; we just don't know when or how. Plus, we watch as three seemingly intelligent people basically fall apart.The film really kicks in during the final 30 minutes to the dizzying climax and haunting last scene.A must-see for fans of horror and suspense; also for movie fans who want to see something new and different. A campfire story for the home video generation.

According to the friend, this is the scariest movie ever made. Although I had read some bad reviews I decided to watch it anyway, to satisfy my curiosity.  I came to the conclusion that this movie is THE WORST movie I have ever seen.  Contrary to the hype, there are NO thrills in this movie.  The quality of the filming is bad, maybe purposefully, but it does not add to the authenticity of the movie, it only gives the unfortunate viewer a headache.  The story starts out okay, but then it goes to a virtual standstill, with nothing happening for 60 minutes.  When things eventually start happening the viewer gets excited, only to be let down.  This happens time and time again, you get excited, wait for it, wait for it...bummer, nothing.  I told the story to my mother in four sentences, that is all there is to this movie.  No character depth, no real plot, no satisfactory scary scenes.  This movie is one big let down.  I was looking forward to the ending...unfortunately it turned out to be the worst part of the movie.  I was left feeling frustrated, uncertain about what exactly had happened at the end, completely and utterly UNSATISFIED.

Let me offer a couple of suggestions to possibly prevent that from happening to any new viewers.1) Don't buy the hype. This is not the scariest movie ever made. In fact, there's not a single big scare in the entire movie. That doesn't mean it can't creep you out. There's something to be said for the painfully slow building of tension.2) Use your imagination. Try to pretend it's real. (Possibly a small spoiler here) Things will not be spelled out for you. Don't expect special effects. That's part of its charm. As Hitchcock could tell you, what you never see is far more moving that what you can.That's my advice.

But I was shaking when the credits rolled.All anyone ever complains about is that this movie didn't live up to the hype and all that - well, the hype was half the fun! I saw the Blair Witch show on the SciFi Channel and I got so scared that I actually started to cry (at the time I thought it was all real).Half the reason people say this movie is ""stupid"" is because they don't understand it (boy am I gonna get it for that one). They went into the theater expecting something like ""Scream"" or ""Urban Legends"" - you know, with a jump every minute & enough gore to make it an anatomy lesson. Instead, they got a great psychological thriller (*Oh no! A change in the typical horror movie pattern! I can't handle it!*).I give ""The Blair Witch Project"" 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.

Unfortunately there is a ""is that all"" feeling at the end. It's not a bad film, just not as good as I was expecting.  That wonderfully modern cliché about being impossible to live up to the hype obviously applies here.The thing is, with all the back-story of how it was made this is a very interesting story.  If possible you should really check out the Director's commentary on the DVD edition, it really is worth the effort.  The problem is that to review the film you have to forget about this.  What you're left with is an above average film, which promises a lot for its crew's futures.The three actors are all functional; Heather Donahue really excels though and deserves to go further than this.

Basically the whole film just shows scenes with the three teenages hiking through the forest, looking for answers about the Blair Witch. It was over all too soon and there was only maybe one scene that made you twitch a little and I mean twitch, not a jump but a twitch.Overall I didn't enjoy the film all that much, even with the DVD version and all the added features, I felt robbed of a good watch. All I asked from the film was a decent storyline and at least tell us more about the ""Blair Witch"" however all we discovered in the course of the film was that the teenages were great at getting lost, hardly anything was known about the ""Blair Witch"", we didn't even get to know the characters. The angles of the camera were well done and even though it did make me a little queesy I must say that it was perfect for the film but even the great camera angle isn't enough to save this film.

Three friends and I tired to see this movie on the third day of the opening weekend, but it was sold out.  So a week later, two of those same friends and I tired again. This time we made it in...with only about six other people.  I know now why there were so few people in the theater that time.  No one was going to see it a second time, and anyone who had seen it before their friends must have done the same thing I did after seeing it...if a friend told me they were going to see it, I did everything possible (short of bludgeoning them with the nearest piece of furniture) to prevent them from seeing it.The home video touch was interesting, and had potential, but it just didn't come off.  The only thing it did for me, was give me the kind of headache and eye strain I get after reading several hundred pages of an engineering textbook or writing a C++ program.

Actually, I spent more time to stiffle my laughter than anything else.I know what some of you are thinking, ""The movie is trying to portray the emotion they are going through being lost out there.  Try putting yourself in their shoes.""  Well, I think I can imagine that desperate feeling they were supposed to be experiencing.

1237,djpaulsweed,If only there hadn't been so much hype...,8,17 June 2006,"BE WARNED - BIG SPOILERS HERE! this is one of my favourite films, i saw it in the cinema here in the UK when it first came out, after feeling intrigued by the trailer. at no point did i think it was real (i heard that for a while after the film came out, the actors decided to go into hiding because so many stupid people in America took the bait and believed it was real. oh dear.), however i was able to really put myself in their shoes, probably because it was shot in such an amateurish way. never before had i seen a film that did not show you what was supposed to be scary, and it is better for that.so many people have said they thought it was rubbish because they were waiting for some big payoff or for something showy to happen. admittedly, the hype surrounding the film did give the impression of something more spectacular, which did nobody any favours. luckily for me i never read reviews of horror films for precisely that reason, just seeing the trailer was enough for me.blair witch's dialogue is fine by me even with all the f-words. young people that swear will swear a lot when they're scared, and if you look into the making of this film you find out that there was no script, most of the dialogue was improvised. the bad language was not excessive because the directors had no control over it. they had only certain lines and events pre-planned and so the rest was made up. the young actors did a good job with this too.as for people stating the characters were idiots for not climbing trees to look for civilisation, surely if they did they would only see the tops of more trees? they were in the forest! also someone said they should have just followed the river downstream and they would have found some way out. IF YOU HAD PAID ANY ATTENTION you would have seen they did that, but with the curse or magic of the witch they ended up in the same place they were before. to quote ""that's the tree we crossed, it's the same one"" and ""we walked south all day, i don't know how we ended up back here"" or something to that effect. surely the idiots in films are the ones who know there's someone in the house trying to kill them, so they run upstairs instead of out of the back door or through a window.the ending was something really special, to find a house in the middle of nowhere like that would be creepy enough, but to hear your friend's cries coming from it is far worse. the things you see inside the house, and the final moments make all the stuff said at the beginning of the film make sense.i think the guys that did this have made a superb student film, that was exploited far too much, and it was made out to be something it's not. so for anyone who hated it, please take this advice - don't believe the hype about ANY film, ever. try downloading a trailer first and if it appeals to you then go see it. you have a brain, don't let the idiots in the media ruin your cinema experience again, go and make your own decisions about these things. don't forget, the critics thought titanic was awful when they first saw it, but as soon as the public started saying otherwise they changed their tune.",The Blair Witch Project

The lack of any on screen antagonist also decreases its credibility. Although at one point you CAN hear an owl. The three so called actors aren't that good, as i've never seen them in anything else.

It didn't come across to me as a real film.The Blair Witch folks may have had a good idea, I honestly don't know, Maybe in their hearts and souls they thought what they had was a good idea; but they simply didn't have the skills to pull it off or to execute it well.As with any other art form, freedom and spontaneity are all good and well, but they must be tempered with skill, control and compromise. This involves some mastery of the craft; many years of study and experience.

I don't think so!,4,7 January 2006,"Three teenagers disappear in the woods of Burkittesville, Maryland whilst filming a documentary about the legend of the ""Blair Witch"". A year later their footage is found.It's hard to know how to review this film, because the only reason it was thought to be so unbelievably scary is the great advertising idea advertise it as if it was real! If I had watched it believing it was real, I would have been freakin terrified. I would have felt the terror of the actors; I would have felt the frustration and the anger; I would have heard every tiny noise they heard and I'd have probably been hoping that they got out there alive, even though I knew they had been missing for a year, so it wasn't really likely and I would have loved (well, be left wondering by) the ending! But I didn't. I saw it knowing it was false and I felt.. not much. From the beginning the characters were already annoying me, and they just got worse as the film went so it was hard to feel anything for them; I laughed in disbelief at the ridiculous things they did (One of them purposefully kicked the map into the river when they were already lost (???)); and the repetition of them running around the woods screaming at each other and then sitting in the tents terrified of the noises they could hear outside, yet still trying to capture what it was on film, got a little tiring.And then there is the famous ending not so great after all! But again, would have been effective if you believed it. The only thing that still works though is the use of the idea that it's scarier when you can't see what is out there. This was used to good effect... up to a point. There are a lot of shots where it's all just pitch black and all you can hear is their frantic whispering about what the hell it is that is out there, or, in some cases, just silence and you're just waiting to see if something passes by, but this is used to often and it got too routine by the end.And I have to say I loved the hand held camera style of filming, very effective and I have to give credit to the actors they were great! I would have believed them! But it doesn't leave any real affect on you, so my advice: don't watch it expecting much.",The Blair Witch Project

Their trip was planned to go to Maryland, interview some townsfolk, film some of the historic sites in the woods and return home. A year later their camera footage was found.Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez decided to break away from the traditional cinematography and go with a first person view of the events that take place. We actually watch the majority of the movie through Heather Donahue's eyes. It was pretty creative and went well with the story and the actors.The Blair Witch is really a feeling movie. You have to pay a lot of attention to the film and really get into the mood the scenery and actors are trying to set. There isn't any monsters, no ghosts and no gore to be seen. You have to use your imagination and focus on the feelings of the actors. Heather Donahue and the rest of the crew do some great acting to suck you in and make you really feel like you are there scared for your life right along with them. The story kinda stalls towards the end as it seemed like they added some scenes in to make the movie longer but not noticeable on your first watch through.The Blair Witch has set a precedence for this type of genre that was fun and enjoyable to watch.

It would have said follow the river!! Leads away from the source which is in the Forest! Obvious!! Despite the above let downs, this film has got some serious good points. As a horror fan i like to see a good plot, a decent believable cast and a solid scare. This film delivers an original plot that has intrigue surrounding it from the get go. The cast are very believable as you see their true reactions, partly due to the filming and production techniques of withholding food etc!! And lastly this has the scare is amazing. You never see the force behind the scariness. You never see the people behind the children's voices. You never even see the witch or anything!!

Upon interviewing many of the locals, they discover that the supposed Blair Witch is a woman who was tied down in the forest and everyone thought she was dead, or something like that. Half the children from the town started to disappear, and then sightings of a woman covered in thick hair (hippie!).

1265,FZ-FX,"All hype, no substance",3,23 May 2005,"I have to admit that I too fell victim to the marketing hype around this film. It first stuck in my mind when I saw an ad for a special about the film on the SciFi channel (back when they didn't just run lame B-films). For those of you who are too young to remember the buzz around the theatrical release of ""The Blair Witch Project"", the film's marketing gave the impression that it was an actual documentary of three people becoming lost in the woods of Maryland and falling victim to a mysterious, supernatural power, local legend the Blair witch. It may seem a bit outlandish looking at it now, but the marketing was surprisingly convincing at selling this as an actual documentary, even going so far as to list the actors as missing. Through word of mouth and rumors, the film fascinated the public, who were left to wonder if the horrific events of the film had actually occurred. Even after it became widely known that the film was fictional, the hype surrounding the project and many positive reviews help the low budget B-film become one of the biggest hits of the year. Before I begin, I'd like to say that I'm not a huge fan of the horror genre; but not because I don't like being scarred, but because I am very rarely frightened by movies. The key appeal of a horror movie to most people is it's ability to get them on the edge of their seat, and it very rarely does that for me. There are a couple that have rattled me (The Exorcist, Seven) and some I enjoy for their plots or directing (The Shining, Alien, Day of the Dead), but on a whole I don't get the genre, whether the film happens to be a teen slasher flick of the 1990's, a gore feast of yesteryear or even the classic Monster pictures of old Hollywood. That said, ""The Blair Witch Project"" was an hour and a half of sheer boredom and sloppy camera-work. For those who haven't seen it, it revolves around a group of three film students who set out to make a documentary on the Blair Witch, a legendary figure supposedly living in the woods of Maryland. Seen from a hand-held camera, it shows the group as they go from being enthusiastic about what they think is going to be a two day camping trip to slightly distressed about being lost to utterly terrified at being pursued by what we are led to assume is the Blair witch. The film is careful to never actually show the witch. The ""scares"" come from the students terrified reactions to their increasingly dire predicament. As the become more and more lost, they begin seeing signs of the witch and of course begin to hear odd noises in the night. Some would argue that the film is scary because of what you don't see; I find that little is given to make us believe that their truly is something evil stalking the students. In order to make the terror seem real, the film mostly relies on one thing: screaming. There is rarely a minute in the ""Blair Witch"" where one of the kids isn't screaming their lungs out over something. Would real people react the same way in the same situation? Probably, but this doesn't make it interesting. The simple fact is that the movie lacks almost any tension what-so-ever, and rarely manages to surprise (the reasonably well scripted ending being the exception). To its credit, the acting does lends to the documentary feel of the film well. Since the students aren't actually shooting their documentary most of the time, we see them acting like fairly normal college students, which means crude jokes, pot smoking and an abundance of profanity. The acting, while certainly not interesting by any means, is effecting in creating the illusion that these were real events. The characters seem like a trio of goof balls on a camping trip, and their reactions to their growing troubles are believable. The ""real"" acting can't change the fact that never once are we intrigued by a character's reaction to the horrors around them, as the reaction is almost always the same: running, screaming and talking about how scared they are into the camera. I've got to hand it to the people who masterminded the ""Blair Witch"", because they certainly managed to do well; making well over $200 million dollars from a movie that cost just over twenty grand to produce. While arguably one of the biggest phenomena of 1999, ""The Blair Witch Project"" hasn't become the classic many people said it would become. This is all well with me, because despite the fact that it scarred a whole lot of people, the ""Blair Witch"" is a movie without a hint of substance, even by horror standards. I can remember very few other films that managed to bore me as much as this simple minded scream-fest. Perhapse I just don't get it, and I'm sure most people would be frightened by some of the film. Either way, I'm taking comfort in the fact that we probably will never see a movie like this again.",The Blair Witch Project

And i believe it was one of the first if not the first to do so. Sometimes this gives movies some good creepy shots but in this movie it kinda just made me slightly nauseous and didn't really benefit the movie in my opinion.There is no soundtrack so its pretty much silence besides the characters' dialogue. The film doesn't rely on obnoxious jump-scares which I appreciate, and it built up a decent level of suspense.

1270,mattjseed,Good movie but with low spots during the middle,7,31 October 2017,"When watching the Blair witch project I always seemed to be in one of two positions; on the edge of my seat or with my hand clasped on my mouth not in fear but with a sympathy for the inevitability of their demise and for this reason I would say this movie is a master at suspense not horror. Near the end we see mike facing the corner in what was essentially the last shot of the film. To me this represents not necessarily the control the supposed witch has in the film but him turning his back on Heather and resigning to his fate. A lot of people and media outlets claim this is one of if not the best horror movies of all time, I can't really say I agree with that statement as I am not as learned in horror movies as most but I can say the overwhelming hype for this movie is a little undeserved. While it is good at certain things like suspense the Blair witch project doesn't stand alone as a movie per say. This is mainly because the majority of the movie is focused on arguments and the characters going round in circles both in conversation and in physically accidentally retracing their steps. For this reason I would give it a 6.5/10. I think this especially when I consider the most interesting part of the movie is what happens after the cameras stop rolling around the end. I'm not usually one for tin foil hat thermos but I was curious, so I looked one up after the movie and ended up buying into one. Long story short he showed a variety of different evidence that pointed to the truth that Josh and Mike had planned the whole thing as an elaborate way of killing Heather. It's eerie how many subtle details you don't notice while watching the movie points to this theory being true so I believe that after the camera drops Heather is killed by the two boys.",The Blair Witch Project
1271,slbossman,interesting.,7,2 November 2017,"The Blair Witch Project (1999) is a movie that ultimately changed films that followed. It is about 3 students who embark on an adventure searching for the ""Blair Witch"". On their journey, they manage to get lost, leading to questionable events, leaving the audience biting their nails. Throughout the whole film, there are no actual jump scares or gruesome scenes which leads me to believe that this film was meant to built suspense. When following these students on their journey, the audience watches them struggle and sees them reach the point of insanity. In the end of the movie, Mike is facing a corner because earlier in the film they interviewed local civilians and one mentioned that the ""Blair Witch"" puts one person facing a corner while it kills the other. This means that the witch had put Mike in the corner and was in the middle of killing Josh, when the camera was knocked to the floor leaving the ending open for debate. I found this movie to be neither the best or over hyped. The movie's idea behind creating a realistic feeling to the footage and having the characters filming was amazing and was the first of its time. All the hype around the movie is well deserved as it was entertaining throughout the whole movie. After the filming ends, the audience is left in the air with all sorts of theories of what happens to the students.

Consider this review a public service, do not waste your time watching this garbage.",The Blair Witch Project
1273,jgfoot,Intelligent and scary,10,18 July 1999,"An excellent horror film that works on many levels.  Towards the end of the film we see that the three characters have as much reason to be afraid of themselves and of each other as they have reason to be afraid of the witches out to get them.  This isn't a message-laden film, but it makes a few neat points about filmmaking and the imperfect relationship between movies and reality.",The Blair Witch Project
1274,JoVa,What a horror movie should be,10,2 August 1999,"Most people who see this movie will either love it or hate it.  The movie is completely psychological in its terror, which is, I think, much stronger and disturbing on a basic level than the drivel which passes as horror films today.  If your idea of scary is someone in a raincoat/hockey mask/cheap halloween costume graphically killing teenagers with a hook/machete/garden weasel, then this movie isn't for you -- wait until the next installment of ""Scream if you Know What I Did The Last Time I Had A Nightmare when Halloween fell on Friday the 13th"" comes out.  If, on the other hand, your idea of scary involves projecting yourself into the characters and sharing the psychological terror they experience, see this movie.  You won't be disappointed.",The Blair Witch Project

I think not!!!,3,8 December 1999,While this film has received a cult following in a very short time and the concept is intriguing I must admit that this was just not a very good movie.The trouble with cult movies is that objectivity seems to go out the window and the film is not judged on its merits. This is one that falls into that category.,The Blair Witch Project

Why does everybody think this film is so scary? i liked the website and the mythology they put out, but the movie was BAD! These were college kids, who'd figured out how to use a movie camera, video camera and sound equipment, but they couldn't figure out a compass? For their information, just pick a direction and GO. It also made me sick to my stomach.",The Blair Witch Project
1277,Nixon-4,It Sucked.,1,22 October 1999,"This movie will not scare anyone with a dozen brain cells.  Here we were, all expecting a fantastic horror/suspense flick, and all we saw were a bunch of idiots who get lost camping in the woods.  No matter how lost they were, they didn't stop filming, and even made a in-joke about it.  I've been more scared walking home in the dark, and I live in New York City.  Worst $8 I ever spent, even after seeing 'Leonard, Part 6'.",The Blair Witch Project
1278,Punch-3,Amateurish Home Video,1,27 July 1999,"Grossly overhyped, The Blair Witch Project is an astoundingly lethal bore that spends much of its eighty minutes giving viewers motion sickness from its ""cinematography."" Most of the movie is video that's been transferred to film with occasional clips from a 16 mm B&W camera.  Nothing is more painful than watching violently moving, blurred, extreme close ups of the ground. As for the story, three Gen-X ""filmmakers"" set out to document a local legend, get lost in the woods, scream obscenities at each other, and then die.  I have two suggestions for Myrick and Sanchez's next project: a tripod and a subscription to Videomaker Magazine.",The Blair Witch Project
1279,crisps,Disappointed,1,28 September 1999,"0.55 am Leeds, England. Just finished watching THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. It's not on general release here yet, but hey, I'd heard about the film, and got chance to see it on video. Yes, it's different, yes it has suspense. Generally though there is no substance and no decent 'events' within the film. The premise alone may negate the requirement for graphic or typical plot devixes, but you have to question the validity of a film that seeks to exist on a fictional authentic-esque documentary film style but neither shocks, revolts or disturbs to any degree whatsoever. It was though a change not to have familiar predictable shock scenes, over the top mutilation or typical actors, film grade and of course artificial/background soundtrack. As a concept it could run. However, with no plot, it plods. And although the ending was necessarily weird, it just reminded me of the ending of Monty Python's Holy Grail. Vaguely interesting, ultimately very disappointing.",The Blair Witch Project

I walked out of the theatre with my friend Gio, who was chatting endlessly. I did not hear a word he said. Petrified, I got into my truck, started it up and drove. Gripping the steering wheel, I jerked my head at every litle sound, nearly driving us off the road twice. Now I sit here, terrified to close my eyes, knowing I will have to face the terrors that will emerge as I try to drift into a slumber. help me.

It's more like a student film. Picture the worst movie of all time multiply it by ten and you wont even get close to how vile this is! This is the movie that would get shown in my own version of heck.First of all the hype killed it - that and the spoofs - by the time you see it most of the footage has already been seen in commercials and entertainment shows.And the ""actors"" and ""actress"". Sure it made them famous but where will they be next summer? I wish they really got lost in the woods, then we would have never had to see them!Finally, this is a perfect movie for MST3k (may it rest in peace), more perfect if they watched it with the sound off.",The Blair Witch Project

It didn't get me thinking at all.  All I could ever think about was whether my girlfriend would get bored quicker than I would.  This is one of a long line of films that doesn't live up to the hype.  If you are a typically paranoid person or have some kind of similar ailment then, yes, this film may scare you out of your wits, but most normal people wouldn't find this one bit scary.  I don't usually watch horror movies and am not a big fan of them but even Scream 2 made me jump out of my seat and that is a pretty cheesey movie by all accounts.  The one thing you could marvel at in this movie is how they shot it, I mean, talk about original!!  The way it was made drops one on every other big budget film from a great height.  Ingenious.  Otherwise a really boring bland film.",The Blair Witch Project
1284,Jason-59,The scariest movie I have seen,8,29 April 1999,"If you are looking for a scary movie and you haven't been scared for a while I recommend this movie. By the virtue of the filming technique it creates an air of believability that you can't shake throughout. I have never been so scared in a theater before. The cast is awesome and the story is believable. Move over Stephen King.The entire movie sustains this feeling that you are with the campers in the movie, and you are as scared as they are. When they lose hope and cry you lose hope and cry. I honestly believed this movie the entire way through, with the possible exception of the end shot.Rolling Stone called it what it is: ""Scary as Hell""",The Blair Witch Project

I had figured that I would constantly be looking over my shoulder, waiting for something to jump out at me.  But, it never happened.  Don't get me wrong, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is an enjoyable movie.  The actors are fantastic, and although their sense of fear and desperation was never completely transferred to me, it was hard to tell that this was only fiction.  I just did not find it as terrifying as so many folks have claimed it to be.  However, I do find it effective in one area, which is perhaps the intended point:  ""The Blair Witch Project"" will do for going into the woods what ""Jaws"" did for going into the water.",The Blair Witch Project
1286,cjshan,Simply Stunning,10,1 August 1999,"This movie might just do for the woods what Psycho did for the shower.  The most horrifying thing is just how realistic this movie is.  This may not be a perfect motion picture, but it is a perfect movie.  What it sets out to do it does perfectly.  It will scare the absolute crap out of you.  I saw it in a full theater with probably 200 people total.  Afterwards, no one was talking about where they were going to eat or what they were doing next. Everyone was talking about this movie, and I assume that like me, they kept talking about it all night long.",The Blair Witch Project
1287,the-way-and-the-light,The scariest...,9,7 August 1999,"As the lights in the theater went up, every single person immediately said something to the effect of ""Oh sh--."" Then playfull nervous laughing emerged.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a movie that still affects me now. Like the people in the audience, I feel like I need to laugh it off, or say something like, ""Heather was so annoying.""  The simple truth is, though, that the movie absolutely terrified me.  Why exactly, I have few clues.  A friend of mine who attended the movie made fun of my slacked jaw and tight grip on the armrests.  He didn't think much of the movie(He likes ""Pet Cemetary."").That is why it is hard to decide whether or not to recommend the film.  Alot is made of things in the movie that go against typical ""lost in the middle of nowhere"" films.  Maybe the movie's lack of standard cliches, and it's ""Spinal Tap"" innovative approach is what draws the critical acclaim.  I guess horror, like humour, is subjective.  Some people are scared of people in hockey masks with chainsaws.  Some people are scared of things that go bump in the night.  For me(and the young lady behind me who jolted loudly in her seat during the last 15 minutes), I think the scariest thing is the idea that strange things are out there, and there is absolutely nothing you or your friends can do about it.Some things about the movie bothered me, technically.  The camera's constant movement was perhaps too real, and I struggled frequently to make out some of the strange things that the group finds in the film.  I was unclear about one particular detail towards the end involving a bundle of sticks(I will say no more to avoid any kind of spoiler).The bottom line:  The movie may scare the pants off you.  You may find it silly.  It could be just ""all right.""  All anyone can do is say what they thought of it.  I thought it was so scary, so suspensefull, and so primitively instinctively terrifying that I probably can't bear to watch it again.

And, despite the cool 1st person view, I found myself getting motion sickness more than once.When one of the stone pile burial markers was kicked over, I was freaked. I expected all hell to break loose. It didn't. The whole map fiasco was lame, too. It would have been more scary if the map had just disappeared with no explanation.

I am very glad I found out before going to see it, because the knowledge in the back of my mind that it was fiction was the only thing that kept me from freaking out completely. Simply stated:  If this film doesn't win an Oscar or two, the folks that hand them out had better just pack it up and forget the whole thing.  It has been a long time since any movie had done what this one has (neither financially or emotionally.)

(Spoiler begins here)Three idiots stumble through a wood that wouldn't hardly even qualify as one in Europe. They argue and swear (I don't feel offended by strong words but this was simply swearing for its own sake) and the only reason they kind of break down is that they obviously can't stand each other. And I can't blame them. Any sane person would hate each of them. They reach some house, one of them stands in a corner (oh horror!) and that's it.(Spoiler ends here)In short: Don't watch this.

Blair Witch is a complete waste of time and money.  It has my vote for the most irritating movie of all time.  After sitting through the 80 minutes of the film (was it ONLY 80 minutes?  It felt like an eternity) I felt like the film makers had lured me into the theater to kick me in the ass and steal my nine bucks.

It is simple and I think that's the reason it makes for a great story.  Horror, true horror is simple.  Nothing to distract you from what's happening and in this case, the filmmakers have excelled.I'm sure by now you all have heard, read or seen the basic premise of the movie which is (bear with me :) the story of three film college students wandering off into the Black Hills of Maryland in search of the mythical Blair Witch named after the town which bears the heavy burden of being the witch's primary target.  These three disappear, never to be seen again in spite of 33000 man-hours of searching and then a year later, their footage is recovered.The movie opens up with the kids in happier times, excited at the prospect of making a ""kick-ass"" movie.  In high spirits, they take off into the dense forest armed with their video cameras and the usual accoutrements of camping: a book entitled ""How to Survive in the Woods"", compasses and a map. Things take a turn for the worse when their sole map suddenly goes missing and things begin to go bump in the night.  One can sense terror beginning to creep into our character's lives insidiously and almost imperceptibly as they try to gather their wits about them.""It's impossible to get lost in America!"" one of the characters, Amanda, is heard to affirm with a little trepidation as day rapidly approaches night. Little does she know! Go find out what happens next.  I guarantee you won't sleep so easy after seeing this movie.What I have a problem with is this: The common-sense tactics anyone lost in the woods employs to get un-lost is nowhere to be found in the movie. There's a scene where our doomed travelers decide, after the loss of their only map, to travel south and end up going around in a huge circle.  They made this decision while standing next to a stream!  Everyone, or at least, I hope everyone knows that one way to get un-lost in the woods is to follow a stream which won't turn on itself and usually ends up leading out of the woods. Another is the insane insistence that they have of taking their cameras and shooting film everywhere they went.  ""Normal"" people don't do that but I guess that without this, there'd be no movie and what fun would that be? <wink> <wink>",The Blair Witch Project

It was the spookiest movie I have ever seen. Most horror movies make their mark depending on the realism. Jaws, one of the best and top grossing horror movies ever, hits the reality factor pretty hard as most people believe it could happen. The Blair Witch Project seemed extremely real.

The film makes clever use of the home movie style footage, but the whole thing is a complete waste of time. Hardly anything actually happens in the film apart from a lot of noise and blurred pictures. This could be argued to contribute to the chill factor of the film, but in my opinion it really just annoys by not ever actually showing what is going on. You probably think I'm just not getting it, but I would say that I get what it is supposed to be, but it really isn't that.

Then, the end comes out of nowhere hitting you right between the eyes like a hammer!  Heather Donahue deserves an oscar in my opinion for an absolutely chilling and convincing performance.  She is an absolute wonder.  This movie will scare the living heck right out of you. Honest.  When Heather apologizes late in the film, with tears in her eyes, you know fear.

Boyeeeez!,2,21 July 1999,"Oh boy, I think all of these glowing reviews for this movie are spawned by the wonderful workings of the hype machine. Once ""certain"" moviegoers get it in their head that a movie is going to be great, and scary, and wonderful, and all of that -- they will almost be hypnotized into thinking the movie is all it is cracked up to be. They will walk out and parrot everything they've heard everyone else say -- because it's the concensus and it is easier than going against the grain. Right now, it is apparently ""hip"" to really dig this movie, and say you've seen it and loved it. Well, believe me -- it is truly underwhelming. I think that is in understatement, but I do not know how else to put it.My severely edited version of the film:""I want to make a student film! You two are helping me.""""Ok, pushy girl.""""Oh no! We're lost!""(screaming): ""You @$$hole!""""Oh my god, what is that!""(Viewer, responding): I don't know, I didn't see anything -- but I am supposed to think that it is ""intelligent"" of the filmmakers to not let us see what is out there, because hey -- isn't that more scary?
""Oh no! We've lost one of our friends!""(weird voices from woods that sound suspiciously like student filmmakers)(more screaming)""Ahh, where'd the other guy go?""(guy dead in corner)THE ENDBooooring! This could've been 20 minutes long, and it would have been an excellent short film. But they stretched it out, and in between the So so opening and the Ok ending they put in a lot of crapola. Too much screaming, which is obviously the directors' strained attempts at coercing the audience into feeling tense and scared, and too much walking around feigning being lost.After watching the ""footage"" (which was the scariest thing about the film -- because of how darn shaky and nausiating it was!), all I could ask myself was ""Wouldn't these idiots put down their cameras if they knew they were being hunted?"" DUH! Come on! It was so obvious the filmmakers kept finding ways to make it plausable that they would continue shooting so that the ""being there"" aspect would work. It didn't. Especially the part when the girl is shooting the left side of her face -- with a light on -- even after they had talked about not having any lights on so they wouldn't be found. I mean, it is so silly and utterly unrealistic to be filming yourself if you think you are going to die. Who the F- cares if it turns out cool in your student film project, that is if you make it out of the woods alive!? A thoroughly uninteresting film, and not scary at all! What is scary is that someone would actually call this one of the best horror movies ever. I even read that someone thought it was one of thhe best films ever!? There are far more scary films out there. Don't get me wrong, I think the ""realistic"" horror film is far far scarier, and more respectable then the easy road of blood n' guts -- but this...this is just silly. Rent ""The Silence of the Lambs"" - a truly scary film that doesn't even fall in the horror genre. Or possibly ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,"" or even ""Peeping Tom"" These are scary films.

I really feel cheated, because I actually had to think with this movie!  I actually had to use this crazy thing called an ""I-MAG-I-NA-TION"", and ponder what horrible fates these poor kids had.  What a worthless hunk of garbage!!

This kind of raw injection, filmed entirely with handcameras, switching between black and white and color, no soundtrack with the latest hits in popular music, no superhuman leadcharacters, no people with inhumanly good looks etc etc goes against all what the market controlled Hollywood of today stands for.The backstory of this movie alone raises an eyebrow or two. And the movie itself do not let you down. Three innocent students in the woods, making an innocent documentary. But the subject of the documentary seem to mind, and their terror begin. They have nowhere to go in the woods, evil is all around, and all hope begins to fade. The haunting of the little team is portrayed in an absolutely horrific way, which compared to the trend of the late 90'ies in horror is stunning. The basic idea, which is greatly inspired by Cannibal Holocaust should be mentioned.The Blairwitch Project will undeniably become a classic in horror, nestling right beside the likes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Suspiria, The Haunting (1963) and Last House on the Left.",The Blair Witch Project

But I am afraid this film crossed the line. While waiting in line to buy tickets for this movie, I asked a cinema staffer if they had been receiving any good reactions to this film.  Her respsonse; ""People who go in thinking the film is real are disappointed, but I saw it the other day and LOVED it!"" So when I stumbled out of the theater, thoroughly scared, I had to think back to that comment and wonder what is WRONG WITH PEOPLE?  Had I gone into that movie thinking it was authentic footage I would have come out physically ill.  I don't know how to judge this movie.  It was some of the most excellent acting I have ever seen...leading people to believe, I'm sure that it is real.  And the dialogue was tremendous, the most realistic that I've ever been witness to...but does that mean I recommend it?  I can't tell yet.  I saw it over a week ago, but I'm still not sure how I feel.  Yes, it is an incredible piece of work.  But are we, as a society, crossing the line of voyeurism and taking it too far?  What is the difference between this and a snuff film? Watching something you are led to believe is real, or in fact, is real...

Instead, you have a movie filmed on home cameras with batteries that never die, and the realism is lost to the constant scary points being interjected by requests on how the cameras are running. Hypothetically speaking, ""Don't kill me... is this in view?"" is not good acting. The movie wasn't the least bit scary once the directors let the cat out of the bag on the public. The movie should be divided into three parts: The beginning, with cheerfulness, the 90 percent middle, chock full of leaves, leaves, and more leaves, and the ending. The best part of the film was the end. The credits rolled and the crowds roared that this was a hoax.
I was displeased with this movie. The constant running and moving, with most of what we saw being foliage on the ground, gave me queasiness. I welcomed the end of the movie for this reason as well as for my utter disappointment in the flick. The premise is great; however, it was the actors, actresses, and filmmakers themselves that ruined it in my eyes.

But I also knew that the movie was bought, they did not make it. A truely independant film, and a remerable horror film.While you are watching this film you may think it is moving along rather slowly, but the deeper you get into the moment, the faster the movie goes, and has gone by.One of the most amazing things about this film is the grip that it has on your mind. You have to listen to the movie, and the fact that you have to listen so hard to the background, that you may start to hear things that arent quite there.The Blair Witch does feel the need to wrap everything up, it's part of the beauty. The movie does not end when the credits roll...you are still left thinking about it when you leave...it doesnt answer any questions, it doesnt want to answer any questions, in fact....it's the movie that is asking the questions and it is up to the audience to come up with it's own answers....",The Blair Witch Project

Alot of the scares actually came from the film-makers reactions, feeling of hopelessness and dread of the dark. This film plays heavy on your fear of the dark, scaring you the way you used to scare yourself when you were 5 and in the dark.  The last 20 minites totally steal the show in feelings of panic and dread.  I highly recommend catching this flick when it goes wide release on the 30. Hell, some movie companies are maneuvering their releases so they  don't have to compete with the wide release. Like Mystery Men and Deep Blue Sea.

The only part I would say that is mildly scary is the end, but that is all! I also found that parts of the end have just been taken from THE LAST BROADCAST and CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. I can pick out at least 10 points where parts of scenes which have been ripped off from THE LAST BROADCAST. Overall I would say CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and THE LAST BROADCAST are far better films. THE LAST BROADCAST taking a different view and so, not completely ripping off CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Don't bother renting THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT out, if there was any scare in it, it was in the cinema.

I had never heard of this movie.  Never saw any previews for it.  I didn't know what to expect.  What I got was an entertaining ride. I truly enjoyed this movie.  It was creepy to see these people lost in the woods.  The sounds and the way it was filmed is what makes this movie an excellent horror flick.  The sounds are excellent.  The movie was filmed bad (because the camera movies up and down as the person holding it walks) but that only makes it more realistic since the person filming the movie is supposed to be one of the kids who is filming the documentary. ( not a person trained on how to use a camera.) It all goes along with making it seem like it is a true story.  This has to have been one of the best independent films I have seen since Halloween.

The style of this film realy pushes you to use your imagination, even though there are times in the film when you don't want to, but are draw in to.

The Blair Witch Project is way over most people's heads. If you say you don't like it, then you don't admire fine art. There is no way to discredit this film, simply because it was not made to look like a movie. There's not really suppose to be a pay off scene, and there's not supposed to be a formula.

I think the fear of the unknown is more scarier than any digital monster or made up guy with a hockey mask...(although, I was scared by Halloween as well).  My brother and my Boyfriend both did not enjoy this movie.  They thought it was boring and unrealistic.  I can see their point as well.  When I put myself in their place, I know that I would not be filming anything.  I would have left all the camera gear and followed the river out.  It makes no sense at all.

Also, concerning the motion with the camera's, I am the type that gets motion sickness extremely bad.  I can't even ride on a kid's swing with out wanting to throw up.

I can see how the movie might appeal to people whose idea of great television is the Jerry Springer show, or perhaps people who have a pile of cat bones in a bag and pentagrams all over their floor.

Heather is shrill and annoying throughout... her ""method"" acting reminiscent of a bad introductory college acting course. Thus, the psychological horror that the film is going for never quite hits the target. The 'seasick' inducing camera shots don't help, either. Additionally, when the actors get stuck as to what they should be doing, they solve the conundrum by screaming at each other and having a ""dramatic fight scene."" Too little substance.

It goes from incredibly boring (during the days) to just plain boring (at night), etc., ad nauseam. I wanted to leave, but was hoping for an old fashioned slasher movie ending where theses annoying characters were butchered. It's horribly shot. It does not look like a real documentary student film. I've known film students and seen student films. The camera is way too shaky. Real documentaries and student films do not look like this. It should have been a 7 minute short on Saturday Night Live and then it would only have been fair. 1:20 or however long it was (it seemed like I was in the theater the as long as they were in those woods) was much too long.

The use of the documentary camera to set the perspective was interesting, and the true-to-life characters broke the artificial molds that Hollywood usually tosses us.  Unfortunately, marginal story development/execution gradually tanked the film. Blair Witch was certainly creative and unique, but this alone combined with a scary premise and a low budget does not necessarily yield ""quality"".  Some of the folks unfamiliar with art / experimental films have found theirselves without a benchmark and have aligned themselves loosely along this film's marketing efforts.

She would be being congratulated for acting when all she was doing was portraying herself as she had no idea what was going on anyway.

What dominated the show were the conflicts among the 3 persons, accentuated by the fact that they were lost, and the stress induced by lack of food, rest and a good bath!Their conflicts became petty, self-centred and juvenile, which came out in the form of screaming sessions, sarcastic remarks and finger-pointing routine. They were just too distracting for me to enjoy the horror (if there were any in the first place).I can't call this a horror film. Maybe a showcase of young people in extreme duress coupled with psychological trauma. Or perhaps a teenage film telling what will happen to you if you hang out with pals whom you don't know well.

Bad acting, horrible camera work (OK, it is supposed to look authentic, but even by documentary standards it is bad), a story line that fits under a closed door and none-existing narration.I cannot think of one redeeming feature that makes the `Blair Witch' worth watching.I noted the `suspense' and `innovative plot' remarks in other user's comments.Actually, while I appreciate other people's opinions, I personally don't even begin to understand where they are coming from.For example - what was spooky, frightening or suspenseful about this movie???OK - I've been in the Army and spent time deep in the bush . not just in a park like setting like the `Blair Witch' guys were strolling through. I have seen more frightening and intimidating things on Army training grounds like what's pictured in the movie. Does anyone really think that `witch' thing was frightening??? Well, I hope they never meet a drill sergeant in their lives . especially not in a forest!!!Also, how could these guys possibly get lost? A road is a continuous line, which divides any given area. If you know in which direction the road is (these guys even had a compass), just hike in a straight line towards it. You cannot miss it. OK, these guys walked in circles (how you do this with a compass is a mystery (maybe the only one in `Blair Witch')). Why didn't they just walk up or down one of plentiful streams they passed?Therefore, the summary of `Blair Witch' could be:Three resource less idiots (played by abysmally bad actors) go into a forest looking for signs of witchcraft or a witch and get lost. They get scared, and even the little intelligence they displayed in the beginning evaporates. After that, they do everything wrong, bicker a lot with each other in the most senseless way and finally disappear is an abandoned house in the forest that may or may not have anything to do with the witch they were looking for.The whole think is played out in about 80 tedious minutes, filmed with poorly handled handheld cameras, bad sound or no refinement commonly associated with film making.Or, as a one-liner:A student film project gone horribly wrong.My opinion: 10/10 for the marketing, ***minus***5***/10 for the movie.

Apart from that the story is on average level and the characters seem to be a little bit...let me say ""stupid"", even after days they act like: ""...Where to go now ?

It never implies once it's fictional, and the style it was shot backs this up, and that for me makes this movie what it is - pant soilingly scary.",The Blair Witch Project
1345,drewinlove,"I know it's a fake, but still scary.",10,12 October 2001,"Before I saw ""the Blair witch project"", all of the mass media said that it was a fiction, more real than a non-fiction. I took it as a commercial thing, only to raise concern. They also recommended to go ad check the ""Blairwitch.com"", an official web site of the movie.( Later,I was aware of the fact that without the basic information of the movie, it isn't scary at all.) I took their recommend and saw the movie finally. At first, the trembling of the scenes and unfamiliar actors seemed to me that it was pretending to be a sort of documentaries. But as running of the movie, I found myself trembling with fear just like the actors doing at the scenes. Even the subject of the fear,like Freddy Kruger, appears enough. It just gives you the feelings that you are chased with something, and you can sleep peacefully no more. It's the beauty of the film. It's not that kind of bloody horror movie. Without lots of blood, screaming, and chopped body, the Blair witch project team made it a really scary movie. Except The Blair Witch Project and The Exorcist, no horror movie made it ""horror"" only with unidentified thing and people's fear and insanity ever. I know it's a fake, but still scary. Literally SCARY.",The Blair Witch Project
1346,kevo101,Don't listen to the hype!!!,6,8 March 2001,"'The Blair Witch Project', not many people won't have heard of this film. Although directors Sanchez and Myrick are sitting pretty (che-ching!) after the box office success of this movie, many people came out from watching it very unsatisfied.Basically, three student filmakers get lost in the woods while making a documentary about the 'Blair Witch'. They get lost in the woods and some weird stuff happens.The directors cunningly set up a website making the whole thing out to be real, which is when 'Blair Witch mania' began.By the time it was released over in Zone 2, it was riding on such a huge wave of hype that it was never going to satisfy the expectations that preceeded it. Therefore it is in my opinion that this movie is a victim of it's own success.Personally I enjoyed the film. The trick was not to listen to all that was being said about it. I remember watching on T.V an interview with  Myrick and Sanchez, talking about the response in America to the movie:""How scary is the film?"" the presenter asked.""Well, people have been vomiting in the cinema while watching it and alot of peole have been unable to not cover their eyes!"" replied Myrick.Not that he was lying- but was this because people were scared, OR could it have been motion sickness from watching through a hand held camera???

At this time, it was the talk of the over-populated high school I attended. So one Friday night, I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to see it, she tentatively agreed. Once in our seats, many people around us were laughing and joking about the story, and what to expect.A man came in from the side door, and put both of his arms in the air in an attempt to quiet the young audience. He was an employee of the cinema and he began to speak with an incredible tone of seriousness.""Everyone please keep all of you're talking to a minimum, and please silence your pagers(cell phones weren't owned by many at this point). He said. ""This is a true story of these three young adults, and of how they lost their lives in a very tragic way."" With that, he exited.The hecklers were reduced to a minority, and it seemed as if no one spoke for quite some time. There was an uneasiness in the air that both myself and my girlfriend felt. Suddenly she leaned over and whispered in my ear.""Come on let's go see something else..."" Before she could even finish her sentence, the lights died down, and the story began. We sat, glued to our seats, as it unfolded in such a way that you could barely tear your eyes away, and if you did, you were fearful that you would miss something vital.At this point, I was totally convinced that what I was witnessing was real. There was no room in my mind for doubt or logic, and the employee that spoke up in the beginning took care of that.The Blair Witch Project concluded, and I could never be more content with a movie after the first viewing. Normally I would focus on flaws, continuity, and the ever so popular question, ""Why didn't they just..."" At 16 years old, I had found the first movie that scared the hell out of me.

The Usual Suspects shocks the hell out of you, Taxi Driver makes you yell ""WHAT THE ****!"" and Rudy makes you stand up and cheer.But The Blair Witch Project is an entirely different story. Its ending is so suspenseful and horrifying, it can give you nightmares for weeks and stay out of the woods for the rest of your days.Besides the ending, the movie is not that scary, except for maybe 2 or 3 scenes.The movie tells the ""True"" story of 3 university filmmakers shooting a documentary about the Blair Witch that haunts the woods of Burkitsville, Maryland for half a century. They decide to camp out for several days in the woods that she supposedly haunts. In the midst of it, they witness weird sights during the day and strange noises that surround them at night. In the midst of it all, the filmmakers are going through hell psychologically. The movie becomes pure horror in the last half hour 45 minutes of the movie.Its a very original and creative movie. I give kudos to the actors for improvising all there dialog. Perfect for when on vacation or camping.9/10",The Blair Witch Project

Too bad for them.Sure, the film has weaknesses, but do yourself a favor and don't fixate on them. Instead, focus on the greatness of the film. The makers of The Blair Witch Project showed that you can make a great horror film with a couple of crummy cameras and a kick-butt classic ghost story.If you have not seen it and are thinking going to, just make sure to pay attention to the details of the Blair Witch/Rustin Parr legend as they are laid out.

1363,JimRaynor55,Massively Overrated Tripe,1,9 October 2006,"The Blair Witch Project is not the brilliant film that it was hailed as by the critics when it first came out. No, instead it's a uniquely-made (not necessarily a good thing) movie that just had masterful marketing. Before it came out, many people honestly believed that it was real. Even after they learned it was not, they were still intrigued by the eerie advertisements and the unique premise. Coming out in 1999 amid the backlash against of big-budget, visual FX-heavy blockbusters like Godzilla (1998) and The Phantom Menace also likely benefited this low-budget film.I'm not some stupid kid looking for tons of ridiculous gore in a horror movie. I can understand the idea that sometimes ""it's what you don't see that scares you."" However, I also believe that you do have to see SOMETHING, even if it's just a little, to be scared.All this movie shows is a trio of stupid kids running around lost in the woods. Occasionally they freak out after hearing spooky sounds, that's basically it. Oh yeah, at one point they find a bunch of little wooden arts and crafts hung on some tree branches. Real scary.The plot is nonexistent, as is the backstory (I hear it's provided in a sequel which dispensed with the unique first-person video camera perspective, and was just a plain old crappy horror movie). You NEVER learn what the Blair Witch is, or even if that's what's behind the things that go on in the movie.The characters are stupid and unlikable kids. I heard that the no-name actors were told to improvise their scenes, to make things more ""realistic."" Believe me, it shows. There's an entire scene where the three characters do nothing but scream ""F*** you!"" This movie which supposedly reinvigorated the sagging horror genre is completely overrated. There's not a single real scare in it, and the story and writing is pathetic. Save yourself the time and rental fees by passing on this film.",The Blair Witch Project

It has a wonderful realism caused by fine acting and the filming style (everything is filmed by the actors using two cameras in a documentary style) There are no special effects of any sort. It is quite spectacular to have a film with such an openness that requires raw talent in this age. The acting is flawless: the actors come off completely naturally. However, the only way I could find myself getting scared was if I tried to imagine it actually WAS real. That way, the noises in the night (literally) could be genuinely invasive and haunting. Yet, because I never saw anything, or heard anything apart from the screams from Josh, it was difficult for me to feel any terror. The figures and rocks that appeared out of nowhere in the mornings were a fantastic idea and, again, the reaction from the actors is flawless. Personally, because there were no actual jump scares or any recorded contact with the Witch for that matter, I didn't find it scary. It places ideas in the mind and leaves a lot to the imagination; I found that I needed more. This film simply is not for me regarding scare-factor, because of it's nature.

It taps into a common sense of fear in the audience: the fear of unexpected noises in the night, as well as the source of those noises, when there is no hope of rescue. There are some who say that this movie was not at all scary. These people were obviously raised by the television in such a way that they have no imagination and no tolerance for intriguing dialogue. And that really is the key to enjoying this movie: Every word that is said is a key to understanding the situation in the film, the mythology of the Blair Witch, and why the three filmmakers choose to record their situation on tape, rather than experiencing it with their own eyes.

It is extremely boring and depressingly unscary.  There is absolutely no excuse, in my mind, for the mind-bogglingly crappy way the film was shot...things are out of focus, it is jumpy, and much of the time the film is either completely dark or the shot is of trees or rocks while action is happening elsewhere.  I realize it is supposed to be a documentary shot by amateurs, but there is no reason to put the audience through that for some arty notion of what is ""realistic filmmaking"".

1372,Oryx,"Some supremely chilling moments, but don't expect too much",7,14 July 1999,"After hearing all the (what I now believe to be) hype about this movie, I was very excited to see the preview.  While the movie was very inventive and very creepy at times, it's definitely a case of the whole being *less* than the sum of its parts.The story line, about the recovered video of three college film students lost in the woods while doing a documentary on local supernatural happenings, is inventive and provides plenty of goose-bump inducing moments. The three main actors all do an *excellent* job, and each scene in and of itself is interesting.  However, just because a scene is well done doesn't stop it from being repetitive, and too many scenes rehash something an earlier one has already covered.The video, both hand-held and 16mm show the students increasingly getting on each others nerves as it becomes clear they are lost, and documents their terror each night when they hear unexplained sounds (and eventually more) in the woods around them.  But there's only so many times I want to see them all losing it and yelling at each other.  The strength of the movie is in the eerie nighttime scenes, and we could have used less of daytime bickering and more of what the movie excelled at.  However each of these nighttime scenes didn't quite go far enough.  They were always chilling, but never truly frightening.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, because the mystery of what is happening, and what is going to happen is at the heart of this film. Suffice it to say that I was expecting more at the end than I got.  The last scene had me gripping the arms of my chair, absolutely riveted.  And then it ended.  Abruptly.  I think I can appreciate why the film's creators did the ending in the manner they did, but I was left wanting more.In the final analysis, the film doesn't draw together, it doesn't cohere in the way it needs to, and that is why its individual scenes, wonderful in and of themselves, don't quite create as wonderful a movie in total.",The Blair Witch Project

It always gives a slight pulse-quickening when Jason drives a machete into his first victim.  But for that extended grab-the-armrest-until-your-knuckles-turn-white fear, only three different themes do that for me: religious-based horror, clowns (don't ask), and dread, the feeling that things aren't right and the cause of it is just out of reach, but coming closer.  All the best frighteners did it, from the two notes on the cello to denote the appearance of Jaws, to the silhouette of Ma Bates stalking up the stairs, to the wry grin of Vincent Price, to HAL telling his superior that he ""can't do that, Dave"".  The latest addition to this is The Blair Witch Project, which does it so well that almost half the audience I saw it with had difficulty breathing.The movie is shown as a documentary showing three film students, Heather, Josh, and Mike, preparing a documentary on a local legend known as the Blair Witch.  They film their documentary, but also videotape their experiences, too.  After interviewing a few locals, they learn, with the audience, that there was a disappearance of some children back in the 1940s in the woods surrounding the town, and that people have mysteriously dying all the way back for 300 years.  They then go out into the woods to film some scenes at different sites of the killings, and during this time, they describe the design of twigs that would accompany the killings.  Starting on the second day, they realize that they are lost and when they camp down for the night, they begin to hear voices and disturbances, and when they wake the next morning, they find three rock formations outside their tent.  Josh and Mike begin to blame Heather for getting them lost, since she was the one who put the whole thing together, and never bothered to scout the area first.  After the third night, they change from being a little worried to completely terrified.  They frantically try to backtrack out of the woods, until they realize how lost they are....First of all, I have to give kudos to the plot.  Documentaries in documentaries have been done before, but it works very well here, as they are still taping themselves in hope that if they don't make it out alive, at least their film will.  The premise of a local legend as the backdrop serves as an overarching fear.  Many areas have that urban or backwoods legend like the Jersey Devil, and this will remind anyone who has ever went into the woods as a youth and tried to find the truth in the rumors.  The whole trick is, you never actually see it, you just see what possibly is the outcome. The use of a simple black & white camera and a camcorder only heightens the worry, with the lower technology reinforcing the idea of just regular people.  There is a scene near the end when Heather holds the camera up to her face and apologizes to Mike's, Josh's, and her parents as she is so overcome by terror she can't speak without crying hysterically and running her nose.  The three of them show real fear as they face their own doom, and you can't help but feel slightly voyeuristic watching this.The main question of movie is if this is real or not, so if this is pressing you, stick around for the end of the credits.  This movie draws on the most primal fears we all have: the unknown, the things you can't explain, and the things that go bump in the night.  Not seeing what is happening is what creates that feeling of dread.  It's the watching of things unfolding and the anticipation that delivers the fear, i.e. the hunt being much more visceral than the actual kill.  This delivers one hell of a scare and considering the lack of true horror movies of this decade, I would rank this up there with Jacob's Ladder and It (the whole clown thing) as the best fright-inducers of the decade.  It's biggest flaw might be word-of-mouth hype, because if you don't allow yourself to taken into a horror movie as a viewer, then nothing would scare you.  I also had to ask myself why would they bother to keep taping if they thought they were in such mortal danger, but obviously, the movie would fall apart if this aspect is noted.  I rate this a 7 out of 10, (definitely worth the price of admission) because this is a great original concept executed with great results, not perfect, and it is certainly not the scariest movie ever made, but it does sparkle.  This is a movie to see if you want to get a real pit in your stomach, and if you let it, it will.  After seeing this, you might think twice before going out in the woods ever again.",The Blair Witch Project
1380,Fedge,"This movie is more than a movie, it's an experience.",8,18 July 1999,"I found this ""horror"" movie to be more creepy than anything else.  It's all about what you hear but can't quite see, and that's it's power.  It never goes to far to become silly and yet it contains several comedic moments. Moments you almost feel bad about laughing at considering the trauma the cast is going through.  The story is of three students making a documentary of the Blair Witch, who disappear in the woods.  The only evidence of their expedition being video tape and film footage found over a year later.  This is well made one of a kind movie that leaves you talking about it for days. Go see it with several friends.  As I left the theater the only talk from anyone was, ""Was that really real?""",The Blair Witch Project
1381,WorkingClassDog,"Stylish, original scares delivered by the sleeper of the summer...",9,20 August 1999,"I went to see BWP after hearing the hype, seeing the hype, web-surfing the hype... being assaulted by it on every front.  My only regret is that I had been tipped off that the docu-drama was actually a movie, and not real.  If I had sat down to watch this movie, buying into the concept that these kids were real, and so was their terror, I would have been much more terrified.Make no mistake, I loved this movie... it is the most original scary movie to come out in years.  It brings back memories of the type of psychological scares that Hitchcock's films would bring to your mind.  Sometimes the *scariest* things are the things you don't see... this movie brilliantly illustrates that concept.  The scenes of the kids running through the woods, being chased by enemy or enemies unknown are genuinely scary. (I don't think I'll ever feel the same way about camping again.)Heather's screams haunted me for days after watching the movie, as did both kid's cries for their friend when they don't know where he is.  I have to say I was going into this movie expecting a completely different sort of movie, growing up in an age of slash/scream/gore/Freddie/Chuckie/Jason-type horror flicks.  I was very surprised and haunted after watching this movie. Highly recommended, 9 stars out of 10.",The Blair Witch Project

I will say that, no joke, this works as a comedy. I was seriously laughing throughout the movie. I loved how the stoner dude kept saying man. If that was in the script it was great. If that was improv-ed credit goes to the actor. Then how these morons were afraid of piles of rocks and bundles of sticks? That was hilarious. And since these people apparently were the only film students to not see Scream, I would like to point out that anyone who has seen a ""horror"" film should know never to run up or down stairs when you believe you may be in some danger.

If this is not the most frightening movie I have ever seen, then it's in the top three for sure. The film is scary not in the sense of ""shock"", ie. Jason jumps out from behind a tree and yells ""BOO!"", but scary in that disturbing way, that for the duration of the film, you have this sense of profound dread building up, the kind of terror that children who play in the woods at night and hear a scary sound feel for a brief while. Sitting in the movie theater, the most honest feeling I had was ""I just want this to END"". Not because it was a bad film; I loved it.

We all know what it feels like, but nobody can describe it accurately enough to make the listener FEEL it as we have.  This film does. The comments I have read on here amaze me.  This film is NOT about the ""witch"", it is about being lost in the woods and the increasing paranoia and fear that result.  It's a slow building process.  By the second day in the woods, the ""witch"" is forgotten and the filmmakers focus on their own dread and fear.  THAT is what this film is about.  Not a ""witch"" that so many are disappointed that they didn't see.  Little do those folks know, they saw the true monster of the film, but are not perceptive enough to realize it.

The dark.  The noises in the dark.  The unexplained.This is the concept behind the Blair Witch Project.  I won't say much on the film, just a few notes, because it is the first film I've ever seen that one must experience for oneself before one can truly enjoy it.You never see the monster.  You never see death.  All you see is dark.  All you hear are things that go bump in the night.  The scariest moment of the entire film, the moment that really sent a chill down my spine, is seeing Mikey standing in the corner of the basement, as you see the last few seconds of Heather's videotape.  Before it drops.But we don't see the monster.Not only does this prove an excellent effect, but the way in which the entire film was made.  All improv.  The actors never told what was going to happen.  Filming it themselves.  This is the reason the film REALLY works. We can feel the insanity the lost students go through.  We can relate to them when they scream at each other.  And, it's funny because it's the same way we would react.  The funniest moment of the film is when the brightest ray of light in the four days lost kids house is when they find a pack of cigarettes.

1388,ARRGH!,There has never been anything like it. Honestly.,10,2 July 1999,"I'm not the kind to just write haphazard reviews just so people can see my wonderful opinion online. I have to really believe in the film to get myself to write about it. Remember the movie ""Crazy People"" with Dudley Moore? It was a comedy about truth in advertising. There was a film in that film called ""The Scream"" which had the tag line ""This movie won't just scare you. It will F**k you up for life"". That line shoulda been used for this film. This is THE REAL THING. It's the most well structured, incredibly well executed film I've seen in years (hell, maybe ever). After a title card explaining what we are about to witness, the entire film is made up of ""Raw"" camera footage from both a 16mm movie camera and a hi-8 video camera discovered a year after the events on the media. The footage relates the story of 3 student filmmakers hiking through the woods of Maryland, seeking out sites of gruesome mutilations by a mythical Blair Witch. Things go bad, then worse and then indescribably horrible as they lose their way deeper into the woods all the while being stalked by something that may or may not be human.The actors are first rate. It's not easy to describe the ease which the actors pull the audience in with their performances. On one hand, I'd like to see these performers move on to deserved better things, but at the same time, I'd like never to see them in another film... just to bolster the illusion of this film.There is not a drop of blood spilled, nor is there any background music to be heard. That's right. NO MUSIC! This film is the only one I can recall that can scare without the use of musical Stings or excessive bloodletting. That in itself is an achievement. Sound effects carry a lot of the tension and fear, but it's what the movie DOESN'T visually show that is the most terrifying.This film won't be for everyone. The narrative and camera style might throw people off. The fact that this isn't a film you can dismiss with a laugh might throw others off.

I am pretty willing to suspend my disbelief for most things (like, I didn't even question if the house in The People Under The Stairs was plausible).  But I just couldn't make the leap for the Blair Witch Project.  I think that it was the premise that ultimately made it fail.Because the characters in the BWP spent so much time and effort taping themselves react to things, at no time could I really believe that they were all that scared.  I mean, if you were scared out of your wits, would you be peering cockeyed through a viewfinder, or would you use both eyes to look around?Ah, but then, we wouldn't have a movie, would we?The result is some unbelievable overreactions caught on tape and some eye-rolling situations, which made the entire movie as believable as an episode of Jerry Springer.  It was as if the emotions were overplayed just for the camera or for a drama improvisation class.  And, despite the ""innovative"" way of telling the story, that conceit, as realized by those actors, made the situation too implausible to be truly frightening.Don't take the comparisons to Jerry Springer and the Real World to mean that this movie is bad.

I saw it at a free preview in Portland, and the entire audience was held spellbound, dead silent during the final five minutes of this movie.If your idea of a scary movie is Jason hacking at someone with a garden weasel, then skip ""Blair Witch."" You will be disappointed. Go see ""I still know what you screamed about the summer before last"" or whatever the current dead-coed movie is called, because that's probably more your speed.

1405,gldkey,"An interesting novelty, but hardly the exercise in terror it's purported to be.",4,19 July 1999,"I, like countless others, have waited with bated breath for this film to be released.  At last, a true horror film, one that will follow me home. Alas, this is not that film.It is an accomplishment, in that same way that other ultra-low-budget VISA-financed films are an accomplishment.  It is also an accomplishment in the way it was filmed, as the epitamy of cinema verite.  But it is not a good horror film.Structurally, far too much screen time is spent establishing that the team is lost; how they get lost, how they get more lost, how they stay lost, and how they bemoan the fact that they are lost.  The vast majority of the film's running time is spent establishing this simple fact.  Only the remainder is dedicated to the nocturnal haunting and hunting of the group. This is a serious miscalculation (one likely borne of the filmmaker's methodology - one has to wonder how much night footage was usable, and how willing they expected an audience to be to stare at a blank screen in a too brightly lit theatre), a miscalculation that has the net effect of mutating the film into something more akin to a '70s-era ABC Movie of the Week than the future of horror.The film also suffers from its failure to establish any of the three main characters as the skeptic, the audience's voice of reason, their proxy on-screen.  The skeptic is vital to the suspension of disbelief in a horror film.  The skeptic argues that it's nothing more than a lesion in the temporal lobe, and not Satan, that makes little Regan act so poorly.  The skeptic says Camp Crystal Lake is NOT haunted, that there's nothing to be found in the empty rooms of the Overlook Hotel, and there's no reason we shouldn't go to sleep tonight.  WE know the skeptic is wrong, because those are the rules, and we expect him or her to either die gloriously or receive their come-uppance in some other spectacular manner.  WE know the skeptic is wrong.  But we need the skeptic nevertheless.  Without the skeptic, we're asked to believe that three adults will be overcome with horror over the sight of a pile of stones in the woods, that they'll lapse into hysteria at the spectacle of some stick-people totems.  This is ludicrous.Much, too, has been made of this film's ""unseen"" horrors.  True, a great number of the most nerve-jangling scenes in horror film history have been of the unseen:  remember the door to Regan's bedroom, a thin wooden barrier between us and the horrors beyond; remember 90% of Robert Wise's original ""The Haunting"".  These are clear examples of the horror of the unseen.  But they are horrifying not MERELY because they are unseen, but because we KNOW something is there.  Often, we think we've seen bits of it out of the corner of our eye.  There, in the carvings on the walls of Hill House - was that a face?  Or we can hear it - that nerve-shattering banging in the halls.  But there's always some clue we've been given to seed our fear.  And what does the Blair Witch give us?  Seven piles of rocks, then three piles of rocks, one bundle of sticks, and a partridge in a pear tree.  These are hardly harbingers of doom.  And what do we hear?  Well, every night the deranged understudies of the Broadway musical STOMP will stop by your tent and beat out a rhythm on some rocks they have.  Please...if you want to hear the sounds of horror, play back the aforementioned sequence from The Haunting at high volume some night, or catch the first half of Wm. Peter Blatty's much-underrated ""Exorcist III"" for some real sounds from the devil's boombox.  By comparison, the rock clattering of the Blair Witch isn't even worth a witty analogy.The Blair Witch Project is an interesting novelty, and is deserving of a footnote in the annals of film history.

As I sat and watched, I found myself checking my watch and looking around the darkened theatre during what seemed like too many uninteresting moments.  I left a little- no a lot- disappointed.  But after the conversations it started with my friends and the nightmare it gave me that night, I decided I'd have to go one more time and make sure I went with a more opened mind.  EUREKA!  It worked, and I love this film!  I guess you would say it took some getting used to.  I only wonder why everyone's giving it rave reviews and not a single one of those cynical critics has given it a bad review (hmmmm...).",The Blair Witch Project
1412,cgaros,Hollywoods new plan to seperate you from your $ more efficiently,3,4 August 1999,"This movie is being sold as a surprise hit, a revolutionary film that will change movies forever, and a fine example of truely independent film-making. It is none of these things.  As to the first, the release of this movie was carefully orchestrated by Artisan to maximize profits, to the detriment of all else.  If you think that this movie did so well it's first week because everyone spontaneously recognized it's genius, you're an idiot...it did well because Artisan hyped it on MTV shows, in commercials, etc.  Secondly, this film is not that revolutionary, and it will not inspire other film-makers. How many movies with this kind of jerky camera work (for instance) can the average movie-goer take?  The answer is ""Not many more than one"", and if there's no market for it, Hollywood won't make it.  Also, the way this film was made is just an exaggerated form of the camera work done by directors with TALENT, such as David Lynch and Oliver Stone.  In addition, it's conceit is borrowed from a movie that IMDB lists...go look up the remake section on the page.  Finally, if you want to see a true independent movie that became a success because of its quality and word of mouth, see Clerks or Reservoir Dogs; the film-making here is atrocious.  The dialogue is terrible, probably worse than Manos:The Hand of Fate.  The characters do little more than swear at each other and complain.  The ending is the cheesiest thing I've ever seen.  The people who made this movie couldn't be bothered to think of what their ""witch"" actually was.  Finally, the allegedly ""scary"" sections were very non-scary.  OOOOHHHHHH!  Rocks! and stick figures! thats pretty scary.  and funny goo too!  wow, im quaking!  I give this movie a 3/10 (and not lower), because some of the camera work is cool and the concept is a decent one, when we're not looking at a black screen and listening to poorly faked hyperventilation.  This movie was clearly made because THE MAN realized he could make a movie for $40,000 and still charge us $8 to see it.  Im sure they've spent many times what they spent on the movie on advertising all ready, just to make sure that all the impressionable people will line up with their money; don't get sucked in, don't believe the hype, and if you do have the misfortune to see this, rate it and get it out of the top 250.",The Blair Witch Project
1413,dorktron,Over-hyped disappointment.,2,3 August 1999,"I am not understanding the rave reviews found here.  The Blair Witch Project was an unfrightening disappointment that, in the end, left me wondering if that really was all there was, as many other people felt.  The final five minutes are the only part of the movie that even got my heart pumping a little faster.  Some other parts really just annoyed or confused me... there was too much bickering in daylight between the students, and yes, some have pointed this out as well: if they just followed the creek, they should have been able to get back, out of the woods at the least, to the outside world. The daytime shots, however, really got to me; after a while, you realize nothing frightening happens at daytime, and around 90% of the movie conists of daytime shots.  If the movie had more nighttime scenes that played with the mind a bit more (not this running around aimlessly with the camera's video off), then it might have frightened me even a tiny bit.  I give the Blair Witch Project a two out of ten, since it was intended to be a horror movie but failed pretty miserably at that.  One way the movie could have potentially been scarier is if they had more night shots and less painful-to-watch daytime shots.  Seeing as to how easy it is apparently to frighten American audiences, everyone should see this one and get their own opinion.  Many of my friends and I, however, felt this movie is a waste of great scary movie potential.",The Blair Witch Project

The first horror movie with a new idea since Halloween (unless you count _Scream_'s idea of mixing self-reflexiveness with straight-ahead slasher scariness)._Blair Witch_ is too good to give away.  It's not a jump-out-of-your-seat scary movie, but is increasingly creepy and nerve-rattling.  The premise is brilliant, the execution is perfect, and the acting is uniformly excellent.There are no flaws in this film.",The Blair Witch Project
1415,Sabien,"Marketing and Originality were outstanding, Overall what a bore!",1,2 August 1999,"I must say that the hype behind this movie was a result of marketing genius. Using the internet the way that they did was brilliant, and the way they got all the papers to buy into it was even better. The story was original enough, but overall this movie stunk! Those of you that find it terrifying or what not must have really weak minds and find really simple junk frightening.This movie had a great premise to be really frightening, but the cinematography was just too amateur to build any sense of fear. Perhaps had the marketers been able to keep a sense that this was reality than it would have kept the fear up a little more, but the papers and mags spoiled that and this movie stunk! There was nothing scary about this movie, the only thing scary about it is that I along with millions of others fell victim to the hype, and received one giant let down. This is by far the worst movie I have seen all year!Two thumbs way DOWN!",The Blair Witch Project
1416,lefty-17,A Successful Experiment!,8,1 August 1999,"_The Blair Witch Project_ is, indeed, a very frightening movie; more interestingly, it's a pretty successful experimental film, of a sort I can't recall having seen before. The directors performed an experiment in ""method film-making"" here, taking three actors, giving them cameras and basic instructions in their use, set them loose in the woods and (evidently) spent some time scaring the blue daylights out of them while they played with the cameras. The results are very effective, not least owing to the film's complete obstinacy in refusing to explain what it is you're seeing.  This film is possibly better enjoyed if you've seen the ""teaser"" segment on the Sci-Fi channel: it provides some useful context in which to place the actual film.",The Blair Witch Project

1418,heckler-2,Wonderful film making!,6,30 August 1999,"This was truly one of the best horror movies that I have ever seen. The best part to me and which most people hate about it was the way you never saw what was doing it.  I was just like in really life were you don't always know what is chasing you or after you.  The movie attacked all your senses it made you laugh, cry and even at the right point jump out of your skin.  This movie was like another I have seen called Cannibal Holocaust (I don't recommend this won to the faint or strong on heart) were they find the film of the lost film crew and see what really happened to them.  Both movies caused alot of people to think that they are real and not just a movie which I liked about them because they do look really and do make you wonder.  They movie makers are very smart in that they integrated the Internet with the movie (blairwitch.com).  If you saw just the movie you may wonder about the legend of the Blair Witch or what happened after or before and the Internet site tells you just that and also makes the movie seem all the more real.  After I went to the Internet site(yes I went there after the movie) the movie seemed alot scarier.  I would advise anyone to watch this wonderful movie and if you don't appreciate look at the web site because it makes it much better trust me.",The Blair Witch Project
1419,Stanton-5,A superb psychological thriller,8,24 October 1999,"I think that the idea of this film is a very original one indeed.  I think also that the story surrounding the film is the hook that grabbed me.  Let's face it:  this film however is not for everyone.  If you like to be induced and entertained by dazzling special-effects, blood stained victims running in terror, and sinister murderers that never die, this film will do less than entertain you.  However,if you like psychological thought provoking mind-terror films, then by all means I highly recommend it.  What makes this film work it's magic is that you gain a perspective of the three kids being hunted and stalked.  I felt like at times I was in the movie due to the fact that the actors held the cameras and this gives the film a certain flavor of credibility.  Rarely do horror films scare me, but this one did in certain scenes due to the fact that the kids acted in such a way that I would have, and this allowed me to get sucked in to the building tensions and terror-induced thinking schemes.  Truly this is a fabulous way to shoot a film if you like candid typed situations that lend an air of uncertainty. As I said before though, this film will not entertain everyone.  It comes up short as a horror film due to the fact that the storyline is somewhat vague. This brings me to the point I made earlier:  This film is not for those who like to be spoon fed the plot, storyline, or viewpoints of the director. This movie is slickly handled and well ahead of it's time.",The Blair Witch Project
1420,Motown P,Get lost!,1,6 July 2001,"This is a boring film about getting lost in a forest. It pretends to be a horror movie but it isn't.

1422,fancylad-2,Great Concept and Execution. Truly Creepy.,9,7 August 1999,"This has to be one of the most original movies of the decade. Very creepy, with great dialogue and camera work. While this movie will not scare you out of your seat, it will make you restless on your next trip to the woods. The interaction between the characters is great. It really seems as if this is a home movie. Nothing seems contrived. To really enjoy the movie, you must get into the characters and their situation. Nothing jumps out of the shadows with a knife and a mask, so their fright is all in their minds, or is it. You are left guessing, even after the movie. This gets my highest possible recommendation.",The Blair Witch Project
1423,KG140NY,Just didn't do it,3,8 August 1999,"Maybe it was the hype, but this was an all around mediocre film, which I probably liked less because the hype was so much.  Excellent concept, excellent premise, but it was no 'The Omen'.  I understand what was trying to be done here, but to be honest the one piece of information which you didn't want to know (that all three are going to buy the farm) was plastered up on the first frame of the movie.  After that it was an exercise in conclusion.  You knew they would die, it was just how that was the issue. And the how was a pretty boring trip.  I must admit that the stick figures creeped me out and the last 30 seconds were intense.  But honestly I just am not intimidated by a pile of rocks.  I know, I know, it's the simplicity of the whole thing that is supposed to make it work, but I just didn't find it very scary.The other thing, and this bothered me too, is that streams turn into creeks turn into rivers turn into lakes and oceans.  In the first 30 seconds they show that they have a field guide with them, but apparently no one read it. Follow the stream!!!!  It was almost like watching a cheese film where the dumb victim runs upstairs when the zombie is chasing them.  I suppose the possibility of intense magic precludes this as an option but we never get the inkling that that is the reason.  Instead, by the end, I almost felt like our heros get the benefits of their stupidity.Regardless, I must give kudos for I wouldn't have done better with $60,000 and I've seen much worse with 10-100 times that amount.  It's an OK summer movie, but it is not overwhelmingly scary or intimidatingDavid Campbell",The Blair Witch Project

After the first half hour the entire movie is the same thing over and over again. I personally didn't get scared. I watched the movie on an empty stomach and the camera movement made me sick or perhaps I got sick because this was such a waste of time and money. What scares me about the movie is that it has actually generated millions.,The Blair Witch Project

1426,Haleys Comet,Save this one for video/DVD to watch during your Halloween party.,5,5 September 1999,"The good, the bad and The Blair Witch... The fact that I saw Blair in a small theater did not help my perception that it really belonged somewhere in the realm of a college film production class and the annual showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Yes, I realize that the rawness is part of the reason so many thought that it was an incredible experience.  I can not begin to agree.The good: incredible acting on the part of all of the characters in this film, especially Heather Donahue as herself.  They truly convince me that this was film from an amateur's escapade (unfortunately part of the bad.)  I could see their emotional decline and feel their hopelessness and frustration.  The bad: Almost all character development was diminished by the monotony of the plot (see bottom for generalization  WARNING:  POSSIBLE SPOILER).  I was at no time scared by anything in the film, and toward the end was wishing something, anything, would really happen.  The Blair Witch: Where is she?  Who is she?  What the h*ll is she doing? 
All in all, Blair seems like a reoccurring nightmare.  When it's over, you're really relieved and hope you don't have to go through it again.  The Blair Witch Project proves that you can have almost flawless acting, but if you don't have a direction, a plot or some sort of clarification, you can't have a truly great story.  I can't tell you that Blair Witch is the worst movie I have seen.  In fact it wasn't bad at all, but it definitely has a sense of not belonging in theaters and a lot of filler. Even for a film that lasted only 83 minutes, it seemed to be incredibly long.  Save this one for video/DVD to watch during your Halloween party.  * * ½  or 5 out of possible 10.

It's not the fact that they had no budget that makes this movie terrible, it is very groundbreaking in a way. Are we really supposed to be scared by wooden people hanging in the woods, this movie created no real tone or mood for me, nothing is explained and everything comes across as stupid. The female lead does a good job of acting but her scream will almost make you want to run out of the theater.

Even though it's short, some of my fellow theater-goers were bored after an hour and laughed at times when the tension should have been getting thicker.

This is just pure psychological horror and now I can't walk into a room without checking every corner.  I am never going camping or even going near any kind of wooded area again.  I must give the Blair Witch Project kudos for being the most terrifying movie I have ever seen.",The Blair Witch Project
1431,Billp-3,I'm sorry they found the footage,3,6 August 1999,"What a disappointment!  Perhaps if I had thought, as apparently some friends of mine did, that this was real as opposed to a movie, I might have been genuinely frightened.  Instead I was bored.  A group of people screaming at each other and telling us that they are scared is not, in itself, frightening.  At some point, something has to happen.The 'innovative' approach of this film, while certainly a good idea, is very frustrating in execution.  On a large screen the jerkiness of the film is at times almost nauseating.  The camera frequently focuses on the ground as whichever character that is holding it lets their arm drop, and at times it isn't actually focused at all.  The result - a static and blurred image accompanied by off-camera arguing - is less than appealing.The central characters do a good job of improving their way through the scenes (they are decent actors), but the lack of structure leads to some fairly aimless, pointless scenes.Finally, it's not scary.  The idea that what we can't see is more frightening than what we can see has been used to great effect in the past (witness Robert Wise's 'The Haunting') but only in very carefully made films.  Edge-of-your-seat tension must be painstakingly built, and cannot happen by accident.",The Blair Witch Project

Unfortunately, this movie does not do that.Now, I like all kinds of movies, and especially love the kinds that scare you to death. Although I was on the edge of my seat waiting for something to happen, ""it"" never really happenned, and what I was left with was disappointment, and nausea, not from being disturbed or scared, but rather from the annoying camerawork to give it the faux-documentary look. In many horror films, you find yourself screaming to the screen, ""Don't go down there!"" or ""Watch out behind you!"" In this case, you find yourself asking, ""How is that possible that you are so stupid?"" or ""When is someone going to die?"" This is partly due to the fact that the characters are a little annoying, so you have no sympathy. And second, they really are THAT stupid. (How can you manage to navigate yourself in a complete circle hiking all day, if you plan to just go south?? Can't you just use the sun?)On the upswing, there are some images which are very creepy, ones that would give you nightmares. But, it's not enough to make this film work.

At that time, I knew NOTHING about it except its stated premise: 3 filmmakers are lost in the woods and a year later their footage is found.  So I went, very sure that this was not the actual case.  The ending credits belied the premise.  It was ""only a movie"" after all.  Yet, throughout, I found myself involved and then I would pull myself out and say, ""would they really do that.""  I must tell you.  For pure veracity, this film is unbeatable.  It could be exactly what it says. To think such an effective film could be made for under $50,000, and have such talented actors, that the actors were the camera operators and improvise their lines, and that we see absolutely nothing that is inherently frightening, is quite amazing.  Everything that scares us is what we do not see. This is one of the best conceived film projects I have ever seen.  It uses its medium (this could be done in NO other art form) and hits where it intends.  By the way, on a more prosaic level such as was the directing/writing good? the performances sound? YES!

1440,Justin C,very chilling movie!!,8,1 August 1999,"I saw ""The Blair Witch Project"" in Memphis yesterday, and let me tell you, you have to see this!! It is one of the creepiest movies ever made. The final 30 seconds of the movie is the best part, and it is one of the best endings I have ever seen in a movie, and definitely the best in a horror movie. The final scene is so creepy, it makes me scared just thinking about it. It's a totally original movie (well, almost). The atmosphere of the movie reminds me of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", which, by the way, is my favorite horror movie. The movie has a lot of profanity in it, but it is worth watching again just to see the ending again. To fully understand the ending, you have to understand the stories at the beginning. I was actually scared last night before I went to bed, and it's been a long time since I was that scared after a movie.I went into this movie thinking it was a true story, and I think this is the best way to approach the movie. I had a unique, unsettling experience unlike any I've had in watching a movie before. A warning: this movie will not work for you unless you use a lot of imagination during and after the movie.
After the movie, you are not likely to say, ""Wow, that was a really scary movie."" It is in the hours that follow after the movie when you think about the ending and the rest of the movie when the horror really sets in. This is no ""Scream"", ""Halloween"", or ""Friday the 13th."" It is a refreshing turn for the better for the horror genre after a recent raft of hip teen horror flicks like ""Scream"", ""I Know What you did"", and ""Carrie 2"".

1441,WillPowerATL,"An Interesting experiment, but failed in some aspects...",3,18 July 1999,"Perhaps it was the buildup that killed this movie for me. Since I work in the entertainment industry, I have many friends who have already been to see screenings of this film in various cities, and although reviews were mixed, there were actually several who defined it as ""the scariest movie I have ever seen.""  When I went, I tried to keep my expectations low, so I wouldn't be disappointed, but it didn't work.This film just didn't scare me. I was impressed with the concept, and the improvisation of the three young actors was, at times, more original and heart-felt than most of the acting I have seen lately in big-budget films. But despite this supernova of creativity, BWP never became more than an interesting experiment for me.  The gaping holes and inconsistencies in the story made me think about things too much, and some of the improvisation and events were obviously ""goal-oriented,"" and were too contrived to effectively mesh with the rest of the film's naturalistic methods.  In all, there were many times where I had to say, ""No way, someone in this situation wouldn't do that!"" or even ""What is that supposed to be? I don't get it.""Although I am glad I saw the movie, apparently I didn't share the same experience most of my fellow moviegoers did. It seemed to me like I had just sat through a two-hour campfire story, but one told by a novice storyteller. I found myself picking at the inconsistencies, and feeling let down.  After several hours of buildup, I left the theater unfulfilled.Again, I seem to be the only one that thought this.  Most of my friends LOVED the film.  Of course, most of them are idiots, so don't take their advice.  See it on the matinee to really get your money's worth.",The Blair Witch Project

The less you know about this creepy little chiller, the better.Filmed on video and 16mm black & white, this film is exactly what the horror genre needs in a time reminiscent of the early 1980s slasher onslaught.

We see what the three film makers see as they make their way through the deep, dank woods in search of a legendary witch. There are times when there is nothing but a black screen, and all we can do is listen to their scared voices and the unexplained noises going on around them. The true horror behind this film is the unknown, and those dark places where you know something is lurking.If you are a seasoned veteran of the horror cinema, The Blair Witch Project may be less frightening than for someone who has not seen many scary movies. You will have to respect it's originality, and it's manipulation of our deepest fears. At times the film really makes you feel the sense of dread the film makers are experiencing. One thing I did notice about the audience in the theater is that everyone was very quiet. Except for an occasional gasp, the moviegoers were absorbed in this film. That's unusual for a modern horror movie. Most are full of fake scare tactics and multiple twist endings that keep the audience shouting and screaming at the screen. One thing for sure, you can expect many imitations of The Blair Witch Project in the future. Isn't that how it usually goes?",The Blair Witch Project
1443,madde-4,Not a very good movie,2,19 September 1999,"[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]Why this movie ever has gotten anyone's attention or admiration is a mystery to me.Before watching I had read about it on the net, in newspaper's and so on. Therefore I was expecting something new, something out of the ordinary, something memorable, but this was just a waste of time. Mostly it reminded me of movies that one of my friends used to produce in his backyard when we were at school and the dialogue in his films was better. That this movie has gotten the attention it has could only happen in the States, I think, where the craving for something new is more pertinent than the craving for something good.First of all there is nothing remotely scary about it, just three kids in long johns running around in the middle of the night frightening each other. Secondly the 'realism' is plain phony and the story is badly told, nothing hangs together. The quest these kids are undertaking is badly researched, badly prepared and badly executed. The witch never becomes real in any true sense, so the story of her fails to add to the scare. All the things the kids encounter in the woods has the feel of silly pranks and Josh' disappearance makes no sense. Nobody in their right mind would toss the map and nobody in their right mind would follow the female lead anywhere, since she's constantly screaming and commanding the guys around. I surprised they didn't make her disappear instead.This could perhaps have been a good movie and even a scary one, but it would need some script work, a knowledge of plot structure and better actors, not just a snappy web site or two.",The Blair Witch Project

When it came time to see it, I was more than drawn in, I was there in person.That's how real it was, which was what the directors wanted, no doubt.  They succeeded, as I was captivated from beginning to end with 'characters' that I could sympathize with.And the ending...it was amazing, unforgettable.  The last scene still haunts me as I write this.  The only complaint that I could possibly make is that after I left the movie I felt ill.

It is not meant to be known whether this is fictional or not.  It is not shot on a sound stage.  It is not accompanied by a full orchestra to entertain you through the slow moments.  It does not have a unbelievable plot.  There is not any supernatural effects in this movie.It IS: It is meant to be seen as a true event.  There are 3 film collage students out to make a documentary film.  Being film students they are over zealous and tape everything.  They more likely tape things zealously to extenuate their situation.  The movie is supose to be a timeline compliation of the film and camra work done by the missing students.  If you have ever gone camping and heard noises which you could not identify then you can relate easily to the reactions the students have.  Their terror is a acurate portrayal of common fears and justly so.  The movie is very realistic.

1448,Nate Dogg,"Whose afraid of the Big ""Blair Witch""?",3,7 August 1999,"First of all, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is NOT a horror movie in  the way all these teen slasher movies are these days.  It's way worse than that. After watching these 3 ""actors"" in the woods for nearly an hour and a half, me and many like me in the theater kinda went, ""So?""  It was different and kind of neat with the first person perspective.  And that's pretty much all it had going for it.The most disturbing thing about the movie is that people think that it's real.  Why would a true story shot with real footage have directors?  Can you imagine the legal implications of releasing this movie if it were real? I heard a comment leaving the theater from a girl who said, ""If it wasn't real, they did a very good job making it look real!""  Of course it looked real! It was shot with a 16mm camera by people running through the woods. But it's not a true story, and the Blair Witch doesn't exist, not even as a legend. It was made up by the directors and fueled by internet sites that the staff of the movie created.As a suspensful artsy flick it was great.  The only problem is not too many people like artsy movies that look this bad.  As ""the scariest movie ever"" it sucked and fell way, way short of expectations.  If not for all the profanity (of which there is quite a bit) this movie could have been rated PG, with no gore, no sex, no drug use, no violence to boost it any higher.In August of 1999, I dissapeared into a theater near Escanaba, Michigan while going to see a ""documentary."" One and a half hours later, my money was wasted.",The Blair Witch Project
1449,jensw-2,Under the skin.,8,17 November 1999,"Most scary movies are set in realities not quite our own. We suspend disbelief and immerge ourselves in this other reality in order to be scared.Some, however, have the power to let the horror seep into our own worlds and under our own skins, and that's when things get really scary. BWP succeeds in this most of the time and I felt my heart racing at several times during the movie, which is a very good sign. On the downside, it was a bit unbalanced: between the set-up in town, the horror elements and the ""drama"" elements.Nevertheless, a great film...",The Blair Witch Project
1450,Lisa M.,Is this all there is?!!,1,12 August 1999,"I don't watch horror movies.  Haven't since being scared out of my wits by Alien on TV and turning it off halfway through.  But I decided to see BWP because of all the incredible hype surrounding the movie, and because I wanted to see what a couple of college film school graduates had come up with.  My husband and I went (he likes good horror movies), and we were both left wondering what on earth all the hype was about.  Neither of us (nor the folks sitting next to us) were scared for one minute.  I honestly don't get all the buzz around this film -- it's just three college students running around with hand-held cameras, getting scared by piles of rocks and stick figures.  The noises that were supposedly scaring them out of their wits at night couldn't even be heard clearly in our theater.  And Heather really got on my nerves -- during the interviews in the beginning, she kept interrupting the people she was interviewing or otherwise interjecting comments, which was annoying.  And -- correct me if I'm wrong, because I've never read a lost-in-the- woods-survival book in my life -- but can't you follow a stream and usually find civilization?!  To those who are saying that anyone who doesn't like this film has to have huge special effects to enjoy a horror movie, think again -- I did watch a few of Hitchcock's masterpieces and was scared out of my wits, with almost zero special effects.  I am just mystified at the critics who are giving this 4 stars and saying it's one of the scariest movies ever made.  What a joke!!  Thank goodness we went to a matinee and only wasted $8.50.",The Blair Witch Project
1451,Lisa M.,That's It?!!!,1,18 August 1999,"I don't watch horror movies; haven't for years since being terrified by Alien and turning off the TV halfway through it.  But I decided to see The Blair Witch Project with my husband (who likes good horror movies) because of all the amazing hype surrounding the movie, and because I was curious what a couple of barely-out-of-college filmmakers had done that everyone was saying was so creative.  I told my husband I'd probably have to leave mid-way through the movie, since I was prepared to be scared out of my wits. Wrong.  There was not one scary moment in this entire movie.  We both sat there, waiting for the scary stuff to begin, and it never happened.  This was one of the worst, most boring movies I've ever seen.  Yeah, the premise was fairly creative and a good way to make a movie on a $30,000 budget, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a bad movie.  I got really tired of seeing jerky camera footage and the three actors saying the same things over and over (f**k, we're lost!!).  Not to mention the fact that the three characters had a wilderness survival guide and managed not to know that if you're lost in the woods and find a stream of water, you can often follow it to civilization!  Also, they kept filming themselves as they got more and more terrified, and how real is that?  You're awakened in the middle of the night by strange noises (which we couldn't hear well at all in the theater; bad sound effects) in a supposedly haunted woods, and you stop to grab the camera to film everything?  The piles of rocks and stick figures that were supposed to terrify the audience left me yawning.  The people sitting next to us in the theater had the same reaction we did.This is an example of what Hollywood hype can do for a bad movie and of how critics will grab onto anything remotely different without stopping to really examine whether it's a good film.  Honestly, this movie is like the Emperor with no clothes -- when are critics going to start telling the truth about The Blair Witch Project?  I can't believe the supposed experts, the critics, who are saying that this is one of the scariest movies ever made. What a joke!  At least we saw a matinee and only wasted $8.50.

1452,Zohariel,"Very realistic, hard to forget",9,24 August 1999,"People say that the script of The Blair Witch Project was contrived and not clever, but this movie is incredibly realistic because it DOESN'T have all the usual witty Hollywood dialogue--this is what teenagers would *really* do and say in a situation that scares them.  The ""boring"" scenes at the beginning only add to the tension and realism.  I wasn't as scared as I expected to be but I was *not* disappointed.  It's true you don't particularly like the characters, but that only seems to make them more realistic.Now this movie is permanently stamped into my mind.  I can not stop seeing over and over the last couple seconds.  I can't get that image out of my mind.  (Not a spoiler...you'll see what I mean when you see the film.)
As everyone has mentioned before, you will be more scared if you are imaginative because this film is mostly psychological and leaves it up to your imagination to figure out what's going on.  Probably not a good idea if you get motion sick (I didn't at all, but some people...) or if you like only gory, action packed horror films--or if you are going to be in the house alone for a while.I never knew *trees* could look so scary....P.S.

1453,KevinB-2,Worst movie I've seen in a long time!,1,14 August 1999,"""Is that it?"" That was my reaction when this movie was over. I couldn't believe it had been hyped so much and offered so little.One good measure of how good a movie is is how well it pulls you into it. If you lose track of your surroundings and feel like you're a part of the movie, it's probably a pretty good flick. Based on that criterion, this one sucked.The gimicky hand-held camera shots were nauseating and distracting. Had there been a decent plot and dialog I would have overlooked the seasickness this movie almost induced.But nothing about it was good. Almost every horror movie I've seen does a better job of bringing you into the movie than this one does. It was really bad. The whole movie I kept waiting for the build-up to end and for the real action to begin. I really wanted to be ""in"" this movie. But it never succeeded.I suspect viewers under 21 probably enjoy this movie a lot more than older viewers. Unless you really related to the characters...which I didn't...I think it would be hard to feel like you're out in the woods with these actors. On several occasions I checked my watch to see when the movie would be over. That's a REAL bad sign.Did I say that I didn't like this movie?I'm particularly annoyed because I WANTED to like it. I'm also annoyed because I could have seen Sixth Sense or any number of other movies, but we chose this one. We don't go to the theater all that often; mostly rent videos. To think we paid $14 to see this when we could have seen something decent gets my goat. Movies should offer a money-back guarantee. Oh well. I got sucked in by the hype. That's show biz.P.S.

I think you have totally missed the point with this film.  If you don't believe that good art can be made without mega-budgets then you cannot fully appreciate art... many painters, writers, and musicians have created amazing art since the beginning of time in this manner (without state of the art resources)... if you think ****** **** is preferable to a poor, undiscovered yet talented musician creating real and challenging music or art, then I can understand your comments.

People use cam corders much like our students.  However the film did not scare in the least.  I wanted it to scare me like Jaws or Alien or The Shining but instead it seemed more like a MST 3k Movie.

It's also great to see a horror film that doesn't contain gallons and gallons of fake blood and computer-generated monsters that are shown from the outset of the movie - many recent ""horror"" movies could take a great lesson from this one.

There is little to push the plot along, other than ranting and raving by the three characters, and the occasional ""supernatural"" occurrences seems exactly like what they really are: B-movie quality ideas with little effect.If this movie scared you, I hope no one pops a balloon or anything near you, you might have a heart attack from fright.",The Blair Witch Project

1459,e_mclachlan,points for PR,6,17 January 2000,"Perhaps it's just me, but I didn't find this film all that frightening. Maybe there is a sort of fundamental difference in how Europeans and North Americans respond to this sort of material, based on our cultural heritage? Personally I grew up reading the original Grimm Brothers (rather crude material for a five-year-old) and Disney always struck me as preposterous and stereotyped. So this was hardly anything new. What was new however, was how it was marketed, - and I congratulate the filmmakers on one terrific PR-job. This one must go down in history, I'm sure. I remember seeing the fake documentary about the fake film on TV - and it was severely scarier than the film itself. I guess that was somehow the point. Anything to draw us in. Who cares what we think once we've bought the ticket. The film itself resembled some sort of psychological study more than anything else. Some have complained about the language, but I doubt I'd be any less foulmouthed if I was in the characters' situations - or even the actors' for that matter. I just might whine a little less, but perhaps it actually adds to the credibility of the film to have American college student behave like crybabies. The film did have some finer points however, like the scene where the camera is finally being turned around at 'Heather' and we see her being tormented (by now, I am sure we have all been ardently awaiting it). If anyone still wants to go see this film, I suggest you leave before the end because it will only annoy you, in some desperate attempt of tying the storyline together. Common now - what storyline? Please. You might as well not have bothered. Never the less; my unreserved congratulations to Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez.

When it started I first was pretty bored: Why the hell did I spent my money on that? But then the film started to work on my psyche. By the end I was glued to my seat, cold showers running down my back. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT accomplishes all that without fancy special effects. In fact, you don't get to see anything scarier that an out-of-focus shot of blood stained teeth, and sometimes the screen simply goes blank for half a minute leaving only sound. The horror of the movie is created within your mind. And that's why it runs deeper than any violent splatter movie could ever do.

Of realising that once you step beyond the glow of the self-congratulatory campfire called human civilisation, you find yourself a shivering hominid a million years in the past confronting the Outer Dark, and all bets are off.The impressively negative popular reaction to what, ironically, was an extremely popular film, says something about how comfortable, cynical, and amazingly unimaginative First-World humans really are nowadays.  We live in the age where a gun isn't scary until it's pointed directly at you, if even then...so asking people to remember how to use their imaginations is probably a lost cause.But that's unfortunate, because _The Blair Witch Project_ is in a class by itself in the Horror genre, and deserves to scare people paranoid.  It's a work that translates the ""diary found in a cabin"" idea popular among writers like H.P. Lovecraft, to film.  It demonstrates amply, despite all the jaded critique, how quickly the human mind breaks down outside of reassuring frames of reference.  And it looks real.This film cost me sleep, had me looking over my shoulder, distrusting curtains, groups of trees, and open dark doorways for days.  It scared me silly, and it still does.  Even writing this review scares me.  It's one of those films, like John Carpenter's _The Thing_, or Kubrick's _The Shining_, that gets scarier the more often one perceives it, and the more thought one puts into the dilemma.

Then again there was the ""up the runny nose scene"". Great stuff. The story was boring and not the least bit scary. The only good part was the final few minutes, but sadly it was too little too late. The internet hype created this abomination and the fact Roger Ebert gave this thing 4 stars proves he'd lost it as a movie reviewer.

Then within two weeks of seeing it and continually talking about it with friends/family, I started having nightmares about it. Really vivid, creepy ones too. Enough to make me wake up in a sweat and enough to make me glance over my shoulder when i walked upstairs to bed at night. They wore off after about 3-4 weeks, but any film that has that sort of effect deserves recognition. I thought it was great.",The Blair Witch Project
1476,Stinkytaco,I've seen types of rocks more interesting than this movie,1,1 October 2006,"OK, I'll go step by step to tell you just how bad this thing really is.Camera Work: Horrible! The camera shakes every second! It's so annoying and you can't really see what's going on. Most of the time you'll be skipping parts because of a black screen. You'll wonder: ""Is this important or can I just skip this part?"" Acting: The acting is just screaming and yelling and arguing and that kind of stuff. But do these people really need to put a swear word into almost every sentence?Sound: What sound? There is no music except at the end and on the DVD. But it's so stupid. Seriously, the opening sound on the DVD sounds like someone turned up the volume of a keyboard as high as it would go and then sat on it. The music at the end sounds like a dog and a cat ran across the keyboard.Story: OK, so there are 3 kids who go off into the woods to make a documentary about some witch or something. One of the kids gets lost or something. I don't really know what happens to him. So they spend some 3 days in the woods then they go to this house but then the one guy gets lost. The girl finds him like standing in a corner or something. What is he doing in the corner anyway? He's just standing there and the girl flips out and the camera lands on the ground. Wow....Overall: I don't understand why people sometimes force themselves to watch bad movies. Most likely because they want to see if it's worth the 6-8 dollars they shelled out. In the case of the Blair Witch project: To stop watching this film should require as much strength and intelligence as breaking a potato chip. It's BAD. DO NOT WATCH IT. WATCH IT ONCE AND YOU WILL BE HAUNTED FOR LIFE BECAUSE OF HOW BAD IT IS!!!! How can a movie just be that bad? It's inhuman! Do not watch it if you value your eyes and ears.",The Blair Witch Project

""The Blair Witch Project"" is perhaps one of the worst films I've had the displeasure of viewing. I saw this in the theater the first night it opened surrounded by little 15 and 16 year old teenyboppers who shouldn't even be allowed in R-rated movies. Don't theaters enforce this policy anymore?? This movie is extremely boring and it drags on way too long. The jumping camera made me nauseous and I was ready to walk out. Fortunately, the film mercifully ended to a loud chorus of boos.

You never know what's going to happen next, your at the edge of your seat, staring off into the darkness to see whats lurking there, this movie mastered that. Once your drawn in, it doesn't let you go. I personally, was drawn in entirely, I felt like I was actually there with them the entire time, thus is why the movie was incredibly effective to me. The actual story in the movie surrounding the legend is creepy as hell. Children are vanishing, one by one until they are eventually found butchered inside a secluded house deep in the woods. Killed by a deranged man telling everyone an old woman ghost told him to kill them all. The little girl disappearing for days, then returning babbling about an old woman who's feet never touched the ground. The whole making one kid face into the corner while he killed the other, then killing the one in the corner. That definitely stuck in my mind until the end. When Mike says, ""Its a house."" nearing the end, I began to tense up. Imagining myself in that situation is absolutely terrifying. Out in the middle of nowhere, in a forest in pitch black, your friend is yelling for help and you stubble upon a house...Jesus. When the girl descends down into the dark, scary as hell, cellar, that moment she turns and you see Mike in the corner, that moment was extremely terrifying and effective. The fact thats what that murderer would do, and he was caught and executed years ago, so he's out of the question...just gave me a flood of chills. Its just scary, there's no other words I can think of. I can only picture what else was in that room. That other kid butchered on the floor? The ""Blair Witch""? Yeesh, it just scares me.The fact you don't see anything is the exact reason why this movie scared the crap out of me. Im going to say what a lot of other people have already said, it did was Jaws did for going into the water and what Psycho did for taking a shower. Not only dark forests, but just staring into darkness scares me because of this movie. No other movie has scared me the way this one has. Like I said once you've seen it, thats it. Its only effective once, but hell, its powerful. This movie was a frightening experience, and I loved it. I can safely say, this movie is definitely one of my favourites. I just really really hope I don't fall asleep one night, and I end up dreaming up being in any situation resembling The Blair Witch Project.",The Blair Witch Project

1483,ficken_58,If you go down to the woods today you'll be sure of a big surprise!!,8,7 November 2006,"The Blair Witch Project does not use much blood or gore and there are not any murders to be actually seen the film but is still mortifying and could be somewhat exciting for those who like being put in the victims shoes as it makes you imagine being lost (in the woods) as we have all been at some point in life. The build up to the lost scenes are well done as it gives us a hint of what is to come but it also distorts what is to come by not telling us a single clear insight into what is to come which keeps us wondering what could the horror ahead really be. It makes a simple thing of walking through a lot of trees seem much more scary and makes you feel more vulnerable because of it. Even the scenes of daytime are unnerving and the reasonably wide spaces between the trees gives a sense of universal space from help and the daytime makes it worse because of the fact that they cannot see any signs of humanity. The only flaw to the film is the sense of direct action, the fact that there is not anything very explicit apart from the fingers shown it makes us wonder whether if a bit more money had been spent on the film it could have been a bit better and also if the murderer had had more involvement or made an appearance. However, the film is still a very horrific and also very thrilling film. The way it has been filmed contributes significantly to the horror and realism of the film as it feels like we are one of the victims as it puts us in the driving seat to nowhere.",The Blair Witch Project

Eduardo Sánchez,director""They wanted us to be hungry and tired, so they did the sleep deprivation, and they stopped feeding us... which is a great way to create animosity, for future reference."" Joshua Leonard, lead actor""By applying the same physical and mental stresses to the actors - lack of food, lack of sleep, walking them around, f***ing with them at night -, we hoped by the time we really needed them to freak out, they would be able to tap into areas of their psyche they normally wouldn't be able to tap into.""

We pressed on for about another minute, then finally you could see the light coloring of a tent off in the distance. Everyone took his or her places. We created a triangle around the tent but from way out. On queue - the guys hit play on the three tape players, out comes the high-pitched screech of a child - then laughter, then children talking. The actors are waking up - you could hear them talking. Then the guys begin to do footsteps in the leaves. Then, some of the guys go up and begin to violently shake the tent. The actors begin to scream and eventually run from the tent out into the woods. Their cameras rolling."" From the journal of Stefanie DeCassan, film crew member""...and the tent started shaking and we heard babies crying outside, and so I think that all of our first reaction was 'I'm not getting up... this is not happening...'"" Joshua Leonard, lead actorThere's something about The Blair Witch Project most people fail to realize. This is not just a movie trying to pass as a documentary with great marketing outcomes. This is the one of the sickest, most daunting, barely legal human breaking experiments ever made in cinema.Haxan and Artisan really went off their way trying to pass this as a true story until their premiere at the Sundance Festival. But co-directors Eduardo Sánchez and Daniel Myrick also pushed things to the limits while trying to give the acting and shooting a sense of creepy realism. For that purpose, they hired three inexperienced and unknown actors with high improvisational skills, gave them a crash course on the filming equipment, sent them to the woods in Seneca Creek State Park, Maryland, and directed them remotely, giving them no script dialogues and only a brief guideline of what was to come. The result is a genuinely terrifying experience which proves to be like no other, if you embrace it as it should be embraced. This is getting more and more difficult to achieve, as some parts of the movie have now been spoofed beyond maximum tolerance and without deserving that treatment. But giving it the proper personal investment, you will be dragged into the woods with three people. And you will feel confused, scared, exhausted, hunted, haunted, and on the verge of physical and mental collapse. All these were felt by the actors at some point. You stretch your physical and mental limits, and you will end up entering a different, unfamiliar reality, where nothing's certain or safe anymore. The most eerie and haunting fear of all is the fear of the unknown. If you end up being led by the darkest places of your imagination, you'll end up seeing the most frightening things under the dimmest light...For all this, and because I can truly feel that when I can create the right conditions upon viewing of this film, The Blair Witch Project stands in my book as the ultimate horror experience, side by side with the cult classics that gave me true nightmares when I was younger.Top notch.",The Blair Witch Project
1486,TingoMango,"Interesting idea, but not so immersive",5,3 July 2021,"I have seen a good few horror movies and I think I can say that The Blair Witch Project is one of my least favorite. Don't get me wrong, it is by no means a bad movie, but not as scary as some and very interpretive for the viewer. It's not overly heavy on tropes but lacks explanation for a lot of things. Unlike movies like The Shining or Donnie Darko, there are no theories that can be easily created by the viewer and it is truly a matter of using your imagination. This is intended to make it scarier, but I found it harder to follow- even taking away from the setting they created at times.Another issue I find with this movie is not in the movie itself, but the circumstances to watch it. I believe it has surpassed the time period that made it so scary. Upon its release, it was a new type of film with a huge campaign. Its image added to the fear because people were exposed to the story in real life. Seeing the videos and missing person posters was very convincing at the tine. Many people were left on the edge of there seat and wondering if the whole movie could've somehow been real. Obviously, we know the actors are fine, but as time has passed, some of the 'movie magic' was lost as it the drifted out of the limelight.",The Blair Witch Project

The children heard in the woods at 2am crying sent shudders down my spine. You could tell the actors were scared themselves.

In the acting game we say you need a level of emotional intelligence to attempt to get close to ""the real"". In Hollywood all emotion is primarily boring displays of self indulgent sexual grandeur and feigned ineffective, unmemorable performances. What's confusing is the amount of people who say they can give relative SUBSTANCIATION for their ""It's a great movie"" style quotes.

Despite being eleven years old, this movie doesn't feel dated at all and remains incredibly horrifying. Everything about this movie hits the bullseye. The three actors are all magnificent, especially Heather Donahue, who's gut-wrenching (and often parodied) final confession to the camera is truly chilling. The shaky camera effects are poor quality, but that's what make this film so believable. And although this isn't the first time that a first-person perspective has been used, this is definitely the most well done version. The movie just feels so raw in its presentation and every little thing about it works in. But what really makes this film stand out (at least to me) is the fact that the audience is never given a view of the monster. In nearly every single horror film, we are given the chance to at least get a glimpse of the thing causing all of the death and destruction, however it's left entirely up to the imagination as to what's really going on. So many questions are left unanswered by the end and it's definitely for the better.

Not ever seeing the evil in a film is much more shocking than any visible form that evil could take. I believe that an attempt to show us the Blair Witch, regardless of how inventive and disturbing this portrayal would have been, would have hurt the film. The makers of The Blair Witch Project rely on the imagination of the viewer to contribute to the true horror of the film. Is it presumptuous of me to suggest that those who don't find this movie frightening lack the insides that make real fear possible?Another complaint I don't understand is that the acting is bad; I thought the performances were excellent. The Heather Donahue monologue that imbeciles have been so eager to parody is astounding. The detail of showing the mucus on Donahue's tear-stained face is strikingly honest - and woefully underappreciated.Finally, I will admit that it is highly improbable that one would make sure to bring a camera when fleeing for one's life.

No thanks, I don't want any splatter orgies; I want the horror to be slow and creeping, and I want it to be in the mind. It is not for nothing that movies like ""Don't Look Now!"" or ""Rosemaries Baby"" are among my very favorite ones of the genrè. I think the plot is constructed very well, and the rising angst and confusion of the three people appears to be genuine. Their situation somehow reminds me of Sartrè's play ""Huis-Clos"" (""No Exit""), which contains the famos line ""L'enfer, c'est les autres"" (""Hell, that's the other people""). Like the three people in Sartrè's play these three characters provide hell for themselves. Some people complain about the ""amateurish shot"" of the movie. They don't seem to have got the idea that the movie is supposed to look like a documentary, so what do you you expect? Why should three people with no more technical equipment than 2 hand held video cameras be able to make anything more than that?

1499,jamesnightshade,Blair Witch Project is definitely a great horror film,9,8 March 2005,"I watched this film with my girlfriend, on video at home, long after it had come out. We were stunned by the end of the movie, and felt creeping dread in our apartment. We had trouble turning off the lights and sleeping comfortably. The premise of the movie is good enough, an easygoing group of college students investigating local lore, and finding themselves spun into a web of horror in what should be perfectly normal conditions, having fun, shooting an amateur documentary in the outdoors. It's strangely disconcerting that the""witch"" in the movie is never quite seen or explained, and overlaps with a murderer in the small town from many years ago. We aren't completely sure about the source of the psychological terrorism inflicted on the students in the woods. It is at once creepily unreal, witch-like, metaphysical, while also realistic, with links to a psychotic murderer from long ago. The imagery in the movie is justly famous. It begins with a simple pile or rocks, nothing more, but oh so suggestive. The vaguely heard children's laughter and cries as the students' tent is molested is an excellent use of sound in the film. The wooden icons they encounter hanging from the trees as the pressure mounts on them will make your spine tingle. The children's hand prints in the horror-classic dilapidated house in the climax are frightening. I've heard viewers complain that the students confusion and the fact that they find themselves going in circles as they try to find their way out of the woods is unbelievable. I disagree. That type of confusion and inability to find your way out of a terrifying maelstrom is exactly what a ""witch"" would inflict on its victims, exactly what can happen during psychological terror and trauma--like being unable to escape from a terrifying dream. The end of this movie, the heated terror as the surviving students chase a chimera (their captured friend's terrified screams), and their entrapment in the basement (referring back to the tale of the town murderer, told earlier in the film), the final, bleak music after the camera falls, is chilling to the bone.

1501,sketch_09,More Documentary than Film.,8,19 February 2005,"One of the reasons that people hated this movie i think was that they viewed it on the cinema screen, which considering that this was more of a documentary like experience than a piece of well thought out cinematography would hurt the movie in that it's true impact was sorely missed. If you want to see this film the right way, see it on a television screen, the way documentaries are supposed to be viewed, as a late night non-fictional documentary. I say non-fiction as this is the frame of mind the film wants you to think in, and this is it's main strength and why it must be seen as a documentary, not a piece of cinema. Knowing this then, you can throw away anguishes of bad acting, since most of the script was improvised and spontaneous, so it borders on the definitions of acting and a document of people's emotional journeys through frightful times. And by God, are they frightful. This is not a happy movie.This film grips you into the myth of the Blair witch right from the start, with interviews with numerous towns folk sewing the tapestry that is the story by making creepy descriptions of sightings made and rumours of what really might be in the woods, that creates the foreboding aura that follows the three teens as they make their way into the feared woods. A line from a woman answering a question of whether she visits the woods at all after describing almost the entire myth as preposterous, ""Oh I don't go up there ... no ..... I know enough not to go up there."" really just sets the scene as to what these kids might be sticking their fingers into.From there on in, it's an engaging, atmospheric, visceral and down right unnerving experience that never tells you everything but leaves enough on the screen to tell the tale of paranoia, terror and the overall deterioration of the human psyche under forces not known and never revealed to the eyes of the onlooker.

I mean by the way they react to different situations, they seem genuinely scared, and the way they shout at each other when mad and freak out and stuff- tres good.I also liked the way the actors were unknown..it kinda makes it more believable and scary...because if it was..i dunno...Naomi watts..i wouldn't be able to really believe it.But i am a little confused with what happens at the end, with the person in the corner of the room - i've heard that it's josh...and i've heard it's mike ... but I'm still not sure!Is it mike, about to be killed? or is it..josh who has been ""possessed"" or something...? and is he floating? I heard that too.. or is it none of those and something very different! Please inform if u know!",The Blair Witch Project

You could rate it in three parts.
The first third of the film is pretty amazeballs, because nothing really happens.
Then the middle part, oh boy, there's nothing really happening. What a twist!

1506,somersaultclemency,"Amateurish, not a horror movie",1,9 January 2021,"Honestly, it was one of the least horrorful movies I've seen. I don't think this movie should be categorised as an horror movie. It can at most be categorised as mysterious and that's it.Like what they were thinking of while making this movie? There is no real plot.The whole movie is set upon/relies on a group of young people amateurishly filming each other while cursing and screaming at each other.No scary visuals, because the visuals they put aren't even visible. No actual witch or anything. It's just as if you are watching a low budget Paranormal Activity movie amateurishly shot by a bunch of university students to have some fun.I am not against realistic horror movies,however this movie was just lazy and uncreative. You can still create a nice, interesting, unique plot with a limited, modern day horror type of plot, but this was just crappy.They didn't show anything except for some weird, annoying audio (annoying, rather than scary when it's supposed to be scary) and some unclear camera shots from the supposed witch's approach and the rest is just young people wandering around the woods.In the beginning, the interviews they did with the locals kind of created some suspension and tension, but they after they got in the woods, boom, it all disappeared. Then they jumped into the map thing, which is ludicrous, as one of them intentionally throws the map into the river and none of them go check for it.To sum up, this movie is pretentious and a waste of time. Fine, if you want to try new things and give a different approach to classical horror movies with realism, you can do it, but that doesn't mean you should take out everything and just show people amateurish and dull scenes just to appear ""different"". If this movie got that much score, it's only because people think it's different, however, it's far from being a horror/thriller movie.",The Blair Witch Project
1507,lralberg,A truly terrifying film,9,30 November 2016,"The Blair Witch Project is, in my opinion, one of the best horror movies due to it's realistic setting and eerie environment. The found footage format makes the scares unpredictable and terrifying. The film follows three people on a mission to learn about the Blair Witch, an urban legend of sorts in the woods of Maryland. It is shot entirely with hand-held cameras and equipment that would realistically be used for a low budget documentary like the one Heather, Josh, and Mike are trying to make. It almost feels like you're actually there in the woods since the camera shows the characters' perspectives.Perhaps the most terrifying moments are when the characters see something but the camera is facing away so the audience can't see what they saw. The mystery is one of the most compelling aspects of the film. The characters aren't focusing on getting the perfect shot when they're running or scared, so the camera ends up showing their feet or the blurry scenery. This creates a very disorienting feeling that adds to the ambiance.The film has a lot of subtlety. Plot points are briefly mentioned by characters who are interviewed or one of the main three throughout. As the mystery of the woods is slowly revealed, you can see more and more references to the urban legend found throughout the woods. Some things you won't even notice unless you re watch the film a few times. It's especially scary when the characters don't notice certain connections to the legend that are playing out around them.All three main actors do an excellent job acting naturally as if it isn't a movie at all. Their reactions seem very genuine and real. In some parts their reactions actually very real, since the director told them very little and would leave them alone in the woods for periods of time. The dedication to creating a realistic horror film is truly astounding. The final scene is one of the most terrifying moments in the film. Josh's screaming is heard while Mike and Heather run through a creepy house. Viewers are terrified about what will be around each corner. The film then ends with Mike going into the basement and dropping his camera. Heather then enters the basement to see Mike facing the corner- a reference to the Rustin Parr story mentioned earlier- and she is knocked to the ground. The camera runs for a minute and stops. This ambiguous ending leaves so many questions and makes for an excellently terrifying end to the film. The Blair Witch project created a truly terrifying atmosphere that remains scary to this day. I have yet to watch a film that comes close to the level of eeriness in Blair Witch. This is a classic horror film that is guaranteed to leave audiences feeling uneasy for years to come.",The Blair Witch Project

For example, ""The Blair Witch Project"": The only good thing about that movie is the acting. The rest of the movie sucks!!!! ""The Blair Witch Project"" pulled off something that very few horror movies managed to do: It made me hate it. In a nutshell, three college students do some interviews asking questions about the local legend of the ""Blair Witch"". After that, they drive out to the woods to solve the mystery of the Blair Witch.....and guess what? Not only do they NOT solve the mystery, but nobody survives. What a crappy film. The makers of the movie tried to go for a ""realistic"" approach to a horror movie, but in doing so, I swear to god upon everything in the universe, it is the only horror movie that made me bored stiff. Again, I will say that horror movies never do that for me! Just this one! It is a complete and utter waste of time. See this movie just once just to see how bad it really is, to satisfy your curiosity, and then never see it again.",The Blair Witch Project
1511,colossu5,Works better than the sleeping pill!,1,15 January 2006,"Despite the obnoxious voices of the characters, this movie still does a better job than the sleeping pill does of putting one to sleep. In a nutshell, if you are entertained by watching characters stand around, complain, and act foolishly, then this movie is for you! Basically this movie is ENTIRELY about kids acting irrationally, complaining, and whining in the forest. Nothing happens to them, and they're all so annoying that you just hope they die. The first 99% of the movie could've been shrunk to a total time of 2 minutes (and even then it would still be a waste of film), and then the ending could've been made such that it wasn't quite possibly the biggest letdown in movie history.Nothing about this movie is scary at all. At the end, there is finally hope that the characters might all finally die and the movie will finally be over but nothing is resolved at all because you do not know what exactly happened. Actually, when I saw this movie, I thought that it was either a joke or a faulty tape or something because the end credits just sort of spontaneously popped up and started rolling. That is why this movie is such a big joke/scam. The entire movie is spent the viewer wanting something to happen (which is probably hoping the characters get killed), but nothing ever happens, not even at the end.Come to think of it, it's hard to even call this ""movie"" a movie. Why? Because there was no plot, terrible acting, no character development, no conflict (other than the absence of a medicine to cure stupidness), no resolution, no conclusion, and terrible cinematography. The only thing that this ""movie"" has in common with a real movie is that they both run on film.I must give props to whoever's idea it was to come up with this ""movie"". After all, right now he's probably rolling in cash. Throwing together a ""movie"", taking absolutely no care in doing so, and then marketing it such that people flock to the theatres to see it is a genius way to spend practically $0, but make millions. I should follow his example (except when I make my movie, I will actually take time and care and make a good plot).If you've ever seen a movie called ""Open Water"", this movie is exactly the same, only in this movie they're on land, there's more complaining, more stupid acting, and less of a plot. If 0/10 were an option, I would vote that for this movie in a heartbeat.",The Blair Witch Project

The actors seemed very real, they seemed really scared.  I didn't mind the low production value.

But with any luck this film will do well at the box office and help bring back the ""true"" horror film to the theaters. I'd say the last good horror film to hit theaters was ""The Prophecy""(w. Christopher Walken) or maybe ""Halloween Six""(just because of Donald Pleasence). But some say there has not been a good horror film in theaters since ""Day of the Dead"". As far as ""The Blair Witch Project"" goes, it is a very well made indie film, that is truly scary. It's diffently not one of the thousand hip teen slasher flicks being released this(or last) year. It markes a return of the true horror film. Not the Hollywood horror formula films we have seen this decade. And yes no Jen Love Hewitt(sp), no rap music, and no Rob Zombie. Wow how different! On a scale of one to ten(ten being the best) I'd give it a eight. Note to film makers, good job with this film, but you could have given a little credit to Mr. Deodato.",The Blair Witch Project

Both for what it is, and what it isn't.As a film it succeeds in every phase: plot, script, concept, and execution -- it is, in short, brilliant. I rated it a 9 on the voting.But if you're not careful and open-minded, you might not pick up on just how great this effort is.The film has none of the Hollywood action cues, setups, or prompts that we're condidioned to respond to.  The lazy viewer, thus unprompted, will miss out on the import of the action.  There is no music to cue dramatic scenes. No sound effects to enforce the action. No sight or sound of the witch.In keeping with the premise of the movie, the opening screens are unadorned and silent.

And I got to see them free!  This movie is so bad that I felt like telling everyone in line for the next show that their money would be better spent on seeing the home video I made with my girlfriend.

It is a pathetic story of three people who become lost in the Maryland woods during the fall.  They don't have any basic survival skills or any ability to support each other during their crisis. The characters go around in circles shouting, ""F**k you!"" at each other to demonstrate their intelligence.  The movie didn't make want to root for anyone.The idea was good--the delivery nonexistent.Sundance not withstanding, Ed Wood could have helped this filmIf you want to see quality in a low budget movie, see ""The Brothers McMullen"" or ""Clerks"".",The Blair Witch Project
1546,RumblePen,"Interesting, Fun, but definitely NOT Scary",1,16 August 1999,"I heard about The Blair Witch Project months before the first TV commercial for the film aired. I counted the days until the first showing in my area. After reading reviews that declared it ""scary as hell"", ""terrifying"", and ""the scariest film ever"", I was almost certain I was going to be frightened for the first time since watching The Omen and The Exorcist.As a young boy, who sincerely believed in the devil (thanks to my mom), the two films were especially terrifying because I truly believed what I was watching was real, or at least possible. That, I believe, is the only sure way of scaring an audience. The Haunting was such a disappointment because there was no way you were going to 'buy' those blatantly apparent special effects. Moving books and opening cabinets with fishing line is more frightening than rendered graphics (didn't those episodes of Sightings make you at least a bit more uneasy?)And that's why The Blair Witch Project appealed to me. A horror movie that feigns reality, achieving frightening effects with simplistic techniques (or so was claimed). A documentary film-crew of three investigates a local witch legend. The three disappear and a year later their footage is found (probably within a bundle of wood or under a pile of rocks opposed to a film can). Great! What a concept! But the film isn't executed properly.The film was shot with very little preparation, relying mainly on improvisation. The result is a film that is very funny, but not very suspenseful or shocking. Humor is something that can easily be improvised, but not suspense and horror. They need to be brought about by the manipulation of sounds and images, not by running frantic with a video camera.I in no way doubt the integrity of the actors' performances, but I need a little bit more than their fright to make it my own fright. Piles of rocks and bundles of wood just don't cut it. Sure, they along with the stick figures that are discovered are freaky as a preliminary, but I require something more dangerous. Phantom hands, Shadows, two points of light that could be evil eyes off in the distance, even grasping branches would have satiated. I spent most of the time scanning the screen looking, hoping to see SOMETHING.Sadly, the filmmakers give you nothing. You leave the theater unsure of what exactly accosted the three. Was it sadistic practical jokers? Rednecks or devil worshippers? A witch or malevolent spirit? I'm afraid you'll never know. I didn't want full disclosure, just enough to make me think ""Maybe Mom was right, the devil IS out to get me!"" Less is sometimes more, but nothing will always be nothing. After all, a house isn't haunted if it hasn't any ghosts.Some argue the point that if I were one of the three lost and haunted filmmakers I would be scared. No doubt. But I would just as soon be afraid of what happens in a Will Smith movie if it were happening to me.So, is this movie worth seeing? Sure. I did laugh quite a bit and any movie that does that is no waste of time. There are two very tense scenes, but they are quickly over before they can be called ""terrifying"" (the final scene is especially disorienting). Although, be warned, those likable characters soon become annoying as they get lost in deep, deep Maryland and begin fussing and fighting. You may be longing for their deaths and find what does befall them disappointing. So, see this movie, but don't tell me ""it'll make you afraid to go into the woods"". Deliverance has already done that.Last Note: Here's a funny thing you can do in a packed movie house showing The Blair Witch Project. When Heather, Josh, and Mike first discover the pile of rocks outside their tent, scream, ""Oh my God! Rocks!"", then, frantically run up the aisle, through the theater doors, never to return.",The Blair Witch Project

Having gotten caught up in all the hype, I was expecting something at least moderately terrifying.  As the three campers became more and more desperate, I became more and more desperate for something to frighten me, scare me, move me in anyway.  The only thing that caught my attention was when the credits began to roll and I thought 'that's it?!?'

I saw it in a packed theater, with a majority hoping for a Hollywood ending. While this movie does not make the viewer scream, there are images and sounds and inanimate objects, especially at the end, that I will not forget for a long time. I did have goosebumps on top of goosebumps several times. As the day went on, and I was able to think about it more, the more creeped out I got. I see a lot of horror movies. Jaws didn't keep me from going into the water. Psycho didn't keep me from taking a shower. Blair Witch made it very hard for me to turn off the light to go to bed.

Even if I suspend my disbelief, I can not forgive the blatant plot holes and inconsistencies that stick out throughout the entire film like sore thumbs. I must admit that I had a chuckle at the thought that someone decided to kick a piece of paper but do not expect me to blithely swallow the idea that this girl is any type of researcher.  The entire premise of the movie is that three ""researcher"" are looking into the legendary Blair Witch, however time and time again, these ""researchers"" simply ignore all of the hints and out-and-out revelations that the locals make about the Blair Witch.In two different instances, the first by Mary Brown the other by the two Fly fishermen, about the cabin in the woods. Imagine my surprise when at the end Heather and Mike find a cabin in the woods. Oooooooooh, how eerie.Earlier in the film, while Heather is in the cemetery, she speculates if the Blair Witch is responsible for the disappearance of the seven children in the 1940's. Even after the fishermen tell her about what really happened to the children, after they tell her about the cabin where their bodies were found, Heather and the team do NOTHING. This was so frustrating. What type of research is this?Okay, one last irritating bit, back to the fishermen, the manic that killed the children, kidnapped them in PAIRS, so why were only SEVEN children killed? Maybe the whole concept of the ""pair"" is different in Maryland, but I don't thank so.I was expecting so much more, this movie was the biggest waste of $9.00 I have ever spent.  This movie was a monumental waste of my time.If anyone ever doubted the infinite power of the hype machine, this movie is evidence that it is alive and well in Hollywood. Emperor's New Clothes? Blair Witch? Apparently lightning does stick twice.  Save your money, burn it, bury it in a pit, spit on it instead, whatever you do-do not waste it on Blair Witch.",The Blair Witch Project

If you expect an idiot, but brave main character, who screams a lot, but is able to kick the stupid murderer, go watch SCREAM, or I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. They have plots like: ""You ran over me! Die!"". The Blair Witch Project is so much different than that! It takes three typical youngs, used to good life, and with the normal teenager sensation of omnipotence, to the woods. At the beginning, everything seems so funny and happy, but as the time goes by, they realise they are not as powerful or smart as they thought, and that their hope is giving place to insanity.People complain about Heather's screaming. What is she supposed to do? Scream once and be quiet while something is after her? I surely wouldn't be calm. Other people say ""piles of rocks are not scary"". NO? How about finding these piles after all you've passed the last night, living in a city where the Blair Witch Tale frightens the citizens for ages? I would feel scared to death. People who say this film are as dumb as the kids IN the movie. They think that they could handle the situation easily, and that what they've passed is nothing...

I believe had they had given themselves a bigger budget to work with it could have been phenominal, and I heard that the unsteady camera work put many people off.The film itself has some good points, the fact that quite a lot of what you see is essentially just improvision is one of them, I do feel it was a bit of a let down though, I certainly wouldn't say its a one to watch, but if you want to see something different, and can stand the nausiating affects of unsteady home-movie style camera work then give it a whirl, it'll either scare you s*****s or bore you to tears, either way you'll have something to talk to with your mates.",The Blair Witch Project

The true embodiment of fear comes from within when the imagination is left to run wild as it does in the 3 characters of the film.  It wasn't meant to make you scream, it wasn't meant to make you jump, it was meant to make you think and use your imagination. Your imagination is more powerful than any cinematic effect that they could have possibly used.Other reviews said this film was a disappointment, they were waiting for the final punch.

I viewed this movie based on the great reviews it was getting, but I left the theater wishing I had waited for someone to rent the video so I could watch it.  Maybe it is because I live in a heavy wooded area, but I found nothing bone-chilling about the movie.  It got a little boring watching people scream at each other for an hour.  The ending was kind of neat, but the story until this point left me checking my watch to see how much longer until the end. People raved about the camera work in the film.  I appreciate artistic film work, but an hour and a half of shaky camera work, and many shots of pitch darkness is not a movie, it is a bad home video.  Yes this camera style functioned well in scenes, but it became an annoyance several times. Maybe I am old fashioned, but The Blair Witch Project will not be my favorite terror movie.

With a female lead that inspired me to wish that the ""Blair Witch"" would pick up the pace and finish her off quickly. The acting was in fact so bad that I found myself laughing at some of the most dramatic sequences.Overall a respectable indie film which lacks strong acting and any semblance of suspense.

1562,Bryan-45,How to save money,1,11 August 1999,"If the big deal about TBWP is that it leaves things up to your imagination, just get yourself a good book from the library.  If you're really scaring yourself you can get much better inspiration from any of thousands of books than you will get from this film.Also I miss out on what is scary because I not worried about getting lost in the woods.  I have simple knowledge of the great outdoors that tells me if I can find freshwater I can survive seven days without food following my compass or a stream and will find something before the end of those seven days that will lead to my rescue or return to civilization.Next point is that if the Blair Witch is out to get you, you're dead meat; a powerful supernatural force that has escaped human recognition for all these years is not going to be uncovered by three bumbling students with camcorders.  Rather than losing your mind inside a tent, open the flap and get killed by the supernatural or find out you were going crazy over nothing.  Do what the audience of the film can't do and take charge of the situation rather than slowly losing your mind, like the tent would protect you if the s**t hit the fan anyway.And if you are impressed by the lack of budget, you are just strange.  It costs you the same to see the movie regardless of what it costs to make; be impressed by their ability to promote the movie on the cheap or applaud their financial success; but in no way should you think a movie is better because it was made for less.  Think if this movie is so good why not impress a studio and get some more money to improve the movie before releasing it to the general public; if they did this you could have gained from the low budget as a two-step production would have shown you a better final product.$800,000 (in 1960 dollars) got you a set that is still standing today, the services of one of the greatest directors of all-time, an actual screenplay, known and quality actors and the greatest horror of all-time.  Psycho got the money it needed to provide the audience with everything it could hope for; TBWP just turned $30,000 (in 1999 dollars) into an immediate profit for a select few and what will be nothing more than obscure movie trivia in a few years for the masses.",The Blair Witch Project

Fueled by a shrewd marketing campaign, the aura surrounding this indi has sent scores of film patrons, including myself, to the back of long lines. After two misfires with sold out shows, I finally landed a ticket and settled into my seat almost intimidated with wonder over what I was about to see. Eighty-two minutes later, I was bursting with more questions than ever. Questions such as, `Am I the only one, or is this movie a major let down?' `Was I the only one not to be the slightest bit scared?' `What movie did I just see, because I've already forgotten about it?'But don't get me wrong, `Blair Witch' did have a number of strong points. For one, it offers an original and clever ghost story, with the filmmakers capturing among the most genuine emotions I've ever seen in characters. Elements such as fear, confusion, hunger and frustration were portrayed with unrivaled authenticity. However, while the trio on screen might have been scared, never at one point of the movie was I even the slightest bit frightened. Not the slightest bit. I kept waiting to be terrified and it never happened. I guess I don't have issues with the filmmakers as much as the hype and reviews surrounding the movie. I cannot recall how many reviews I've read featuring bold statements such as ""one of the scariest movies ever made."" I mean come on, the trailer for ""Baby Geniuses"" was scarier than Blair Witch.

Rarely has there been so much ado about nothing.  I'm not going to outline the plot because you know it by now but here's a couple of thoughts: exactly who was the audience for this ""documentary"" that was being shot? It's filmed with all the technique of Uncle Jim's video of Timmy's birthday party.  There's not even the slightest pretense of trying to make it look somewhat professional with interesting compositions, framings.  The footage was UNWATCHABLE.  I couldn't imagine watching their video for ten minutes much less a half hour to an hour.Why must every banal moment be filmed?  What possible interest could their viewers have in watching the filmmakers shoot the breeze in the motel room or talk in the car?  It was unbelievable to see the amount of video that was used to capture moments that flat out did not belong in a supposedly serious documentary about the Blair Witch.Here's the situation: You're in the middle of the woods at night in pitch black darkness.  You hear groanings and rumblings in the distance that scare the living hell out of you. The first thing you do is... a) grab a weapon or some means to protect yourself and waitb} grab a flashlight to investigate or c) turn on your video camera even though it's far too dark to see anything. EXCUSE ME!!???Ridiculous.  Absolutely ridiculous.  All of the above contributed to my never buying into the nonfiction reality the filmmakers tried to convey and as a result I wasn't scared or thrilled one tiny bit by this film.

I usually have the ability to suspend my disbelief, but in Blair Witch I found myself questioning what the three characters did at every step.  Why were they so damn noisy, why were their lights on all the time, etc.??? 
I expect that some people will be very scared by this movie, but it is not as groundbreaking as it is made out to be.  It suffers from the same old horror movie irrationality.See it on Video to appreciate the different filming method, etc.Gave it a 4",The Blair Witch Project
1572,ronwalker,"Edgey, raw and excellent!!",10,20 July 1999,"This is one of the most frightening movies that I have ever seen.  While it is not ""shock value,"" blood or special effects that scare the begeezus out of you, it is the ""true life"" fear and terror that the people are going through that truly makes it so haunting.The study of 3 people who start out happy, energetic and full of vigor, being reduced to terrified, hunted and on the edge of insanity, is incredible to watch.  I truly felt as if I was invading someone else's private life and nightmare.Watch it and think ""what if it *IS* true!""",The Blair Witch Project
1573,Razor-18,"Fun and determined to scare you, or else...",7,1 August 1999,"I enjoyed the film as a whole and definitely felt the pull of despair that slowly swelled up out of the actors as time went on. This film had the uncanny knack of being able to keep you emotionally paced with the events at hand. Nothing particularly jumped out and scared me during it, but I was definitely feeling the uneasiness of the characters situation and that uneasiness rose with the characters as the film progressed. I don't think that this film corrects what has been going wrong with horror films over the last 20 years (i.e.: too many FX, not letting the audience imagine anything) but it is a good step in the right direction. The actors are uncanny in how believable they are and how they react to what is a formidable situation. Lost, inexperienced, hungry, in the throes of a nicotine fit and unaware of how each person in the group reacts to stress and the unknown or unseen. This film could be used to illuminate how humans deal with the unknown and fear. The fear, like I said, doesn't jump out and bite you....it simply puts you in its mouth and slowly swirls you around. Next thing you know you are nearly a participant, and you really don't want to be. Good film...hope this isn't a flash in the pan for these guys. Wake up Hollywood. We want you to use this as a horror platform from which to launch new horror from. BTW, don't sit too close to the screen...especially if you get motion sickness easy.",The Blair Witch Project
1574,brad-88,Blair Witch is more boring than chilling,6,6 August 1999,"I was disappointed in this movie after seeing it.  It is a very unique film, and its ability to actively involve the audience through ""real"" film footage is brilliant, but it lacks momentum and thrills.  The chilling aspect of the movie just isn't that strong.  The ending of the movie is very disturbing, but not all that shocking.  In fact, it is rather predictable.  The amateur nature of this film, while it does give the audience a strong sense of reality, is also the film's weakness because between the so-called frightening scenes is a large lull that consists of little more than constant arguing among the characters.  While the arguments are sometimes humorous, they also get tiresome very quickly.  This film is far above most horror films in terms of style, plot, and acting, but could and should have been more chilling than it was.  An audience's imagination can only go so far.  I would still recommend this movie, though, because it is a unique film experience.",The Blair Witch Project

I couldn't fall asleep that night.  i thought I heart sticks breaking and rocks piling up, though it was just my imagination.  I thought it was particularly scary because I saw it on July 14, the second day it was released.  Many people;s opinions were affected by all the ""hype.""  If that's true..then fine, but I think all the reviews are true still.  I would watch it again and again. Heather, Michael, and Josh are one of the BEST actors I have ever seen. They started their acting careers the honest and right way.  Unlike all those idiotic, not talented actors on WB, who many people for some reason think are cute and whatever they happen to think, Heather, Mike, and Josh are great actors with A LOT of talent.  They are famous for their talent, not for their looks.  That is what many people these days have to realize. Anyone who likes actors simply for their looks, and then associates that with their talent,must have some problem.  I know there are many people like that.  (people who post messages on the gay and stupid BSB and NSYNC's message boards are like that.  go and see for yourself).  Sorry for the lecture, but it's true.  The Blair Witch Project is the Best horror film. The BEST action/sci-fi film is The Matrix. The best action film in Indiana Jones and The last crusade. The best sci-fi films are STAR WARS (A new hope, empire strikes back, and Return of the jedi.

Most Horror movies depend on cheap tactics like high pitched stringed instruments that chime in as something flashes across the screen, or lots of fake blood and gore spilling out of bodies, but this is the only movie that takes advantage of the suspension of disbelief so vividly, that it takes the worst horror imaginable, one that is created in the mind, and makes the viewer wholeheartedly wish to not see the movie conclude. It was so well acted and believable which made the horror so much more poignant. I dare anyone to find a movie scarier than The Blair Witch Project.",The Blair Witch Project
1578,nevrmore,This one scared the heck out of me!,9,20 July 1999,"After having driven 2 hours to Chicago to catch the opening weekend of The Blair Witch Project', I would have to say it was time (and money) well spent.  It's also good to know that the movie was so well received that it cashed in over $1.5 million last weekend and only played at 27 theaters nationwide.  Of course, a lot of this has to do with all the hype and promotion that was done on TV and the Internet, but nothing can truly prepare you for this film.I made it a point not to read the spoilers in order to heighten the experience.  The show was sold out and people cut off all conversation throughout the film.  You could tell everyone was engrossed in the film right from the start.  TBWP was actually quite funny in the first 30-40 minutes and everyone was laughing heartily.  Above the constant bickering between the students and abundant profanity, the movie never stopped building up.  Countless horror movies build up the tension, then throw in the old cat jumps out of the closet' routine on us.  This never happens with TBWP.  The film builds up right until the unnerving climax.  You really care about the 3 students and start to feel what they feel.  You get dragged down in the dread that they experience and you feel helpless because you know things are going to turn out bad.We never get to see who or what is terrorizing these students, but that's the best part.  Fans of such fodder as Armageddon' and  The Rock' will no doubt hate this film because there isn't a big payoff.  One has to draw his/her own  conclusions about what really happened.  The unknown to me WAS the most terrifying aspect of this film.  There are 3 possible theories that I could come up with as far as what happened but we'll just never know. During the films' climax I heard many people make uncomfortable groans and shrieks and when the end credits rolled I heard many people exhale.  Heck, I think I might have been holding my breath also.See this movie now!  Don't wait for it to come to video...",The Blair Witch Project

Blair Witch Project has nothing to offer for $8.00.The hype around this movie was that it was original, scary as hell, and didn't rely on effects using your imagination  instead.  Well it wasn't scary (I brought my girlfriend who gets frightened very easily, she even jumped a few times at the Haunting and she said Blair Witch wasn't scary at all), its hard to invoke thoughts of sticks and stone piles and believe this is scary material.After the disappointingly abrupt ending, I walked out of the film feeling cheated out of my money not by the film makers or actors, but by all of the critics that gave praise to this farce.

Basically the one sentence that was used over and over again was ""No, you shut up"". The sad part of this movie was that it had the potential to be a great character movie.

This movie looked like a student project (I think it was from the shaky camera angles, and the bad film shots).

If rocks banging around, bundles of twigs hanging in trees, and unknown voices in the night are what freak you out, then maybe you really will be scared by what's happening here.  Still, the whole ""the most terrifying thing to the human mind is the unknown"" is a little overplayed here, to say the least.  Hey, even in ""Jaws"" we eventually got to see the shark.  This thing was made on a shoestring budget and it shows.  Why did they even bother to use 16mm when the best parts are on video?  Anyhow, blah, blah, blah, get ready for a disappointment, folks.  This thing probably would make a good five-minute campfire story, but for crying out loud, why make something that goes on for so long but, like our heroes, really doesn't go much of anywhere by the end?Having said this, sure, most of you are going to go see this movie anyhow.

They soon find themselves in odd situations and unable to escape the woods.  That is all that I can say without giving away the entire plot.The element that makes the movie so weird is the way it was filmed. The filmmakers kept it in its original 16mm format complete with shaky angles. They sure didn't use a steady-cam.  This movie is a definite for this summer.  I gave it an 8.",The Blair Witch Project

1587,EazyE-3,i think i got ripped off?,9,10 August 1999,"The hype behind this movie is phenomenal and i give credit where credit is due. The marketing behind this movie is genius and still today, several weeks after its nation wide release, there are still some who believe that this is real documentary footage. Of course, no studio would ever purchase actual footage and turn it into a major motion picture. Real documentary footage and home videos are reserved for the FOX television network and shows like RealTV. But that's besides the point. The movie itself is not very good for a couple of reasons. The first reason is unavoidable, but darn it, i got so dizzy watching this movie that I spent much of the movie looking away from the screen in order to stop myself from getting sick. I was expecting it, so it didn't come as a surprise, nevertheless I almost lost my lunch. The second reason is that this movie was not believable. I'm sorry, perhaps their nighttime footage was believable, but I didn't buy into their daytime footage with their little quarrels and soliloquies. It was highly exaggerated. The third reason, to go along with reason number two, is the ""townspeople"" at the beginning of the movie. Not to spoil it for someone who hasn't seen it, but the ending was more realistic than the two fishermen being interviewed. There was no way anybody could watch these two clowns and believe they were real. By the time the movie got to the end, i was too upset with the camera and with the girl to be scared or creeped out. It might have been a cool ending, had the previous hour and ten minutes not ruined it. I almost wanted to leave during this movie because it was so bad. I'm glad its making all the money its making and i'm glad everybody has adopted an obsession with the Blair Witch legend, but the fact remains, the movie itself wasn't very entertaining.",The Blair Witch Project

Granted, besides the incredible hype that has been generated, i can only wish that i knew LESS going in. The movie builds in visual and emotional intensity as the increasing plight of these three lost teens grows more and more sinister , hour after hour. Much is left unexplained, and unrevealed, leaving the audience to make its decisions for itself. This is a refreshing change from having CGI slammed down our collective throats. The simplistic nature of the cinematography grasps us in its fist and holds on until the final, harrowing scene. After it was over, I was uncertain what to think. What had I just seen?

Peter Travers, Rolling Stone's critic had called it ""Scary as Hell,"" so I was expecting to see one of the best horror films in my life -- and believe me, I am an avid horror fan and know the difference between true low-budget HORROR with the low-budget pansy horror displayed here. The film contians three annoying-as-hell characters which will grate on your nerves for the entire movie.  Indeed, most of what they do is not scary -- they just swear while screaming at the top of their lungs.  If anything in those woods, let alone the ""witch,"" could not hear them, I'd be surprised.  These characters not only yell for most of the movie, they are also some of the dumbest filmmakers I have ever seen -- I had a suggestion for them halfway through: if you would just shut up and actually start moving, you might ACTUALLY GET OUT OF THE WOODS. The producers of ""The Blair Witch Project"" believed that they could make a feasible film by sending three out-of-work pitsy actors into some woods without a script -- guys, it didn't work.  Many critics, for some reason, seemed to like this one.  Maybe they fell asleep and had a scary dream at their screening.  The public's reaction was nothing like this -- when I left the theater, all I heard was ""That sucked"" or ""What a waste of my money.""  Dedicated horror fans will definitely be disappointed -- maybe the critics liked it because it was a non-horror film billed as a straight horror film -- after all, how many critics have actually ever watched a horror film.

Some might tire of the way the film is shot, by using two hand held video camera.  After awhile the constant motion of the filming made me feel sick and I had to look away from the screen.

By the halfway point, I was trying really hard not to throw up - some of it was due to the motion of the cameras, but most of it was due to the growing sense of dread and anxiety that this movie put into me.  There was not a single scene that made me jump, but the whole movie kept me so on edge that I stayed nauseous.  It gets under your skin - every moment you know that Heather, Josh, and Mike are not going to get out, and worse, you know that they know it too.  I've seen tons of horror movies, and most of them will give you a good fright every once in a while, enough to make your heart pound for about twenty seconds or so.  This movie kept my heart beating hard for a full 45 minutes, at least.  It makes you cold inside, makes you hurt for them, and makes you *never* want to be in the woods ever again.

I thought this would be the horror movie to add quality to an otherwise sagging genre.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.At best, there is 30 minutes of ""intense"" film here.  The rest feels like MTV's The Real World Meets Indie Film Fame.  Watching Josh, Heather, and Mike get the crap scared out of them in the middle of the night is very intense, and the ending will stick with you for a while.  However, watching the three ""break down"" and argue in between those moments starts to wear thin after the second day of filming.It's not as riveting as the hype would lead you to believe, nor is it as ""original"" or ""groundbreaking"" as I had hoped.  Most of the time I was sitting there feeling like I was just watching some inconsequential home movies that led nowhere.  In all, The Blair Witch Project is a quaint little film that may have worked better had it actually been real, or had it not been leaked out that it wasn't real.

1599,silk-12,A major disappointment,1,1 August 1999,"[Editor's note: this comment contains minor SPOILERs]The Blair Witch Project has been heralded as the movie that was supposed to revive the horror genre to a much greater extent than the original 'Scream'. It was supposed to be a genuinely frightening film with little or no comic relief, no trick endings, and no disfigured killers who get knocked off at the end by the one remaining camp counselor who you could guess at the beginning of the movie.  I was supposed to be afraid to drive home after seeing it and have nightmares for weeks.  The hype on this flick was becoming unbearable the days before its release nationwide.  I was so excited to see a scary horror movie that would really scare me.  Most horror movies these days either turn into comedies with endless jokes and no serious edge or they turn into gory bloodbaths that nobody cares about. This movie was gonna be different.  So as soon as Blair Witch came out nationwide, I ran out to the theater, forked over the money for the ticket, sat back and waited to be scared. And I waited and waited and waited.  87 minutes later, the credits were rolling, the lights came on, and the only thing that scared me was that I paid good money to see that stupid so-called horror movie.  Nothing during the movie scared me or my girlfriend (who scares quite easily I might add).  The characters spend most of the time cursing at each other during the day and running around in the dark at night.  The things that are scaring them are barely audible and since they are shooting the scenes, you can't see much at all.  Heather never shuts up, never stops filming, and never knows where she is.  The two guys aren't much help.  An hour into it, I thought maybe the night scenes would still be terrifying once we get there.  Well, they weren't.  Other reviews claimed that the tent scene is soon to be famous.  Why?  It's not scary.  Neither is the rest of the film.  Okay, now it's close to the end.  Something's gotta go down now.  Five minutes later, the footage ends in a frantic, climax that MAKES NO SENSE.  If someone can explain it to me, please do.  I really would like to know what happened to them.  I saw nothing in the whole movie that could lead me to believe anything related to witchcraft was going on. There's no witch, no thrills, no chill.  The only thing I will remember from this dreadful attempt is the confusing, what-the-heck-was-that ending that I may never understand.  If you want to see a scary movie, rent the original 'Candyman' or 'Nightmare on Elm Street', turn off all the lights, turn up the surround sound, and be prepared for the nightmares later.  A truly demented and horrifying alternative to this junk would be 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.  Not this.  I'm sure I'd be scared to be out in the woods at night, lost, and weird stuff happening around me.  But it's not scary to watch in the theater.  This was perhaps the biggest disappointment I've ever felt after seeing a movie.  I gave it a 3 for the fact that I felt bad for the three people in it.  One Point per Actor/Actress.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.  I have to be pretty fired up to submit a long review so you know this one really ticked me off.",The Blair Witch Project

But it turns out, I just hadn't seen a good horror movie in awhile!My main complaint with horror movies is that they always show you too much. Gore isn't scary, it's just gore. What's scary to me is playing off of what many people are scared of already: the dark, the unknown, unidentifiable sounds, being lost and alone.Blair Witch captures all of these phenomenally. It's as if their sole purpose in making this film is to remind the horror industry what they're supposed to be doing. I hope they listen, because this movie scared me half to death.

This is a tight (albeit slightly nauseating) thriller that is as inventive and frightening as anything out there and probably more original than anything in decades. It stuck with me for days after seeing it and I think I even offered to personally give some people their money back if they didn't like the film (although I'm just going to say I was drunk if they come to collect). It's refreshing to see and be scared by a flick that sports a bundle of sticks and piles of rocks and snot as major special effects.

In all good sense I know that it was just a movie, but since seeing it I've seen a documentary on the scifi channel all about the Blair Witch that insists that there really was three film students that disappeared while doing a documentary on the Blair Witch and whose footage was found. This film has two qualities that are outstanding in my mind, the believability of the characters and my disbelief, against my better judgement, that it was just a movie.",The Blair Witch Project
1604,CBSinFLL,"Awful - At 82 minutes, it's 81 minutes too long",1,6 August 1999,"What were all those critics thinking when they reviewed this movie? I was in a full theatre to see this movie, and at the end, the audience was literally stunned to silence at how bad it was. I only heard one positive comment, and I think she thought she would be unfashionable if she didn't like the film.Although I like edgy films, I think a serious fraud has been committed on the movie going public with this one.It's almost pornographic - no redeeming social value.",The Blair Witch Project
1605,Jahhim,Great scam,1,6 August 1999,"I give this movie credit for one thing.......... It's a great scam. I can't understand what people are seeing in this movie. I love independent films, but this one right out sucked! The hype has made these people millions, and I guess I can't knock the film makers for that. I just wish it had a bit of substance to it. I sat there waiting to be scared while trying to ignore the throbbing headache I got from the horrible camera motion. Please don't give me that crap about, ""it was supposed to look like that"", because I don't know about anyone else but my home movies don't shake like that. Where was all the horror I heard about? If not for the comedy relief, I would have been bored out of my mind. Where those sounds supposed to scare me? Maybe I missed something, but where were the horrifying images? Anyone can record a bunch of sounds. I've seen better horror stories on Nickelodeon's Are You Afraid Of The Dark. I get the feeling this is one of those things that people are almost intimidated into liking. They get the impression, from all the hype, that if they don't like the Blair Witch Project then they are just not cool. Sorry, my coolness is all there, but this movie could stand to find some. A-F, I give it an E for effective way to make money. Spend pennies, make millions.",The Blair Witch Project
1606,fibber-2,Best movie in ages!( there may be an accidental spoiler in here),10,6 August 1999,"I saw The Blair Witch project on Sunday, and it left such a powerful impact on me, that i haven't been able to get it out of my mind. It is a film that deeply disturbed me, but that is a compliment! I was so drawn into the film, that i forgot it was fiction....and even though you don't see whatever is chasing heather, josh and Mike, it actually makes it even more horrifying! As soon as the film ended, I was shaking from fright.... my friends and I could not stop discussing all the possibilities  and all the theories we came up with while watching the story unfold....this movie makes you think...and that is what is so great about it... even though it scared the daylights out of me, i want to see it again... also checking out the official website after the film helped to fill in some of the gaps that i found... so my advice is....see this film!!!  And don't sit too close, because  a few people i know had to vomit from the jerky camera motions on the screen!!! This film is a cult classic already...and it hasn't even been out that long!",The Blair Witch Project
1607,realfan-3,NOT scary & NOT original,1,6 August 1999,"I registered with IMDb purposely just to trash this film. I have never felt a movie so undeserving of praise than this one. I see no point as to why it was made or why people like it. If you liked it, good for you, I'm glad you enjoyed it. I however did not.I take offense to the suggestion that people who don't like this movie are somehow less intelligent or imaginative than those who did. I guess it takes more to spark my imagination than a carefully-constructed hype campaign and the inability to make the audience suspend disbelief. I fully wanted and expected to be scared and be swept away into the story. Alas, there was nothing to be scared of, and no story: only 3 kids screaming obsenities at each other. At no time did these characters make me think they were real. To anyone who thought this was a real documentary for a microsecond, I truly feel sorry for you. Never have I believed more strongly than now that film critics are just a bunch of group-think cretins, who use their pony-tails as antennas for the brain police to download ideas into their empty heads. The critical response to this failure proves it.I was going to give this film points for originality, but these charlatans of the cinema, Sanchez and Myrick, ripped off the concept itself from ""The Last Broadcast.""

The people who marketed the film have actually made chocolate ice cream out of excrement. As a producer, I could only strain to hold my dinner in while watching this inept excuse for film making. But the person (or people) who thought to sell the film, and I use that word with trepidation, as a ""mock-umentary"" hit the marketing mother lode.My dog has more creativity in getting a whole carrot cake down from the kitchen counter than do the makers of this film.

1610,Corky-33,Get The Ending,10,9 August 1999,I can't say I fell into all of the hype surrounding this film because I was sucked into it as soon as I saw the ads on TV. So when i finely got to see the movie Saturday August 7  I had very high expectations. The theater was packed and bursting with nervous anticipation. I watched with hypnotic amazement and as the film came to it's chilling end I felt a feeling of relief mixed with disappointment. There were so many people expressing their thoughts on the ending at once I missed the horror of it. But as soon as someone next to be mentioned what the ending was about i realized just how terrifying it was. Until then I didn't think the film was frightening at all. That night when I got home the mental haunting began. I have not been able to get it out of my head for days now. I must go see it again. I do think that people need to be able to get the ending. I have read so many people think it is something it is not. Please if you have not seen the movie pay attention in the beginning of the movie and use your imagination. All in all I loved The Blair Witch Project. Thank you to the makers for giving us a fresh look at horror. It is truly brilliant. I hope to hear your thoughts.,The Blair Witch Project
1611,Corky-33,IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET....,10,10 August 1999,If you have not seen this film yet please read as little as possible about it. Try not to hear other peoples opinions about it. The best way to see this film is to know as little  as possible about it. I'm sure anyone who has seen it would agree with me. The more I read the more is see that the people who didn't enjoy The Blair Witch Project as much as other people are the people who heard too much about it before viewing it.,The Blair Witch Project
1612,Iggy-Wu,"Sure it's cheap, but not in a bad way.",7,10 August 1999,"After reading through multiple IMDB user posts on this movie, I wasn't sure if this low budget film would be one of the best and scariest horrors ever, or just a boring and laughable attempt at moviemaking.  Which was it? Number 1, all the way!  This was the best horror movie I've ever seen, even surpassing the original Psycho. With an extremely original approach this movie succeeded in engrossing me. Then it freaked me out!  It was one of the scariest movies ever, with an equally freaky ending.  In fact, I was quiet for hours afterwards, not wanting to break the spell it put me in, I just sat and analyzed the ending. This movie is NOT for everyone.  If you prefer pointless, bloody, and need I say FAKE, slasher films, you'll probably shun this ""imposter"" to the horror genre.  I thought it was delightfully original, with wonderful acting, and a seamless and completely believable plot.  That's why I gave it a 9 out of 10.",The Blair Witch Project
1613,Dilly-3,Blair Witch Reject,4,10 August 1999,"Right.  I have to concur that this flick let me down.  When I went to see it, a couple people got up and left close to the end.  I wasn't sure if they were leaving because they were afraid of being traumatized for life, or if they found it rawtha boring and wanted to salvage as much of their lost two hours of life as they could.  In any case...I actually laughed during some of the scary parts, because I could imagine myself running around and screaming with a camera and getting much the same results. ""AAUAUUAGH!! OH MY GOD! JOSH WHERE ARE YOU!! JOOOOOOOOOSHHHHHHHHHHH!!!""Usually I am very susceptible to scary movies, so this movie must really be a dud if it didn't even scare ME.I do have to hand it the filmmakers though.

1614,boxcar-2,Moviegoing sheep have made this movie a success,1,23 August 1999,"It never fails to amaze me what passes for genuine and groundbreaking in our culture. That goes double for film...it seems the American film audience are akin to lemmings, jumping off the cliff at the debut of the latest ""masterpiece"". This time around, it's the ""Blair Witch Project"", an innocuous piece of tripe that I wouldn't be so angry about if it was screened in a film class or a free showing down at the YMCA. Instead, I'm bombarded by magazines and newspapers proclaiming it to be ""the scariest movie ever made!"" Critics I used to respect have absolutely sold out by hyping the film's originality and brilliance in not actually showing the ""boogeyman"" What that left me with was one and a half hours of watching completely charisma-less actors screaming obscenities and bugging their eyes out. How entertaining. Between the shaky camera (intended to convey the fright experienced by the actors, but actually succeeded in making the woman next to me vomit)and the extreme closeups of the principals, I was starting to feel queasy...queasy that I plunked down $7 for this amateurish home movie.

1615,JG-23,The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,1,12 August 1999,"The Blair Witch Project has to be the worst movie I've ever seen.  It was not scary.  It was not intriguing.  It was boring, and the jerky camera work left me nauseated.  The acting was decent, but the storyline didn't really go anywhere and the cinematography was atrocious.  I understand they were supposed to be film 'students,' but my 10-year-old sister can shoot better footage than this.  At the end I was really wondering why I bothered to sit through the whole thing, and I was definitely sorry that I actually paid to see it in a theater.  If you're still curious about this one, wait until it comes out on video.  At least then, hopefully, the smaller screen will reduce your motion sickness.",The Blair Witch Project

I had tried twice before to get tickets only to find that it was sold-out.  So, when I finally got to see the movie, I was really excited. The movie was great!  I have to admit that when it ended, I wasn't as scared as I thought it would be.  But, then I got home that night, and I could not go to sleep.  Usually scary movies don't get to me like that, but I was genuinely afraid to open my bedroom door in the morning!!  This movie is one of a kind, and should be viewed by everyone, just for its originality. But, this movie is more than original, it will keep you afraid for weeks after having viewed it.

In fact, leaving the theater I turned to my friends and told them that the movie gave me this deep desire to go camping. While it wasn't what I expected, I found myself really enjoying this movie (which is why I gave it a vote of 8), because it really made me want to use my imagination on what really happened to three movie makers in the film.For a while now, movies just spoon-fed you everything... it's nice to see a movie that requires you to use a little of the gray matter in your head and draw your own conclusions.  And it shows that you don't need a grossly huge budget from a big-name studio to make a good movie.",The Blair Witch Project

I think that there is a big difference between scary and and gory.  I would catagorize this film as scary with a bit of comedy. It does give a good example of how you don't have to see a bunch of blood and guts to be scared.  Personally, I don't think that movies filled with blood and gore are not at all scary, I think there sick and disgusting.  I honestly found this film more funny than scary though. I think that all the hype around it was a bit much, but I do admit that if it weren't for all the hype I probably would have never seen it.  Finally, I probably would not pay to see it again, but it wasn't a waste of my money to see it once.",The Blair Witch Project
1619,GODSGIFT,Scary movie if u know about the whole story,3,28 August 1999,Everywhere you go you hear people talking aboout the Blairwitch Project and on t.v. you see commercials claiming that this is the scariest movie of all time. So naturally you go to the movie theater with a couple of people and you pay your 7.50 for the movie and you start watching it expecting a movie that will give you the creeps for a long time. Now the movie is done and everybody you went to the movie with is dissapointed and saying what a joke the movie was. Well I understand why you would say that due to all the hype this flick was given but maybe if you had visited the official blairwith project site in advance then you would really find the movie scary because when you go to the site and you read about all the mythology and everything it makes you see the movie in a whole different way and it makes you think more about the movie and when you watch it you understand what the people in the beginning of the movie are talking about and it really makes a difference in the chill factor. ANother thing I recommend is when the movie turns pitch black close your eyes and listen deeply to the sounds cuz they really make the scene more intense. The bottom line is to find out more about the mythology behind the movie before you watch it even though you know its fake. This movie is a 10/10 if u watch it the way I told and if you go watch it not knowing anything about the story and are expecting it to be the scariest story then it gets a 3/10 for u.,The Blair Witch Project
1620,Dr. Bill-2,Home Movies will never be the same!,10,15 August 1999,"Well, I might as well add my name to the list of people with scorching opinions one way or the other about THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  Students in my various classes at Dowling College (Long Island) were pretty evenly divided down the middle--they either HATED the film with a passion or they LOVED it. I fall into the ""loved it"" category for a number of reasons.  (Actually, I think it's exciting that people can get so worked up over a movie.)First, the home video / 8 mm format is truly intriguing, an original variation on the French ""cinema verite"" style of the early 60's (or what was called ""direct cinema"" here in America during the same era).  The viewer believes what he/she sees.  Not once do you think that something is being ""staged.""Next, the acting is top notch.  The improvised scripting is superb. Having been on expeditions to the woods with young people, I was glad to see that people were talking the way REAL people talk.  I've heard complaints about the profanity; well, for better or worse, that's how lots of people talk in situations like this.  Indeed, it was that profane language that made me believe in what I was seeing.  (After teaching young people for over 25 years, I know that this is, whether some like it or not, ""real language."")Finally, it's the building tension that grabs the viewer.  For anyone who's ever been lost in a strange, remote place, this film completely captures t he irrational terror that can overcome the most rational person.  If you've never experienced a situation like this, take it from a person who has--the sanest of people will start believing the most insane things, the slightest sound will truly become the unseen monster, and the darkness will become a suffocating terror that will traumatize you for years (JUST years, if you're lucky.)My one complaint is with the media.  In telling readers/viewers too much about the film beforehand, a lot of the punch is taken out of the experience.  Whether you do or do not know that the documentary is or is not really a documentary doesn't ruin the film, but it does take the initial jolt out of the experience.All in all, it was great seeing an original film that is both an homage to ""direct cinema"" and an exciting step forward.  It's one of those rare films whose style is so individual that other films like it will be called copy-cats.",The Blair Witch Project
1621,CJustin,its ok,1,17 August 1999,"Blair Witch Project neither *stinks* nor does it live up to the hype about it.  i would give it 5 out of 10 stars, and the only reason it would rate that high in my opinion is because it IS original.  During this film, several people got up and simply left, my friend included....she said the film gave her a bad case of motion sickness.  Immediately after the film, there were many loud exclamations from all over the theater, such as *that sucked,* * what a bulls*** movie,* etc, etc.  Many of my friends are positively livid in their expressions of anger over what they consider *a piece of crap which i was suckered into seeing by the critics.* Personally, i really REALLY wanted to like this movie....some of my favorite online movie critics, including my very fave, Scott Renshaw, gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars, calling it *brilliant,* a *masterpiece,* etc.  To me, Blair Witch is original, pretty well-acted, a little creepy, not scary, kinda funny, mostly boring.  This film could have been SO MUCH SCARIER and BETTER: the premise is great, and the acting was good, but the buildup of tension just was not there to any substantial degree.

I'm also a big indie movie fan, and therefor I waited in line on opening night (pre-wide release) to see it.  Damn, what a waste.  This movie is not scary, creepy, or anything resembling a horror film.  The film really begins to drag when you realize that each passing day is virtually the same as the last.

If you've never made an amateur movie you can never understand the limits you have. It's very hard to get every thing right. Luckily I knew someone who went on to Hollywood films so I had good acting. I've always been trying to figure out a movie like this. I thought the last 5 minutes were probabaly the best stuff I've ever seen. The idea of using an offhand comment to give the final scene is awesome.

If you asked me to go spend a week in the woods, I would say yes in a second.  Even the ending, which is supposedly the really scary part, was lame.  I couldn't believe the hype this movie received.I know part of the appeal of this film was how different it is from the typical Hollywood horror flick.  Well, I didn't find it to be all that different, just slightly more boring.

1628,mycritic,Fear the dark! She is out there.,9,30 August 1999,"Don't panic. I won't spoil the flick.That would be cruel.I just survived the new independent film, ""The Blair Witch Project."" If you haven't heard about this movie, and that is only possible if you have been living on a submarine for the last seven months, it focuses on three college film makers who, in the fall of 1995, trot off into the Maryland woods in search of the fabled ""Blair Witch."" Unfortunately, they never returned from their little jaunt in the forest. A group of anthropology students stumbles upon a duffel bag filled with their film canisters nearly a year after their disappearance.The film is pieced together from their original footage by a film crew hired by the families of the three missing students. What results is a 120 minute spine chill. The chill originates when you realize that these three seemingly happy kids are going to come to their untimely demise at some point in the film. You have no clue how this is going to happen. You simply know that it IS going to happen. From there, the film, combined with your imagination, proceed to jar you repeatedly right up to the end credit. That is right. CREDIT. Exactly ONE credit. Less than they would have gotten for completing the film for their film class. That would probably be worth three credits.Advice for when you see it. You will see it. I know. You won't be able to resist. You can feel it now. She is calling you. The Blair Witch. If you weren't working right now, you'd be at the cineplex. You might even be planning your own escapade with the kids into the woods for a nice family weekend. Don't. Don't do it. She's out there. I know it. Logically, I know that the film was shot in Maryland. I know that I live in Arizona. That just doesn't matter. She's out there. Oh... I was going to give some advice. Unless you are an avid operator of a small hand held video camera, and you walk around with this camera glued to your right eye 24 hours each day, you will feel ill as the camera jumps and hops around in the hands of these young film makers. Do you remember that feeling that you get when you are leaned back in a chair and you lean back just a hair too far? Do you remember the disorienting sensation of having to promptly right yourself lest you land on the floor? Good. Now magnify that feeling times 120 minutes. Take Dramamine. I nicknamed the camera in the hands of the girl (Heather) the ""Dram-a-cam."" I started to thank God every time she would steady the camera for more than two seconds. Don't eat a heavy meal before seeing this film, either.Now, some advice for the parents out there. This film is rated R and then some. Not because of any real violence. In fact, the R is probably only for the kid's frequent use of the ""f"" word. Even that isn't so bad, really. I think that this film received its ""R"" for the fact that the rating panel was too shaken to write the letters ""PG-13."" They said, ""To heck with this. It ain't a G so I'm picking the only other one-letter rating and then I'm going home to hide under my bed."" This flick will give YOU nightmares. Don't even think of letting the cherished fruit of your union see this one. This is what you were put on this earth to protect them from.Don't get me wrong. You NEED to see this film. And trust me. There is nothing in the film that is worse than your own imagination.Fear the dark. -Clint Potts, Chandler, AZ",The Blair Witch Project
1629,JMG-5,Excellent!,10,8 October 1999,"Without a doubt the most interesting and frightening movie I've seen in a long time. The Blair Witch Project scares in a way that horror films haven't been able to since ""Halloween"": subtly. There's no outright, in-your-face terror and no discernible antagonist; what frightens you is whatever your mind conjures up - it's sad that so many people require the film makers to do that for them. There's a consistent sense of dread that saturates each scene, though it isn't always obvious, and watching the three kids slip irresistibly into madness is, at once, frustrating and mesmerizing. Pure emotion can be shattering to witness and The Blair Witch Project comes about as close as possible to capturing it. There is one particular scene in which an apology is recorded that is absolutely heartbreaking. It's that rawness and realism that make the days so captivating. Find me three cold, tired, wet, hungry and scared 20 year-olds who get along and don't swear like sailors and I'll give you a thousand dollars!  At night dread manifests itself in the form of pitch darkness, obscure noises and what sounds like children's voices, and the fear is not about being startled out of your seat as much as it's about burying yourself in it and not breathing. The movie builds on this fear and dread at night and returns to the frustration of day, continuously escalating.  Each day becomes more unbearable and each night becomes more frightening culminating in what is, truly, one of the most terrifying scenes I've ever watched. The final frames are absolutely haunting.It's certainly not for everyone - what movie ever is? - but I can't recommend it enough.",The Blair Witch Project

What Blair Witch has that most horror films don't is an incredible feeling of suspense and wonderment.  You FEEL for these kids as they trek through the forest and lose their minds!Maybe I'm too hard in the above comments, but when I was watching this movie, I (with use of my imagination) felt like I was on the trip too...everthing FELT so real...and the apology...and the final house sequence...That IS TERROR.I go to movies to enjoy them and be totally immersed in them...not to criticize them and not enjoy myself..In short this movie is THE HORROR film of the year!!

The camera work is horrible, and the story is confused and more or less unplanned. There is absolutely no horror in it until for maybe the last minute. Apart from that last minute, which I admit is brilliant, the film is one big boring sequence of video clips.I am normally quite open to experimental film styles, and love to watch strange films.

This movie basically drops three obnoxious film students into the woods under the premise that they are going to solve the mystery of the legendary Blair witch.  Heather, the only female in the group, was loud, obnoxious and very pushy-her major talent seemed to be screaming at the top of her lungs every time she heard a twig snap.  The other two, particularly Josh, seem to be little more than stoners whose primary preoccupations are with smoking cigarettes and using one particularly charming expletive repeatedly.I felt that the entire movie was setting the scene for something, but it never delivered.

Without the overpowering F/X and music score most movies rely on to 'scare' you, if you still have an imagination left what is implied becomes a hundred times scarier than anything offered up by Hollywood in the last 30 years.  The hardest thing in movies is to scare you.  Not make you jump out of your seat with 5000 watts of sound blasting at 400 decibels (ever seen the 1999 version of the Haunting?  Event Horizon? - every potentially tense scene is preceeded by dead silence then the Blast).  Wake up people!  Blair Witch is the horror movies we have been needing for a long time and I'm glad someone finally had the guts to make it.",The Blair Witch Project
1634,belskoid,Not the same ol' stuff,8,20 November 1999,"Have you ever been seriously lost somewhere and been unable to find your way despite repeated attempts?  Have you ever been trapped in a truly nightmarish situation that you could not control?  Have you ever been dissatisfied with the unrealistically accelerated event time of most films, i.e., the failure to show process?  If you answer yes to these questions, then you will probably find The Blair Witch Project satisfying and very unsettling, as I did.  But if you're hooked on the jolt-a-minute manipulations of films such as Alien, this is not your movie.As a hiker and former high school science teacher from the region where the film was shot, I can assure viewers the banality of the some of the dialogue and panicky and irrational behavior so effectively displayed in this film are far more genuine than most of what I've seen from major studios.

My friends and I expected this to be a good, scary movie because of all the excellent reviews.  Instead, we found the movie boring, but it gave good headache with all the camera movement.  My brother just borrowed the movie and now wishes he never wasted the time watching it.I do have two good things to say about it:  It was original, and had a good cast, but these two positives couldn't carry the movie.

I was, quite frankly, not afraid. At all. The entire movie was one big profanity. The three characters screaming f*** this and f*** that and f***you, etc were bad actors adding to a bad plot. Now, I must give some credit to the film makers for some very clever advertisement, and a good idea... maybe next time... make it silent. There was not a meaningful thing said in the entire movie...

You all seem to be brainwashed by the special effects and blood and gore that modern movies today have to offer. This is just showing how much the media is exploiting violence and how one by one we are becoming immune to the extent that is portrayed. Blair Witch is a refreshing change from all the bulls**t trash that we devour every year. A film doesn't necessarily have to have a $100 million+ budget and an arrangement of machine guns to be a masterpiece. Blair Witch plays with the mind psychologically. It isn't a case of when the 'scary' moments are ( I am referring to several comments that other people have posted) but what the it is and what it will do next. The beauty of it was how it was made and set out. I am a 15 year old female so my opinion probably is of no value to you but I can tell you I seem to have understood more of this film than most of you.,The Blair Witch Project

1645,cherrykick,Technique:10 Actual movie:1,1,22 June 2000,"The technique of this film was a brilliant idea. The finished product is nowhere near brilliant. The actors have watched too many Tarantino films and think good dialogue means a lot of swearing, especially the F-word. How do we show we're scared? We say ""oh F*** I'm so F***ing scared"". When I first heard about this movie and got to thinking about 3 students lost in the woods, not knowing what was going on, it gave me the creeps, I could imagine it. Walking home late one night through the woods I actually got pretty spooked. Then I saw the movie and thought, what a bunch of idiots. If I wanted to put my brain on hold then I could believe the kids were actually scared and lost and confused and possibly something evil in the woods was driving them loopy. Instead, thanks to very bad acting and unintelligent dialogue, I began thinking it might not be such a bad thing that they disappeared.People who saw the Sci Fi mockumentary were lucky in that it enhances the story line. I saw the 'documentary' first and went with my brother who hadn't seen it. He was completely confused during the movie, until I began giving him background information on the witch from the 'documentary'. He thought more of that should have been added to the film.Don't get the idea behind this film and the technique confused with the final product.

It's a bit of a gamble: 99% setup for a 1% payoff, but the whole eighty minutes fly by (inane dialogue and poor acting notwithstanding) pretty fast. Without a single frame of special effects or a single suspenseful note of music, the filmmakers manage to create an unmerciful sense of dread, and the final scene becomes among the most tense I can recall.",The Blair Witch Project

There is a reason for this. There are two types of horror movies: There is the kind that tries to scare you by showing you something scary, and there is the kind which suggests something scary, but lets you imagine it yourself.  The people that hated Blair Witch were wanting scary images and blood and guts to be fed to them. That is not what they got.Blair Witch sets out to scare you by forcing you to imagine something.  It lets your mind ""personalize"" what is really scaring you.  The people that don't like this movie must not understand this.  Either that, or they just don't care and they can't appreciate a horror movie which strays away from tradition.  Either way, they did not fully take in what this movie was offering to them.If you are debating whether to watch/rent/buy this movie, you must first think about what really scares you.  Are you frightened by a scary monster jumping out and eating someone?  Or are you scared when you wake up in the middle of the night and hear something outside your window, letting your imagination create the most horrifying possibilities of what it is?  That is what The Blair Witch Project tries to do, and in my opinion, it succeeds entirely.",The Blair Witch Project

Okay, I really doesn't scare easily, but what's wrong with this movie is that all of the characters are so annoying, that after less than half an hour you're just looking forward to see them get killed in some bizarre way. And while hoping for this to happen may be slightly exciting, it's certainly not scary. Second, I don't like the hand-held low-quality cams, but that's just me.

There's almost nothing to enjoy. Nothing even happens until the 50 minute mark.And then there's the characters. The lady was so annoying, thinking that she was better than everyone and that everything had to be her way, that I actually had to go through and skip over the parts when she was talking.This is how annoying she was.
When they were obviously lost, she didn't want to share the map and insisted that they weren't lost.She would yell at her friends, who were having mental breakdowns, that they needed to ""keep walking"" even though they would ask if they could have ""5 minutes"".At one point, they find weird witch symbols in trees. They filmed everything, but then when her friend asked to move on to film something else, she ignored them and kept filming. This lead everything being filmed too long, and her friends kept yelling at her to move. That happened multiple times. She even stopped to film things, in detail, when they were supposed to be running in terror.Her little ""I'm sorry"" speech didn't change my view of her at all.Then there was the ending. What?

Otherwise its just not scary enough for a movie and i cant see myself getting nightmares over it. I was mad frustrated with the ending as well? WHAT HAPPENS!?

No other movie has managed to get me so scared of the woods!The Blair Witch Project is about three young adults who want to shoot a movie in the woods. The forest that they want to shoot in is known for the myths about the Blair Witch who is supposed to live in it. Same as most people they don't believe in those myths but as strange things start happening during their trip they become more and more terrified of the trees surrounding them.The way that The Blair Witch Project scares you is nerve wracking and the way it creates suspense and horror is genius. You become terrified of what might be in this forest and an oppressive feeling fills your body as you watch these three young filmmakers wandering around in the pure terror of these woods.
What you feel when watching this movie and how it gives you this feeling is very hard to express in words since it scares you in its very own way. Mostly it is the fear of the unknown which makes this movie so extremely scary for me.I want to greatly recommend this movie to anybody who is even only in the slightest bit interested in horror, because The Blair Witch Project managed to give me a kind of fear that no other horror movie could give me yet. And if you watch it, you will never forget about the truly horrifying ending of this fantastic movie.",The Blair Witch Project

1662,allierogers-95531,Still waiting for something to happen..,2,1 May 2021,Found footage movies are my favorite kind of horror movies. They add a different kind of horror to the movies because it makes it a lot more real. Found footage movies can be a hit or miss- they're either terrible or amazing. The Blair Witch Project was one of the worse horror movies I've ever seen. I only finished it because I thought something was going to happen. But nothing ever did! You never actually see anything happen. You hear the noises outside the tent waiting for something to happen and then nothing ever happens. The ending was stupid. A lot of screaming and you never see anything actually happen. This movie was a waste of time.,The Blair Witch Project
1663,garlick,"scary, more eerie",9,18 November 2001,"Seeing ""Blair Witch"" again after a few years, I found it easier to view it on its own merits.Quick synopsis:  three students hike into the middle of nowhere to make a documentary on a piece of local folklore.  They become hopelessly, desperately lost.  The realization of how screwed they are slowly sets in as they begin to suspect that they are being stalked by something sinister and unseen.  The film itself presents itself as the doomed student's own video footage of their documentary.The primary factor is to keep in mind the difference between ""horror"" and ""terror.""  ""Terror"" is sudden, blood-soaked threats of bodily harm that jump out at the heroes, and unfortunately is all most ""horror movies"" deliver. ""Horror"" is dread of unseen and horrid possibilities, carefully cultivated by a thoughtfully-crafted situation.  ""Blair Witch"" is rich in horror.  It has some terror but it's fairly lean and carefully employed.  This may disappoint some viewers, especially if they have very high expectations and/or are accustomed to schlock.  If you want to see a movie starring a special effect, look elsewhere.Anyway, ""Blair Witch"" does have a long build-up, but it does reward those who pay attention through the first quarter of the film.  It will provide you with the depth of the story that is not explicitly laid out for the viewer later.  Most importantly, it does become more creepy in the context of the movie.The jiggling camera is somewhat dis-orienting in parts, but is put to good use in drawing the viewer into frantic and confusing scenes.  Also, the film might have less impact on you if you feel very at home in the woods, or if you have little sympathy for the characters.  Horror is, after all, subjective.There are several scenes which are overtly scary, and still made me jump. However, the best part of the movie is the strong build-up from frustration to desperation, from desperation to dread, and from dread to screaming panic.  When the credits roll you'll be left with the adrenaline of the high-energy scenes.  A while later, it's the eerie implications of the build up to those scenes that sinks in...  Usually late at night, when you're by yourself.  Now that's horror.Regretfully, ""Blair Witch"" is an experiment that shines in its original concepts, but lags in some of its delivery.  If you can tolerate the actors and cope with some dragging pace, you'll find it a refreshing take on the genre.",The Blair Witch Project
1664,andionita,An Educational experience,9,15 September 2008,"I got to see this film after my brother's room mate and his girlfriend remembered the occasion of seeing it at a Home cinema in a cabin. I had heard very much about the title. Even at a Media class at my university the professor mentioned 'Blair Witch project' for the hand-held camera view. Also one of my friends came into making some short movies about campus and stuff, and he was really into it, so one day he said: ''Rei, let's make a movie, I mean a real feel movie, OK - not quite as Blair Witch project- but still...After all this I just couldn't stand missing out on a influential piece of culture. The film itself is just one hour and a quarter long, but I guarantee you would want it to end way before and have impulses to check your watch.The footage found from three (probably cinema) students that wanted to make a documentary over the legend of the Blair Witch, and for the purpose they went into the woods of Maryland to find evidence.I really liked this movie! As a horror film it is a favorite. All classic horror movies are just ""directed"", they build the tension through some events the director chooses and the actors behave as if wanting to get your chills going. Well, in Blair Witch all that happens is perfectly - and I mean it - normal.Just remembering the decline the group suffers, that you might think the guys will resort to inhuman acts to survive (probably in a Hollywood movie this would have been sought - but here the mere idea of it is oh so creepy).It is as if I were in the group. The movie tempts me: 'Rei, what would have you done in this situation?' That's why it's so great and I preferred it so much.After seeing it for the evening of course I couldn't get to sleep. I actually myself got going in the genre, so I put some fragments of classics, The Exorcist and The Shinning. Apart from just scenes in which the scare is inevitable, these look like toy inventions: they want to find a better way of scaring you. They just pale in comparison...I don't mean to ignorant, but 'Blair Witch' is something that gets a special place in one's memory. It's a story. It's not a directed story, the interesting facts in and cinematic achievement to be remarked. It's a story that gets you gripped and it has full effect. After watching it think about the 'educational experience part'! If somebody asked me about my scariest movie or horror films, I'll just suggest them to see 'The Blair Witch Project'.

1668,cinemafiendee,The most perfect movie i have ever seen!,10,7 April 2008,"The Blair Witch Project is in ways, more than a movie. At the time of its release, work was done in order to insure the most realistic feel the movie could have. using words like 'documentary' and providing documentaries of the kids and placing missing posters around Maryland were all tactful in making it feel like you are watching the final days of three people's lives. The director used interesting techniques in providing the authentic documentary feel. The three actors carried all the equipment and shot it all themselves. They improvised their lines, and were only told basic plot points by the director placing notes in test tubes so that only that particular actor could read it, and then reveal it to the other actors. The ending has been described as one of the best endings in a film of all time. This is all not to mention the effect of these techniques, which is unbelievably frightening at the right moment. This is a movie that is almost faultless as both a horror film and a mockumentary. Certain scenes are intensely disturbing and unforgettable such as when Heather finds Josh's teeth wrapped in a piece of his shirt and put in a bundle of sticks. Heather and Josh's reactions are the most disturbing element of the film. The director walked around them at night with friends and threw sticks and stones around the tent. This technique means that the frightened reactions of the kids are often genuine. It is because of this that you feel like you are there, discovering the trinkets left outside the tent for the first time also. don't be surprised if you start feeling stressed about getting out of the woods yourself. The end scene in which Josh stands facing against the wall while Heather is killed is tense and sickening and leaves you feeling regretful that you watched it, but if you wait, and think about 'The Blair Witch Project' you will discover its brilliance.

My older sister and her friends were watching it in the living room on Halloween night. I didn't know what the story was, but just the sounds, images, and EXTREMELY convincing acting was enough to make my hair stand up on end. A few years later I watched it for the first time and had trouble falling asleep for about 2 weeks after wards, and I definitely didn't wanna go camping! So many friends have asked me why I think it's scary. I always hear ""It doesn't show us anything!"" ""You never even see the witch!"" Well... they just answered their own question. You never see the witch, or anything for that matter. Everything is left to your imagination. You don't know whether or not these kids are really being haunted by something, or if they're all simply losing their minds. That is real suspense. You can't re-create that feeling with bloody makeup and monster masks. The other huge factor that went into my fear for this movie was the marketing. As a kid, I genuinely believed it was real ""footage"" that was found in the woods. The actors are so convincing in their roles that it sucks you right in.Everyone is going to have their opinion. Some people have certain standards for their horror films, and The Blair Witch Project might not meet some of those standards. Personally, I can't think of another film that has ever evoked that much raw fear out of me. Even now that I know it's just a movie with actors, writers, and directors. It still creeps me out to my inner core.",The Blair Witch Project

Thats all this is, the perfect ghost story. Those who take it for more, will be disapointed. Those who love great story telling, will love this film! Rent it, turn out the lights, and let this film take you into one of the greatest ghost stories ever told on film!
*SPOILER* I refer to this as a ghost story, cause that's what it reminds me off. I can remember my father telling me a ghost story around a camp fire long ago, where the end of the story the teller grabs the arm of the person next to him, and yells ""GIVE ME BACK MY HANDS!"" the final sceen in this movie with the kid standing in the corner IS that part of the ghost story. And if you let the film absorb you so that you are in that room and see him there, its like a revisiting of the camp fire story and you just got grabbed by the teller, yelling ""GIVE ME BACK MY HANDS!""I so loved this movie, and im sorry to see it spoiled by people who can't take it for what its worth.

I saw the original again and even though I couldn't quite get what was happening in every sequence I could understand the three of them eventually grating on each others nerves, becoming disoriented and then scared and desperate to get back to the car and home. However I was never one for camping and one of my main reasons is the woods have a way of messing up your head and if you REALLY don't know where your going and don't have a lot of time on your hands or more than two people with you who are experienced about doing that sort of thing, then maybe ya shouldn't attempt it.",The Blair Witch Project

The brilliant concept of filming the whole thing with just a small, blurry camera brings you closer to really experiencing a movie than to any other film in the history of film-making. They weren't trying to do any normal, pretty teen-horror-movie, this is an ugly film, and that's the way horror-films should be. Perfectly accurate camera and some overly-supernatural demon aren't going to get you even close to real horror. You know it can never happen to you. But the Blair Witch Project is very,very realistic. That's what drives a person to the brink of insanity. And the brilliant part is, that they never even show ""the Witch"". The kids just get lost in the woods and then strange things happen to them. There's not a tiny bit of supernatural activity there. Maybe the whole thing's just in their heads. Maybe they're imagining everything. Maybe not. Who knows? And we never find out what happens to them at the very end. All I know is that it's terrifying. It's a raw, psychotic, nerve-breaking film.

Shaky cameras don't impress me. Undelivered monsters and undelivered explanations don't impress me. The least they could have done was actually show SOMETHING scary. Some sustained muted form, but this movie delivered nothing but two hours of gratuitous cursing and screaming and crying. I hated it more than sideways constipation.This movie is an utter waste of time and falls way below the one star mark that any established movie house would crank out.

It is the kind of horror film that, once you've watched it, leaves a fear inside you, it makes you want to never go into a deep, dark forrest again. The Blair Witch Project is so terrific because it is so simple, one of the first ""found footage"" films in fact. It is true that people a more scared of what they can't see, while the blair witch is never seen in the film, her presence is made, which makes it all the more terrifying. The entire film is a suspense builder that does not end until the climax of the film, it keeps you glued to the screen, holding your breath.

If you watch the movie the way you watch a lowbrow sitcom, you will have wasted 86 minutes of your life. But if you watch and use your *imagination* you will really enjoy it. I know that sounds lame but it's true. The movie makes you think for yourself, especially the ending which is completely open to interpretation.

But no, they only find more leaves and sticks.Finally, 5 minutes before the end of the movie, the gang (a smaller one, as the hippie one has gone missing) finds a cabin in the woods and goes in. There, after screaming and running the gang gets trapped by the witch (nope, you don't get to see her) and the film ends.Conclusion: no, nope, non, niet, yok, οχι. do NOT see that movie.",The Blair Witch Project

I suppose this was ahead of its time not so much for the found footage... that had been done and better.This was ahead of the curve in the reaction genre whete voyeurs watch others react to things.

Which is a good thing, if you ask me, because movies that rely on visuals and/or sound tend do be crap, as demonstrated by the year of 2005. The concept behind BWP, however, is to make the viewer's imagination compensate for the aforementioned lack of effects. And indeed, a well-developed imagination surely is much more effective then the potential of all the animators, composers, choreographers, etc. of Hollywood put together. However, all this is somehow very poorly realized in the movie. Not creepy at all, imho. I personally had a feeling similar to watching the Animal Planet on mantis mating.So out of 10 possible points, I give 5/5 for an original and very interesting, as well as ambitious concept behind the movie; and 0/5 for the actual rendition, which was dreadful.",The Blair Witch Project
1686,ellisonharlan,"Then why did so many critics love it then, huh?",10,6 October 2005,"The one thing the haters of this film never want to deal with is this one question: why did so many good movie critics universally hail TBWP as such a great horror film? The college, frat boy crowd who hate this film cannot give an answer, unless they admit that their is some collective insanity that made every important critic in the country get scammed by this so-called bad movie. You and I both doubt this, so this must mean that either you cannot fathom a decent horror movie, or you are sold on the premise that only computer animation and boo/gore effects make a horror movie shine.This is one of the great horror movies of all time, not because of the look of the film, but because of the smart idea of the making of the film and the way the inspiration of the amateur actors seem to gel so completely, almost too perfectly. Everything seemed to work right, even though so much could have gone wrong. The looks on the actors faces, the real fear and real anger made for a great movie, that could have been the bad movie, talentless detractors think it is.Here is why this movie works so well:The experimental nature could have made the film fail, or not be as interesting, but the actors real uncomfortability with the woods and the things that happen make for a real experience, when it could have looked hooky and planned. Without even suspending disbelief, you never thought the movie was fake. It seemed like these were real college kids looking for a witch. You felt their REAL fear, you felt the cold, could sense your own fear and it made you uncomfortable in a way that is seldom seen in horror films. This is a real experience, that goes beyond campfire fun. The horror, that hides in the shadows seems more real, because you feel it. Most horror movies are fun, but this film is too creepy to be the usual fun horror experience. That is what makes haters hate, they do not want to deal with their own discomfort, about this film, and what it did to them.The acting is real. They could have been tongue tied, or had shitty words coming from their mouths, but they did do a smashup job and coming up with plausible dialogue. You have to give it to them, since they had so little to work with.Odd things happen in the film that help the plausibility of the story seem more real. I will not divulge them, but you lovers of this film know what I mean. The directors got very lucky in what happen in the woods. So much could have gone wrong, but didn't.The greatness of this film is not about art--the film is actually not art at all. It is an experiment that works. Look at it that way and give it another try. Put yourself into the shoes of the campers. Maybe the fear will make more sense.The haters of this film merely show their ignorance.

1688,monarcagiulia,too interesting not to watch,7,26 October 2017,"The Blair Witch Project is a 1999 American movie based on a true story. It is about three young students; Heather, Josh and Mike, who get lost in a woods while they are doing a project on the Blair Witch. They spend a week asking questions about the witch and the related legend, then they go into the woods. They are supposed to spend two days there, but they get lost, and strange things begin to occur. As the movie goes on, tension rises, reaching the highest point when the guys find a house hidden in the trees. There, what told by the legend we heard about at the beginning happens. Mike faces the wall, so we know that Josh is already dead, Mike is going to be killed, and Heater is going to be the next one.  Even though the killing of the guys isn't shown, the end of the movie is pretty clear. The movie is a psychological horror based on the recovered footage discovered a year later after the guys' disappeared. You really become involved with it; knowing that you are watching what those guys were filming makes you feel their emotions. It scares you because you can feel the real fear. Their acting is very realistic and the use of cameras is interesting and compelling. It is not a usual horror movie, but it is still fascinating. It can be considered boring because not much happens, however I think it does catch your interest till the end.

No, quite the contrary really, the film is very good. It isn't typical horror by any means and it does take great risk in doing something new. But this attempt proved to be quiet effective. Perhaps this film might have been more scary in the movie theaters but watching it at home creates a difficult environment to become scared in. There were never any moments that made me even the slightest bit startled, the film played more onto the realistic factor of horror, things that make you uncomfortable and nervous.The acting in this film is outstanding, some of the best I've seen in a while, never stale, never artificial.

1700,HarryC,"Flawed, but brilliantly spooky",9,11 August 1999,"I used to review books and movies professionally, so I hope my comments will add a few fresh perspectives.  First, let me say that it's obvious that this is not the kind of movie that everyone will like.  People biased against seeing horror films won't; people who want technical perfection in the filmmaking process won't; people who want an airtight and tightly wound plot won't.  And I agree that the film has its problems - lots of gratuitous profanity, a tendency to drag about two-thirds through, and some plot points that aren't entirely clear.  For example, I didn't tie in how some of the residents' brief comments in the beginning affected the movie's ending (and various other events).  But they do impact it.  Maybe I just need to be hit over the head, but I didn't get it the first time around.All that said:  I love ""The Blair Witch Project.""  Took me two viewings to really appreciate it.  The first time, I found it fascinating -- and the second time, I found it scary, especially when I ""got"" the ending. Scariest movie ever?  No.  But for a combination of scary and interestingly done, it scores big points.Unlike some reviewers, I found the acting very realistic.  Some of the negative reviews I've read cite problems:  The actors wouldn't have done this or that, usually.  One reviewer said student filmmakers are very savvy these days, and the filming wouldn't have been that rough around the edges. He said this totally spoiled the movie for him.  Lighten up -- all fiction, and especially horror fiction, requires suspension of disbelief.  Horror films are notorious for having plot holes, unlikely things happening, and people going where they shouldn't.  In fact, in a lot of horror flicks, if people acted realistically there would be no plot!  And obviously fake studio-lot trees and dry-ice ""fog"" certainly didn't keep ""The Wolf Man"" from being a horror classic, at least not for me.I also disagree that finding out how the film was made or that it isn't a true story make it a lesser experience.  Sure didn't for me.   And I'm glad to see some other comments here that tell me I'm not the only one with the ""hangover"" effect -- it ran across my mind for days after I saw it.  By the nature of its filming, Blair Witch gets a little vague in its plot sometimes, but it more than makes up for this with its freshness and genuine thrills.I also appreciate the intricate Internet and TV framework of mythology -- what negative reviewers call ""hype"" -- that's been built up around the movie.  There's talk of a sequel.  Personally, I'd like to see a ""prequel"" built around the Blair Witch mythology created on the film's home page and in the Sci-Fi special, ""Curse of the Blair Witch.""All in all, I'd rate this right up there with ""The Exorcist"" and the original version of ""The Haunting"" as the best of the post-1960 horror films.  Although each has its own special brand of horror, each keeps its place well secured in my memory.  As to those who are disappointed that they didn't ""see the witch"" or needed some presence to scare them, blame modern horror cinema for spoiling them with special effects and gore.  Those who don't like the film for these reasons would never ""get"" a classic ghost story.",The Blair Witch Project
1701,Pipes,"The Blair Witch Project was over hyped, over compared and made me sick to my stomach.",4,3 August 1999,"Silence of the Lambs was the best thriller movie I have ever seen and had been highly compared to the quality of The Blair Witch Project. So, admittedly, my expectations were pretty high. The Blair Witch Project is a documentary of the legend of the Blair Witch that is filmed by three college students. The movie itself is made up of the actual tape and film that they shot on their handheld camcorder and movie camera. Upon interviewing the locals they attempt to find the Blair Witch deep in the woods. Eventually, they lose their map, get lost and the characters become pretty scared, although I did not. This movie really had nothing to do with being a scary film and more to do with how angry the characters become with each other for being lost in the woods and to see how many times they can use the `F' word. Furthering my disappointment was that ninety percent of the film is dedicated to shots of the forest floor as they are running about hysterically. So all you really every see is leaves and twigs and dirt shaking violently on the screen. This new trend in filmmaking is an empty attempt to portray the movie through the viewer's own eyes and left me with an upset stomach for hours afterwards. It was so bad that I counted at least a dozen other people who had to leave the movie altogether. If Breaking the Waves made you even slightly squeamish, then don't see Blair Witch unless you want to barf in your neighbor's popcorn bag. This movie had neither clever acting nor an interesting plot and it came no where close to putting you on the edge of your seat like Silence of the Lambs did.

1702,BigB,"Overrated and not scary, it's still worth seeing.",7,8 November 1999,"This has to be one of the most overrated horror films of all time, and it ended up not being even remotely scary. Nevertheless, it's a worthwhile film to see, and I applaud the fact that it was made. Being from the West Coast where conifers dominate the forests, East Coast forests seem like a park to me; this seriously detracted from the suspense. If they had added a very subtle soundtrack, such as that in ""Twin Peaks"", it would have added to the suspense, and wouldn't have subtracted from the documentary feel of the film. Despite these shortcomings, I wasn't bored with the film, nor disappointed that it wasn't frightening for me. I found it far more interesting and enjoyable than many other films these days; in that sense, it deserves its praise.",The Blair Witch Project
1703,htamano,Someone who doesn't like it!,1,2 September 1999,"This film is unique in its method, which I find to be truly wonderful. However, once the veil of reality is lifted by certain acting choices and post-mortem late-night talk show appearances by the actors, the movie loses its edge entirely. When lost in the woods without food, without direction, and, ultimately, without a traveling companion, one's sense to make a documentary would likely fade in the emerging presence of the overwhelming need to survive. Cans of film wouldn't be hauled around. Batteries for lights wouldn't be hauled around. Cameras would be dropped when punching your buddy who kicks maps into rivers. I love film, and believe in the suspension of disbelief.

By the end of this film my body was tense and contracted and my breathing shallow from the pure intensity of the situation. There's no gore, barely enough blood to speak of, and no special effects monsters. That's what makes this film brilliant. The truly horrifying part of this is simply witnessing the breakdown that the 3 students go through, and the simple fact that you don't *know* what's making those noises.
No spoilers here - but this has to be one of the best movie endings I've ever seen. I was truly frightened to be alone in the dark for a few hours. Good thing I moved to LA from my woodsy upbringing in NC... I'd have never made it from the car to my house...",The Blair Witch Project

Like other horror flicks ths characters did stupid things (go out at night, follow a person with a voice when they obviously weren't able to make sound) but UNLIKE other horror flicks (i.e., scream & stuff) you understood their panic.  The unique way the first person view was used, helped the audience get seriously disturbed.  The audience usually couldn't SEE anything so they had to rely on their hearing sense alone.  It was such a new experience... it seemed so real that it scared me more than any other 'unreal' films could.  No special effects to be comforted with just the unknown, sudden fear inspiring panic that the characters passed on.

If you do see it, see it either at a matinee or a second-run theater...better yet, wait for the video. There were a few, and I do mean few, ""entertaining"" parts of this movie.

All the people that I could overhear afterwards were telling each other how much they disliked this movie. You can compare this movie with the standard highschool horror movies, its only much worse and it adds nothing to the genre at all.

The handheld shots are effective at sucking the viewer into the trio's nightmare, and the low production quality actually works in the film's favor on many occasions. The actors do a very good job progressing from film school students to terrified kids who just want to crawl back into the womb.However, the characters seem unbelievably stupid at times (similar to most films within the genre), and the fact that there always is at least one camera rolling, day or night, whenever something scary happens is a bit hard to swallow.  The ending, which I won't ruin here, would have been much more affecting for me if the fact that throughout the scene, the characters never took their eyes from the viewfinders on their video cameras hadn't seemed so ludicrous.Still, it's a no-budget classic and a lot of people are going to be way more freaked out than I was.

It has been a long time since I saw a really scary movie.  Unfortunately, after seeing this film I am still wanting to see a really scary movie. The acting is bad, the footage shaky home video or bad b&w 35 mm.  The plot is pretty much non-existent.  No characters really develop, and the thing just generally flounders around for 90 minutes before drawing to a close. 
This films biggest problem is the *tremendous* amount of hype about it. None of it is deserved.  This just simply isn't a scary movie unless you are 8 years old and haven't progressed beyond the stage where any noise in the dark scares you.  If you find twigs hanging from a tree and piles of rocks scary, then this movie is for you.  Otherwise, you will suffer thru 85 minutes of it to get to final 3 minutes, which are almost bearable but still not that scary.  
By the way, I was so p**sed off by this movie that while riding the elevator up to my apartment, I commented to the couple riding up with me [complete strangers] that 'If you were thinking of seeing Blair Witch Project, save your money'   Imagine my surprise when I found out that they were at the same neighbourhood theatre as I was and agreed with me 100%.  The woman of the couple commented that it was the worst film she'd ever seen.  The male of the couple commented that it was a good thing we went to see it on Tuesday, when movies are only $5.  ""Imagine how disappointed you'd been if it cost you $10""
Maybe I am just missing something here.  If you think I'm out to lunch on this one, then let me know.  If you thought this was great, why??  And if you found it scary, again, Why??

People said it was scary, ""scary movies"" are like Scream and IKWYDLS, because they use sudden actions and loud and flashy effects to scare the audience. This movie was frightening. Frightening is an overall effect that comes from a movie that is consistently and thouroughly depicted to give the audience that feeling inside that that sends a shiver up your spine. I know this movie got mixed reviews, mainly because people went into the theatre telling themselves that this could not scare them. Anyone can make themselves unafraid in a movie, it's the people who go into it thinking that this could very possibly scare them that truly appreciate the film. If you give the movie a chance, you will have pleasent, or rather frightening, experience.",The Blair Witch Project
1714,Rider11,Don't Buy the Hype!,3,26 July 1999,"There's a reason that almost every company in town passed on ""The Blair Witch Project"" -- it's a very interesting idea that quickly runs out of steam and is technically demanding and artistically frustrating.  There's no question there's some imagination here, but the constant hand-held camera (which offers very little in the way of style or narrative information until the very end) is nauseating and the acting ranges from tepid to simply awful.If you've read all of the hype and ""stories"" about the making of the film, you know everything you need to know.  If the filmmakers had either better technical ability or a stronger hand with the actors, this may have been a more successful and even spookier endeavor.  As it is, the ""improvising"" actors have little to do for most of the film except swear profusely at each other and run around in darkness.  The ""spooky sounds"" they hear are poorly mixed, and the audience is given such sketchy information on the exact myth of the ""Blair Witch"" that it's not even clear what these kids are supposed to be afraid of. The real weakness of the film is the acting, which in spite of best efforts by ""Josh"" and ""Mike,"" is hampered by the constant whining of ""Heather,"" who seems inept as a documentarian.  None of these characters seem real even on a satiric level -- they are ciphers from the get-go and have no emotional depth.  As frightful as their ""lost in the woods"" story may be, the performers obviously lack the chops necessary to sustain the fact that there is no real story.""Blair Witch"" is little more than a failed cinematic exercise:  one wishes the filmmakers would have used their first effort as a calling card to re-make the same story with a stronger stylistic hand, modestly increased budget and better-prepared actors.  The reaction from most of the crowd in the full house I saw it with was mostly, ""Is that it?"" and there was hissing and booing at the end of the film.  The folks at Artisan should be credited for getting the most out of their limited run engagement, but this is unquestionably a film that will be better on video, late at night, long after everyone has forgotten that this is supposed to be ""the scariest movie ever"" or some such nonsense.",The Blair Witch Project

This movie terrified me and everyone else present.  There were no cries of ""Don't go in there!"" or ""He's right behind you!"" from the audience.  Blair Witch is the only honestly touch-your-soul frightening movie I've ever seen. No one moved through the entire last half of the movie.  No one spoke, no one even breathed.  All hung in rapt concentration on the incredibly eerie images on the screen of three kids, scared, hungry, lost, and hunted.  I am still being haunted by several moments in the film, frozen in my memory by sheer terror.  Hours after the film, a friend and I tried to walk down a path through some woods-and failed.  We turned back a mere 5 minutes into the walk from fear of the very trees surrounding us.  To every indication this does not appear to be 'just a movie' and so it isn't.  This film is real enough to haunt anyone that sees it.  I don't know if I'll ever be able to camp again and I say that seriously.  Don't read anything else about this movie.

1716,Ramy,"Fascinating, but fatally flawed.",2,17 August 1999,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is a fascinating, but fatally flawed film. Like an inside joke, the movie assumes a greater understanding of the mythology behind the story than is given in the movie. The significance of story elements are lost amid the jostlings of the camera and the breathless (and frequently unintelligible) narration of events. While this jostling and narration contribute to the tension experienced by audiences in the later portion of the film, they prove to be little more than a one trick pony.The film is well paced and edited, ratcheting up the tension as the filmmaker-characters experience the mysteries of the Maryland forest. However, it is an empty tension. It is difficult to willingly suspend one's disbelief when (1) the characters themselves defy empathy, and (2) their decision-making and behavior reflect a woeful naivete and lack of basic survival instinct.""The Blair Witch Project"" was fascinating in that it pushed a documentary narrative technique to its limit. The editing and pacing is well executed. The sound is serviceable, and the cinematography (such as it is) perfectly matches the desired atmosphere. The performances by the filmmaker-characters were remarkable.That said, the film is flawed because of a presumed understanding of background mythology, a reliance on manic first-person narration, a lack of characters worthy of empathy, and unbelievable behavior and decision-making on the part of the filmmaker-characters.I understand why there is electric hype surrounding this film.

Heather does becomes much more hysterical as the film goes on, but much to the audience's annoyance than much else. Mere attempts to shake the camera simply isn't enough to generate atmosphere.I know some people loved the film: but let's face it, very little people have yet the chance to see it for themselves.

This is an excuse to justify 80 minutes of hand-held MTV-ish footage of dark woods and the slowly deteriorating mental state of the characters after they get themselves lost.   They get scared because of odd noises and objects they encounter after they get lost in the woods.Of course, the movie never actually SHOWS what makes these noises--instead we get stupid myths, a bunch of cursing and screaming from the actors, and a lot of scared and very shaky camera footage.  Even in the amusing final five minutes of the film, where SOMETHING ACTUALLY HAPPENS (or at least the pace increases), the film NEVER establishes what is going on!

The three principals (Heather, Josh, and Mike) seem far more natural and un-selfconscious than most of the cast of MTV's ""Real World"", and were quite convincing as the hapless victims of both an unseen entity and their own naivete.See it, if only to appreciate what movie magic can be wrought  with a mere $25K and a very novel approach to a classic storyline.",The Blair Witch Project

1728,upstartfilmworks,"A truly scary, watershed moment in filmmaking",10,17 July 1999,"There are going to be two kinds of people that walk out of this film.  Some will be immediately shaken by it.  It will take the rest until they get home,  shut off the lights and try to go to sleep until they realize just how much the film messes with you.  Most of the latter are going to be of the backlash mentality, as this film's hype was only second to that of the Phantom Menace.  Fortunately it lives up to the hype.  This film delivers horror on that base, gut level that The Exorcist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and (to some extent) the Evil Dead gave us.  This is not a cut-and-dried post modern horror flick like the sort that typifies the genre of late. The main premise if you haven't heard it:  Three student filmmakers (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams) disappear into the woods while shooting footage for a documentary on a regional legend, The Blair Witch.  A year after that, their footage is found, and the conceit is that what we are watching is the actual footage of what happened, edited by Haxan Films.  What happens?  There are no easy answers, and in all actuality, it will take you a while to form the questions as well.  It bears the mark of a well-made horror film (or any film for that matter): it makes you think, and stays with you after leaving the theater.  All three of the students give frighteningly real performances that are wrenching at times, especially Heather's confessional towards the end of the film in which her eyes are those of a hunted, frightened animal.  The movie succeeds on a technical level as well, being largely an improv piece between the three main actors (who incidentally, also completely shot the film, contrary to recent reports that this was untrue) who were given basic character directions and rations by the directors, Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick.  The directors also basically told them, `We will mess with you at night.  You will never be in danger, but you will get messed with.  Film everything.'  What resulted was 18 hours of footage culled from an 8 day trek in the woods that eventually go cut down to a highly effective 82 minute film in which the fear and hunger are, to some extent,  very real.  Take note, this cinema verite approach is not completely new.  Benoit Pooelverde used it to great success in Man Bites Dog, (which also features a similar denouement), and the sparsely released The Last Broadcast also features the same plot device (among other interesting similarities: a crew from a faux documentary access show gets slaughtered in the woods, and their footage is all that is left). Even if the Haxan films guys bit a little off of these preceding films, and I'm not saying that they did, they still managed to turn out a hell of a good film that I can easily label (as a horror buff since infancy) as the scariest this decade.  It has had some detractors, people complaining about the shaky camera work (part of the idea, when you're being chased by a supernatural force in the woods you don't have time to frame up shots), or about the fact that there's no latex-covered face for the horror in the woods, no boogeyman that gives us a payoff, very little gore...but therein lies the charm and freshness.  I challenge any of the naysayers to try to go out and spend a night in the wilderness now.  Then would they realize how deep this film cuts.  It is an innovative and welcome change from Scream-era mindless horror.  The only bad thing is that it will probably spawn a slew of copycats.  But hopefully said copycats will realize that you can make a very good film on a very little budget as long as you have a good script or extremely well-fleshed out idea and an excellent cast.",The Blair Witch Project

Don't believe the hype, you will be duped into parting with hard-earned cash for an hour and a quarter of total rubbish.  If you're expecting to be scared, you will be sorely disappointed.  This is not supposed to be a conventional horror film, but even giving it miles of leeway it fails miserably.  The only enjoyable thing is the comedy factor of watching the two guys flip out at the girl for being an annoying whiner. The first hour is pure comedy in a kind of docu-drama version of 'Slacker' (a great film by the way).  The girl is the annoying, enthusiastic and naive filmaker, Michael is a serious, straight kind of guy and Josh is somewhere inbetween, leaning more towards a kind of surfer-dude than anything else. The interaction between the three is enjoyable, especially when things start to go wrong, but you find yourself wishing they'd either get on with the horror or just give it a miss entirely, as the 'horror' sections in the first hour come simply as annoying interruptions of the comedy.  The last 15 minutes do create some kind of tension and atmosphere, but even that is not used very effectively.

(I'm actually a little curious as to how they spent $35 000 on it!) I'm not surprised that people caught on to it as they did, but just because something is indie doesn't make it good.

The rants and the raves came too much too quickly, and no movie could be expected to fulfill that hype, but still, Blair Witch is contrived, boring, and not at all scary.

""Breakdown of Unit Cohesion"" is what the military calls it, I believe.  The infighting, the head games, the acts of rebellion all struck me as very real and very disturbing.  You just know the minute the guys start questioning Heather (and the minute Heather starts lying to them about whether they are lost) that the group is doomed.  I liked the way each character changed as they reacted to the stress of the situation.

The lines were the longest I'd ever seen, and it took over an hour to get to the front of the line.It was worth every freakin' second of effort.Never has a film given me the stone-cold creeps as this one.  Sleep after viewing does not come quickly or easily.  You'll be discussing the characters' situation and the quick, brutal ending for hours.  Negative reviewers are just trying to look smart.  Forget them, see the film, and never forget it.",The Blair Witch Project
1736,DBTrox,great horror movie,9,13 July 1999,"I thought this was a really original horror movie.  I had trouble deciding if it should be considered a movie or a prank.  When you watch this movie, you feel involved with the characters because they act so naturally. Afterwards i thought that it would be an ultimate prank to show your friends, if they somehow didn't hear all of the hype.  It's the kind of movie that would be fun to watch by yourself or invite a bunch of friends over for a scare.I really enjoyed the fact that the horror is all in your mind. There are no graphic images, no special effects, and no murders shown on camera.  What makes the movie scary is the way that the cast convinces you that they are truly scared and confused.",The Blair Witch Project
1737,LiteLord,"It'll scare the pants off you, but...",8,20 July 1999,"...it will only work if you believe the premise: that three filmmakers vanished while making a documentary on a local ""spook story"", and this footage is all they've left behind.A few folks complained about the unprofessional quality of this movie... especially how jerky the camera is in some scenes.  However, keep in mind that you're essentially watching a home movie of a camping trip gone horribly wrong.  Consequently, if it looked slick and professional, it would destroy the illusion.  Think of it as ""America's Scariest Camping Video"".Nor will I deny that there are a few gaps in the storyline, especially regarding the various aspects of the Blair Witch legend.  But according to the premise, the filmmakers had barely started their project when they hiked into the woods to film a couple of remote sites associated with the legend. Consequently, when they get lost in the woods and odd things begin to happen, they don't have a clue what it means.  How can they tell us what they don't understand?Further, this is primarily a suspense movie.  You spend most of the film waiting for something to happen.  However, in the meanwhile, you see the mental and emotional disintegration of these three filmmakers as they blame one another (and themselves) for their predicament.  But once again: it only works if you believe the premise.  My best friend didn't buy the premise, and he thinks this movie is a piece of crap.Bottom line: This movie is not for everyone.  I strongly recommend that before seeing this movie, you visit the official website at http://www.blairwitch.com.  After reading the background material provided there, you should be able to determine if you can believe the premise.  If you can't, then you will not enjoy the movie.

1739,STPFan,A new disturbing genre is born & Hollywood should be scared!,9,2 August 1999,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is a masterpiece in its own right. The movie is laid out like a student documentary would be. The interaction between the characters is truly realistic from friendly exchanges to mild distress to pure fear. The mysterious disappearance of Josh induces a true array of human reactions in Heather and Mike. This movie leaves you with a chilling climax without the use of computer graphics or blood squibbs. In fact, the psychology of the last chilling schene is what scares you, not the visuals. In addition, every little detail has a significance and returns later in the film to provide a sense of closure.Hollywood is full of the notion that higher budget will mean better box office results. Due to this, Hollywood is only interested in making movies with large budgets and famous stars. This movie had a miniscule budget and no-name actors and is turning heads left and right. I feel the quality of acting in this film is almost unparalleled with any other movie I have ever seen. I hope that Heather Donahue and Michael C. Williams are nominated for Best Actress and Actor. Joshua Leonard also deserves an Oscar nod for Best supporting Actor for his performance in this phenomenal film.But this won't happen. There is too much  Academy to entertain. They will take the latest realease from a major studio for consideration. This new type of ""real life"" motion picture should be a wake up call that big budget, action packed films are on their way out.There are signs though that Hollywood is a little bit intimidated by BLAIR. Dream Works was afraid that their latest offering, ""The Haunting,"" would not be as popular due to its opening against BLAIR. Universal Pictures delayed the release of ""Mystery Men"" a week to prevent it from being slaughtered by BLAIR.My only complaint lies with the theater where I saw this film. I sat 5 rows from the front and I got motion sickness and eye strain from the wobbly camera. I really can't complain about the camera because it did create the mood and tone for the picture. Please, if you see this film and plan to sit in the front, take some motion sickness patches!",The Blair Witch Project

Anyone who has done any type of camping, hiking, backpacking, etc. will find the premise absurd.

Period.  The acting is brilliant.  I never got the sense the 3 were actors speaking lines - I felt they were three armature film students lost in the woods being hunted.

I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone, but the last two nights of the footage shown and probably the last five minutes of the movie had me and my friends shaking and even crying for a couple of seconds.  The actors were absolutely amazing.  The fear that they conveyed was so real and everything was unscripted allowing them to really be scared, mad, etc.  This was a great movie, although I don't think I would ever see it again being that I didn't sleep more than an hour until the sun came up this morning when I finally fell asleep and the fact that I'm still running the last scene through my mind. It still scared me as much as it did when I was in the theatre.

1746,Squishy-8,A triumph in original Film making. A+,10,5 August 1999,"My pick for original film of the year goes to BWP.  It has been a long time since I have been so excited to see a film and boy did this one live up to my expectations.  In my review I would like to make several points about this film and the reactions of other people seeing the film.1.)  If you liked the string of teen slashers we have been forced to endure lately or you liked the remake of the Haunting, then please, do the people who enjoy good films a favor and do not see the film.  I have seen the movie twice and have been through two very different experiences.  The first time I saw was at a local ""art"" theaters, that is to say one of the 27 theaters that got the film on the 15th.  This was a great experience.  It was quiet throughout the WHOLE film and the atmosphere in the theater was that of enjoyment.  The people there knew what they wanted and this film delivered. They basically felt as I did.  The second time I saw the film was at the local stadium theater after the wide release.  This was less than enjoyable. In front of me was a couple with a BABY! Behind me was a family of loud kids and and even louder parents.  They felt it their duty to inform people as to ALL the happenings on the screen and that the movie was boring.  At the end, one patron actually yelled out ""This movie f***ing sucks!""  This was not an enjoyable experience.  I was angry at the people.  This is why I urge you not to go if you are not ready for an intelligent, psychological thriller with virtually no special effects.2.)  I urge everyone else to see this film.  If you want to be scared, see this film.  It reminds me of the first time I saw the Haunting(original). I was so scared because I had to imagine the ""monster"".  I was left to ponder what was going on.  That was so frightening.  I have not been as scared in my life as I was after seeing the BWP.  This film is such a relief from the usually ""here is your cgi monster now be scared darnit"" flicks.Now I'm not saying all intelligent movie goers will enjoy the movie, but I do believe they will be able to see it for what it is, original.  A movie with NO script, NO name actors, and all real human experience.  That what this film captures.  The human experience, and films that do it as successfully as this film are true masterpieces and deserve a second look.",The Blair Witch Project
1747,doctordi,What a snooze....,2,2 August 1999,"I cannot believe that anyone thought this movie was scary.  I'm pretty easily scared and I did not feel scared for one second during the entire film.  I think part of the reason for this is the format.  The entire movie is done with handheld video cameras, and with people talking at the camera. For a movie to be scary, I have to feel like I'm there myself, and then whatever is threatening the characters feels like a threat to me too.  In this movie, I was constantly, painfully aware that I was sitting in a theater watching a movie, and the distance that that created between me and the ""scary"" events made them not even remotely frightening.",The Blair Witch Project
1748,melk666,Cult Film,8,27 January 2000,"I passed over all the marketing exposure. I did not get drowned in documentaries or reviews. I had no expectations of any kind, so I saw the movie as we were supposed to see. This film is about fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of darkness, fear of being lost, scared, hungry and hunted. The actors were credible breeding fear and terror, but not always they succeeded in spreading those feelings in way to get the audience infected. The movie has a dark atmosphere, perfect to create a certain mood. Well, I can say I never get bored at all. The end is far from being bad too.

I think I personally overhyped the movie a little bit, but it was still an excellent movie.  During the movie I was not as scared as I had expected to be.  There were times that I gasped, closed my eyes, and felt my heart race, but somehow I expected more.  Word had it that people were running from the theatre screaming and getting sick at the showing before ours.  What I didn't expect though, was the very gradual sense of horror that grew in the hours after I left the movie theatre.  What I saw in the last few moments of screen time stayed with me, in a way I have never experienced before.  All in all, as an experience, this film did not scare me the way I thought it would, but it did creep and freak me out in a way I never imagined possible.As to the film itself, the gritty, amature feel of the camera work was amazing!  The acting bowled me over as well.  This was an incredibly well made film in addition to being an experience unto itself.  Maybe I am being unrealistic, but this little film deserves recognition from the Academy.",The Blair Witch Project

Even doing that it's hard to not become so terrified that you leave the theatre at the end shaking.  I did.  As fun as it may be, don't allow your friends to believe it's real either.  We're talking psychological and emotional abuse.  There's no gore, no violence, and yet this movie is more terrifying than Halloween and maybe even The Exorcist.  I didn't sleep at night after watching The Blair Witch Project, and I may not be able to sleep for many nights to come.All that scary stuff aside, this film is monumental to modern film making. I have never seen anything like it before, and you can bet there may be a handful of copycats to come.  It is not so much that the directors came up with something original, because I can assure you that they did not, but they created something so utterly successful that it could possibly discourage many people from going into films, simply because they know they couldn't compete.  Chances are, they were lucky -- all the cards fell into place for them.  They found fabulous actors (especially a COMPLETELY believable four-year-old), developed a great premise that actually worked better with a smaller budget, and began a promotional endeavor that will be documented in history books.  Anyone could have been lucky enough to do this, it just happened to be the guys at Haxan Films who found that luck.See this film.  Watch it with friends and be sure to plan on staying up all night afterwards.  You may not notice it for a while, but by the end of the film you could realize that you've been camping with Heather, Josh, and Mike the whole time.  That is what will scare you.

If you've ever had to sit through the projects of some untalented film students you'll find these scenes true to form.  For me, there was no tension building.  The fact that the clueless group was lost in the woods had me worrying more than any supernatural events.This movie is a great example of average filmmaking and excellent low budget marketing.

There was no suspense, all the horror parts lasted only seconds, while having them wander through the woods during the day took up the majority of the screen time. A lot of the reviews state there is a plot spoiler in the text, but how can you spoil a movie where nothing happens.  As far as believing it is a true documentary, the last part shows two of them running around, who is filming.

1761,Felix-30,Get ready for the jitters,8,3 May 1999,"The Blair Witch Project is a landmark in horror filmmaking and should become a sleeper hit upon its release in July.  While not a perfect film, this sure is a damn scary one--scary enough that I had to have my eyes closed quite a number of times during it (in fact, I'm predicting future anxiety attacks among some audience members).  The movie is about three college students who go into the woods to film a documentary on the so-called Blair Witch, and never return.  Their footage, of course, is found one year later, and thus the film itself is seen through the eyes (rather through the camera) of the students themselves.There is not a single cheap scare in the whole film, and that's what makes it so frightening: we are constantly waiting to see something.  Indeed, I often had my eyes closed when the screen was totally blank (as it often is, giving way to one of the most significant sound tracks in recent years). It knows how to prop the generic conventions as well--whenever the sun goes down, the monsters come up.The movie builds an incredible sense of realism (the acting is pitch-perfect), however it disobeys the laws by making the characters ballsier that they ever should be.  It's hard to believe the story when we are saying ""No one would ever do that!"" (ex. turning on all your lights at night when you hear bloody-murder noises) Yet the film is destined to be a (cult at least) classic.  Matriarchal (witch/mom references) and political (""You can't get lost in America"") undertones are sure to stir up a argumentative following about what it all means.  But most of all, it is a thrill ride like no other.  See it if you want to be more consistently scared from beginning to end than perhaps any modern horror film ever made.  *** (out of 4)",The Blair Witch Project

There were some good moments too, such as the 'We're in America - this can't happen' bit, and Heather's breakdown was really moving.

There was nothing genuinely frightening about this all out scam on the American population.  At the very worst there is one jump and a couple of times where the hair on your neck might rise, but nothing ever happens.  This was the handy work of a marketing genius and a filmmaking novice.  We have all been told by critics and other agents of the media how good this movie is, and having invested our money and time in going to see it, we are afraid to admit we were duped.

We have seen recently an increase in special effects and visual effects to scare, thrill and entertain us.  Gone are the days of an actual PLOT or STORY doing those things.  Alfred Hitchcock was the master and this movie reminded me of him.  Since you never see the Blair Witch your imagination is left to fill in the blanks.  I sat there in the theatre and was totally freaked out by the fact that they were being hunted and hadn't the slightest clue as to what was following them around.

1769,Jager76,"Excellent Film, that relies on your imagination for the horror",5,18 July 1999,"I saw this film late last night and let me tell you... It spooked me.  The filmmakers do a very good job of making this look like an amateur documentary like it is supposed to be, even to the point of the shaking camera.  The movie follows the final days of 3 young students on their trek through the woods to film a documentary on ""Blair Witch"" and when they get lost, everything goes downhill from there... I am not going to tell a lot for it would ruin the whole ambiance of the film, but I will tell you 3 things:  1.  If you are in the mood for gore, this is not a film for you. 2. If you want a good scary movie that makes you think, this is the film. 3.  There is no music, but the sound is the true villain....  I highly recommend this film.",The Blair Witch Project

In this respect,it doesn't live up to it's hype,(how could it)?,and if this is the sole criteria on which it is judged,it is bound to disappoint many viewers.For myself, a film made on a shoestring, eschewing overt violence, gore, and bloated Hollywood style special effects is a long overdue breath of fresh air. Additionally, I found the story compelling. The way this trio moves from initial camaraderie, to petulant arguing and sniping, and finally to panic and hysteria is finely conveyed.The last few minutes were unsettling rather than frightening, but I can't help but admire the filmmaker's conviction in crediting their audience with some imagination.In short, this is a film that will not please everyone.

1771,NEO_RAGE,Great movie!!!,9,1 August 1999,"WOW!!! Great movie.  Personally I did not find myself scared because I knew it was a movie but when we left the theatre last night their were about 10 traumatized girls their that could not even open their eyes to look at the credits so scared something else was going to happen.  What makes this movie so good is that you do not have to see a skinny old one with a long nose to actually feel fear, the directors relied on letting your imagination create what the scary sounds were, unlike in the new ""the haunting"" were you saw all the scary things.  The actors were great; they actual had emotions toward what was happening.  If you go and see this movie you can go in two ways in as viewing it.  One this is just movie, there is never really anything out there that is going to hurt them and you know that this people are actual still alive at this very moment.  Your result is a good movie that is quite interesting and intriguing.  Viewing two going in thinking that this was real people put yourself in their place, believing that thing was happening to you and you end up with a movie that will probably scare the $#!^ out of you. 
Closing analysis great movie worth the wait in live and worth the money.

It is not scary, or even creepy; it is astonishing that anyone could find it so much as unsettling. Moreover, the performance of the main character/actor Heather Donohue is unbelievable and overacted.If you must see this movie, wait for it to come out on video or on TV; it simply doesn't need to be seen on a big screen.  In fact, it simply needn't be seen at all; don't waste your time or money with it.If you want a quality psychological movie in the horror/thriller genre try Les Diabolique (1955) or The Innocents (1961).",The Blair Witch Project
1773,Loretta-4,What Idiot Would Run Around a Supposedly Haunted Forest Without a Cell Phone???,1,2 August 1999,"It might be a cleverly crafted, extremely well-edited movie, but I found it dreadfully dull, unsuspenseful, and downright NOT scary, not to mention boring.  I never was drawn into the plot and never had any sympathy for the characters.  I was never made to care who they were as persons.  It was like sitting through someone's home movies of a backyard sleepover.  I'm sorry but unscripted, improvisational dialog does not work with this story.  They needed some effects, ANY effects, even extremely simple ones to at least stir our imaginations.  If they had had more thrown at them to react to and play against, it would have been gripping.  As it is, it was lukewarm and even more unworthy of the hype than The Phantom Menace.",The Blair Witch Project

Now all I have to say is, `What's the big deal?'. There was almost nothing scary in this movie  psychological or otherwise. 95% of the dialog in this film was either whining or bickering. The viewer doesn't `share' in their psychological terror, they just want them dead, so that the whining will stop. I will say that I did enjoy the tense climax  but having to put up with the rest of the film to get there just wasn't worth it. An interesting note: I have never heard such a violent crowd reaction at the finish of a film. Booing, jeering and the shouting of some very colorful commentary followed the rolling of the credits.  Add some pitchforks and torches, and we might have had a good old witch burning!",The Blair Witch Project
1775,PNuke,Best horror movie in years!!,10,25 July 1999,"Less can be more, and for 'The Blair Witch Project' less means more realistic and more terrifying.  Despite (or because of) no gore or special effects, a better horror movie will not be released this year.  The mockumentary follows three young film students into the Maryland woods in search of the legend of the Blair Witch.   The movie itself offers little about the history of the legend.  Glints of information are presented as hearsay and gossip from the interviewed townsfolk and a turn of the century text on the little known legend.  It works to the picture's benefit, as does the grainy feel of the handheld footage comprising the entire picture.  The result is an  impossibly heavy tone of mystery, paranoia, and hysteria that builds layer upon nerve fraying layer.  The writers and directors understood what it takes to make an effective horror movie.  They constructed likeable and believable characters.  We're not watching a platnum bimbo and mindless frat boy being stalked by a faceless menace, we like and want the three young students to make it.  Secondly, they understood that what we can't see is always scariest.  The beast is never as frightening or as real on screen as it is in our craven minds.

After having seen the trailer, I've been facinated by the movie and after having red a few things about it on the net, I was convinced that it would be the first movie ever to scare me up and the fitst horror movie to disturb me. Well, not at all. I don't think I've been scare more than ten seconds at all in the movie. But it's still a really great movie. I've been impressed by the cast performance, I felt the tension rising and I've loved all the dialogues, especially from Heather, witch provided pretty funny moments. However, I do get why people vomited in several teathers. It's not because of the emotional charge but because of the hand camera effets, always moving one side to the other, enought to give everybody who gets disturb in a simulator a nausea. Maybe that's what broke my trill. I was actually hoping the movie ends fast. I had to close my eyes every minutes for 10 seconds to make the nausea pass. Maybe it will be the first movie actually more trilling to watch on video.",The Blair Witch Project

Most people lost interest after 10-15 minutes and began talking or left the room.

""Yeah people are getting motion sickness because the camera work is shaky."" Whatever, I thought, some people are wimps. Until the movie started. Because the screen was so big and the image so jumpy I seriously had to concentrate to keep from vomiting. I had to take deep breaths like after I've drank too much. Anyway the movie had some scary moments, but nothing that made me believe all the hype......until the end, needless to say, my friends and I were all scared by the ending. It'sambiguous, but it's so freaking cool. When I got home I was scared until I had all the lights on, and my friends were with me!!

What caught my eye was not only the movie, but the audience members whom I sat next too. They were abosoltuely captivated by this movie. As I was. I haven't been this scared for a long time. Usually movies that are of the ""suspense"" genre are all to predictable. But Blair Witch Project had twist after twist. I felt so sorry for those three out in the middle  of the Maryland woods, far from food, far from water, and from hope. I actually left the movie shaking after the climatic end, that in my opinion was perfectly written, and shot. I won't spoil anything thing for those of you that havent seen BWP, but I highly suggest this for those of you that loved to have your very soul scared by this movie. One thing that should be included with this movie is warning label for the weak of heart.  I'm certainly going to see this one again!",The Blair Witch Project
1784,ntaylor,Rare gem unspoiled by weak ending,10,2 August 1999,"[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]It seems to me that horror films have evolved over the past 20 years to the point where the writers are forced to rely on pretty superstars running from a masked villain and directors are required to have buckets upon buckets of fake blood and intestines on standby.All in favour of a change, raise your hands.I thought so.""The Blair Witch Project"" is an oasis in a desert of pathetic, half-thought out chop-slop flicks and is destined to stand out among such greats as dePalma's ""Carrie"" and Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"".  The reason I say this is simple:  Nothing like this has been done within recent memory.  The concept itself is so unique that the directors very well could have let the concept ""coast"" the film along, but instead they chose to make it a character study and it paid off.What really made this film great was the sense of impending doom that slowly crushes the spirits of the three characters.  Several scenes in the film such as the scene in the abandoned house and the discovery of a certain item hidden within a bundle of twigs are sure to go down in cinematic history.My only problem with ""The Blair Witch Project"" was the ending, which seemed to be rather ""tacked on"" and personally speaking not all that scary. However, the rest of the film does not pale because of it, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting the bejesus scared out of them.10/10Nathan Taylor",The Blair Witch Project

Especially since the concept for the film is really terrific!  I mean its just a great idea! However, I felt they really failed to deliver on it.  My biggest complaint about the movie was how stupid the characters acted.  Of course this is the problem with almost all horror movies made today.  If someone would only make a horror movie that didn't use stupidity to move the plot along then perhaps we would see a scary movie.  Another problem the movie had was an inconsistency in the behavior of one of the characters who goes from being a complete coward to someone who doesn't appear to be scared of anything at the end. Between myself and the others in my group as well as several people I've talked to since I've seen the movie, we've come up with a sizable list of things wrong with this movie.

1791,ADM-4,The Scariest Movie Ever,10,16 July 1999,"This film is so scary because it is so pure. It never abandons its two main conceits: the documentary footage, and the invisibility of the terror. The result traps you in a way that other horror films fail to. You never see the hatchet man waiting around the corner, you never peer through a bedroom window, you never have a point-of-view removed from the characters. The effect of this, drawn out over 90 minutes, is startling, especially to viewers accustomed to the tongue-in-cheekiness of Scream, the irony of which purposely distances us from the character's terror. In Blair Witch, there is no distance: we see what they see, we feel what they feel.The facelessness of the terror contrasts with the other horror films that stay with you days afterward. The Shining and The Exorcist, for example, both put a demon of sorts inside of an ordinary human. Your fear comes from watching what these humans-gone-awry do to other people, and from the implication that the ""demon"" is really just a malevolence lying dormant inside each of us, or at least inside someone you know.By contrast, Blair Witch lets the terror inhabit the woods, immutable and insuperable. In The Shining, there is always the hope that Jack will come to his senses or Danny will escape. In The Exorcist, you can hope that the little girl will just ""go back to normal."" There is no such hope in Blair Witch.There are a hundred places in this film where it could have gone wrong, but amazingly, the cast and crew pulled it off without a hitch. A few of the film's early moments don't ring quite true, but these incidents are minor, and forgotten as soon as the kids get into the woods.Once they get there, it is impossible to take your eyes off the screen. As one of the characters says (roughly), ""I'm afraid to close my eyes, but I'm afraid to keep them open.""It is amazing how potent the film's photography is, in light of the actors being the chief camera operators. The ad hoc nature of the photography is nonetheless gripping, as the film's publicity shots reveal. Among the thousands of shots that comprise the film, though, it is one that most stands out in my mind: the film's final image will never leave me.",The Blair Witch Project
1792,Ed-181,Boring and trivial,2,17 October 1999,"A good premise -- finding video and film left behind by three folks who disappeared in a dense forest -- and generally good acting -- all three main characters and those in supporting roles were fine.  However, the film is very repetitive, which makes it seem much longer than it really is.  (A plot summary would take about ten sentences, at most.)  In addition, somehow the ""villain"" never seemed real.  And, PLEASE, don't tell me that someone would have prepared for such an outing (as our heroine supposedly did with her backpacker's guide) and not know that if you get lost and come upon a stream, you simply follow it downstream until you find a home, town, or the shore of a large body of water, any of which allow you to quickly find others.",The Blair Witch Project

After eagerly anticipating this movie all summer, I can honestly say the only thing I was disappointed in was the one idiot in the whole theater (who happened to be behind me) who felt it necessary to continue saying how stupid the movie was throughout the entire thing.  I notice he stayed for the whole movie, however.  No one left, and no one moved or said anything throughout the whole last half of the movie.  It was the quietest theater I've ever been in.  This is the only movie I've been to where I felt more scared an hour after I left the theater than I did while watching it.  If you're expecting ""Scream,"" don't even go--you will hate it.  If you like having the hair on the back of your neck stand up while you're watching a blank screen, you want to catch this one.

Almost every aspect of this movie is outstanding.  The camera work adds so much to making the experience more realistic, and while you are watching it you can almost feel what the characters are feeling.  And I found the movie overall to be very original, which is wonderful to see in a summer that is being dominated by movies which are full of distasteful humor or are high tech and without a plot. This movie doesn't have any gross humor and it is not high tech, but it could be the best movie of the summer.

Isn't it ironic that what I feel is perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made was done by two college film-school buddies, with their credit cards, with no-name actors, with no blood, special effects or violence, and with camcorders!  I'm tempted to never pay for a movie again.  Those characters were so real!  I found myself telling them to calm down and try to pull together, I wanted them to get out of there alive.

It really isn't the thought of a madman killer, or a swift, fatal disease--it is the unknown, the odd. And this film is full of the unsettling...the inexplicable. And that is why this film succeeds. Not by making us shriek in terror, but by giving us a gnawing feeling of unease and doubt.One last note: If you are prone to motion sickness, wait for the video.

The film itself is very well done and the ending is one of the best ever.  And finally a horror film of the 1990's that hasn't copied Scream.  A truly great horror film that can be compared to the likes of The Haunting. A must see if you like horror films or suspence thrillers.,The Blair Witch Project
1813,arkie-2,Very Disappointing!!!!!,1,23 August 1999,"I attended this movie with ""high hopes"" and was thoroughly disappointed.  In no way did this movie even come close to scaring me.  The only thing it did was make me sick at my stomach from the amateur use of the video camera. I'm still waiting for that movie that really scares me & Blair Witch didn't deliver.  A BIG WASTE OF MONEY - ON MY PART!!! Don't be tempted to see it - you will come away wishing you had stayed home!!!",The Blair Witch Project
1814,E TiE,Not scary but funny all things considered.,5,19 July 1999,"My advice to anyone planning on being scared in this movie is not to read the details on how it was made or anything else other than just the ""mythological"" backstory to it.Anyway, I went to this movie expected to be scared. Instead, I found that it was quite absurdly amusing in a number many ways: First, the characters just losing it and freaking out, Mike especially, was funny. It was understandable for them to be frustrated by the situation but they didn't do much to resolve it, instead they worsened it. Then secondly, we had Heather, despite being supposedly upset, frustrated, scared or losing it, had the ever present video recorder or 16mm camera by her side -- I mean, right up to the end!. How unrealistic and absurd is that? Too funny. Then thirdly, the plain stupidity of the characters -- hello?!? -- follow the path of the river or stream, that's should be in that ""survival"" camping book you showed us earlier. And how dumb can you be to have a map and a compass and not find your way home, but instead, throw away the map and get mad then tape it all! Ridiculous! Then the ending was a complete joke. What spoiled this movie was that I'd read a number of articles on this movie and how it was made.... I did enjoy the movie, not because I was scared s***less, but cuz I was laughing so much at the shear absurdity of it. --e!",The Blair Witch Project
1815,hdavis76,Disturbing and Inventive,8,2 August 1999,"Blair Witch is one of those movies that people will be talking about for years to come.  The movie doesn't rely on blood, gore, or surprising shock scenes (which have become over used in most horror movies), but on a building sense of terror that is never released until the very end.  We are also never given any easy answers about what is happening.  We know exactly what the students know, which is really very little.  My only complaint is that the camera work was so jumpy at times that it made it hard to focus on the screen.  However, this is just me being very picky.  Overall, it was a great movie that I would recommend to any fan of horror movies.",The Blair Witch Project
1816,veovix-2,F a n t a s t i c !,10,18 July 1999,"Saw TBWP opening day in Seattle WA, and was Blown away. The film has a way of drawing you into the group; making you feel as if you are lost in the woods with them. Heather, Josh and mike seem like old friends.. friends whom are lost, hunted and traumatized.  There is a feeling of claustrophobic anxiety that builds with each scene. You want them to escape the woods but you know they are doomed. Finally, in the final scenes, claustrophobia explodes into out-right terror..  the best terror I've ever experienced in a movie theatre.Blair Witch is both horrifying and heartbreaking.. For two days now I've felt like I'm mourning lost friends who died mysteriously, even though I was there to see their 'end.' This is only possible because of the films total believablity. A masterwork of fakery..Heather, Mike, Josh?  are you OK?",The Blair Witch Project

One recommendation though:  see the website first. (It'll give you a better context for what happens, leave you with fewer questions, and possibly prepare you to be even *more* freaked out.)  The acting was excellent, BTW, and if Heather doesn't get nominated for Best Actress, there is no justice....",The Blair Witch Project
1818,stonkey,This is no ordinary scary movie,10,20 July 1999,"I'm of a generation that knows the horror genre primarily as a gore-ridden slasher fest. I'm talking about a type of movie that sought to scare through cheap shock tactics that never work the second time around (IMHO). This movie does not employ shock value. It keeps you guessing, keeps you wondering, keeps you worrying. This is not a fun scare. This movie follows you home and whispers things in your ear, conjures images from the movie in your mind, when you're trying to get to sleep. It takes our primal fears of the dark and unknown and makes them a raw, visceral reality. An experience of eight horrifying days is distilled into one eight-seven minute descent into walking nightmare. Do not watch it alone. Do not watch it at night. It is the most effective, consistently horrifying piece of cinema I have ever seen. I could not have imagined that a movie could scare me so much. Anyone who has not seen it should take heed: it will hurt your mind. It is not gross. It is hardly bloody. It is hardly violent. The R rating is primarily because of extensive profanity. But it should be rated R regardless of the profanity. Don't take your kids to see it unless they've done something bad.",The Blair Witch Project

Don't get me wrong -- this was a really, really good movie -- GREAT premise and fabulous performances.  But it just wasn't scary!  My friends and I discussed it at length and decided the best word was ""creepy.""  If we hadn't been exposed to all the buildup and spoilers, we would have been very impressed, indeed.

It was thinking about the events AFTER the movie was over that I got scared.  Haven't felt that way since The Haunting (the original, not the special-effects laden remake).Very well done! All the more to feel this way when you realize that the story is well within the bounds of reality and not the supernatural.Definitely not for the faint of heart or people who love camping.

1821,joerum,Good movie overwhelmed by hype,7,24 October 1999,"The Blair Witch Project was a good movie, but totally overwhelmed by the hype surrounding it.I first became aware of Blair a while back when one of their promo trailers ran on a cable access channel here in Brooklyn.  It left me questioning whether this was a true story or some put on.  It was very well done and really psyched me for the acutal movie.  However, all the hype became totally out of hand once the movie was released.Now, to the movie itself.  The plot line was very well developed at the beginning of the movie and was able to sustain itself for the initial foray of Heather, Mike and Josh in the woods.  However, the mid section with everyone running around in the woods became extremely tedious and even annoying at time with their ineptitude.  But, this was rectified with the truly spooky ending, the type that will always haunt you (if you got into the movie that is).  I really appreciated a horror story built around the psychological elements of fear as opposed to a lot of overrated special effects.My rating - 7.",The Blair Witch Project
1822,farley77,What future horror films should follow,8,2 August 1999,"I had been waiting over a month before finally seeing this master piece. TBWP is by far the creepiest, most frightening film to come out in a real long time. Those that didn't appreciate this truly great film are either lacking in imagination, or too young to remember classic horror films like The Shining. This film isn't like Scream, which makes you jump a number of times throughout the movie. No, this is much more. The unique camera views make you feel like you are there with them. Rather than use fake looking monsters, the film makers force the audience to use their imagination. Assuming you have one, the worst possible images will invade your mind. The simple sounds are so effective because the feeling of being in the woods at night is freaky alone. When the film was over, my original reaction was that it lacked some truly frightening effects. However, as my girlfriend and I talked about the film, I continued to relive the experience, each time creating a more terrifying image to go with the experience. I am still reliving the final scene, constantly inventing new ideas about what happened. I now see that this is the scariest movie I've seen, because I can't get it out of my head.",The Blair Witch Project
1823,TragicLad,If you've ever been spooked by the thing going bump in the night - then this is the film for you.,10,12 August 1999,"Like many, my first exposure to this film came on the internet.  Word of mouth in newsgroups and chatrooms.  ""Can't wait for this film.""  ""It was sooooo scary.""  ""As soon as it's out in theatres, I'm going again.""  I made a mental note to myself - see this Blair Witch Project that everyone's talking about.And my chance came, as a special advanced midnight screening came to Toronto.  I was all set to hop on the subway and enjoy the show, but then Space happened to run ""Curse of the Blair Witch"".  An examination of the Blair Witch throughout history, told as a straight-faced documentary.  As I understand it, this mockumentary was originally intended to be part of the film - but the filmmakers separated the two, feeling that the footage alone was powerful enough to stand on its own.  Well, ""CotBW"" was fairly powerful in its own right, as I decided to skip the midnight showing.  I'm an atheist with little fear of spooks and ghosts, and I'm a veteran horror film watcher.  It takes a fair bit to put the scare into me, but based on this one hour mockumentary, I had come to the conclusion that leaving this film in the dead of night and making my way home alone was a definite no-no.  I decided to forgo this viewing in favour of seeing it with a group of friends when it reached general release.A wise choice.The story is a simple one.  Three filmstudents enter the woods in 1994 to make a documentry on local boogey man, the Blair Witch.  They never returned.  One year later their film is found.  Edited together, it tells the story of their last days.The film may be disappointing for some.  Unlike the current hollywood trend of ""cgi monsters on parade"", this film sticks with the ""less is more"" school of filmmaking.  It doesn't spoonfeed answers to the audience - no confident scientist or brave police officer to explain bit by bit just how it all fits together.  No denouement to wrap it up in a nice and neat package.  There are no audio or visual cues to inform the viewer of impending danger.  Rather, the filmmakers have chosen a much more intimate approach.  We are forced to take in the information at the same pace the characters receive it.  We see what they see.  We know what they know.  Not all the questions are answered. Even the ending is open to multiple interpretations.This is a film devoid of effects or any form of Hollywood sparkle - as such, the entire film rests upon the strength of the actors.  Though I'm sure much of what we are seeing is the actors playing themselves, the performances are powerful.  That many are leaving the theatres convinced that what they just witnessed was an actual event is a testament to these actors' abilities.I would like to think that this film would act as a signal to Hollywood that we don't need multimillion dollar effects and actors to make a successful movie.  All that is needed are good actors and filmmakers who believe in the story they are telling. Alas, I fear the only thing they will take away is ""Hurray, we don't have to pay cameramen any more.""  Be prepared for a wave of really bad mockumentries nipping on the heels of the Blair Witch.If you like films that provokes thought and discussion, if you are a fan of scary stories, if you've ever been spooked by the thing going bump in the night - than this is the film for you.

Out of the 87 minutes, about 15 are just downright creepy, and the other 72 minutes kind of leave you asking for more, or atleast what the trailers and the website promises. It is very refreshing though to see a good movie actually scaring you without using gory effects or grotesque computer imagery. This one lets your imagination do the work, and work it does!

If you must see this thing, bring plenty of dramamine: it will reduce the nausea and if you're lucky, it will put you to sleep for the rest of the movie.

The whole thing is an amateur documentary that three teenagers made with a home video camera. Really, there is absolutely no real cinematography in the entire flick. Furthermore, there was no action at all. Not once did you see or hear more than some clicks in the night and some bloody teeth or something outside their tent in the morning. And really that was the only part that seemed like a horror, but since it was filmed so shakily and cheaply, even that part wasn't at all scary or interesting. I could have made this ""movie"" with a couple of my friends. It was straight out of MTV's ""Real World"" watching them all bickering and swearing at each other. Every night it was the same BS. One ""scene"" where they're all scared cause they hear noises. Not at all scary. Not at all entertaining. It's a home video. Every lousy thing you see is shot through one of their two camcorders.

It really touched my senses and the movie brought to me the very elements that scare me in my own nightmares. The things that you can't see but , rather, implied have a greater effect upon your senses than those that you can! Perhaps those who had a vehement dislike to the movie should view it a second time uninterrupted just as I did. I am too scared to watch it a third time at the moment as the aura of the movie still haunt me. If watching it a second time doesn't affect you then, this is not the movie for you.

It took a little while to get used to the 16mm camera, and documentary style, but it added to the terror with its natural sound and reality.  Such a simple idea as this must leave big-horror-movie buffs and agencies kicking themselves, because it shows that audiences are truly terrified not by serial killers wielding chainsaws coming through the wall, but by symbols and slight crackling noises that leave chills for days and weeks to come.

Stylistically the film views as an ameteur video shot through a home video camera which adds to the realistic suspense present in the film maker's lost footage. Unfortunately, the style of the film will undoubtedly lend itself to negative criticism from viewers entrenched in the superficiality of the high priced - low substance modern american film.

This movie had no plot, no actors, no script, no scares, and absolutely no business being on the big screen.  It was a childish attempt at horror. The ""actors"" made the lines up as they went along and you could tell.  The best they could come up with is ""f"" this and ""f"" that.  That took a whole lot of talent. NOT!  As for the horror factor, three idiots running around the woods with a video camera screaming at each other is not scary.  The way they handled the camera, I'm surprised no one had to leave the theatre to throw up from motion sickness.  You were never shown anything that could actually scare you.  Hand prints on a deserted houses walls is not scary. Noises in the woods barely audible is not scary.  Twigs tied together is not scary.  A chicken heart in a hanky is not scary. What is scary is all the over rated whoopla that has been made about this thing.  What is even scarier is people spending that kind of money to see it.

I feel as though you should have been warned you that if you go to see this 'home video, you'll feel as though you've been hugely ripped off. I did! I saw BWP in my local cinema; a place where I have known people to stand and applaud at the end of a film (sad but true). The only reaction when this one finished was an audible groan and mutterings of 'was that it?'.The best way to describe it is annoying. The jumpy, grainy picture is annoying. The constant bickering and profanity is annoying. The huge holes in the story (go downstream!!) are annoying and, above all, the totally unsatisfactory ending is annoying. I sat and watched past the credits just in case they'd snuck something in to explain what had been going on!
OK, having said all of the above, it does have one thing going for it. It's got people talking about films (at the time of typing, there are over 1900 other comments posted).

I will say that I may have been biased by the hype, but this movie was not scary at all.  I was expecting to see a movie that actually made me jump or get worked up.  There was only one time that this movie could have made me jump, when they were in the tent and the sides were being pounded on, but by then I was just so annoyed by the annoying personalities, I just wanted the movie to end.  I will say that I am sorry that I feel this way, I really wanted to like and be scared by this movie, but it just wasn't the case.  I could see that the three students were scared, at least by their level of swearing, they seemed to be, but their fright was not properly passed on to me.  What would I have done different? First off, make some of the shots a little clearer, when Heather was opening the stick packet and found the bloody mess, I couldn't make out what it was. I understand that it was part of Josh, but WHAT WAS IT?  It just added to my annoyance.  Add the outside perspective, not just one of the characters shooting.  After the 2nd or 3rd night of horror, they could have realistically set up a camera to record the campsite so we could see something happening.Like I said, I've been waiting for a movie to really scare the s**t out of me and hoped this would do it, but I was severely disappointed.

1847,De Niro-5,Scary? Not in the Least. Unintentionally Funny? You Bet.,7,25 September 1999,"There is a craze that is currently sweeping the country, or maybe it's more like some type of misdirected phenomena.  It's called ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and it has received almost as much hype as that long-awaited ""first"" entry in the ""Star Wars"" saga.  Make no mistake about it; the Blair Witch is definitely something to marvel at, even if it's more for its utter stupidity than anything else.  Filmed in 16mm black-and-white, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is filmed like a documentary.  After about five minutes of watching the camera wobble from the ground to the sky and back to the ground again, the viewer is overcome by a splitting headache and a desperate urge to vomit.  Actually, much of the film is spent with the camera directed at the ground, leaving the viewer to wonder if the filmmakers were looking for the Blair Witch or merely looking for rare species of ants.  With a running length of 87 minutes, approximately 75 minutes of this time is consumed with the student filmmakers, who are the center of this lowly production, running around in the woods, lost, screaming obscenities at each other.  One is left to wonder that if they would have shut up and actually walked for a little while, they would probably have stumbled upon a strip mall within 5 minutes. But that obviously wouldn't be interesting enough. So forward we trek with our documentary crew, fully absorbed in the frightening reality of their situation.  While the threesome soon run out of food and supplies, the camera continues to roll, as if it's powered by a nuclear generator.  I don't want to give away any more details about this ""fright-fest,"" but let's just say that the three leads in this film are intolerable at best, and are representative of everything that the youth of America stands for: incessant chain-smoking and rampant profanity.  How proud we are. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.  I found myself highly anticipating this film upon its release, due to all the great thing I had heard about it.  After about 30 minutes, however, I was hoping that a fellow audience member would feel as cheated as I, and do everyone a favor and go on a mass killing spree in the theater.  The producers wish to promote this film by saying that it is ""the unseen terror"" in ""The Blair Witch Project"" that makes it so darn scary.  After viewing this travesty, though, it is my belief that the witch is never revealed simply because the movie was so damn low-budget.  1.2/5 stars.",The Blair Witch Project
1848,cookie-63,"Too much use of the ""F"" word and not enough frights!",5,31 October 1999,"From the reviews and all the hype, I was expecting this to be a really frightening film, but was disappointed to find it was not scary at all. The most shocking thing about the film was how much the ""F"" word was used.I saw this on DVD, the special edition, and found that the ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" documentary was more entertaining.",The Blair Witch Project

1850,Grassman,There's someone making a lot of money by giving me motion sickness.....,5,5 August 1999,"The movie itself was fairly refreshing. There were no hooded creeps with hooks-for-hands trying to kill big-breasted highschool girls....However....The method of filming made me feel ill. It really did.  About 6 people left during the relatively short film to go yak up their popcorn, simply because it was hard to watch.  I know, I know...that's how it's supposed to be, but crud, who needs to have a headache just from watching a movie?",The Blair Witch Project
1851,liselle-3,Don't expect to be scared....,3,5 August 1999,"I was very dissappointed in this movie, and, it seemed, so was everyone else in the theatre.  The movie ended and the theatre was immediately filled with people saying ""that's it?!?"" ""that wasn't scary"" ""what a bunch of hype"" and comments in the same vein.  This movie seemed to have such potential, but it was just never realized.  There were scenes that *began* to be scary, but they were few and far between and too short to ever cross over the line to *actually* scary.  If you have never been camping, perhaps this movie will affect you differently, but basically, there is nothing inherently frightening about the woods in the day light (where most of the film is shot).  Even the *characters* weren't frightened in the day... tired, hungry, irritable, frightened of being *lost*, yes, but any ""fear"" they displayed at the supernatural nighttime activities faded as soon as the sun came up.  The best scenes were the night scenes, when the screen is black or the only lighting was the light from their camera, but even these did not cause enough genuine fear to sustain any sort of feeling that this was a frightening movie that you were watching.Worth seeing if you are a fan of independent films, but there are many better ones to see.  Some very praise worthy method acting took place in this film, but  scary it is not.  After reading all the praise posted so far, I have no idea what the theatre full of people and I missed during our showing, but I wish I would have saved the $8 and waited to see this one on Encore.",The Blair Witch Project

1853,Ovular,A terror in your own head...,8,6 August 1999,"The Blair Witch Project is the most unique approach to horror that I have ever seen.  This is the first time I have actually felt the real emotion in a horror flick.  And though the film itself is creepy beyond creepy, the most unsettling thing about it is that I found myself incapable of turning my bedroom light off that night.  And I DO mean incapable.  The film plants unpleasant seeds in your imagination.  And therefore the audience brings the horror home with them. The shaky camera handling and home video feel of the film convinces us that we are seeing something real, something that perhaps we are not supposed to see.  Such an effect can only result in tension and suspense, making for an interesting reaction when things finally go bump in the night. An incredibly imaginative and clever film, The Blair Witch Project is a definite must-see for anyone immune to motion-sickness.",The Blair Witch Project
1854,ash24m,"GENUINELY SCARY AND VERY ORIGINAL, A FUTURE CLASSIC!!!!",9,8 August 1999,"I don't care what some people say, this movie to me is way scarier than the exorcist, Well i guess it all depends on what gets you scared, I remember walking along though a wooded path by my house when i was younger and i couldn't see my hand in front of my face and as i walked i would step on a dry leaf because it was fall at the time and a couple of seconds later the leaf would un crunch, It felt like someone was behind me the whole time, That is the kind of unknown fear that is a lot scarier than any special affect could ever conjure up . This movie really reminded me of that time and gave me the allusion that i was with them in those woods, I thought it was so original and really played with the audiences imagination and anyone who says it sucks is just trying to be cool. I'd recommend it to anyone who has a good imagination.",The Blair Witch Project

Any comparisons to Cannibal Holocaust or the last broadcast or any other movie that may be construed as similar are way out of line, this was so much more then those movies will ever be. It surely deserves to go down as one of the best Horror Movies of all time. You people really need to take a second look at this Masterpiece and appreciate it for what it is, a true classic. Use some imagination people!. The acting was excellent; any one of you would have acted like a bunch of screaming schoolgirls if you were in that situation and you know it. Some people say, ""Who would be scared of a pile of rocks. The answer is anyone who has been hungry and scared for days on end would have a heightened send or paranoia, and if you were already scared to begin with a pile of rocks outside your tent that wasn't there earlier would scare you, as someone had to have put it there.

This movie is utter crap.  The only thing scary about it is contemplating being stuck ANYWHERE with these 3 losers.  If you even consider the possibility that this incident really happened, the world is a better place to live without Heather, Mike and Josh.  Consider that they are surrounded in dry, dead tree leaves, smoking cigarettes, and screaming at each other about how lost they are.  Light a damn  signal fire and someone will come and rescue you!  I think you can hear the sound of small airplanes overhead during the film, and I am expected to believe that these 3 college students can't figure out that they should signal them?I was expecting something like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" from this film. I got a film I could have made myself.  ""Honey, dust off the camcorder; let's get rich!""",The Blair Witch Project
1857,paladin-38,This movie is the punk-rock answer to the baroque excesses of a genre grown tired and self-indulgent.,8,8 August 1999,"Within one month of each other, 2 watershed movies have opened that have, each in their own way, done more to shake the hoary old genre of horror movies to its foundations than any movies in decades.One is the Blair Witch Project; the other is The Sixth Sense.The horror genre has been mired for some time in the baroque self-indulgence of superficial and ornamental special effects.  The Blair Witch Project has come along like the cinematic equivalent of punk rock---stripping away the self-indulgence to help rediscover the elemental core of the genre.The Sixth Sense is quite another matter entirely:  it is quite simply a great pop movie----deeply felt, humanistic---and almost certain to be overlooked and underestimated.  It is a movie that uses the conventions of the horror genre, but bends them to its own purposes. Like the movie ET, which taught us that not all aliens are unfriendly invaders, and in so doing, liberated the alien/sci fi genre.......so to The Sixth Sense steadfastly refuses to view the spirit world as some adolescent frat-party of frights. Instead, it reacquaints us with the age-old lore that tells us that the dead shall walk the earth as long as their spirits are troubled.  The dead do not haunt the earth, and our memories, just to scare us---but because they want something from us, some grace note that gives their lives meaning, and settles old hurts and misunderstandings, but not in the immature and vengeful way that the horror genre had descended into.  And we the living want something from the deceased who have left us:  we want them to be proud of us, to give us their blessing.And so this movie, incredibly enough for a movie that plays almost straight with the conventions of the horror genre, is a subtle meditation about love and connectedness and relationships, between the living, and between the living and the dead.  It is a movie about redemption.  And one thing it helps to redeem is the genre that it arises from.",The Blair Witch Project
1858,Bgfamily-2,Fear of The Unknown!!,9,8 August 1999,"Simply put, ""The Blair Witch Project"" will scare you with what it doesn't do. No special effects, No blood and gore, No actual creature or strange being to jump at you on screen, just plain old fashion fear of the unknown!! A very simple movie by today's ""Star Wars"" Standard, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is actual footage from three film students(Heather Donahue,Michael C.Williams and Joshua Leonard).The film and video tapes where found in 1995 during an archaeologist dig in the area by students from the University of Maryland, a year after the disappearance of the three students in 1994, in the very same woods were the filming of the documentary took place. The three had gone into the woods near Burkittseville, Maryland to do a documentary on a local Legend of The Blair Witch, never to be found again. The film is not of the best quality and there are a lot of scenes where you see nothing at all(but hear the students talking and the fear that surrounds and is coming from them),but what makes this movie great is the unknown. Know one knows what ever happened to the three students and all we have left is their film. You never actually see ""The Blair Witch"" in the documentary, but it is those things that happen to the three of them combined with the fear of the unknown that make this movie terrifying. Some would say its a hoax, I say open up your mind and be prepared to be scared!!",The Blair Witch Project

1860,bsmaurer,Ignorant People Just Won't Get It,10,8 August 1999,"Dear Harsh Critics of the Blair-Witch Project:It sickens me to think of all the ignorant people out there complaining about the quality of the BWP video or the annoyance of the characters, because that is in essence what I like about the movie.  The movie makes no effort to be thrills OR chills. . . it just attempts to show you what would REALLY happen if gen-Xers went into the woods and experience what before was ONLY a legend firsthand.  I've heard people say ""Oh, how stupid do you have to be to get lost in the woods?"" and my reply to that is that they were never supposed to leave.  That was the whole point of it.  Supernaturality changes all dimensions of reality and this is what one has to expect.  So what if the characters broke down and cussed and were annoying--thats reality.  How many people can you claim to know who wouldn't freak out after four days in the woods and something attacking you every night?  Don't you realize that your cushy little suburban houses and apartments will give you nothing but reason to make fun of a camping venture?  I went out into the woods less than a week before seeing the movie, and I realize firsthand that all one needs to be scared is his or her own mind.  I went into the theatre to enjoy the movie, whereas most people went in to disprove a ""hyped movie."" This sickens me.  If you are determined to break apart a movie before you go in, then you will hate the movie.  But if you go in with the notion that maybe you might be able to enjoy this for its reality and creativity and simplicity, then who knows?  You may not act like a total *&#!head when you write your next review.  So from now on, I implore you to look away from the everyday explosions and guns and sex and instead look for a steadfast film which will challenge your mind and delve into the depths of the human soul and reality the way that the Blair Witch film did.  (And yes, I am an avid fan of Die Hard Movies)  But what really needs to happen lately is an awakening in the entertainment industry to challenge its viewers to think rather than be thought for, as the way it is these days.  If we disobey the norms of this ""Dawson's Creek/MTV"" era, then maybe we'll be a little bit more individualistic and real to ourselves rather than be just another name on a BIG MOVIE BOX OFFICE ticketholder.  Also, does anyone realize how bad the Titantic sucked but how good it became because of its hype?  It won best picture... err... bought best picture, when it had no business even being nominated!  It showed no real ingenuity other than the best special effects James Cameron's money can buy and yet everyone loved it, just because they were supposed to.  So I urge all of you Blair-Witch Nay-sayers to get off your asses and view this film as psychology and reality rather than spectre's and amateur video.  Its supposed to be amateur.  Its supposed tobe annoying.  But most importantly, its supposed to be real.  So enjoy this fact, this innovation rather than shoot it to the ground because it doesn't fit the norm of what Hollywood has conditioned us to think.",The Blair Witch Project

I was also intrigued by the mix of video and film.  For the first 30 minutes of the film I thought everything was great...the set-up and the acting were both first rate, funny and well done.  But then everything deteriorated.  The acting became bad improv, the set-up ludicrous and the pacing excruciating.  While there was tension when the sun went down, it ultimately felt like the boy who cried wolf...where was the payoff?  One long tease with a particularly unsatisfying ending, the film was unfortunately never ""scary as hell"".  Perhaps if I'd seen the film before the hype I wouldn't be as hard on it, but I sincerely doubt I'd think it was very special.

The other two were also very believable.I have also read reviews that complain that the details of the legend weren't explained very well, and that there wasn't a satisfactory explanation at the end of the movie.

I truly believe that an intelligent audience will be able to feel the terror of the three (and in particular -- Heather & Mike).I found it totally creepy when they found the house.

The most scary part in the movie for me was that I almost dislocated my jaw from yawning.It's also pretentious - the movie I mean. They try (and fail) to make U believe that the movie is a real footage of a bunch of bozos that got lost in the forest. The also managed to convince some of the (scary part is that some refers to quite a lot) people that the whole idea is tremendously original - well it isn't. For one the unsteady amateur like camera: That was done  several times before (and with much better affect, for instance in 'Man Bites Dog'). And having amateur like unsteady camera is one thing, but the picture being so bad that its barely watchable hkhm... People getting lost in the wilderness and faced with extreme conditions: Much (MUCH) better done in 'Deliverance'. People getting on each others nerves: 'Who's afraid of Virginia Wolfe '. People going slowly insane: has anyone seen that play 'Caretaker' or 'Birthday Party' (by Harold Pinter) and finally people doing stupid things: what about 'Dumb and Dummer'.Well since acting on some parts is even better than the local amateur theatre group so I rate this movie 2/10.",The Blair Witch Project

So you can imagine why I liked this movie.  It is not just that, the Blair Witch Project takes a whole new perspective on horror films.  It is more realistic and lacks the fake blood and guts of todays horror movies.  This horror flick is related closer to The Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby then anything else.

That's why the movie is scary.  It's not because of what we see or don't see, but how the actors react to what is happening around them.  What's the most important part of acting?  Reacting!  And these three were perfect.  I kept thinking to myself...wow..that's exactly how I would react to that...or ""that's what I would have said.""  I could totally imagine myself with two friends in the same situation reacting the same way.Sure, the fact that they film to the very end is asking a bit much to believe.  But remember, it IS a movie  There has to be some suspension of disbelief..there is in EVERY movie.  But here's the question that all of you have to ask yourself...let's say you were these film students..you got lost..you lost one of your friends..you were frightened for your life. Most of you would stop filming...I probably would.  However, the filming to the end makes sense to me.  As they get closer to Josh's voice and the climatic scene in the house....what if they saw something, saved their friend...escaped the witch, or whatever it was..and got out alive?  Aside from being grateful that they're alive...they would be forever kicking themselves for not getting the one thing on tape that they set out to get. And so would you.  A serious artist is willing to put everything on the line to get that one important shot that would make everything that they went through worthwhile.  if they hadn't continued filming, and survived???? It would all have been in vain.This movie didn't really scare me until about an hour afterwards, when I had all that time to think about it.  Imagine yourself in that situation...you WOULD be scared to death.  If you deny that, then you are lying to yourself. This was a brilliant film and a much needed film for the genre that has been dominated by Scream spin-offs.  I thank the director and the actors for such a wonderful piece of work, and I can't wait to own my own copy.",The Blair Witch Project

The movie is not scary or thrilling whatsoever.  Which after you've decided that, only leaves the film with a guy with a bad hand for holding a mini-cam.  It was supposed to make you feel like you were there, well nice try but not even close, all it did was annoy me.  Plus it's all of 1 hour 20 mins long tops....not exactly a great buy for $10.  But even this short amount of time had me starring at my watch wondering when this movie would end or get better, which it never did. The movie finished the way it started, weak.  I can't say one good thing about this film.",The Blair Witch Project

Guess what? It never came.  Although the premise of the film is interesting...the film NEVER (at any point--except maybe the last two seconds of the film) lives up to its potential (you end up wondering why this movie even cost $60,000 to make).  One needs to have a lot of unmotivated imagination (or be down right gullible) to find any part of this movie scary.  The film is mostly comprised of the three characters arguing and fighting (the girl is especially annoying), them running around at night screaming (as if that's supposed to scare the viewers), sticks hanging on the trees and gathered stones, and of course the grand finale which leaves the viewers numb with utter disappointment.  Again, the premise of the movie has (or had) a lot of potential but it nowhere near lives up to its hype...It is one of the most (if not the) boring movies I've ever seen and a total waste of time and money...Our group was so bored after watching the ""Project"" that we ended up watching a video of the Matrix afterwards...A generous 1 (out of 10) for the Blair Witch Project",The Blair Witch Project

1886,Herby_N,i was had...,1,16 January 2000,"in my opininon this student video might be the biggest scam and most incomprehensible media phenomenon in recent memory.  this disjointed, repetitive shaggy dog story of a movie had me begging for the thing to end: not from fear, but boredom.  three very annoying young adults lost in the woods.  whining, complaining and sniping at each other for 90 minutes... were we supposed to be pulling for the 'witch' to put the audience out of their misery???  have i become so out of step with the american zeitgeist that i'm the only one that doesn't 'get it'?  well, even if i am if feel compelled to climb onto my rooftop and scream to anyone that might hear me: ""THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES!!!""",The Blair Witch Project
1887,ekotan,A triumph of hype and marketing,1,30 October 1999,"This was truly the worst film I've seen in a long, long time; and definitely the worst film I've ever seen in a cinema. ""Spawn"" had better acting. ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" had better special effects. ""Police Academy V"" had more coherent direction. And ""10,000 Years BC"" had a better script. Perhaps I can excuse the lack of anything like a script, direction, acting, etc. that might qualify it as ""a movie"". After all, it was shot by amateurs who never dreamed it would get widespread cinema release, never mind this high a profile. What I can't excuse is the complete lack of entertainment value. Any good movie must have a good story to tell, with characters the audience cares about. ""Blair Witch"" has neither. There is no plot to spoil, and the three characters are equally whiny and annoying. There are also huge gaping holes in the plot, but I won't mention these now as they've been discussed to death in Usenet.I wanted to walk out several times, but I just had to watch it til the end to see what all the fuss was about, and in case some miracle happens at the end to make it worthwhile. It didn't. It was pathetically naff. It was so bad I've seen better home movies about family holidays in Crete. I guess this film is the biggest testament to the power of media hype and guerilla marketing, and I respect that. But boy, did it stink. At the end of it all, some people in the theatre were furious. Some even demanded their money back from the box office, something unheard of in my experience!Critics are raving about how this was made on only $50,000. My point of view is, what a waste of $50K. And I wonder what it was spent on? I agree with Chris Rock's verdict: I swear there's gotta be someone out there walking around with $49,500 dollars in his pocket. It was boring, pointless, irritating and a waste of time.Despite this, if you are in any doubt about whether to go see this movie, I recommend that you DO. There is no other way to truly ascertain how awful this film really is, because you've read all the good reviews, and you've been exposed to the hype, therefore you wouldn't believe me now when I'm saying this film is terrible, in however many ways I put it. *I* wouldn't have believed me, if I hadn't seen it for myself. Given that I've just recommended it to you, despite my hating it, it should go to show just how it got its profits.Some UK critics are hailing it as the scariest movie of all time. Comparisons to horror classics like ""The Exorcist"", ""Alien"", and ""Jaws"" are already being made. Please let them be kidding, I've seen scarier hamburgers. And they were far more entertaining to watch.",The Blair Witch Project
1888,smack50,"Good idea, bad movie.",3,28 March 2000,"Rarely have I ever wasted 90 minutes as badly as when I watched The Blair Witch Project.  This film is constantly alternating between day and night. There's day, which is of course not at all scary, even when the characters find various artifacts presumably left by the Blair Witch.  The day is mostly used to advance the unusually weak plot.  Then there's night, which is remotely scarier than the day, in that it's dark and the hikers hear strange noises around them.  During the night scenes, as soon as I felt remotely frightened at what might happen, the scene would abruptly switch to day.It is actually just as frightening to hear what this movie is about as it is to watch it, as the film doesn't offer anything beyond its own premise.  If you are scared of darkness, moaning sounds, and college kids, this movie is for you.  Otherwise, you'll be disappointed.",The Blair Witch Project

The reason for this was somebody had been sick on the steps (this sounded even scarier now!).Yet when we finally got in I spent the best part of the movie trying to keep my eyes open, I found it no wonder that somebody had thrown up as it felt like I was on a roller coaster.  Anybody with a video camera could have filmed this, it seemed to have been shot in a plot of wood no bigger than 600 yards either way, and the worst part was the night when it was just a blank screen with what sounded like somebody rattling a bag of crisps, all I can say is I was more than happy to get out of the cinema after this rubbish",The Blair Witch Project

I think the biggest reason I disliked it was because of my expectations going in after I heard one reviewer state ""Best Horror movie since the Exorcist."" I like many others rushed to see it the first weekend.I was left at the end saying, ""That's it."" The second reason is I did not allow myself to get into the story. Some people have told me who are campers that they identified with what was going on and actually scared themselves even more. I don't have that frame of reference.I just didn't buy into it, the premise of the plot was original but it just failed to hook me in due to the poor lighting and bad sound. I couldn't hear or see half of the ""scary things"" the directors wanted me to see.It anything it had some comedic lines in it. But overall it was a big flop.",The Blair Witch Project

One walks into the theater expecting an refreshing, original, independent film. What is dished out, however, is a cross between a slasher movie and bad ghost stories from camp in the 7th grade. I must admit that the format was an interesting idea, and was almost executed well. The movie gets off to a good start with the interviews with the local population. However, once the students go into the woods the film quickly degrades into a an episode of Friday the 13th. Also, the movie confuses the audience as well as itself by focusing the interviews and the background information largely on the legend of the witch who lives in the forest, but than actualy plays-out another, half-mentioned legend concerning a hermit in those same woods. Over all ""The Blair Witch Project"" was an idea that could have produced some fruit but instead died on the vine.

1903,lutz.kessler,"A lot of attitude, but no movie.",4,29 September 2000,"Long after the hype I watched this film. There was only one thing in this film to make it look like a documentary: the ever unsteady, shaky or wobbly camera (but not in those moments it should have been unsteady - there it was perfectly balanced).And here the whole thing fails: Since you know it's just a movie and no documentary the unsteady camera is only a style - one style only is not enough to create a good movie.And now the whole card house falls: Everything is sheer attitude.Even if the actors were only improvising their lines - they knew what they were doing.The characters were more stupid than Hans and Gretel (Jack and Jill in English, I believe), they never left a trail of bread crumbs.When they were lost they went south one day, east the other day - they never followed that brook. They always lit their spotlights when they needed night vision of their own eyes. They always shouted when they should have been listening.They never had any problems with batteries or accumulators - Heather kept filming and filming over days - it was cold and damp - I never had that luck with my video camera.And for the ending: I didn't expect a monster - the whole film said it'll be like that. Simple - no surprise.If you want a REALLY scary movie watch ""Spoorloos"" by George Sluizer (but avoid the Hollywood remake, it's rubbish).",The Blair Witch Project

I didn't find it the least bit scary, namely because everything looked fake and the acting was remarkably bad. It was obvious from the start that the film wasn't ""real"" because most people would have genuine believable fear and sadness when faced with death.People say that the fear generated came from not seeing what the horrific things were. This just made it vague: the characters are frightened by disembodied voices and scary images that you can't hear and never see--it's confusing, not terrifying. I was bored to death and kept looking at my watch. That ain't good, cause it's less than an hour and a half.

The TV ""teasers"" and the website - not to mention the various ancillary products (especially, ""The Blair Witch Project: A Dossier) associated with the movie were uniformly first rate and whetted my appetite for the movie.Upon first viewing the movie, I was feeling rather foolish - I (and, apparently, millions of other had been ""had). What I saw was a short movie with a great premise and a few really good suspenseful/scary scenes that had been stretched out to feature length by seemingly endless footage of the hapless principals wandering about lost in the woods and - even worse - continually whining about it. I was not a happy camper.Later, a few other members of my family saw the movie and they literally ranted and raved about how creepy it was and how a woman they saw at a local carnival was the spitting image of Mary Brown. This incident triggered a large number of conversations among their friends and family. The capper came when my wife watched it on Cable and it gave her the major ""willies"".I began to think that maybe I had been too harsh in my judgment and that this movie deserved another viewing.Well, I have watched this movie about a half dozen times and I have good news and bad news. The good news is that it can be spooky fun for a while. The bad news is that the total quality time in this movie amounts to only about 1/3 of the running length.I am still impressed with the concept and with the genuinely creepy look of some of the scenes but the best score I can muster is 5 points out of 10.I would really like the originators of this movie (or someone else who sees the potential for a really GOOD horror movie here) to re-imagine the project and , perhaps, include more of the back story (Rustin Parr and the Blair Witch herself).

Also, they would know that if you find a river, follow it and you will eventually be led back to civilization(plus you'd have water if you're stuck for more than a day or two).Now I know there is supposed to be a degree of suspension of disbelief in movies, but when the movie is presented like a documentary that degree is decreased dramatically.In conclusion, the stupidity of the characters and the lack of any real ""jump moments"" until the last ten minutes is what ruined this movie for me.",The Blair Witch Project

When i recently started doing a film course I told myself to go watch the movie. And oh my im totally obsessed with it. This movie really shows you don't need the best equipment or a record amount of money to make a great movie. The idea behind this film is the whole power it needed. This movie plays with fully black screens and still manages to keep the viewer's interest. I can barely explain how amazing I think this film is.

Of course the movie scared her and I thought it was pretty chilling stuff as well (even though I knew it was fake). The drive back to the apartment and the sleep that night was scary, especially for her, as well.I have read where many people are flaming this movie but I think you have to understand the publicity around it to know why it has the impact it does on people. It was all over the place and one of the first viral marketing campaigns using the 'net for a movie - and it worked. Thinking that it was based on real events certainly helped many watchers get even more scared than they would normally have been.The actors did a great job improvising and the crew did a great job at using techniques to get realistic reactions from them. Sure, watching it again nine years later the film loses something without the palpable fright of a movie audience, but it's still a good film.And to answer the riddle some people who think they are smarter then the rest of us like to pose - there is no ""floating"" camera at the end. Mike had the camera with the DAT, or digital audio, and that's why Heather sounds so far away while screaming in the house.

The only real positive thing I can say about BWP is that its one of the most original movies for years, but that doesnt help it making the worse movie i have seen this year. You could all point perfect acting, scary effect, theme, recording etc. IMHO it was just really boring, and i didnt feel the least scared at all.

I couldn't wait for it to become dark so they could get eaten or whatever. But nooooo they had to keep waking up.Maybe those little wooden things were offerings or little gifts like a cat brings home! Maybe the witch just wanted to play with the video cameras.You have to admire the tension created which forced you to watch til the end. But I admit I only watched to see the thing at the end. No such luck.The freakiest thing they could do was have the dude stand in the corner like a naughty boy. Not bad, but not really freaky. Its not like turning a corner on your big wheel and seeing a couple twins standing in the hall.I couldn't give it a 5 because it did force me to watch to the end, and that's something. When I think of the ""day shots"" I wanna give it a 2. The stick figures really weren't very scary.I would think apathy would set in at some point when the thing continually torments you every night when it could just make you go thump. And if the witch wants folks blood, why wasn't there some yummie slurpy sounds when she made one go thump? Anyhow, good job shooting a feature film in 2 days out in the woods.

If the light from the camera isn't on something, you can't see it. We never actually see the witch, but we feel a presence. Somebody had to mess with the tent right? Somebody had to put together the sticks! Was it the Witch? Was it a couple of locals messing with the film students? I don't know!

As it turns out, my friends loved the movie, and continued to think that it was real until the sequel came out.I thought the movie was just plain bad...  The concept was good, but the movie was bad.  I loved the unique way that the producers used the camera, but that's about it.  There is nothing to see in this movie.  The producers obviously tried to scare people with suspense, but the suspense was just bad...  Good suspense will get a ""WTF is that?"" reaction out of me.  Or perhaps a ""Oh S**t, this is gonna be bad"" reaction.  But this movie didn't get that kind of reaction out of me.  Throughout the whole movie all I saw were people being scared.  ""Ok, they look pretty scared."" ""Yup, still scared"" ""Ok, I wonder why they are scared"" ""Hummm, I guess they are really scared"" ""Ok, now they're freeking out...""

1930,mateimiu,1 hour + of footage to set up one scary scene,1,28 August 2021,"That is what this movie, in short, really is about. Everything else that happens is either slightly unsettling or just plain boring.The acting, however, is on point. The firendly banter in the beginning, the arguments that got more heated over time, and the exasperation at their seemingly never ending aimless wanderings throught the forest are very believable.However, it adds nothing to the movie. And I mean nothing. What 'horror' is there in seeing a bunch of people getting lost in the woods? A lot, I guess, since the producing team decided to make 60% of the movie about this, and only 30% of actual confrontations with the blair witch, the other 10% spent on the conversations they had with the locals. Not to say that the plot alternates between confronting the blair witch and then wandering through the forest in a very repretitive fashion.Speaking of the blair witch, is it by far the least scariest monster I have ever seen. One of the main selling points of this movie is that the fact that the blair witch is never seen is what makes this movie scary. Well, let me tell you, those rock piles and wooden stickfigures surely put the fear of god into me. I fully understand why those guys were scared pantless of this monster. Who could face down such a monstrosity with sublime art and craft skills?As I said in the title, this movie's only saving grace was the last scene. Honestly, the tie in with the old man's story about how the 'killer' made some children face the wall before he killed the other child and the last scene was pretty smart.All in all, not worth your time.

Apart from that, nothing works in the film, except for the actors who generally did a good job./*possible spoilers*/ While I can just about accept American teenagers of whom noone has a mobile phone, given that the movie does play early in the nineties, I certainly cannot accept people on an expedition throwing away their maps (that really was very very cheap as a twist). Furthermore, what do you do when you're lost in the woods and come across a river? Correct - you follow the river downstream. It's an easy way out if you've lost all other means of orientation. There is some basic stuff people going on expeditions like the one in BWP simply know and the plot should respect that. /*end possible spoilers*/In the end, I found the film boring. The scary effects aren't really scary, the characters totally unconvincing in their actions (though the actors did their job well as I said).

It seemed so real because of that. I enjoyed it very much, but i think people have to look at it as a film acheivment rather than an actual motion picture. People I know either laugh or shudder when I told them I was going to watch this movie, so I really didn't know what to expect. I had heard that it seemed so real from a few people that I really wanted to watch it.

1940,The_Imaginary_Friend,Effective,10,24 February 2009,"Over the years, the horror genre has evolved into brainless, unimaginative movies revolving around the socially active lives of good-looking teenagers who drink, have sex and party all the time. Usually they consist of a female protagonist with a nice body who coincidentally loves to shower and walk around in nothing but their undergarments. The Blair Witch Project, however, is a breath of fresh air. The heroin, Heather, is a self-righteous smart ass who organizes to make a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. She and two guys, Josh and Mark, go hiking in the woods, and as expected, terrible things occur. The first while of the movie is easy-going and relaxing, watching them just being teenagers. Though once the terror really starts, it holds onto the audiences and introduced a sense of unease and desperation. Throughout the film, I felt like I was there with them. This has much to do with the effective documentary-style directing. Though not much is clear in view with the bouncy camera action, it leaves a great amount of mystery, and therefore more frightening to watch. The events and the character interaction is the real tension in the plot, not the blood and guts like a lot of horror movies. The emotion is very real, and through their distress you come to care about the characters and feel exactly what they're going through. And of course, it's freaking scary. When I get scared, I starting shedding tears. The night I watched this, tears were constantly running down my face. In all, I believe this is one of the better horror movies in the last decade.",The Blair Witch Project

I have been tramping in New Zealand and been lost/taken the wrong way, and in a couple of other risky situations, and this film gets the antagonism you feel when, in your view, it is the other person's fault. It also gets the feel of going out with a bunch of people who may not be your closest friends, and who have their quirks, but you are with them for the journey and have to get along, sometimes under a little pressure. It also gets the way people without realising it overrate their ability and take the wrong option, yet because of the way groups work you can wind up on a path you wouldn't choose. In my country we don't have any scary animals and I don't feel scared of what might be out there, but people die every year in the bush from exposure/injury/drowning in rivers etc, this film makes that realistic fear and turns it into a supernatural one. I thought the acting was great, I was wrapped up in it, and because some of the things the characters were going through rang a bell for me it hooked me in and sold me once their fear started kicking in. I liked the whole idea of it too.",The Blair Witch Project

Watching it again the other night, I realized how much of an innovative movie this is.  I've heard many people complain about it being ""not scary"" and a lack of any real ""cinematic art.""  When it comes to a horror movie, cinematic art comes last.  If I want to be scared, I want to be scared.  I don't wanna' watch some paper thin teen horror story where every scare is cheap.  Making someone jump is not scary.  Anything can do that.  Someone drops a book on a table in a quiet library, and there'd be a good chance that you might jump.  Is that book scary?  No.  Is the library scary?  No.  Is the librarian scary?  Maybe, but that's not the point.  My point is that it's hard to make a genuinely frightening film, and this is one of the few.

1945,guilandros,"Ghastly, amateurish and humorous",1,1 April 2002,"Evidently the Blair Witch, (if there is one), has quite an appreciation of film. This may account for the fact that she/he obviously didn't want this lousy piece of trash, as it was mostly what remained of the cast when the film was discovered. Why she wanted to claim the unimaginative, expletive charged, venomous kids who made this film, though, shall forever be a mystery.With all the antagonism between the members of this film's cast/ victims, a reasonable guess as to what happened to them, is that they murdered each other! At least, the publicity spiel is generous enough to tell us that this drivel was filmed by film ""students"" and not professionals, and we can blame the film editors for feeling that this cinema verite, has enough interest to inflict upon a naive public (which they obviously believed their audience to be).As an Australian who has been lost in a bush environment myself (and a city Aussie at that), I could not fail to be amused at the amateurishness of this team who would have trouble finding their way out of a supermarket, let alone a supposedly beast harbouring forest.I suppose with many things in life, you get what you pay for and considering the malicious natures of the four victims in the film, they may have gotten what they deserved.",The Blair Witch Project
1946,lozza333,justifies all the attention it received upon it's release,7,1 November 2007,"This was one of the scarier horror films I've seen and for that alone I can call it a great film. Having seen it many years after it was made, I missed all the hype surrounding The Blair Witch Project upon it's initial release. I had heard many different opinions from different people; it seemed like a 50/50 divide between who liked it and who didn't. That probably levelled my expectations as I simply didn't know what to expect. But I really enjoyed it and some parts of the film were the 'heart-pounding-hard-in-your-chest' moments you expect from all horror films, except that they were amplified by a heightened sense of reality with the documentary-style filming. This is ultimately what the film relies on for it's horror of course; it draws you very close to the hearts and minds of the characters involved and you genuinely feel scared for them. So many horror films simply have characters 'made for dying', that you don't really care about and are just included to eventually become victims.I am a fan of the low-budget, low-gore style it employs, simply because it still scares you regardless. There are some flaws in the editing style needed to be employed to make it realistic (ie. times when it is unrealistic for them to have their camera switched on, but would be very scary to watch for the audience) and I did feel the film came to a quite abrupt end. But it is also very necessary to applaud the actors, who are part of the reason the film is so believable. Overall, you can't fault the way in which this film helped reinvigorate the horror genre. With the number of mindless slasher films reaching stupid levels in the mid-90s - Friday 13th Part 9 was released in 1993 and A Nightmare On Elm Street 7 in 1994... - I can still feel today, even watching it 8 years later, how important this film was.",The Blair Witch Project

The Blair Witch Project is only scary on that level. Otherwise, it's a jumpy, obnoxious experiment into the gullible nature of todays society. I personally found it annoying, but then again, I never thought it was real. The only scary thing about the film is the amount of uninformed idiots there are walking around who will believe anything they hear.

They enjoyed it, a bit, but it's difficult to explain to them just what an impact this ""home video"" blockbuster made on the pre-YouTube film-making world when it first came out. And I can't say for sure how much of my attraction to it has to do with nostalgia (I saw it while on a date, in an indie theater so long time ago). The instability of the camera work still makes my wife sick, after all of these years. Aside from the novelty of its lo-fi, homemade film style (in 1999, anyways), the acting was fairly strong. Had it not been, I suspect that this film would never have made it out the gate. The storyline is decent, the assemblage of different characters is fun, and there's a reasonable balance of action and introspection. What's missing? According to my son, the witch herself. In our current age of ""top 5 carcrash"" styled YouTube lists and 720p jumpscares, the lack of a visible boogeyman proved too anticlimactic for his taste.

I enjoyed Hannibal rising, but the fictitiousness of it didn't make it frightening for me.out of these 3 movies i was scared ONLY by the low budget, mock documentary about 3 college students looking for a witch. go figure.the Blair witch project was unlike anything i have ever seen. the method by which it was shot created a feeling that these characters are just like any other college kid...you feel as if they could be people that you yourself know.the dialogue was exceptionally genuine. even though i knew that the movie was not actually real life footage...i questioned that idea right up to the end. the fact that the story seems so authentic is what makes it scary. you do not just watch this movie...you're a part of it. it feels like it very well could be you looking through the video camera lens.the terror that the kids feel from a combination of being lost, food running out, and a witch hunting them translates to the audience like you cant really imagine. sure, in some horror movies you're scared for the main character, but with this film you're almost scared for yourself, that you're in danger.although this movie is not made of real life footage, i believe that no movie will ever be created that comes so close to reality as the Blair witch project does. if there was ever a movie that made people ""feel like they were in it,"" it is this movie.",The Blair Witch Project

When this came out no one knew it was fake, everyone thought it was real so I saw it and felt completely horrified being so close to my forest that looked like this. Now that people know it's fake they look for every mistake possible and try to prove this brilliant movie wrong in someway.

The scene at the end is the only bit that's even vaguely scary (and I scare easily, Coraline was pretty scary for me).I think it would have been a whole lot more tense if I had more sympathy for the characters, but I just found them annoying, though this is more the result of a bad script than the actors fault, they did a pretty good job with what they were given. I think the real issue for me was that I just couldn't get into the story, I mean how can you get THAT lost when you have a map and compass. They walked for 15 hours and ended up where they started, how is that possible when you have a compass? They even decided to walk in a set direction, SOUTH, surely to end up in the same place there would have had to have been a point where they were looking at the compass and it was pointing NORTH usually a good indication your walking THE WRONG WAY.I have two flat mates in their first semester of a media and broadcasting degree and in all honesty I've seen them produce more plausible, better edited material than this.

It was like watching a really really boring, poorly made public access TV documentary.  Ooohhh, and the script!!  Any third grader could have written it: 'What the &%$#&!! was that??!!'  repeated over and over for 2 hours, without even changing inflection ... how creative.(MINOR SPOILERS - but who cares, if you haven't seen it, don't, it's complete crap ... and if you have, you already know, so...)The were 2 parts of this movie that I found *somewhat* worthwhile:  What I like to call the 'Bundle o' Josh' was good for about 30 seconds of spine tingling, and the last 2 minutes were definitely a worthwhile scare ... but this does not come close to making up for the complete disappointment of the first hour and a half plus.I paid a dollar to see this at a discount theatre.

I believe it should be rated much higher than it is. The acting is great and truly believable. It's not one of those movies where you wonder how in the hell they still have a camera going. They fight about the camera being on and everything they say and do doesn't seem like acting. I love the beginning when they are interviewing people around town and getting their opinion and stories about the Blair Witch. As the days in the woods go on you can really feel their fear. In my opinion it's always best to not actually see what is so frightening. Therefore you are not disappointed. The detailed information you are given about the witch is enough to satisfy your imagination.

The Blair Witch Project is a boring, foul-mouthed horror movie that has some good ideas, but fails to do anything with them that shocks. This movie started a recently re-ignited fad of found footage movies or ""mockumentaries"". Some of which are good, such as the first Paranormal Activity and Chronicle, but most of them are boring and lazy. That's exactly what this is. Boring and lazy, and the mystery that could have made this movie thrive wasn't used very well until the final sequence. The rest was just ""Oooooh it's an inukshuk thingy, that's scary.... Right?!"" I've seen many horror movies, and this is the least scary. Of course, if you convince your self it's real, this movie could provide some atmospheric horror that it was going for, but as I said earlier, failed to deliver if you know it's total bullshit.

Talking to people, walking trough the woods, great backstory!But it's the way they portrayed these teenagers. Our protagonist is a girl who does nothing else than showing off how great she is, being a real bitch to her friends and not helping anyone at all. The two other characters are just her friends. A bit stereotypical. We got a tech guy who handles the camera and another guy who has no real use whatsoever but complain about the situation.In fact, i hated the acting so much i actually wanted them to die! Just to get rid of their awful childish discussions about a map. A MAP! These kids are being followed by a creature out of mythical lore and the best thing they find to worry about is the goddamn map and the fact they ran out of cigarettes!I don't care nothing really happens.

Something about uppity females swearing is very unattractive. However, this effort goes to the heart of human fear, that which they cannot see, that which they do not understand and that which they cannot explain in simple and logical ways. Much like the power of religion, fear is baseless yet all pervasive, the very things modern people scorn as hocus pocus or fantasy (god, ghosts, evil spirits) are the same things that will give a well adjusted person the fear this film evokes, it is elemental, the caveman type of fear of the dark, strange noises and""things that go bump in the night"". This is why it works, I watched with a background in emergency medicine, funeral direction and other forensic science experience but it still made me jumpy.

The plot is pretty basic and they didn't really seem to bother with suspense at all. I can understand that it is good for the budget and number of people involved in the project but I simply don't think its worth buying or renting because its not that good a film. As I said in the summary, Midsommer murders, a British TV crime production, is more scary which isn't saying all that much as it is more scary than a lot of horror. Still maybe I'm being a bit harsh.

It wasn't a great movie and I don't see what the big deal is about it.Credit where credit is due:  The movie was made with a tiny budget and no-name talent.  With that in mind, they turned out something that was watchable.  However...The movie was not scary - I had it figured out in about 15 minutes.  The movie contained barely 30 minutes of interesting/original material - let's face it ""scared folks running around in the dark being chased by some unseen demon"" was done in Alien 20 years ago.  Trade the trees for a space ship and you'd be hard pressed to tell the two apart - except that when Alien came out it was new and interesting.The ""handycam's eye"" view gets physically nauseating pretty quickly (ok, perhaps I'm more susceptible than others).  It gives the movie it's ""unprofessional"" feel, but quickly starts to detract from what little story there is.The hype engine that inundated us for weeks in the lead up to this movie is partly to blame for my opinion.  Frankly, the hype was better than most of the movie, and if there had been less hype, perhaps the few merits of this movie would have shone through better than they did.Sadly, there'll probably be a sequel.",The Blair Witch Project
1987,RedWolf-8,"A thriller for some, a thinker for others.",8,1 August 1999,"I went to see this film with two other people. Going into it, I expected to be frightened beyond belief, which in hindsight, might have affected my opinion of the film. The general opinion of the film critics and other people who saw the film seemed to be that it was unbelievably thrilling , and gripping, and worthy of comparison too horror classics like The Exorcist. After seeing The Blair Witch Project, I can say that I do not agree with these people. I am not making any attempt to trash this movie as I was generally impressed by it in several ways. First of all, the first person perspective from which the viewer sees the film is very creative and adds a lot to the thrilling aspect of the film by making the viewer feel like they are actually there. Also, the way the characters are portrayed adds to the realistic feel of it. It feels less like acting and more like the natural behavior of three people in a difficult situation. For me, what was on the less appealing side was the lack of closure in many parts of the film. (You will be able to understand this statement after viewing the film.) While this feature also adds to the unique feel of the film by making us realize our own fear of the unknown, it also gives people the option to fill in blanks on their own. The problem with this is that you never know what is really happened. This nagging feeling of uncertainty was enough to turn some people off. I talked to several people after seeing the film, and the general feeling was that it left too much to think about for the viewers. These days, people go to movies to be told a story, whether it be funny, scary, dramatic or whatever, they want the story to be told to them, they don't want to have to create pieces of it themselves. Although it is intellectually stimulating, it is not expected from movies. For this reason, I would say that The Blair Witch Project is more of a psychological thriller than a straight horror movie. If you like thinking about what could have, or what really happened, then this is probably your type of movie, otherwise you might be a little disappointed unless you are very easily scared.",The Blair Witch Project

As a movie, it is poorly done in many aspects.  It is very boring at times and poorly paced.  The characters are never developed, so you really don't care what happens to them.

I haven't seen such dynamic and profound changes in characters since I saw Deliverance for the first time this summer (yes, I know the connection there, and I'm not entirely sure it's just a coincidence), while the final 10 minutes is some of the best horror cineamatography (sp?) I've ever seen. It's more frightening than the entire remake of The Haunting.Sure, as some have complained the actors aren't the greatest ever, but this is their first movie and, lest we forget, they're not exactly ""acting"" either. Most of what you see in the movie are their real reactions to what's going on around them, reactions that most people would come close to if put in the same situation.Another ""problem"" that people have tried to blow out of proportion is the quality of the filming, again without taking into consideration what was actually going on. The actors only had an 8mm and a 16mm camera to film with, and even if they were film students, they were ""students, and not accomplished filmmakers, so the level of lighting, sound and filming wouldn't be the greatest.All in all, I would say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, in all facets of filmmaking. While parts of it could conceivably be better, the movie as a whole is as close to perfectly done as you can get.",The Blair Witch Project
1993,Jimbo-17,The only terrifying part was the price of admission.,1,30 July 1999,"I was not only disappointed by the movie but actually disgusted that I could get suckered in by the hype. That's all this movie is. I was expecting to go into the movie and be terrified. I wanted too. I knew it had a slow start so I waited for it to get scary. It never happened. It was not scary. Believe me, I scare fairly easily in films and fully expected to walk out of there with my heart pounding. I walked out instead upset and even mad. I felt like telling everyone else in line to forget it. The only genius part of this movie is the marketing. That, I will give full credit for. I was taken and so were the 9 other people who accompanied me to the movie because of how much I hyped it. I apologize to them and hope no one else will get duped the same way I did. Stay away from the Blair Witch Project unless you want to pay 9 bucks for a film that could almost easily be aired on the discovery network or public television. DON'T GO SEE THIS ONE!!!!",The Blair Witch Project
1994,Doc Q.,I didn't like it.,1,22 August 1999,"This movie was horrible.  It was more funny than scary, but it wasn't even remotely funny.  I'm sorry, but to be lost in the woods with a compass is rather inept.  I think all three of the main characters had to be seriously unintelligent to get and remain lost.  It was innovative, just not positively so.  I mean, if this is how horror movies will be in the next millenium, I'll check out the romantic comedies.  I give it very few points, mostly for the slight innovation and the concept.  Overall, it wasn't scary, nor was it an entertaining film.",The Blair Witch Project
1995,bjornc,I'm not so scared...,8,17 July 1999,"... but I had a lot of fun.I am not a big fan of horror movies, and I generally prefer films that have high production values, however, I must admit that I was impressed both with the set-up and the execution of this film.Although the beginning of the film (before their first night) was a really good set-up to the terror part of the movie, I did have trouble believing the characters. I had a few good laughs, and when the creepy stuff started to happen, it was an about-face to what had previously been presented. I was excited when the creepy stuff started to happen, but wasn't scared.About half way through, the annoying over-acting of Heather really began to get to me (along with the heat in the theater) and I began to lose interest in what was going to happen the next time they heard noises outside.BUT it was worth it to see the final scene, which scared the crap out of me and still leaves me with goose-bumps. Although I don't think this film is the scariest movie ever made, I'm certain that its the scariest film ever made with a micro-budget and no professionals. And the last scene will stick with you forever.",The Blair Witch Project

I understand the concept of the movie, but it did nothing for me. It was not very believable. Are you going to tell me someone who goes hiking every weekend is going to get lost that easily? I doubt it. Things that go bump in the night are scary, but not this movie. The only thing that I find scary about the movie, is that people were actually scared!!!   At least from what I read here.  The people to the right and left of me, looked as bored as I was. I also heard several comments,  about what a waste of time  it was. I have nothing positive to say about the movie at all.On a scale of 1 to 10 I'll give it a MINUS 5.",The Blair Witch Project

2000,astre,i'm still in shock,10,22 July 1999,"The Blair Witch project uses a kind of fear that I haven't had in a movie before.  Normally in horror films, the fear that I feel is one of shock when someone jumps out of nowhere or that of disgust when some is brutally killed.  But the Blair was not your typical horror film.  I wasn't sure I was scared until I realized that I was breathing fast and that my heart was beating fast also.  The tension just builds and builds and you feel it in you also.  The movie just grips you and that is all I can say.  Go watch it now.",The Blair Witch Project

No.,7,17 July 1999,"Although I commend Haxan films for delivering a very original horror film to the big screen, I can't say that it was ""The scariest movie I've ever seen,"" as some of the other movie critics out there have claimed. Before you say it's because I've been jaded by the likes of Jason, Freddy Krueger, et. al., let me tell you that I saw the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"" last weekend and it had me more scared than this, and like this movie, it was used very little in the way of ""special effects."" Anyway, my recommendation is to see this movie because it is an interesting concept and for a few good edge-of-your-seat moments, but don't expect to be frightened witless.",The Blair Witch Project
2002,Mikal-2,Worth The Wait!!,9,19 July 1999,"I first heard about this movie shortly after the Sundance film festival. It sounded intriguing and horribly frightening.  Boy, was it ever. I have never heard of such a movie before.  An entire film made up of ""lost"" footage shot by a camera crew making a documentary about a local legend.  The only draw back is that this movie was shot mostly in first person perspective and the camera was constantly in motion.  I was literally seasick by the end of the film.  It was a small price to pay to see such an original and emotional movie. It was obvious that there was very little scripting done for the actors.  The dialogue is so real that ""lines"" are dropped and words are occasionally slurred.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if this entire film was done on the first take.  This was a very short and effective route to a new level of realism. I did a great deal of research concerning this movie before it even hit theaters (I had been looking forward to seeing it since early this year) and was curious as to how the directors could possible end such a film. Although I won't spoil it for you I can tell you that the last 15 seconds of the Blair Witch Project will likely haunt you for many nights to come. This is a genuinely scary movie.  It accomplishes this without gore or cheap shocks.  The camera never actually shows the audience the danger the three characters are facing but it is a powerful presence that hides just off camera in every shot.",The Blair Witch Project

HAHAHA!!! what a joke! 80 minutes of sitting around waiting for something scary to happen and finally the big final scare, and boy was i disappointed. they came close to almost being close to scary twice. the tent and the house but thats it. if i wanted to see a movie about people mentally breaking down i would go and rent ""The Shining"" (which is a far better movie). So in conclusion if you read this don't let me discourage you. You may like. This is my opinion alone.

2004,Lene-2,"Good movie, but...",10,27 July 1999,"Not a masterpiece and not the best horror movie ever, but I still added it to my top ten list.  I really liked it, it was nice to get away from the teen slasher flicks we have been seeing more and more of lately.  This movie did scare me and it really played with my imagination.  Just like in the original Haunting, you don't see a single ghost or monster and isn't that what made The Haunting so scary?  That is what makes this movie scary, you let your imagination do the work when you hear what the young film makers are hearing.  I have to admit, people are walking into the movie expecting to see a masterpiece of horror and they walk out thinking that they wasted their time.  This movie is a ""either you liked it or hated it"" flick and you are going to hear both sides argue over this issue.  You just have to go and see it for yourself and make up your mind.",The Blair Witch Project

Let's call this movie for what it is.....Some people may be surprised when they go to see that nearly all of the movie was shot on videotape and never fills the who screen. Think the square projection you had for ""How Bugs Eat"" in third grade class.I know that they were after the affect of it being an amateur movie, and that isn't my problem. The thing is that most of the ad libbed dialogue just comes off too amateurish and contrived.... Coming out, I remembered the movies my brothers and I used to make on videotape. I'm planning on submitting our pictures ""Hopping Plague Invades North Hollywood"", ""Saddam Hussein on MTV"" and ""Bono and Edge Get Drunk"" for Academy consideration.

Yes, it was quirky... yes, it was original... but this is simply a student film, a good student film, but in no way is this a movie that I should have paid money to see.  I feel cheated by undue hype. I did not see this film in an art house and the patrons where I viewed the film were overwhelmingly disappointed.  Uninteresting photography, if that's what you can call it, dizzying in its shakiness, awkward in its jumping from video to 16mm, predictable, tiresome in its dialog.... Still, I liked the idea but sorry, there are lot's of good ideas that fail in their execution, this failed for me.  I have to wonder, how, after having seen thousands of films over the years, can my opinion be so diametrically opposed to the current general praise this film has generated?  Or is it simply a cry for something different from Hollywood.... but surely protest doesn't make this film more than a good student film?",The Blair Witch Project

While it is scary in the night scenes, the day scenes tend to drag on.  I was always anxious for it to get dark again - when all the scary things happened.

The best part about this film, is that it's the unknown, the unexplained, and the unseen which creates such fear. These days, too many films try to scare an audience by using graphic content. Real fear however, I think comes from what we can't see. And this is what makes ""The Blair Witch Project,"" such an incredible film.Phenomenal acting and an amateur home video approach, draws the viewer into the film so well, that fear can truly be experienced.

This was a nightmare, there are several scenes in Blair Witch that are comparable to the way a dream would carry out. It also carried with it a sense of infinite realism, just like the way everything in a nightmare would seem real in its context, the movie had me in that same zone. Everything was real and I was right there with the characters terrified at what was going to pop up around every tree they crossed in those woods.  Blair Witch had me weirded out, I came out of the theatre totally dis-orientated. Over the past week my friends and I have been tossing theories, clues, and interpretations around - every time I feel the hair stand up on my arms. For me it was how it seemed like a nightmare that captivates me, for others I've talked to its other aspects of the movie - all of which are exciting. Blair Witch Project is so out there because it is so in here, in our minds, it has captured a part of my mind untapped by any movie I've seen before it.

Even if it were true -- a reputable filmmaker would have completed the story.

What makes it scary is the ideas you get of what could really be out there.I do recommend seeing this film in a theater with a good sound setup though.

All of my hopes were destined to fall. And dammit, they didn't. Not one bit. This movie is terrifying.All of the actors are AMAZINGLY convincing. I guess that's becasue they're not acting, or at least not in the Hollywood sense, they're honestly being messed with in the middle of nowhere in the still of night, so the reactions are real. In fact, the only fault I could find is the absence of total wackaloon freakouts. (I probably would have hit myself in the head with a heavy tree limb repeatedly until I calmed down or passed out).One word of advice: If you are the type of person who equates ""scary"" with ""gore"", or are a HUGE fan of 'Scream' (you know, the nod-and-a-wink film that so many folks thought was sooo good) you will NOT like this film. No gore, no maniac with a knife, and no nudity. ""Dernit, ah guess they dinnit haf enuff munny to get that Heather chick to skimper down to 'er undies.

The unrehearsed, documentary feel and the nightmarish build to the terrifying conclusion is something that has stayed with me for a few days now. The final shot has to be one of the most disturbing on film. And all of this from a low-budget, mostly video production with almost no blood or violence and no annoying hipster rock soundtrack. I'll definitely think twice before ever camping again...A horror masterpiece.",The Blair Witch Project

The fear of being lost and being haunted by something or someone and you will never know what it is.  The actors are great and they do as anyone would do in the given situation (cry, swear, quarrel, etc.).A comment I have heard a lot, is that the ending ""sucks"".  Why, this is the only ending this movie can have.  If you don't understand the ending, have another look at the movie and especially pay attention when the townspeople are interviewed.I just wonder how else this movie CAN end.I rate this movie ***1/2 out of ****",The Blair Witch Project

The first part of the movie made me want to go asleep.Throughout the whole movie I think I jumped twice. The first time was because I was thinking about something else and the girl started screaming, the second time was at the end.Please do not pay any money to see this movie.

2039,Jenidiot,soooooo scary... NOT,3,17 July 1999,"I am so disappointed that I bought into all of the hype surrounding this movie. It was not scary at all and was at times extraordinarily boring. A pile of rocks on the ground and a creepy noise in the middle of the night do not a horror film make. Every time I started to become the tiniest bit anxious, NOTHING happened. The only time I got even remotely goose-bumpily was at the very end, but by then it was over. If only the filmmakers would have included more about the mythology of the witch legend in the movie (as they did on the chilling website), it may have been a bit more frightening, but as it is I was highly unimpressed. It is a shame that the creators of ""The Blair Witch Project"" came up with such an intriguing concept and style of film making and then allowed it to fall so flat.",The Blair Witch Project

2041,Kaimi,"Great movie! Very different from anything else this year, or maybe ever",10,24 July 1999,"Very unusual movie.  Scary but not in the same way as ""Scream"" and the like. Good acting by all, especially Heather Donahue who had some great parts including a sad, emotionally charged monologue-type part near the end (I will say no more so as not to spoil).  Michael C. Williams also was quite good and the actors had great chemistry as the the slowly disintegrating friendship / work relationship fell to pieces.Don't blink or you could miss something.  This movie is totally unforgiving to the casual moviegoer- there is quite a bit of foreshadowing but nothing helpful, and if you miss a part it is gone, never to return.  Go to the bathroom before the movie starts, order only a small soda so you will not need to go during the film.  Like real life, the film has parts where it seems to slow down.  Then suddenly, something crucial to the story appears, and then it's gone.Perhaps the most eerie part is the ""documentary"" framing device.  The film is totally loyal to this fiction, though at times this makes it seem a bit unrealistic (especially at the end, when cameras are still rolling in the direst of emergency situations, and perfectly focused).  Still the use of this framework gives the film an amazingly eerie quality.  It is like a Discovery Channel documentary, gone horrifyingly wrong.  No creepy music, no cheesy special effects, just the story and the actors, and that is quite enough.",The Blair Witch Project

I have now seen it over 20 times and it still gives me goosebumps.  This movie is a great example that you don't need millions of dollars to make a good movie.  Just a good idea and lots of talent.

It allows us to genuinely get to know, like, and, identify with, (on basic human levels, if nothing else), these characters. After a fun introduction, things start going bad, and, we care. The makers use some very basic fears to draw us into the growing terror. A simple film, and, a well made film. It scared the hell out me.

Through Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm St., Halloween, I have been able to sleep soundly after viewing such films.  After this ferociously horrifying movie, I could not sleep.  I would shut the lights off and try not to, but think of any scene in the movie and have to turn the lights on again.

Great idea, gripping trailers, absorbing web page, etc. Unfortunately the movie just doesn't deliver. It is completely transparent and as a result completely ineffective. It is not scary in the least and at times when its supposed to be is often utterly laughable. If I had heard this story around a campfire I would have been totally creeped out. However, outside of that setting its a lame duck. I went into the movie with very little prior knowledge which didn't seem to make the experience any more enjoyable. Should you see this movie?

2046,LG-2,It blows (Spoiler),2,25 October 1999,"I saw it the day it opened, to minimize the effect of heightned expectations.  So my expectations were minimal.  It blew.  From the very beginning there is no attempt to get the audience to empathize with the characters.  They could not have been more unlikeable.  They were afraid of a pile of rocks?  Not likely.  As soon as that happened, I lost any ability to relate to the character's sense of fear.  Everything else that happened was random and unclear.  You could never quite grasp what exactly they thought they were running from.  Whatever sounds they heard, I certainly didn't hear. And when a character does dissappear, there sense of fear doesn't seem to increase. Interesting because I think that would be pretty scary. It was random, and nonsensical. I'm sorry if you think I am warped by Hollywood's idea of a scary movie. But there is nothing inherently scary about bad camera work and bad dialouge. The scariest thing about this movie is the thought that similar movies are likely to be massed produced due to the unfathomable box office success of this piece. Skip it.",The Blair Witch Project
2047,dancemn9,I was disappointed,7,1 August 1999,"I seem to be mostly alone in this opinion, but this movie didn't frighten me much--it didn't make me feel much of anything.  I didn't particularly like or relate to any of the three students, and the more they wandered around in the woods, the more I shook my head and said, ""How dumb can you BE?""  I already knew that none of them would make it out alive (from the film tag line), so there was no suspense involved.  Only the last five minutes of the film gripped me.  Even then, the ending was hardly a surprise.On the positive side, it was a very creative idea, and I appreciated the absence of blood and violence.If it was not a particularly bad film, neither was it an exceptionally good one.  After all of the non-hype hype, I must say I was disappointed.",The Blair Witch Project
2048,pfred,Scariest movie I've seen.,10,16 July 1999,I was very pleased with the end.  It was a perfect climax to the constantly increasing creepiness of the film.  Couldn't have been better.  Except that the constant camera motion made me a bit queasy.,The Blair Witch Project
2049,davec-6,Couldn't Match The Hype,3,24 October 1999,I suppose that it was impossible that TBWP could live up to the hype that it has received. It was an interesting experiment in film-making but would have been better as an hour-long TV show.Even at just 90 minutes long it went on too long and became incredibly repetitive.Oh... and scary? You've got to be joking.,The Blair Witch Project
2050,big bird-2,Kill the girl....,4,9 August 1999,"Generally, the movie sucks.  Everyone says the concept is so cool and original.  Bulls**t.  It's *The Real World: Lost in the Woods*.  Imagine three of your least favorite, most self-involved Real World characters all fighting to be the one who rambles on the most.  ""I'm so scared""  ""No you're not, I am""  ""Oh, I so totally can't believe how selfish you two are.  I am the most of the scaredest.  Oh, by the way, watch how I smoke while pretending not to notice that I'm smoking.  People who are nonchalant like that are cool.  Especially while smoking.""The character of Heather wins the annoying contest, hands down.  She's the kind of person who has to convince herself that she has no friends because people ""don't understand me"".  If that's the way the character was intended, huge applause to the young actress who annoyed the s**t out of me.Aside from the 9.67 reading on the annoying scale, the movie is less than scary until the end, which, admittedly, was nothing short of creepy.

I read every article I could get my hands on.  I logged hours on www.blairwitch.com reading the (albeit falsified) history of the Blair Witch.  Now that the movie has come, I must say that it is even more frightening that I had expected.  The 80-something minute film is incredibly convincing, realistically acted, and truly terrifying (and even hilarious at parts).  It relies not on gore or escaped serial killers, but rather simple symbols like piles of rocks or a stick man hanging from a tree.  Everything in this movie works, from the characters to the jerky, low-end cameras (which immerse you even more, being a first-person point of view).  It sucks you in and doesn't release you until the last frame goes to black.Trust me, you will sleep with the lights on.",The Blair Witch Project
2055,Kukkanen,Utterly unfrightening amateur crap...,1,1 November 1999,"This movie should be retitled in the name of Psychology.

Doubtlessly that title would be a burden for cinema-listings, but seriously! This movie seemed over-long, yet it couldn't have been more than a little over an hour long. I couldn't help yawning. Maybe I'm not impressionable enough, maybe I've seen too many cheap-thrill type shockers to get the subtlies... maybe the home-films shot by my parents of my siblings and I frolicking in our garden are more inspired. Lets face it, this 'film' just defies any logical explanation of a plot, a purpose or a reason. Furthermore, it has been way overhyped. The short trailer featuring a snippet of the Heather character's desperate soliloquy to the camera was actually scarier out of context on the t.v. screen. But that's the price you pay for creating false impressions--some are driven home in individuals willing and possessing the trait of being conned by hype; others just end up having their illusions shattered. Just between you and me, I knew deep down I wouldn't be scared, cause that's just not my personality, but I needed to verify it. Perhaps that's the other attraction of such movies... they make us doubt our senses and our convictions. But only temporarily. The moral of this story is that the real scares we have to experience ourselves. I don't believe such badly filmed footage can recreate in the audience any feelings of the terror felt by the actors.",The Blair Witch Project

So how come half of the footage is out of focus or pointing in a meaningless direction or just plain cockeyed?  My ten year old son shoots better video.And whatever happened to plotting a story.  Try to find the mid-point in this story.  You can't.  I doubt the director even knew when they'd reached the mid-point, let alone the end of act two.Character development?  Character arc?

2060,davhsu,Over-rated home video,4,22 July 1999,"Billed by many critics as one of the scariest movies, The Blair Witch Project falls well short of expectations. Certain aspects of the film, especially the ending, had an eerieness to it. But the bulk of the film is simply not scary, unless you are really affected by stones, twigs, and other things that can happen to you while hiking and camping.The film is also plagued by the three main characters whining and arguing about directions during the daytime. If they had been more likeable characters, I probably would have cared more about what happened to them. The movie also falls into the stereotypical horror movie traps -- going into an abandoned house in the middle of the night to investigate strange sounds and splitting up.Yes, I know the story about how the movie was filmed, and it's great that they can do so much acting impromptu, but the end product does not work very well.

2061,coolidge,"A good concept lacking in the execution, few scares.",5,12 January 2000,"Blair Witch was a good concept and overall does credit to those involved, but it suffers because the factors which make it unique and original at times also detract from it. It is perhaps a double-edged sword, but it could have been better without sacrificing the good points. The un-steadycam was a little too shaky, the hysteria a little overplayed, the camera work in general could have been better without spoiling the whole ""reality"" concept. Beyond this, a little more effort on the sound effects and a few more good scares would have made it so much the better.In the end, full credit to those involved for what they did with what they had, unfortunately to me Blair Witch is yet another movie that suffers under the weight of its own hype. I'm afraid the whole ""true story"" concept failed to capture my imagination. I have found two schools of thought on the movie, those who were terrified and those who were fairly unimpressed.

The majority of the film is during the daylight hours when they're just walking through the woods and the parts shot at night are filled with nothing more than twigs, leaves, screaming, and ""scary voices/noises"" that you can't hear but supposedly the actors can.  To top the pathetic theater experience off, the shaky camera work caused such motion sickness that I had to leave the movie towards the end and vomit 5 times in the movie theater bathroom.  I don't think ANY movie should cause you to toss your cookies because of the ""cinematography""... and I use that term loosely in this case.  According to my fiance' I didn't miss much.

You must imagine that you are in one of the other theatres, watching a different movie. This movie must be one of the most disappointing films in a very long time. The most devastating blow to its credibility was that there wasn't one genuinely scary scene; only 3 scenes could even be described as potentially scary.The acting, admittedly, was passable; the reactions of the cast were about what you would expect from the 3 filmmakers. However, although the idea was good, the execution of this film was very weak. How can you try to psychologically thrill your audience, when the sound is so horribly done that you can't hear the sounds that the characters are afraid of? In addition, some of the events that make their situation worse could have been handled by some unexplained phenomena; I highly doubt anyone would kick their only map into a river. In conclusion, TBWP is merely an overhyped, extremely disappointing piece of filmmaking that avoids the dreaded one only because of some very good acting in a horrid script- if there even was one.

I knew it was a low budget film and that production value would be minimal, and I expected it to have many faults. But I rarely walk out of a film and I was on the verge of walking out of this one at least five times. Not from motion sickness, but from the nausea that these guys pulled the wool over so many eyes and made so much money from a film that can't even be deemed a decent ""student film.""

The online and just the all around buzz was good and it seemed like everyone was talking about it. I didn't know anyone who saw it because of the limited release of the film. Some friends who went to see it before were turned away due to sold out shows. When the movie started you are introduced to the characters as they pack for their trip. Right away I will warn you that this WHOLE movie is filmed with an 8mm camera and even if you don't get motion sickness you just might start when you watch this documentary. There was never a scary moment and there was only a scene or two that even hinted at suspense. I would recommend waiting for this to come out on video, but if you must see it then bring some Dramamene and be prepared to look away from the screen several times before you get nauseous from watching the camera bounce around the whole time. The only thing that scared my friends and I was the thought of throwing up in the theater from being so dizzy and light headed. I can't see how anyone could say this was scary. To even compare this to The Exorcist is idiotic. I have seen Twilight Zone episodes that were scarier than this.

I saw this movie in a theater filled with the most diverse group of people I've seen in a theater since Titanic. Punk teens intermixed with aged film afficionados. The first 40 minutes of the film seem more like a comedy than a thriller, with the three students travelling to Burkettsville, and getting information from townsfolk. Then they head into the woods. If you read the film summary I wrote, Now youre thinking, ""When does it get so scary?"" The genius thing about the film is that, like all of the best, waits until the last 20 minutes of the movie to reveal itself as a thriller. The suspence in this movie is killer. Take off your watch before you enter, or you will find yourself looking at it to see how many minutes are left, and that would truly ruin it. The film, Strangely enough, never drops from it's climax, once it reaches it. You find yourself pitying the students as the last shreds of humanity are torn away into an almost animal wish to escape the forest. This film doesn't explain itself, which will turn off Kevin Williamson fans, who want the happy ending, where all is resolved. You will question what happened in the end for days, before realizing that some things are better left unknown.",The Blair Witch Project
2077,AlexP,Easily one of the most frightening movies ever made.,10,29 April 1999,"The Blair Witch Project is easily one of the most frightening movies ever made. It plays with your head in more ways than you can count. A movie that taps in to what *really* frightens us, as humans.  Most people are frightened of just being lost in the woods, and everyone is scared of being lost with something *else* in the woods.  It'll make you small.Filmmaking history, mark my words.",The Blair Witch Project

The characters are as real as they come because their reactions are from their own imaginations.  Hence the film is insidiously tense and I found myself enjoying this near uncomfortability. It was a pleasure to see fertile imagination win out against special effect over-budget mania. Cold cacklingly recommended!,The Blair Witch Project

Though not readily seen, 'South Park' shows the true level of hypocracy of the establishment, while 'Blair Witch' is truly a landmark of its genre, like the original 'Star Wars' or 'Pulp Fiction'. These two movies genuinely deserve all of the accolades heaped upon them, and I hope they are not passed over when the awards season comes around.",The Blair Witch Project

Knowing it was a cheap movie, but reading it was a scary one, I thought ""please, surprise me"". But no, this was very VERY boring. At a certain moment the first more or less scary moments occur, the lights turn on and the movie is over! Hitchcock knew how to bring suspense in a picture (like ""the Birds"" or ""Psycho""), a number of movies knew how to bring scary filth (like ""Evil dead"" or ""Hellraiser""), both being able to scare you in some way. This movie doesn't either of them. Together with the illogical behaviour of the 3 main characters to find a way out of the woods, I had to close my eyes many times: It was a slow, boring, illogical and bad movie. The only really scary moment was the close-up where tears (or...) came out of the  girls nose: close your eyes please...

Here we have 3 people, lost in the woods, and pursued at night by a terror they can't see or act against.  The Blair Witch Project takes the high ground, and succeeds in delivering its scares the old-fashioned way.  Things that go bump in the night, the plaintive cry of a lost child in the dead of night, the ghostly screams of a friend lost deep in the woods...  all are more effective than any ""Freddy"" or ""Jason"" movie where *nothing* is left to the viewer's imagination.  I applaud the filmmakers' to step back and scare by psychological means, as opposed to brute shock.  The movie's still sending chills up my spine.  My only worry is that as it gains wider release, it will fall upon an American movie-going public too jaded by special effects and too reliant on blood-n-guts, severed heads and cheap thrills to fully appreciate what an incredibly terrifying film this is.  Maybe they should spend a bit of time camped out in the woods, where unseen entities do indeed go bump in the night.And to those who are perplexed by the finale, you really need to pay *close* attention to the events leading up to it. Do so, and what happens makes perfect sense, and adds to the terror.",The Blair Witch Project

2089,schief,my two cents about The Blair Witch Project,10,27 July 1999,"Apparently unlike a lot of the people on this site, I'm not some frustrated would-be Gene Siskel who runs out to see every new movie, then races back here to put up a lot of self-important blather disguised as a review...I'm just some schmoe who goes to go see a movie from time to time. It so happens that The Blair Witch Project is one of the best I've seen in a long, long while. A couple of points I'd like to make:1. I think a lot of your enjoyment (or lack thereof) of BWP depends on the theater you're in. I was lucky and sat among several hundred other folks who were well-behaved through the entire thing, but other people I know went to a showing full of people talking/making noise/laughing at odd moments/etc., which would just absolutely kill the atmosphere for this movie. And surprise surprise, every last one of them came out not liking it that much.2. I generally make it a rule to avoid horror films as much as possible, simply because I find most of them to be really, really stupid when you get right down to it. I went into this movie thinking that there was a pretty good chance it would fall into this category. How wonderful it was to be wrong. With this plot line and shooting style, it would have been really easy for BWP to turn out either hokey or too contrived, but this cast manages to avoid that perfectly. I walked in knowing full well it was fiction and STILL found myself gripping the armrest.It's great to see a creative, well done low-budget independent film can still get wide distribution and exposure in today's world. But for those of you that didn't like this movie, fear not. I'm sure Hollywood will come out with another ho-hum, hype-and-tripe, overbudget 'scary' horror megamovie that's more to your tastes, like The Haunting or I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.",The Blair Witch Project
2090,Danny-87,Near-masterpiece!,8,10 May 1999,"This landmark pseudo-documentary ""film"" has all the hallmarks of cult-classicdom, which is a gross injustice since it deserves much wider acclaim and audiences.  The filmmakers penetrate with fearless conviction and wanton abandon the very nexus and recesses of our psyche to illuminate - in all its terrifying spectrum - a mind-blowing vortex of fear, desire, anxiety, and repressed primordial behaviour.  This anti-""film"" seeks to immolate the form and style of the medium (it eschews the montonous regularity of the grunge / metal soundtracks; the token, big-breasted, half-naked virginal sophomores; the stupidity and delinquency of the characters; the visceral SFX gore and 'dice-and splice'  bloodletting so enamoured of horror maestros; the requisite 'name' stars; and the predictable and strategically configured plotlines all adhering to the formulaic traditions of the genre).Instead the viewer is bombarded with technically inept production values, crude sound, variable focus and lighting, Cassavetes-style improvisational rambling, jerky and mistake-ridden mobile camera takes.  The whole cinematic world, its diagesis, because of the aforesaid rather than in spite of it, renders this truly harrowing and relentless excursion as an unnervingly claustrophobic and intensely warped psychodrama of the very nucleus of our mind and sanity!  The devastating realism, the astonishing simplicity of such a stunning idea (why didn't I ever think of it!?), the evocative and eerie odour of the unknown, and the adrenalin-rush tension all evoke the grand testaments of the classic horror arc of Val Lewton's atmospheric ""Isle of the Dead', ""Cat People"" and ""The Seventh Victim"", to early Polanski (remember the brilliant and subtle terrors of ""Knife in the Water"" and the masterful ""Repulsion""), to the gradual ascent of brooding tension and uneasy confinement of Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"", and Tobe Hooper's vastly under-rated ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".  In no way does this film reference the whirlwind ""stuck in the woods"" misanthropy and explicit violence of revenge films like Wes Craven's ""Last House on the Left"" and Meir Zarchi's ""I Spit on Your Grave"".As an expose and treatise of the subdivide between fiction and documentary the ""film"" works on multifaceted planes:  documentary within film (and vice versa), the interplay between the characters, the filmmakers and the viewer, the mimicry and artifice of the celluloid process that is so glaringly interwoven into the lives of the victims, and the perceived notions of what constitutes fiction-realism.  Furthermore, important themes of the symbolic grounding of ""woman-as-witch' cum maternal earth goddess/mother, the socio-political vanguard of the mythology of the American city/country divide, are all grounded in latent but nonetheless tacit modes of this film's self-referential discourse.  It also posits the Nietzchean question vis-a-vis ""if we are stripped of our normalcy do we become the masters of our destiny and do we appropriate the knowledge and power and mastery of others to survive in hostile, predatory environments?  Prevalent too is the almost atavistic primal elements of the earth - wind, water, fire, earth, light, cold - that obstructs and railroads the characters (and thus ourselves) via stress, sleep deprivation, hunger, alienation and pain.Flaws include: (1) if all hope is vain then why do they keep filming right to the end?  (2) When one of the three goes missing, why resort to the genre cliche of doing the direct opposite of what you would expect any logical and sane sentient being to do (in this case, flash the power lights around like it was the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony lightshow spectacular!).  (3) The penchant for over-reacting, particularly from Heather, suggests something is very awry with this ""doco"".  (4) A far more potent ending would be the absence of credits as this reinforces the fictionalised nature of what preceded.  (5) And the ending, though thoroughly gripping and suitably open-ended, seems a tad contrived and forced (however I will reserve full judgement here as the videotape I saw was very hazy and lacked clarity in this end sequence).The excellent trailer utilises the unsettling and heartfelt soliloquy to camera by the desolate Heather as she curls up in the dead of night with only the light of the bulb rallied against the unseen echoes of screaming surrounding the tent.  Overall, this is a riveting, mesmerising and enthralling work of brilliant simplicity that radiates a rare multifaceted intricacy.  I don't care what anyone says - I consider the film a NEAR-MASTERPIECE (I've now seen it twice)!  And if you, like me, absolutely detest nine out of every ten films made these days, here is that precious gem that restores your faith in the aesthetic and artistic realms of the filmmaking craft.  Personal opinions aside unfortunately, gross box office potential is severely disadvantaged by the low-budget, its style and technique, the genre, and the provocative, almost confrontational nature of the plot.  This will only appeal to the secondary strata of cinema audiences (indie gurus, theorists, academics, cineastes, horror groupies and film buffs will adore) but popular demographics brought up on a diet of fatuous high tech 'spill and thrills' will stay away in droves.  Word of mouth will be very strong particularly if it is further worked around the international film festival circuit, as already evident on the internet, and critical response should be favourable.  A gross injustice when a brilliant little film like this with modest parentage succeeds against all odds.8/10",The Blair Witch Project

And I saw nothing that would have made me sick, but then again, I'm a nurse and do things with the most disgusting stuff humans can produce.

It's incredible.  The directors of this film prove that fancy cameras, high-paid actors, and overblown budgets cannot replace horrifying simplicity of sheer psychological terror.  It's unfortunate to think that many will see this film after TV advertising has started, and most major media will have revealed that this is a ""mockumentary"" not a documentary.

I should not have watched the Blair Witch Project last night. This is the first film that has scared me as an adult.This is perhaps the most elegant horror movie ever.  There is no omniscient camera to interpret events.  It does an excellent job of making you feel like your really in the film and not just observing the characters.  Sure, lots of movies place the viewer as first person, but usually for only a few shots intended to give us a jolt.The timing in the use of props is ingenious.  The fact that a bundle of sticks tied together with some torn denim fragments can produce more emotional response than a multi-million dollar special effect makes me want to laugh at Lucas and cohorts.  Having the audience stare intently at a blank screen is the best special effect ever!Perhaps my favorite detail is the complete absence of advertisement in this film.

They should get an award or something for originality and execution of it all, because it was definately good in that aspect.  But around halfway (the more I think about it), the dumber the kids got (not unlike other movies *cough*anyhorrormovie*cough*) the less scary it was.  Taking the camera everywhere with them?  How stupid is that?  She's scared to death yet she can film it all.  And EVERY time there is a scary noise outside the get outside and look at it (and film it!).

I was so afraid to be completely freaked out at the theater that I may have been expecting too much.  I walked out of the theater actually wishing that there were more ""night shots"" in the movie.

The film exceeded even my wildest expectations.  The script and premise are genius, and the acting and directing fully lived up to potential.  This horror film is unique in many ways.  One reason it works so well is its realism.  Everything that occurs could be either natural (a crazed serial killer or cult) or supernatural. The mockumentary footage is extremely believable in its amateurism.  The character development is perfectly believable.  It also scares you much more by NOT showing you anything.

2112,modaman,Review and Possible Goof in the Blair Witch Project?,10,17 July 1999,"I am glad to finally see a horror movie come along that's actually scary. It doesn't seem like much to ask of a horror movie, but it's certainly not something that any degree of multi-million dollar budget CGI effects can seem to deliver. When I was a child, the scariest movies, to me, were the ones that my parents wouldn't let me finish. Where what the television screen could show me left off, my creative mind took over, in the darkness of my bedroom. As the Blair Witch Project demonstrates with such chilling results, it's often what you can't see, what you don't know that scares you. I applaud the creators of this film for taking me back to those long nights in my dark bedroom for just a little while. Now, something for the ""Goofs"" section- maybe, I'm not sure. This movie was supposed to take place in October, and in Maryland- I'm not sure when it was filmed, but it looked like fall, and I read in an interview w/the lead actress that they slept through 35-degree nights. How is it then, that you hear a cicada's call during one of the scenes? On the east coast, everywhere north of the Virginia's, cicada's are all gone by early to mid September. I don't know. It's probably nothing.",The Blair Witch Project
2113,C Nelson,eh,2,13 July 1999,"You've heard the hype: the rebirth of the horror film, most frightening movie of the year, whatever..sadly, the best thing going for Blair Witch is it's pr campaign. The endlessly bickering characters are straight out of an episode of the Real World, while the cinematography is too nudgingly amateurish to be taken seriously.  Only the chilling beginning (the small town urban legend everyone can identify with) and the truly breathtaking finale can hold up the sagging middle. Not completely disappointing, but in my audience, there were more laughs and groans, then screams and gasps.",The Blair Witch Project
2114,Syko-2,"Original, frightening film",9,3 June 1999,"I caught this film recently, and have to say that it's the ONLY horror film that actually scared me, mostly due to the fact that the actors are all unknown, and are excellent actors at that. I've recommended this film to EVERYBODY, and can't praise it enough",The Blair Witch Project
2115,Joe-331,"There's not much more than great to say, but...",10,1 August 1999,"When I left the theater, there were people who whispered words of disapointment, and yet, I had to wonder why.  Granted, the movie did not have the big-budget, special-effects, that you find in the current Horrors and Thrillers, such as Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer.  Other than that, it was so much more.  First off, this movie presents the unknown as the threat, not some guy in a mask.  Seeing that guy in a mask limits your imagination, while this unknown can be anything, and it is to each individual audience member.  Next, the acting was infinitely better than that in any big-budget box-office smash.  These people are real, and appear that way, unlike the unbalanced and weak characters in the Screams and I Knows.  The three main stars work so well together, that it appears to be a reality.  Also, with the cinematagraphy, it actually felt that the audience was right there with the characters.  I can not say enough about this film, besides that it is a refreshing break from the spoon-feed horrors that have been shoved down our throats the last couple of years, with its Hitchcock-ian style, a definite return to something that we have not seen in a long time.",The Blair Witch Project
2116,Doctor-34,Disappointment & Confusion,1,22 July 1999,"My friend and I saw two of the more anticipated movies of the year (1999)in the same night; Eyes Wide Shut and Blair Witch Project, and I don't think I could have found two better examples of the opposite extremes of filmmaking. Blair Witch, for all its hype is disappointing and even insulting at times. Granted, the core performances are very convincing however much of what they do doesn't make any sense at all. The film's key distinction is essentially that it looks bad with lots of hand-jerky motions which only serve to make one dizzy. There is little real story to the movie and suffice to say the movie feels improvised and off the cuff and subsequently amateurish. The only facinating aspect to this movie is how in the world it could have generated so much hype. The theatre I went to was a packed house while the EWS was only half full (both were good-sized theatres). I honestly don't know how such a badly-filmed inconsequentail film could steal thunder from the genius of Kubrick. Blair Witch commits the worst crime for a horror film; it doesn't scare. It doesn't even tease us with a scare. Its just boring. For all those critics who compared it with the Exorcist I can only imagine they meant Exorcist II. Save yourself the trouble and pass on this dude.",The Blair Witch Project

2118,HutDing,Didn't think it was scary enough? Read below...,9,2 August 1999,"I just returned from seeing ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and it scared the pants off of me.  I've read some negative comments, but I think those people didn't understand the end of the film. As soon as I saw that last shot, a chill went down my spine, and I knew that image would be imbedded in my mind for days. Those that didn't feel that way should see the movie again and pay closer attention to the beginning. I would like to add that I don't think being frightened by the film determines whether or not you have an imagination...it's merely a testament as to what truly frightens you.  I was deathly scared of the dark when I was young, but I wasn't scared of what I saw...I was scared of what I couldn't see.  That is what the film makers were attempting with ""Blair Witch,"" and I think they pulled it off well.",The Blair Witch Project
2119,shakesphereinlove,The Most Horrific Film in Years,9,1 August 1999,"The first film in many years to sucessfully use psycology to induce the chills and thrills, The Blair Witch Project is well deserving of a truck load of awards and honours. Not because of it's creative direction, stark origionality, or superior performances, but rather for gaining the distinct title of the only film to conjour up images so lasting that you will not be able to shake them, even at three a.m. the morning after you attend a screening of this intstant classic. Though it has innumerable ups, probobly themost impressive of all is Heather Donahue's shaking performance as one of the three filmakers. Didn't notice it when you saw it, that's what's so impressive. As my final testiment to this films greatness, I had the honour of attending the film with three other, quite intellegent, persons. Two of which still swear the film is comprised of real footage.I won't be camping this weekend.",The Blair Witch Project
2120,robert-121,"Gripping, stunning film, the absolute thriller!!",10,3 July 1999,"Privileged to see a preview of this fantastically terrifying film, I found myself actually feeling the pain and mind-numbing anguish of the characters. At times in the movie, I would find myself trying to peer through the darkness with them, fully realizing that there was absolutely no chance of knowing what was out there.  I think that is the most effective aspect of this, the fear of the unknown.  I really can't think of anything more frightening than something that has no identity, and so you don't know how to relate or react, and you are forced to suffer through the unknown.  A key component also included in this film was the steady decline of human spirit that you witness first-hand.  You watch as the characters are broken down to small, scared, hunted animals, and you find yourself shaking your head at how pitiful and helpless they have become, yet you don't feel sorry for them, only agonizing hope that they will escape the fear with at least their lives.  Wonderfully created film that, at least for me, an outdoor enthusiast who used to enjoy wandering alone through familiar woods, will always haunt me to the core of my soul when I look around and see nothing but endless woods, unknown sounds, and things that are never seen.",The Blair Witch Project
2121,drevil-4,One of the best films of the summer....,10,9 August 1999,"This is probably the best movie that I have seen this summer, and I have seen many movies this summer.  My favorite part of the movie is never seeing anything, as that lets your imagination run wild with you.  I thought that the acting in The Blair Witch Project was top-notch, especially Heather Donahue's confession scene.  The little use of blood and gore, the acting and just the fact that it cost and estimated $50,000 makes this movie well worth $4.50.  I'd like to see it once again, just to understand it better, after reading so many things about it and everything.  The only people that can't enjoy a movie like The Blair Witch Project are the people that have to have things handed to them on a silver platter, or that have no imagination. It was just an all-around good movie, and I highly recommend it.",The Blair Witch Project

I still enjoyed the heck out of it for its comedy. Talk about over hyping.  What was so scary about this movie for people? The scariest part was <spoiler alert!> the snot running out of the girl's nose in her ""I'm so scared!"" speech.  My father and I were dazzled by the craftmanship of the witches.  Those were the scariest twigs I had ever seen. Oh and those stacks of rocks were great, too.  Oh wait, i'm focusing too much on the ""special effects"" and not the psychological aspects of the movie.  Great plot set up.  There was this witch right, back in the olden days, and it has something to do with some guy coming out of the woods, and some children, too. Its a great Mystery Science Theatre candidate.  Make sure and watch it with your friends and a bunch of beer.",The Blair Witch Project
2123,Reiley,Some people,10,27 August 1999,"It doesn't really suprise me that this film is getting so many bad reviews from members of IMDB. These people call the film; boring, not frightening or disturbing in the least, and just downright dumb. It really is funny because they were expecting to see the witch, to have nice special effects. They also complain about the way TBWP seems it's a ""home video"", completely unprofessional. Really people, THAT WAS THE POINT!!! It wasn't made to look like a hollywood movie at all! And as we left the theater (I've seen it three times now) we talked about how people wouldn't like it because of it's non-hollywood style. And if you didn't think it was disturbing, or frightening in the least, you really need to get an imagination, and put yourself in the filmmakers shoes. So all've you are saying you wouldn't be freaked out if something like this happened to you? I know I would be! And I know when I went camping after seeing this movie I was very cautious! Also (SPOILERS AHEAD) the scene where Heather apologizes to everybody is the most powerful scene in movie history, period. I hope the academy gets smart and puts Heather Donahue and the movie up for an award, otherwise we're going to have more crap that's like Shakespear In Love winning again.To sum it all up The Blair Witch Project is the best film I've ever seen as well as a classic!",The Blair Witch Project
2124,Movienat,Atmospheric but derivative,4,18 July 1999,"This may be a spoiler, but-- While this film has been compared numerous times (and rightly so) to Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust, why has nobody remarked on the fact that the so-called ""original"" and ""chilling"" final five minutes are swiped shot for shot from the French film Man Bites Dog - a film which also, oddly enough, passed itself off as a zero-budget cinema verite horror film told entirely from the point of view of amateur documentarians? While Blair Witch isn't bad, it's just not terribly scary; it spends so much time appropriating elements from other, stronger films and trying to pass them off as fact that it becomes increasingly clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were trying to ""suggest.""  In films like The Haunting and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, your imagination can fill in the blanks and scare you because you can conjure up what's behind the door, what's lurking in the trees, etc.  In Blair Witch, the menace is so inconsistent and poorly drawn that it just becomes ultimately frustrating.  It's not important that you find out what happens to the kids, but shouldn't there at least be some rationale behind it?  The ""creepy"" final image smacks more of a script that painted itself into a corner than some kind of artistic ambiguous statement. Too bad -- the film does have some powerful atmosphere and occasionally exploits everyone's fears of the dark quite well, but this is hardly a revolutionary or groundbreaking film.  Hopefully the real item will come along sooner or later, because we're all getting starved for real horror films here.",The Blair Witch Project

In the fifteen years that followed, I have seen almost every horror and slasher film that was made.  Not once have I been that unsettled from a movie... then came The Blair Witch Project.Let me start by saying that this movie doesn't follow the conventional ""rules"" for a horror movie.  There is no nudity, no sex, or no music.  But don't let that stop you from watching it, you will be frightened.The story is told from the eyes of two cameras that the student filmmakers carried with them on the filming of a documentary. There is no ""phantom"" camera like there is in every other movie ever made.  I feel that this adds to the realism and terror of the film.  You see what they see, you feel what they feel, and you fear what they fear.This movie is so terrifying and feels so real that there is a constant debate on the Internet if this is just a movie or actual footage.  Let me end all the rumors now.  It's only a movie...   but I doubt that will help you sleep easier after you watch it.  It will chill you to the bone.If you hate ""low budget movies"" don't watch this movie, and if you don't like restless nights worrying about what might be lurking in the woods, then be sure not to watch it!It's original, it's unique, and it will scare you to death.

And you may too after signing on to the beautifully suspenseful and spine-tingling ""Blair Witch Project.""  The horror that takes place in front of the cameras in this ""documentary"" as its three-member crew becomes lost, hungry, hysterical and hunted will stay with you long after their last camera stops filming. Forget that this didn't actually happen, though that will be a true challenge.  What will really haunt you is that you can't convince yourself it COULDN'T happen.  Even in a world connected by computers and telecommunications, with nary an undiscovered piece of land to get lost in, we're still fascinated with strange phenomenon like witchcraft or the Bermuda Triangle.  We don't necessarily believe in them, but we also don't venture in by ourselves to discover their truths, either.  At least not like the film makers did here.

2127,Raven-103,"Rent Cannibal Holocaust Instead, Save 8 dollars!",1,21 July 1999,"I've read so many positive reviews of this movie since I got back from watching it, and all I can say is, huh? My God, this movie is not terrifying, scary, or even close to it. If anything the movie is a psychological drama that doesn't work due to the sheer stupidity of the characters the actors play. You don't sympathize with them at all, the plight they experience is completely the fault of the Heather and Mike characters. The only people who will find this movie scary are those who think ""Scream"" is the benchmark for horror in films. Heather Donahue's performance doesn't even come close to creating a suspension of disbelief in the audience. She's much too melodramatic for the film. The film primarily consists of arguments at Heather's character (All the characters in the movie have the same names as the actors playing them, probably so that when they break character it doesn't seem like they do), arguments between Mike and Heather, and more arguments. I watched this film at The Nuart in Los Angeles and when the credits started to roll at the end, the audience broke out in boos and hisses. The movie builds up for over an hour to a horribly lame conclusion that is supposed to seem psychologically disturbing but comes off as anti-climactic. The scenes where the actors rush to pull out their DAT recorders and 16 MM cameras to record the supernatural smack more of the filmmakers planting props for the characters to film in higher grade video. The positives: the film is funny, the charactrs seem like real people (ultimately this is a bad thing, once they get into the scenes in the woods they start to break character and 'act'; it's supposed to symbolize psychological breakdown but comes off as unconvincing). The negatives: Blair Witch is only brought up once the arguments start to get old, the movie is way too cyclical; they go to sleep something weird happens, they bitch at each other during the day. The whole situation with the map; I won't spoil it for people who want to see it, but how they forgive Mike for this is beyond stupid, it seems like their reconciliation is more a product of bad writing than a need to band together for survival. Guy to keep an eye on: Josh - this guy has a future in acting, just pick better projects in the future, he has a cool look and seems like a credible actor. Heather, Mike - stick to indies, or better yet stay in school. If you want to see a better movie with the same pseudo documentary gimmick this film uses go rent Rugero Deodato's 1979 film Cannibal Holocaust, much more disturbing. Eerily enough, right next to the Nuart is a video store and in the window right next to the line for Blair Witch they had Cannibal Holocaust hanging in the display case, so obviously someone else noticed the resemblance as well.",The Blair Witch Project
2128,Seanie-4,Brilliant filmmaking. A great idea made into a great film.,10,23 June 1999,"The Blair Witch Project is the scariest movie I've seen in long time, if not ever. As an adult, growing up with horror films by Carpenter and Craven, it now takes quite a film to even bring a shiver anymore. The first ten minutes of Scream looked to fill that void until it devolved into a mimic deconstruction of the horror genre. But Blair Witch takes you on a realistic, psychological journey into a terrifying myth and keeps you hooked (and scared) for 90 minutes. The last 30 minutes creep by as the overall sense of dread turns into living, breathing, palpable fear, both on screen and in the audience. A fantastic film that deserves a large following outside of the cult/college/festival circuit.",The Blair Witch Project

The movie seems so real, the acting is so real I find it hard to believe its acting and not a complete true story.  I must say out of every movie I have ever seen this one will stay in my head forever as one of my favorite movies.  You will become one with the movie and begin to love/hate certain characters.

It was a low-budget movie ($50,000 to be exact), but it was better than most of the really high budget movies.  It was the best idea ever for a movie and the myth was so believable, unlike the crappy plots most horror movies have.

The point of the in-film documentary was what could the Blair Witch be (good: kind-hearted yokels, bedtime stories, or bad: evil copycats, truly malevolent ectoplasmic miasma, cartoon villains?); but halfway through, that ambiguity was lost. The major flaw of the film was there was no other possible explanation than the one we were lead to believe. Things were too much what they seemed.

The film started out well and I loved the three film-makers.  The interaction between the three of them and the change of emotions through the weekend of filming were wonderful.  However, considering the film was promoted as one of the scariest movies ever, I have to say that I was more than disappointed.  I have to be the easiest person in the world to scare and yet this film did nothing for me.  There are far more intensely scary films out there, and although this would be in the same genre, it is certainly not in my top ten (which is headed by The Exorcist).

By the time I was on my way home, I had to call my parents in order to tell them to turn all of the lights in the house on.  I also made sure that I didn't have to go anywhere near the basement... ""The Blair Witch Project"" is the scariest movie of all time, period. Although I may not be as learned as others on the subject, I don't give a damn.  BWP does not frighten you with images of a witch, or her gory kills. Instead, it plants traces of unknown horrors in to the viewers sub-conscious.  That, in my opinion, is far worse than visual horror.  The actors did an amazing job of portraying terrified people reaching their wits end.  My heart pounded just as fast Heather Donahue's; I guarantee.  The leads' acting ability surprised the hell out of me.  At no moment did I remember that BWP was fiction.  The actors (and directors!) do that good a job.  Do yourself a favor: See ""The Blair Witch Project.""  Oh, and if you've got a special person in your life, bring 'em along.

The Blair Witch Project is a horrifying exercise in the psychology of fear that, if there is any justice in the world, will be recognized fifty years from now as a classic film. It's not just a great HORROR movie, either; it's a great MOVIE period, the first truly imaginative and original one this Oscar year.  In a righteous world, a shoe-in Best Picture nominee; in any world, the most insanely daring and worthwhile piece of celluloid to come down the pike in a long time.

I think that because of the ""documentary"" style you really feel like you know the characters, you see them in very candid and intimate moments and the emotions are very real.  How many times has a horror movie actually taken time to get the know the characters before they start hacking away at them.  The terror here is in the possibilities and the imagination of the viewer.  Some of us may be amazed to find out that our own imaginations are scarier than hollywood could ever hope to be!

Nothing I could have done would have prepared me for what I saw.This movie was brilliantly done, doing exactly what it meant to, which was scaring the bejeezus out of every single person in the theater in Houston. It did it possibly too well.  I think it may have gone beyond the line of ""fun scary"" to ""I- don't-know-if-I-can-handle-this scary"".I highly recommend this film, but I give a VERY SERIOUS warning.

The Blair Witch Project has got to be the scariest movie I've EVER seen.I've always complained how ""scary"" movies nowadays always cheapens the suspense and horror of a scene by showing what is ""suppose"" to be scary, and then it turns out it isn't. The reason would be because the one thing most everyone is scared of more than anything, is the unknown.
TBWP is all about feeling that chill in the back of your neck, turning around and see nothing, but know there HAS to be something there, and it can't be good.Because of this movie all the classic fears from childhood returns to hunt me as an adult (hopefully not for long).  The fear of the dark, the fear of strange noises you know nothing about, the fear of being lost in strange environments, the fear that the supernatural is real, the fear of being alone, the fear of being hunted, the fear of the unknown, and of course the fear of dying.Be warned I seriously believe that no one under the age of 17 should see this movie, unless you want them to have phobias for life.I believe I have a strong imagination and truly enjoy being engulfed by a movie experience, now I wish I didn't.""I just can't get that last scene out of my head, please help me.""",The Blair Witch Project

A group told me that they drove five hours from Mexico to see this movie. I've been hearing a lot of critics saying that twenty-somethings were not going to enjoy it because it didn't have blood and guts or Jennifer Love-Hewitt.

Much of the audience was laughing during many parts of it.  I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't read everything about it on the Internet before I saw it. We rented the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"" afterwards and thought that it was much scarier than ""Blair Witch"".

The lowres cameras only add to the chill, and the actors are stunning in potraying their characters. it is actually the actors who designed their own dialog, and did the shooting, though the writer/directors have to be credited for the genius of the premise, and the mind-numbing, painfully plausible ending. My girlfriend bawled, she was so frightened. One note: don't go see this movie in a crowded, noisy audience-- full of high school students. someone actually turned on a gameboy while the movie was going on, and these ditsy airheads wouldn't stop talking.

This film is unique in that it's done entirely with Hi8 video tape and 16mm film. It will seem especially real to the younger (17-24) group, since the actors talk like this group talks.The idea of the movie is that you're watching recovered video of three kids who, for a school project, go into the forrests in Northeastern Maryland in search of the legendary 'Blair Witch'. This outing supposedly takes place in 1994, when the group heads out but is never heard from again.
Knowing that the story wasn't true, I wasn't too scared.  But my daughter, who didn't know that, well, she thought it was really scary (I told her when the film was over the story wasn't true).This film was done a a shoestring budget, but it works.

It was boring *and* annoying. They should issue both Dramamine *and* NoDoze at the door. At one point a character said ""Mike, don't go to sleep"" and I leaned over to one of the people I was watching it with and said, ""Audience, don't go to sleep"".  She nearly lost it. :-)  The 'nose-cam' scene nearly had us rolling in the aisles!  It went on so long that it started to look like the actor was talking *with* *her* *nose*!  I don't that that was the intended reaction. If we weren't already whispering ""Die already."" to each other, it wouldn't have been so irritating.It's a damn shame MST3K's been cancelled because I'd *love* to see them do this one.

The technique is so effective that I found myself having to take a glance at the theater walls just to remind myself that i wasn't in the Maryland backwoods. The acting, dialogue, and everything else drips with reality which makes you wonder if the film you're watching really isn't the footage discovered beneath that cabin. Most importantly even the horror is real. It exists in myths, legends and historical record of America. The terror is so real it has a pulse.

It's amazing to watch as the three characters start to lose their minds and hope of survival as someone or something begins to stalk them in the woods.

Until now, that is. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is honestly one of the scariest movies ever made. More impressively, there are no cheap scares: nothing jumps out of the bushes and startles you, and you're not assaulted with dismemberments or beheadings. You just sit there in silence, with shivers running down your spine and terror gripping you in the belly. But how can a movie that cost $25,000 possibly be scarier than every other big-budget horror-fest ever produced?It is scary because it is vague. The filmmakers wisely observed that nothing they could put on screen would be as terrifying as what you could imagine. Their tools are a few sticks and 10 lines of well-placed dialogue, but they manage to scare you more than any CG effect ever could.It is scary because it is so real. The characters are you, or people you know. It's one thing to hear a famous actress's trained scream in the face of some hideous monster; it's quite another to hear a `real' person's hoarse, panic-stricken shrieks when all they can see is trees and darkness. The former may give you a start, but the latter chills you to the bone.Go see `The Blair Witch Project'. It will remind you how fun it is to be really, truly scared.

Compared to the sort of horror movies that are routinely produced, it stands out as truly well conceived and assembled. The concept, the acting, the cinematography, and virtually all other elements are dead-on. Unfortunately, they went so far with it and did such a fantastic job that the few weak spots seemed very noticeable to me. For example, the movie is comprised of patched together footage from the cameras 'found later' - and almost all of this footage feels authentic. There are a few shots, though, which seemed as if no one would have been available to hold the camera, and I found that distracting. Also, like so many American swine, I am jaded to the extent that purely suggested horror seems a bit weak to me (though everyone I've shown the movie to has been terrified, so maybe it's just me). People have been saying that this film will change the horror industry, but beyond the predictable knock-offs, I don't see that ""method film-making"" is likely to have much impact in the long run.

In a genre where most of the films of its kind are based on a tired and exhausted formula, The Blair Witch Project gets past the usual equation to achieve something even greater - a true horror movie. This proves once again that a big budget movie with hundreds of digitalized special effects and a cast of $15 million stars is not necessary for a good movie. The only thing that keeps the movie lines long and the theaters packed with people who have seen the movie multiple time is a revolutionary and truly disturbing film (as in the horror genre) - this movie is just that. All too often the market is flooded with pseudo-horror films like ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,"" ""Urban Legends,"" and ""The Haunting.""

Amazing how incompetence can turn a fairly decent premise into an almost complete disaster.  I went into the Blair Witch Project expecting not to be scared, but entertained, naively assuming that this was a well made and clever movie. Instead I got an hour and a half (but felt about twice as long) of three individuals alternating between petty bickering,  disabled  monologues directed to the camera and swearing at nothing in particular.  The set up to this film is non existent, no outside information regarding the Blair Witch is given beyond what you need to understand the unsatisfying ending.  That I think is the biggest flaw of the movie.  The viewer is supposed to believe this is real, but there is no sense that the witch is larger than the myopic scope of the movie.  Her presence is almost secondary, and is most assuredly not the driving force of the movie.  Secondly, the characterization in this movie left a lot to be desired. In a movie with  such a narrow focus you need to see the depth of characters, but you learn nothing of Heather and Mike, and they come off as totally unsympathetic.  That's two thirds of the cast. Finally, the unsteady, continual bouncing and out of focus shots from the camera are distracting and keep drawing you out of the movie.  It's hard enough to tell what's going on in the dark and the limited view from a video camera jerking around simply detracts from the film's effectiveness.  While the person I sat next to the theater seemed to be taken in, most of the rest of the audience wasn't, and there was much heckling and cackling and many (including myself) laughed out loud at the ending.  One man stood up and in a rather booming voice announced, ""That was lame"".  I couldn't have said it better myself.  2/10",The Blair Witch Project

In the same sense, all comments about their 'filming' the movie up to the end make no sense - how would we see the footage any other way? I suppose that films that feature unkillable humans, or high schools populated with models makes sense? SHEESH!!!Secondly: This move is more of a test of the viewer's intelligence / creativity. If you need a movie to tell you to be scared thru: music, explicit gore, etc. then this is not the movie for you (i.e.: You just got off work and are dozing thru it, waiting for a character to explain the story).

Even with that knowledge, it was close.I tried very hard to avoid all the preceding hype, and was almost successful, having seen no more than a print ad with the now-famous come-on (see above). The pains that were taken to make this amazing film seem real, along with the flawless performances by the actors, sucked me in like nothing else I have experienced. In a perfect world, everyone would see this movie the way its creators intended, with none of us knowing that it wasn't found footage. As I said, I had already been told, and I still spent the entire second half squirming with fear.If you're looking for one of the gore-flicks that pass for horror films these days, this ain't it. But if you want a unique cinematic experience that is nothing short of harrowing, see this movie. It's just too bad they couldn't keep the secret.",The Blair Witch Project

""The scariest movie since _The Exorcist_"" and others really got me anxious to see it. I was even scared to take my wife since she's pregnant right now (I didn't want to frighten the baby).  Needless to say, we were underwhelmed. The movie was basically one hour and 29 minutes of three GenXers shouting obscenities at each other while growing increasingly irritated with each other. The final minute was less scary than a campfire ghost story. It's quite unfortunate that in this era of mass-marketing, this movie got so much press (read hype) and ended up being so inadequate. Don't believe what you hear, and don't waste your time/money on this movie.",The Blair Witch Project
2190,FilmCat,"At last, someone understands the psychology of fear...",8,3 September 1999,"I confess I was a late-comer to this film and that I was not expecting to like it.  I was dead wrong.  In this film, which features potent performances by the three lead characters, the creators understand and thereby masterfully execute with chilling results that fear is based on the unknown and the unseen - that which lurks in the shadows of the infinite human imagination.  It's by not showing and detailing whatever is ""out there"" that true fear grows and is augmented.  This film frightens and disturbs by intimately involving the viewer in a journey into darkness.

2194,duckie-4,Highly over-rated B-movie should win awards for marketing.,3,30 July 1999,"I don't know  when the last time was that I disagreed with so many critics and (it seems) viewers (though the sold-out audience I saw it with did not seem too impressed).  BWP is a small, mediocre film that is not without it's pleasures (I enjoyed it), but it hardly deserves the praise that has been laden upon it.  It is certainly not the most frightening movie ever, nor is it particularly original, nor a genre breakthrough.  The film makers took an intriguing idea and made a modest, flawed, dull student film.  The general conceit is doubtlessly lifted from the superior Cannibal Holocaust, a film which is not only more frightening, but which manages a thematic layering that is much more deserving of the label ""genre breaking.""  BWP is not terrible.  It is entertaining, largely due to the excellent actors... Heather is especially good, managing sympathy for a truly dislikeable character.  The other plus in this film (here I agree with the seeming majority) is that memorable final sequence.  But even THAT lifts its tension build from the ending of Psycho.  Lifts it very well, mind you.  Had the script been more carefully drawn out, preventing disbelief from being weighed to the ground by a number of motivational inconsitencies, this might have been a troubling and effective film.  Incorporating the documentary's documentary from the Sci-Fi channel advertisement wouldn't have hurt either. Every person I've met off-line has cited the films shortcomings and their disappointment.  But on-line both amateur and pro critics have been stoking the hype.  Is it summer?  Is it, the Blair Witch?!!!",The Blair Witch Project
2195,joe chem,The Real Horror of this film....,8,5 August 1999,"This was a brilliant film however my viewing was hindered by an audience that thought they were watching scream or something they wouldn't stop talking and they laughed at inappropriate parts.  There are no cheap screams in this film the horror arises out of these characters descent into a hell on earth the horror is not even that they are being hunted but that they are being so manipulated (one of them cries out: ""F*** You God) the film reminded of a few of the really creepy Twilight Zone episodes (Time Enough at Last or The one where william shatner sees the monster on the airplane). The horror is not from the things that go bump in the night or the realization that their is a spook in the woods but the inexplicable notion that we are victims of some cruel inescapable cosmic or supernatural joke and no one knows or cares. The characters merely justify their horror by placing it on the witch and even themselves.  It would be an insult and misleading advertising to call this film a mere scream fest horror film.  I am still pissed off that I saw this film in a theatre filled with a bunch of immature kids whose reaction to character turmoil and pain (the real horror) is giggling (like it is supposed to be ironic or eccentric).  Save yourself the time and see this film because it is a journey into a living nightmare do not see it to scream or jump out of your seat (no one screamed the entire film).",The Blair Witch Project

This film has not been Hollywood-ized in any way...the lines in the movie are not polished by any means.  The amateur filmmaking itself made the movie seem all the more real.  And the fact that there is no soundtrack to spice things up only adds to the seeming reality of it all.  I would not, however, recommend this movie for anyone that gets queasy easily, not because of any gore or blood in the movie (in fact, there's barely any of that), but because of the shakiness of the camera throughout the film. I myself got a little queasy from it, but all in all it was worth it, especially in the final minutes of the movie.

2197,Shaft13,Not Too Impressed,8,30 July 1999,"I went to see ""The Blair Witch Project"" with 2 of my friends on opening day at my local theater(7/30/99), and to be honest, I  did not find it to be that scary...In fact we spent a good majority of the movie laughing at the film. I think the reason I found it to be so boring was that I had heard film critics rave about how scary it was, and probably expected too much from it. I can see how you could be scared if you really got into the movie and put yourself in their place, but I just had a hard time doing so. The only time I screamed during the whole movie, in fact, was when the lights came back on and I realized I had just wasted ten bucks. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that at times it succeeds at being spooky(The 3 piles of rocks by the tent, for those of you who have seen it), but due to the fact that you find out at the opening scene that the characters are already dead, it really kills any suspense the film could offer. I really enjoyed the fact that the movie was recorded using home video cameras and DATs(It made it all too  believable and realistic). So, I guess all I can say for ""The Blair Witch Project"" is that as a film I found it original and realistic, but for a horror movie there was little/no suspense(which in my opinion makes a scary flick).",The Blair Witch Project

I admit that I'm a wuss and could barely WATCH the last 10 minutes of the movie, but my friend wants a sequel. There's nothing ""new"" to the movie that can't be found on the website, with perhaps the slight exception of a certain discovery in the woods.There has to be a sequel -- this is only half of the movie. It doesn't answer any questions, it only raises them. And there are plenty of questions to be answered in the future.Should there be a second movie, my advice is to STOP JERKING THE  CAMERA AROUND. It makes people motion sick, and had I had the courage to watch during the scary bits, I might have been among those who got ill. Yes, it's a nice effect, but it gets old.Ideally, TBWP should be viewed in a remote town so that you pass by woods on the way home. Seeing it in a city doesn't have the same effect.",The Blair Witch Project

They tried to make this a believable documentary, but failed miserably. There were so many mistakes that a first year film student should cringe. Everyone that was interviewed had no idea what the heck they were supposed to be saying, and you'd think that the actors graduated from the William Shatner academy. I really wanted to laugh through the entire movie because it was that bad! I found the movie lacking in plot, in dialogue, in, well basically everything! A lot of the people I know said that it was the best movie ever, but they are all what you'd call freaks and weirdos that have no thing to do with any use of their brain anyways.

The directors of this film went back to basics in a big way, and in so doing have scored one of the most innovative and smart films to come along in a very long, long time. The only thing that might hurt this film come Oscar nomination time, is the fact that it is a horror film. It deserves all of the accolades and recognition it no doubt will garner however. A true HORROR film in every sense of the word. There were moments during which you could have heard a pin drop in the theatre. The audience was totally captivated by this film. One of the most powerful films in terms of sheer emotional content, in at least a couple of decades. Maybe longer.Brilliant concept. Brilliant story. Brilliant acting.

I kept waiting for this thing to get scary. If this was scary, so was that episode of Seinfeld where they got lost in the parking garage. It starts out with this lame attempt to make the thing look like a real amateur documentary. This looked like a bad high school project.  At no time did I believe that these were real film student.  Had they been, they would have failed out semesters earlier.  I kept waiting for this to get scary.  Oh, there is a scary pile of rocks. Eww, there is blue slime on my back-pack.

Much of the film was just plain annoying - the characters were really starting to p**s me off (I wonder how the witch felt about them) or unbelievable (e.g. characters having major emotional confrontations while handing holding camera with great stability).Here's an idea.  Maybe AT&T should sponsor the movie, and after 5-10 minutes when you've got the concept (viz. kids lost in scary woods), they could have a reassuring deep voiceover with ""Next time you go to make a documentary in the woods, make sure you bring your AT&T Wireless Cell Phone with"").Just a thought",The Blair Witch Project
2210,Lorraine-4,A home video -- not particularly scary nor America's funniest,2,1 August 1999,"This movie was not mis-represented as a home-made project in the least.  In fact, at the end, my companion and I looked at each other and said, we could have done that ... and better! But it certainly started with potential and some interest. The combination of three young student film-makers with the suggestion of promising personalities and a potential for complex interactions plus a ghost legend and a goal of making a documentary -- this could lead to a quality movie experience.  However, that quickly dissolved into a very LONG and tedious collection of amateur photography accentuated by unimaginative and annoying dialogue. And where was the scary part the hype was all about?  After all, camping in the Maryland woods is not fraught with grizzly bears and other dangerous critters.  There was so much space between the trees and open level ground that even a psychopathic killer doesn't present a terrific threat.  The frustration was watching three not very intelligent people manage to act like idiots in the great outdoors.  To an experienced camper and outdoorsperson, this was intolerable.  Why was it, they never really start to get out of the now frightening area until an hour before sun down?  Why is it, they are falling apart psychologically after only two nights outdoors?  Why are they falling apart psychologically at all?  Why do they have to resort to bellowing and slamming things around? Why don't they follow the stream to get out?  Is all this lack of outdoors competence supposed to be explained by some sort of bewitched state of mind? Is going around in circles part of the evil spell?  And who the heck is stupid enough to go into an abandoned house with eerie symbols painted all over it when you're already terrified of bad things happening?  It's that spell again, huh.  By the way, if this is supposed to take eight days ... where were the search and rescue planes and bloodhounds,  or were their parents just as glad to be rid of them as we were when the movie was over? The Maryland woods are neither huge, nor the epitome of wilderness.  We likened the experience to taking one of those haunted house rides in an amusement part -- where you rationally expect things to jump out at you throughout the ride, but instead, they just turn out the lights and you ride around in the dark until --- you're back outdoors again and the ride is over.  Admittedly -- it is scary because you were constantly expecting the worst.  But frankly, after getting back outside, you would reflect and say -- I paid money for that????

I went against everything about which Flavor Flav and Chuck D. so ardently tried to warn me: I believed the hype. I called the theatre near me ahead of time...sold out. I went to a theatre in a less culturally aware area of town, thinking perhaps no one would have heard of this film...sold out. I waited in line hours earlier to buy tickets for the LATE late show, 11:45 PM. Finally, I held in my sweaty palm, a ticket to The Blair Witch Project. I had visited the film's website. I read up a bit on the background. I heard the frightful reviews, and boy, I was ready to have the skin terrified from my very bones. I said READY...prepared...waiting...............still waiting. Oh dear...over ten minutes of COMMERCIALS? Not trailers, mind you--they were still to come--but commercials; ADS. Appalling. This is why I stopped watching television. As I sat in the crowded theatre, nervously checking my watch, I noticed that it was nearly midnight. The fellow of no more than 17 seated next to me, leaned over and muttered, ""Is this your first time?"" I indicated that it was, and then he provided me with the unsolicited fact that he had seen it just the night before, and was so mesmerized, he'd returned this evening for a second viewing. THIS was why I didn't like people.The lights went down...AT LAST...and I kept waiting.""Do we have any weed?"" Heather Donahue asks coyly as the other two stooges guzzle beer and liquor in a cheap motel. A silent alarm sounded in my clearly distant Area 39. Surely, I told myself, SURELY this is just a flimsy effort to get the audience in synch with these three kids; make us feel for them. It will get better...won't it? MUSTN'T IT!??As I was about to catch a catnap, hoping to perhaps wring SOMETHING substantial out of this evening, I realized that there were only TWO idiots now. Whatever happened to the third? Hmmmm. OK--capacity of attention span: MET AND SURPASSED. Next...?Mucus...a lot of it. Heather, the pontificating, ever-eloquent a la ""Mary Brown...I thought she was fu--in' insane"" has the camera pointed at herself once again and is crying--not to mention SNOTTING--up a storm. Shouldn't I be feeling something by now...other than the need to use the restroom? Hmmm.
Artisan Entertainment, after a masterpiece like 1998's Pi, why have you failed me? The only difference between the supposed emotion of Heather in her last hours, and say, Deborah Winger as the terminally ill Emma Horton in Terms of Endearment, is...I actually cared about Emma enough that I wanted her to LIVE...and Terms of Enderment was fiction! Enough said?I chuckled to myself as the THUD was audible and Heather's camera dropped to the ground. Surely this loss of balance was the result of a sharp blow to the head from some disgruntled financier, or an Artisan executive with the horse sense to end production of this embarrassment in time to save face.
If I had been in that house in Maryland five years ago, I might have done the deed MYSELF, just on general principle...just to make her STOP TALKING.
My mother always told me not to follow the herd, because they were likely to end up in the slaughterhouse. I should have listened.As the credits rolled, I thought less of the ""great film"" on which I had just wasted nearly ten dollars, and more of an actually pressing issue,

I wont say much about it that will give away the movie (although if you are reading this I am sure you know by now)but I liked it and liked the affect it had on me and several others who saw it. Its hard to describe how it did it but it really creeped me out and the final scene gave me chills the next day. I really liked the sound fx also. Its not a typical horror film which is a good thing. It seems that most of the people who really hated it are wannabe film makers and the reason for that is the simplicity of it.

2218,Primal-2,The Scariest Film Ever... I DON'T THINK SO!,1,2 August 1999,"""The Scariest Film Ever""...I don't think so!I walked into the movie theater feeling that I had actually spent my money well for once, but I left feeling more ripped off than I had in my entire life!WARNING:  This film is not the slightest bit scary!The only thing I actually liked about the movie, and the only thing that will save it was the acting!  The three actors in the film give one of the most realistic performances I've ever seen in a movie.  Yes, some of the things they do are just flat out stupid, but the dialogue between the three of them is excellent.  If it wasn't for the chemistry, or lack there of, between these characters this film wouldn't be worth putting in theaters at all.  As I said before, the acting was the only thing I enjoyed about this film. Simply put, the rest of the movie was terrible. There was nothing in the movie that was really scary.  As a matter of fact, I wasn't frightened for a second.  Don't get me wrong.  I went to this movie wanting to see a really scary movie, but the film just didn't deliver!  That's really my main problem with this movie, it just isn't scary, and that's what it was pawned off on everyone to be.  Another problem with the movie was the camera work.  Yes, it was cool to present the film as clips from the cameras they we're using, but the camera work was enough to make you sick.  BOUNCE, BOUNCE, BOUNCE.  It was almost more annoying than it was effective.  Along with the picture bouncing all over creation, I thought the lack of music throughout the movie was a bad idea.  Music adds a great deal to any movie, especially horror movie.
My final problem with the movie is the lack of common sense. I know there isn't very much common sense to any horror movie, but let's think about a few thing here.  One, how long can a battery in a video camera last? Honestly I don't know, but three or four days plus seems to be pushing it without a good re-charging.  Two,  why would you continue to stop and sleep if you know something is after you?  You might as well just walk away from your friends and say, ""I'll be right back.""  I thought most college students were suppose to be smart.  I guess being smart has nothing to do with common sense.  Three, why wouldn't you just follow the that you ran into on five different occasions?  Everyone knows that if you follow water down stream it eventually comes out someplace, and that beats being lost in a woods any day.  The move just didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense.In conclusion, this film just didn't do much for me.  It wasn't that scary, and the characters weren't very bright.  For me the only thing that saved the film was the acting!  I can only give it 4 out of 10 stars.  And that's simply for great acting.",The Blair Witch Project

2220,Mr.Flick,"Intelligent, Truly Scary Film",10,2 August 1999,"Those who think that ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not truly horrific have not given the film enough thought. The movie is not scary by conventional terms, but builds its horror and suspense on a more psychological level. The final shot of the movie, while a tad ambigous and question-raising, is there for a reason. Viewers who are thoughtful and attentive enough will make the connection between that final chilling shot and a line of dialogue that is stated near the beginning of the film. Once I made the connection between these two crucial points (which was about an hour after I'd seen the film), I was chilled to the bone. Sleeping was nearly impossible the night I saw the film, and I must now honestly say I've never seen a movie as bleakly horrific as ""The Blair Wit",The Blair Witch Project
2221,stanz71,Not worth it.,1,2 August 1999,"To sum up this movie in one line I would say was awful. It was not scary and from what I had read was at least expecting it to be good. It wasn't even creepy. The lady in the movie drove me up the wall. This was not even realistic, I believe that if she was acting as scared as she was I would be worried about filming myself washing my hands in the river. Also how many batteries did she have for camera. It's ashame that this movie is going to make a killing from all the hype. If you absolutely have to see this movie I suggest try finding a bootleg copy and let the person who made it make the profit instead.",The Blair Witch Project
2222,digamma,They couldn't have died too soon for me.,1,2 August 1999,"I was extremely disappointed in this film.  It spends the majority of its time showing three rejects from MTV's The Real World screaming at each other over whose fault it is that they are lost in the woods.  There is a minimum of plot, and the ending refers to a line from the beginning of the film that many viewers have forgotten by the conclusion, through all the whining and fighting.  Some of the B&W shots are indeed chilling, but with a pair of scissors this 100-minute film could easily be turned into a scarier and more interesting half-hour television episode.",The Blair Witch Project
2223,PNut-2,Don't expect too much,5,2 August 1999,"I went into the theater to see this movie fully expecting to be scared senseless.  Unfortunately that was not the case.  Nevertheless, I found the movie to be very good, and would have thought it better had I not known so much about it previously.  I believe the best thing one could do is watch the movie without knowing that it is fiction and without any expectation to be frightened more than ever before.  It is a scary movie, and even better if you don't know what to expect.",The Blair Witch Project
2224,Carol-35,Most frightening when the mood is right,10,2 August 1999,"If you are the type of person who can easily lose sleep on a stormy night by recalling Grandma and Uncle John's sworn testimony that late great Grandpa has been known to phone during thunderstorms, you should be able to appreciate this movie.  And it definitely helps if you've spent time deep in the woods at night and don't mind barrages of profanity.
A piece of advice to which all potential viewers should pay heed:  Listen to the stories told in the beginning in order to understand the ending!  Those who don't are the ones who walk out of the theater afterwards saying, ""That's it?  What happened?"" I've seen The Blair Witch Project twice, in two very different audiences. The audience made the atmosphere, which I found to be the crucial element in getting into (and therefore appreciating) this movie (or not). The first group was quiet from the beginning, aside from laughter at the funny moments and yelps at the frightening ones. With silence and few distractions, people could lose their actual surroundings and be there with the campers, not to mention decipher the faint sounds that occasionally required careful listening (and good hearing).  If only the theater could have been pitch black, like the woods at night.  I would suggest closing your eyes at those times when there is audio but the screen is black, and just listening.
Of course, this advice would be useless in an audience like the one in which I viewed this film the second time.  There were macho types who had to scoff loudly at every turn, a gum popper to my right, whisperers behind me, four CHILDREN jumping up and down in the front row, and various popcorn go-fers cruising the aisles the entire time.  Bad experience- there was no empathizing with the characters or catching the more subtle details, and I doubt anyone in the theater (including the five year old) was all that frightened.  The reality of the theater was too all-encompassing. 
You have to experience the film as a fourth (or fifth?- evil cackle) camper, who is all too aware of how sinister unusual occurrences can be when there isn't an exit sign nearby.",The Blair Witch Project
2225,liberty-9,good for horror movie,9,3 August 1999,"I usually don't like horror movies, but this one was good.  Pretty scary in a no gore kind of way.  I also liked the entire first person camera stuff. I was disappointed at the end to see a fairly massive production crew.  I was hoping this would have been a five person crew indi type movie.  Oh well.",The Blair Witch Project
2226,jinxjanx,One of the scariest movies I've ever seen!,9,2 August 1999,"I saw the preview for this movie on tv and then got into wondering about it. I went to the main site and saw artifacts and stuff that they had ""found"". I began to really get into it, believing it was all true until I read the Rolling Stone review of it, learning that it was all fake. I saw the movie the first night it was available and even though I knew the truth I was so freaked out! It was an excellent movie and even though somethings are left for you to figure out, I liked it that way!",The Blair Witch Project
2227,ctreston,Scaring you from outside the box,10,2 August 1999,"What makes The Blair Witch Project such a uniquely terrifying movie has more to do with the concept than the execution.  The mainstream horror films rely on surprise to maintain suspense.  In fact, moviegoers are usually conditioned to sit on the edge of their seats, waiting for whatever may burst onto the screen.  I spent sixty non-stop seat-gripping minutes of this film waiting for just such a shock -- non-stop precisely because the moment never came, leaving me with the much more suspenseful feeling that it was still to come.",The Blair Witch Project
2228,JDunn187,I spent $7.50 for this?,2,2 August 1999,"I saw ""The Blair Witch Project"" the second day of its release anticipating to be scared senseless.  A long and often dull hour and a half later I knew that I had wasted my $7.50.  What was hyped to be one of the scariest movies of all time turned out, to me, to be one of the most uninteresting and boring movies I've ever seen.  Literally the only thing that kept me from leaving early was to find out how the film ends.  And once I learned that I wished that I'd have left when I wanted to originally.  All in all the film was not scary, suspenseful, or even interesting in the slightest degree. The only thing I will give for this ""horror"" is that it is, indeed, horrible.",The Blair Witch Project
2229,Goldman-2,This movie is not scare at all.,6,6 August 1999,"I don't think this a scary movie, at least for me.  It is certainly creative, but not scary.

2230,Liz3640,Absolutely Shocking!,10,2 August 1999,"I am a horror movie buff. Nothing scared me, until now. I just got back from see The Blair Witch Project just a few hours ago and I am still too scared to sleep. This movie was just too real. I don't even like calling it a movie. The only thing that made it a movie is that you had to pay to see it on a screen. It's the documentation of four terrifying days that these 3 students had to endure before disappearing forever. I honestly don't even know what to say. I'm still shaky from watching it. I think those who don't find this movie frightening are either really sick people or just didn't understand it. I know many didn't understand the ending, but just think of what one of the legends that the townspeople mentioned and perhaps you'll make the connection. I could go on forever, but I won't. Yes, I'm glad I saw this movie, don't get me wrong. But, like I said, it was too real. I felt as though I was with them which made it all the more horrifying. I recommend this movie, just don't watch it alone.",The Blair Witch Project
2231,Jeff M.-2,One PURE ghost story,10,3 August 1999,"I feel sorry for those who do not appreciate the pure and simple beauty of this masterpiece.  As I left the theater it was sad to hear the disappointed ones who did not get their fix of Hollywood gore, robots, and lasers. This was a bedtime ghost story brought to the big screen - nothing more -- and it was SCARY AS HELL!",The Blair Witch Project
2232,Dyson-2,The real terror is one that cannot be seen by the naked eye...,10,3 August 1999,"The folks that did the PR and hype for this film did a so-so job. They hyped this movie so much that it generated huge publicity, but they hyped it the wrong way.  It's not the scariest movie of all time, it's the best scary movie!(understand?)  This movie is about the journey three kids take from being cocky film students, to whimpering, naive, and terrrified little children lost within a dark woods and becoming the prey of an urban legend. Don't expect a witch or gross-looking pyschotic killer to jump out because this movie isn't a slasher flick, it's better than that.  Go to this movie well-educated about its plot and ideas.  Have an open mind and let your imagination run wild.  The back of you neck will tingle, your palms will sweat, and your heart will race during the last 15 minutes of the film, and I'm not telling you why!  The real terror is one that you cannot see, but can only imagine.",The Blair Witch Project
2233,Cane-6,a very spooky flick,9,3 August 1999,"at last someone figured out that you do not need to have gory, bloody monsters and special effects to scare someone. All you need is fear and this movie truly uses it to its potential. Without giving away too much, I don't think I will be going camping anytime soon.",The Blair Witch Project
2234,diva-24,I haven't lost this much sleep since the Exorcist -- may include spoilers!,10,9 August 1999,"This is, without a doubt, one of the must terrifying films that I have seen in my young lifetime. Never before in a film has the intent has been so deliberately to cause fear - no disgust or revulsion, like in the Freddy movies for example. This film is about pure, undiluted fear, and that is what makes it so fabulous. Lately movies seem to operate on a gross-out factor, depending upon expensive special effects and gut wrenching visuals to have the viewer experience some sort of terror. The terror in the Blair Witch Project, however, is more primevial, more psychological, more spiritual. The fear of the unknown is the greatest fear of all -- and the makers of this film and the actors portray that so well. For me, the most terrifying part of the film was when the sides of the tent began to be pushed in by an unseen entity, and children's laughter could be heard outside. The gut reaction of the actors matched that of my own, as did their reactions in the rest of the film. This is another brillant measure of the film...any one of us could have been in the same situation and acted just the same. To create that sort of empathy for the actors allowed the viewers to experience the terror of the film even more. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who was scared in the shower the next day -- I was waiting for the shower curtain to be pushed in on me. The climax of the film, though, I must admit, first struck me as being ""cheesy"" until about 30 seconds later. The un-knowing is the most terrifying part. Not since Hitchcock have inuendo and implications created such terror. The only problem I have seen with this film is that it is an 'all or none' kind of thing. Either you get it, or you don't. That I find unfortunate for those people who have lost the ability to use their imagination to create the monster in their mind and require Industrial Light and Magic to do it for them. The monster in your mind is so much more chilling than any designed by computers -- especially when the monster in your mind is something unseen.(10)",The Blair Witch Project
2235,Tully-6,Truly Horrible,1,3 August 1999,"Over-hyped is the only word that describes this movie experience. The film introduces you to three college film students who the viewer never feels any remote attachment to.  The lead female role is so annoying that the audience laughed as she shrieked in terror.  The film tries too hard to establish the authenticity of the footage, meaning you get a lot of out of focus close-ups of the grass or the never popular blank screen.  Of course this is a creative and original idea, yes its amazing it was made for such petty cash, but who cares if the movie isn't entertaining.",The Blair Witch Project
2236,KDFW,Chilling,10,5 August 1999,"This was the most chilling movie I have ever seen.  It brought out some of my childhood insecurities - being afraid of the dark and hearing strange noises.  I must admit that somewhere in the back of my mind I probably do believe in ghosts, witches and the supernatural.  I knew the story line going in to the theater but was still on the edge of my seat.  If you do not believe in the supernatural, do not bother seeing this movie because you will not be able to let your imagination play along (i.e. my husband). However, if these types of things bother you, you must see it.  Three days later I am still haunted by the tent scene and the final scene in the house.",The Blair Witch Project
2237,wildcat-16,dismal and predictable,3,3 August 1999,"I specifically went out of my way to steer clear of any information about the movie before I saw it.  It had achieved such an incredible following and I wanted to view it as so many others had done; I wanted to jump at every little surprise.  Unfortunately, there were no surprises.  The only thing scary about this movie is that there are actually people out there that found it frightening.  I was so looking forward to see a movie that dealt with the depths of terror.  Fright has never had anything to do with cgi graphics; but the fear of the unknown.  Alas, I will have to wait for another movie to reach this plateau, for to understand the basic premise of the movie is to have already seen it.  Blair Witch was sorely lacking the frightening punch that so many had promised.",The Blair Witch Project

I thought I was going to be on the edge of my seat in fear the whole movie - I wasn't.  The last five minutes or so was the scariest part of the movie. The rest of the stuff was a rather uninteresting build-up.The movie definitely stands out from the rest of the Hollywood offerings. See the movie if you are looking to check out a film that has done a good job at parting from the traditional camera shots and dialogue.Still don't plan to see this movie if you are looking for a horror flick that is going to give you nightmares and sleeping problems.",The Blair Witch Project
2239,violet-13,Pretty awful,3,4 August 1999,"I did not like this movie. First of all, it is all taken for a home video camera and it litereally made me motion sick by the end of the movie. Second, I went to this movie to be scared.  Not happening.  3 kids get lost in the woods doing a documentary on this witch and they disappear one by one.  You barely hear the witch, dont see it, and the kids use bad language every other sentance. I thought the movie was ridiculous.",The Blair Witch Project

2242,Joshua-23,It could have been worse...,1,4 August 1999,"Quick summary - lots of laughs while waiting for something to happen. 
Longer view - The acting is pretty good, I'll give it that.  The character ""Heather"" has a VERY annoying interview style, but aside from that the three main actors give convincing performances.  The marketing is spectacular. The soundtrack needs some work (hee hee).The problem being there is NO PAYOFF, real or implied (yes, I am capable of appreciating subtlety).  In the mercifully short 82 minute running time, I was reasonably ""scared"" for about 5 minutes.  The rest of the time I was either laughing at the dialogue (this should go in the comedy section when it makes it to video) or imagining how this film was going to freak me out (not even close, I'm afraid).As the credits rolled I told the friend I was with ""WE could have done this. And made something that was GOOD.""  I will not let this be an empty statement.  I'm finally going to write a screenplay, get funding, and shoot a movie.  So I thank all the ""Blair Witch"" crew for inspiring me to ""show 'em how it's done.""All in all, I paid $7.25 and wasted about an hour and a half of my time. Much less time and money than I invested on my last girlfriend (now if you want to hear a SCARY story...)",The Blair Witch Project

Despite the absence of ax wheeling maniacs and masked blood thirsty killers, this film will scare the wits out of you.  Blair Witch uses a much better tactic for fear, the viewer's imagination.  You never seen the witch but it still gets you. You will never look at the woods the same again.Even though the story is fictional and even the legend the film is based on is made up, you begin to forget that as you watch.This is a very well made and frightening film.",The Blair Witch Project

2245,Kaneda-6,Simpletons...,9,5 August 1999,"I suppose if you have a little age or intelligence on you, you'll recall another entertainment genius called ""War of the Worlds.""  The whole point of that radio broadcast is that they made it seem real, which in turn, heightened the suspense and horror of it all.That's what they were trying to accomplish here and as a fellow film student, I think they did quite well.  They went against the ""Hollywood"" norm (Notice how the picture was square rather than widescreen?  Subtle, but effective), made something so completely original and managed to scare the wits out of most (minus the ignorant few who flame it on newsgroups). Honestly, when was the last time a movie truly scared people?  Don't say some lame movie like Scream where they dumped 20 gallons of theatrical blood over the camera.   See what I mean?  The beauty of this movie is it's simplicity and sense of reality.  It reminded me of the classic Alfred Hitchcock or Twilight Zone style suspense.  Or is that what you were expecting?  Something where 3 kids wondered out into the woods and stumbled on a Wicca Convent?  I'm sorry; go rent an Xfiles tape.If someone were to go and tell all the listeners of ""War of the Worlds"" that it was fake; announcing the event weeks ahead of time so people would be prepared (Yes, I know they had a *small* disclaimer at the beginning, but it's not the same), would it have had the same effect?It was an intelligent movie for intelligent people; they're always bound to miss a few.",The Blair Witch Project
2246,Jinuwine,"A well written, well acted, scary flick.",10,5 August 1999,This movie was incredible because it so unconventional. It strays from any other carved movie path and takes you to an uncharted part of terror. The true horror of the movie doesn't quite sink in until you watch it a second time.

It is amazing that they found people to hype this movie so much because at my big-screen theater everybody hated it and so have also friends told me that people were reacting at their theaters aswell. There is nothing scary about this movie ,the only thing that will make you sick to the stomach is the out of focus camera. The actors were so bad that from the get go you stopped believing the whole thing.The audience really wanted to go with the movie and tried to pay attention but the ""scary sounds"" were just to low.

It's a remarkable achievement that proves the scariest mysteries are still the ones that go bump in the night--the monsters under the bed, the silhouette in the window.  With virtually none of the typical Hollywood gimmicks like surprise plot twists or red herrings, and no special effects except for a skillful use of light and dark, sound and silence, and the talents of three smart actors, the Blair Witch Project reminds you what fear really feels like.  Fear as you can only feel it in your deepest childhood nightmares or darkest adult anxieties.  It burrows into your subconscious and drags you through the woods right along with the cast and crew.  It's a great night at the movies, but you may have to sleep with the lights on for several days afterward.",The Blair Witch Project

I watched it at nearly midnight, the latest, darkest, scariest time I could find. Throughout the entire film, I kept waiting to be scared - I never was. I kept waiting for something scary to happen - it never did. I was never on the edge of my seat; there was never any reason to be. Instead it was all I could do to stay awake from boredom. This was more a ""movie"" of three people simply lost in the woods. I found the ""actors"" rather annoying. I felt the movie was quite repetitive and frustrating, and I just wanted it to hurry up and end so I could be put out of my misery.

Except for the last 5 seconds, the movie was totally without anything scary. The movie spent a boring hour and a half building up for this final moment. Through this, some audience members were rewarded with motion sickness due to the actors inability to hold a camera without having violent shaking fits.  These audience members did not only go home disappointed, but they had a whopping headache as well.  Those of us who were lucky enough not to be affected by the shaking actors, got to enjoy watching 3 idiots wander around the woods because nary a one could read a compass or a map.

It seemed that they were there, not to consider the movie on its own merits, but because they thought it would be a hip, raw, scarefest blockbuster.  It wasn't and isn't, so don't go if that's what you're looking for.  If the audience hadn't been expecting Freddie Kruger to mysteriously materialize with a gore-dripping chain saw, they might have been able to identify with the characters and realize what an unnerving experience it would be to be lost, frustrated, and hearing weird sounds in the night.  And they might have been drawn into the movie enough to flinch and squirm when the REALLY scary part finally happened, like I did, even under such poor movie-viewing conditions.If you're looking for a quietly entertaining movie with supernatural overtones as well as subtle commentary on changing group dynamics in the current age, go see it; then maybe the theater will be quiet enough that the movie can weave its spooky web around you.  I can't guarantee it will happen, but I suspect that the absence of popcorn and Milk Dud missiles makes any non-""Police Academy""-type movie better.",The Blair Witch Project

I wish they would have turned it off and saved the audience from this incredibly boring and annoying ordeal.This movie does not deserve the attention that it is getting.

This is a bad movie, plain and simple. How a horror movie that is made up of bad camera work, an underdeveloped story, and definitely not scary be ranked so high is beyond me.  I realize that this is supposed to be like a home movie, but nobody would want to see my own home movies, including myself, if they were as bouncy as this one. This movie started out fine as far as story development is concerned. The beginning is the only thing redeeming about this movie.  There was some narration that actually helped develop the story, but when that ended it killed any chance this movie had of being scary.  A bunch of random events without background knowledge is worthless.  Three people screaming at each other about being lost is not scary.  Noises outside of proper context is not frightening.  Poor camera work is not artistic.  This is a bad movie.",The Blair Witch Project

There is no real blood and gore, no sexy teenager with big bouncing boobs, and no special effects. Don't expect to jump out of your seat, it's not that kind of scary. The movie footage is jerky and bouncy at times but that is part of the magic. If you have a good imagination and aren't as dumb as a rock you will really enjoy this movie. It scared the bejesus out of me. Now for some tips for viewing this movie: 1. Don't sit in the front row. The film can be a little nauseating due to the motion of the cameras. 2. Go to a matinee to see it, less idiots. 3. Pay close attention during the first of the movie... Especially to the interviews with the locals so that you can clue in on the legend. This is essential to totally ""get"" the ending. 4. The first 20 minutes or so are a little slow but pay attention. It picks up speed and the end is great!Go see this movie if you want to be scared in a totally different way.",The Blair Witch Project

Maybe I  built the movie up in my mind to something it wasn't.  Nevertheless, I really was disappointed and don't understand all the hype about this movie.

Back in the days of Mothra, Godzilla, Dracula, Frankenstein etc.  When I watched the Exorcist, I said that's it, that's the most frightening movie I'll ever watch in my lifetime. Now, 20+/- years later, the Exorcist has been defeated. This movie had me entranced from start to finish.  I loved the realism and in the horror scale of 1-10, this movie earns the 2nd 10 I've ever given.  Linda Blair, you're still the queen, but your movie just moved to #2.",The Blair Witch Project

2265,Hadley_,Best Horror Movie in Years - Sequel Please!,10,8 August 1999,"The Blair Witch Project almost defies description, because nothing similar exists to compare it to. Having the actors film themselves was a master stroke. That, combined with the gripping and believable myth behind the plot, make this movie a masterpiece. As a liberal college student, I have much in common with the three characters. I identified totally with them, and felt their pain in the darker moments.The world MUST HAVE a sequel! These film makers need to drop whatever they're doing and start a BWP sequel immediately! : )",The Blair Witch Project
2266,ZunDevil,"Too much hype, too much realism",5,8 August 1999,"You've heard the viewer testimonials.  You've been to the website.  You've seen the ads, and you know the premise.  Upon entering the theater, prepare to experience an incredible letdown in both the horror and story aspects of this film.  The Blair Witch Project almost seems to have fallen prey to its own hype.This is not to say this is a bad film.  The Blair Witch Project has no less than three things working for it that have rarely been seen in recent cinema.  The low-budget advertising campaign and the savvy move of keeping the national number of screens to a minimum were both brilliant marketing schemes.  And clearly, not many recent films have kept pushed the envelope of truth/fiction.  The Blair Witch Project wants you to decide whether this is a true story or not, and one cannot easily make that decision while watching this movie.But who cares?  One problem with realism is the complete lack of creativity and imagination displayed by the movie.  As an exercise, imagine you are camping in the woods with two others to research the supposed existence of a witch.  Think about what could go wrong.  This film takes all those ideas and runs with them, making you say ""I already thought of that"" at just about every turn.  If your imagination is as ""vivid"" as mine, you will feel like you have already seen this movie, which tends to ruin the suspense. Although, the climax is certainly worth the wait, making it the only part of the film that meets, or perhaps exceeds, the hype.Go see the Blair Witch Project for the climax, a scene you will be thinking about for days.  But take the movie (as a whole) as an average horror film with a different edge, and see if you like that edge.  Your mind may be messed with, but it certainly will not be blown away.  This movie is low budget for a reason.",The Blair Witch Project
2267,PsiFi,Proof that a great marketing scam can convince people a bad movie is good,1,13 August 1999,"The Blair Witch Project was definitely NOT what all the hype made it out to be. I suppose if I thought it were real, like many of the poor people out there, I MAY have thought it was scary..... until the actors started talking and I realized that there was no possibility that it could be real. The truth about The Blair Witch Project is that it is a brilliant marketing ploy designed to sell a terrible movie. Without all the advertising hype and fake information, to try to make the movie seem like a real documentary, the movie would just be a really bad home video. I congratulate the movie team for creating web-sites, fake T.V. documentaries, and other propaganda to play off the stupidity of the general public. As propagandists the film makers truly are geniuses bet as film makers they should probably quit while their ahead.",The Blair Witch Project

I think that those people were seriously shorted of an excellent movie.I loved how the directors used a subjective point of view throughout the film... it really brings the audience into the plot.  It hasn't been used for a long time, and it was very natural.I don't think that the movie gave enough information about the spells and meanings of some of the symbols in the movie however. There are short shots of particular objects and writing that are not really explained.  Giving the audience the background information about the power or meaning of each object the characters find would have significantly changed the reaction of the audience.Overall, the movie is one of the best horrors I have ever seen. To anyone who is even remotely interested in seeing this movie, do so in the theaters... it won't be as good on video with the subjective point of view. Before you go, soak up some voodoo/witchcraft information.  Your experience will be 75% more satisfying.",The Blair Witch Project

I won't give anything away if you have not yet seen it, the reviews you will read (as I have) are either hate it or love it so you will need to judge for yourself.  I have recommended it to all I know... Go see it when there will be less people in the theater though...two weight lifting jocks were by me and gave a running commentary that was very distracting. I think the unknown is truly the scariest thing...or perhaps the unknowable? Thats what makes Blair Witch so good. Go...but leave your jaded friends at home.",The Blair Witch Project

I've already seen the worst film I will ever see and it was the Blair Witch Project!! I'm happy for those of you who liked the film, but for me it was pure torture (not even a good ""this is terrible"" laugh). Briefly:  Not scary; Characters had me rooting for whatever was supposed to be in the woods; Only tense moment was fear that someone would pick up the camera at the end and that the movie wasn't really over!!",The Blair Witch Project

He didn't know a thing about the Blair Witch, he actually thought it was a real documentary.  I, on the other hand, had read reviews about it and knew that it wasn't real.  We were both freaked out by it.  We are avid campers and I am glad that summer is about over and we won't be camping for awhile!!  The noises and other things that happen in this movie are intense and creepy.  I agree with many comments here that say that this movie uses your imagination and encourages you to draw your own conclusions about what is out there.Overall I gave it an 8 out of 10.  Pretty scary and creepy.  The ending was a trip!!",The Blair Witch Project

This is interesting as the movie delivers what we had heard about.  Three kids, a camera, a forest, and a myth.  But as it would be in real life, there were some slow boring parts. At various times you could see them doing things that weren't likely to be done.  In a movie with a bigger budget, or real life.The only redeeming part of this movie, aside from some interest due to action near the end is the premise it is based on.  That has encouraged more conversation than the movie itself.  Don't pay 8.50 CAD for the big screen, wait for video.",The Blair Witch Project

I was on edge during the show, but afterwards I was staying at a friends place and I was the last of us to fall asleep and I was freaked. I think the effect of seeing the movie at a midnight showing also helped scare me. It wouldn't have been the same had I left the theater and it was still light outside. I loved this movie and I want to see it again. It is worth it spending 10 bucks to see.

I went in knowing it could be, and it might not be a true story.  No one knew from certain. I just have to say that anyone out in the middle of nowhere for 3 or 4 days and with video equipment and DAT equipment would not be taping the things that happened to them in a life or death situation.  Who would run outside of a tent with a light to show a psycho where they where.  Maybe the first night.  Or run into the grass with lights on the cameras and live to see the next day. Plus who goes so unprepared, what, does no one own a cell phone, or take a bit more food just incase?Heather Donahue played a good over controlling idiot.  She made me want to grab that camera and shove it down her throat.  Maybe that's what she was aiming for in this film.Bottom line......if it was real, it could have had a more bite but since it was a myth and was a bit stupid with reality, I wasn't as thrilled about it.

I am sure that a lot of you out there can agree, that blood and gore is getting boring. Come on, even I was swept in by the hype of this movie, hell, I thought it was real until I saw the ""mock-umentary"" on the Sci-Fi Channel. But, I decided to put the hype aside, and see it anyways. Boy, was I in for a surprise! Yeah, the first half crawled, but it sets up the rest of the movie. If you don't pay attention to the interviews, you will not understand the ending. I thought the acting was superb, that is just what I would do if I was lost in the woods, with weird things happening all around me. The last 20 minutes of the movie had my heart pounding, and my mind wondering, ""what is gonna happen next?"" And that is what the movie is supposed to do, what you DO see is not supposed to scare you, what you DON'T see is what is the scariest. Bottom line: If you are into blood and gore, do not see this movie, see The Haunting, or The Sixth Sense.

I have already recommended it to many of my friends because I thought it was one of the scariest films (or perhaps film-experiences) I have ever seen.  This movie makes you use your imagination to find your own terror-level.  It may not be scary in form (it's not like other horror films with wall-to-wall gore and elaborate plot lines) but it is terrifying in practice.  Imagine reading a book--you put yourself into the story; you find yourself as one of the actors in it. Then, you go to see the movie.  The movies are never as good as the books they are made from because they tell you what to think instead of letting you think for yourself.  This movie is a book on screen.  You become one of the filmmakers.  You feel their exhaustion, their anger, their fear.  I loved it.  I let my imagination run with this movie, and believe me, it took off.

I don't mean the movie, I mean the savvy marketing plan executed by the film's makers and distributors. They actually got me to see this piece of crap, and I gotta tip my hat. Now for the movie itself...It's a cool idea. The legend, the cocky naive kids, the ""cinema verite"" techniques, etc. Hey, I Wanted to see this thing. But it all comes apart in the execution. There are a host of problems, many noted here by others, but for me the biggest problem is that the movie makers didn't give me a reason to care about the characters or what happened to them. Donahue is an annoying brat, which would be fine, except that's *all* she is; the other two characters barely register at all. And they're so stupid! I'm willing to suspend my disbelief somewhat for the purpose of the movie, so I tolerated the otherwise non-sensical dragging around and constant use of the cameras. But these three pinheads walk into the woods without any idea of what they're doing. Umm, anybody know how to follow a watershed downstream? Read a map? Bring a cellphone? Mark a trail? This ain't rocket science.For me the movie basically ended when Mike admitted that he threw the map away. There's no reason given for him to commit such a spectacularly stupid act, and there's no justification for it except to advance the plot and let them all say f*ck another 40 times each. At that point I was just hoping that the supposedly terrifying presence lurking just offscreen would spring forth to devour the three knuckleheads posthaste in order to keep them out of the gene pool and permit me to do something productive with what remained of my evening.What bothered me more than anything was the laziness this evidenced. Glaring weaknesses in structure like this are not that hard to work around -- why not have them find the map torn to bits and stuck in one of those hanging stick figures? At least that would have made *some* sense. If the directors had put half as much thought into the actual movie as they did in marketing it, it might have been decent.I could go on and on, but I have to go watch some paint dry.Evidence of the success of this hype (aside from the fact that it snatched $7 from my pocket) is the persistent belief on the part of some yahoos out there that this is based on actual events. Can someone please, please get these people a life! For myself, I walked into the theatre believing the film was actually going to be entertaining. As H.L.

I personally feel that they are saying it b/c they don't know what else to say, they left the theater b/c they were so afraid, LOL.  The lack of special effects and documentary style of filming is what makes this movie so special.  The filmmakers allow us to use our minds, and that in turn allows the movie to be frightening to everyone, not just those who are scared of blood and guts (Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, etc.)  Overall I can honestly say that this was just about the most enjoyable, and frightening movie going experiences I have ever had...

One warning, however, if you are the type who demands an ending that answers all questions and ties up all loose ends, then this movie isn't for you. You are forced to think and to imagine what happens to the characters, and at the end, you will have more questions that when the movie begins. All in all, the movie is very good, but not quite as good as I've head the movie to be. Some of the things the characters do, I would have done differently had I been in their situation (like not bringing a GPS locator).

2289,mcj-2,Depends on the viewer,10,12 August 1999,"How much a viewer likes this movie depends on his or her personal taste (duh).  If you thought Alien was far better than Aliens, chances are you'd be more inclined to like this movie.  Same with Jaws vs. all the sequels. This movie is all about suggestion.  You never SEE anything, and that lets your imagination runs wild.Another viewer characteristic that makes this movie more enjoyable is the ability to put yourself into the movie characters' situation.  That is what I think makes this the most scary movie I have ever seen.  For example, I think Alien was a great movie, but that situation will most likely never ever happen to me.  Blair Witch, though...I have been camping, and I have heard noises coming from the woods.  I know that can be spooky, even if it goes away immediately.  In those scenes where they were shining the lights on the cameras out the opening in the tent, I felt like I was right there with them, straining to find anything in the blackness.Anyway, I think this is a really great film, because it is the first one to actually scare me.  Most films that attempt to be scary end up just being funny, but not this one.Oh, and one more characteristic that it would help to have to really enjoy this movie...a strong stomach.

Sure, you might have to use your imagination ... but it's kind of hard when you are staring blankly at the giant screen, totally bored.A big thing about this movie is that ""it's scary because of what you can't see rather than what you can"".  That would be just fine and dandy ... except the movie certainly doesn't live up to that expectation.  The ending of the film was not bad, but it sure as heck didn't make up for the hour and fifteen minutes that preceeded it.Frankly, the opening sequence for The Blair Witch Project's website is scarier than the entire film ... and that sure isn't a compliment!",The Blair Witch Project

Also, whatshername's voice screaming ""what the f--- is that!?"" got very irritating.Being someone interested in cameras and stuff, I found myself more interested in the 16 mm they carried throughout the film.  But still, I thought that it was thoroughly enjoyable, being the first horror movie I ever bothered to see.  The format it was done in, they way it was filmed, and the true fear of the actors was beautiful.  SPOILER!!!!  WARNING!!!!  A SORT OF SPOILER AHEAD!!!Although I wanted to not be scared by the movie, and I wasn't at first, I can't wait till school starts so I won't be home alone all day.

Ten minutes into the movie I felt hungover from the constant movement of the camera and I had to keep my eyes closed through the last 80 minutes of the movie just to keep from taking a trip to the restroom.  Motion sickness seemed to be a problem for most of the people in the theater as well.The first 30 minutes of the movie was very slow and the last hour didn't live up to my expectations either.  I wouldn't suggest going to see this movie.  Even if you have a great imagination I don't think The Blair Witch Project could be considered scary.

2297,redfrost,The Scariest Movie I Have Ever Seen,8,18 August 1999,"I just saw this movie last night and I can truly say that it is the scariest movie I have ever seen, and I have seen a fair amount of scary movies. The entire movie is tense even in the daytime, but at night, I don't think my heart has ever beaten faster in my life.  The fact that it was filmed entirely with a home video camera makes it all the more real.  The Blair Witch Project really breaks the sterotype that scary movies are never good and always have a stupid and unrealistic story.  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen also.  Whomever said that scary movies can't be good is really eating his words now.  Absolutly Great Movie.",The Blair Witch Project
2298,acac,(slightly) flawed masterpiece,10,26 October 1999,"(Warning first paragraph may spoil - see the film before reading ANY reviews)OK so they should have followed the river downstream (note to film-makers - rivers sometimes go underground). But some of the criticisms thrown at this new-era defining movie are ridiculous. They didn't take a mobile phone - what into the deep woods where it wouldn't work? They didn't have a GPS system - 3 students in 1994? Surprise surprise, they didn't have a helicopter or Scotty's transporter either. They went south for 12 hours and ended up in a circle  it's difficult enough following a straight line in the dessert, let alone a wood.Suffice to say if you go expecting the likes of Freddie or Scream you will be disappointed, move on to the next multi-million dollar gore fest, predictable, safe and utterly tedious. This film leaks atmosphere, it enthralled the audience I was with - leading to a spontaneous round of applause at the end. Perhaps at first glance it does not sound or look that original, but the dialogue feels real (yes students do swear), the hi-8 footage draws the viewer into believing (or at least suspending disbelief), the never-quite seeing the horror leaves you questioning what is out there. This film is not about blood and guts or special effects; it is about a deep unease with the unknown, fear and ultimately, terror.",The Blair Witch Project

2300,jakew,The WORST Movie EVER!!!!,1,28 August 1999,"This is the first time I have ever written a critique of any movie I have ever seen.  It irritated me enough to put my thoughts in writing. Regrettably, the Mrs. and I saw this  - refugee from a cats litter box - excuse for a movie.  At the end, a lady in the row behind us said: ` For this I paid $8.00?  I could have stayed home and seen much better on TV.' A young lad several rows down, shouted: `This movie SUCKS!'  We heard several other people say: `This movie stinks.'  My son saw this movie in New Jersey, and he told us that there was - at the end of the movie  a chorus of people shouting that they wanted their money back.  My own feelings were that it should have had a rating of PG, for Pure Garbage!  The whole movie was very illogical, dumb, poorly filmed, unbelievable, badly acted, dragged out, had overkill use of the `F' word, was not frightening at all, and had more plot holes than a sieve. I could go on here almost without end; casting well deserved aspersions on this `truly dreadful movie.'  Frankly, I felt like walking out of the theater half way through it.  It was so bad; I nearly lost my humanity for a moment, and was almost happy to see every one die a miserable death in the end.  This `Movie?' itself deserves euthanasia.  My wife says that `joee001's' summary of 9 August 1999 `What a piece of crap' says it all.  The real mystery to us is how over 5,000 people in your rating survey, found this `crap flick' worth any rating higher than a one?  In all fairness, please note that in the voting for this movie, most of the voting shows that the voters either loved or hated this flick.  In our opinion, if you haven't seen this movie yet, DON'T!  Do yourself a favor and save your time and money.",The Blair Witch Project
2301,Original-4,Its scary...that it made it to the big screen...,2,18 August 1999,"I have never seen a story where I cared LESS about the main characters, or wished MORE for them all to suffer a terrible death.  Unfortunately, Blair Witch didn't even provide that catharsis.  Failed psychological ploys, in combination with inane dialog, and a plot line as thin as an anorexic on speed make for a story that would be difficult to watch even WITHOUT the jerky camera work.  While its neat that you get the ""handheld HI-8"" effect, it doesn't lend itself to easy watching on the big screen.  In fact, if you get motion sickness, stay away.  I expected much more from something hyped as one of the greatest thrillers of all time, and I was sadly disappointed. Perhaps ""Three Morons Lost in the Woods"" would have been a more appropriate name for the film.  It would all be worth it if it was at least a little bit frightening, but it even fails at that.  If you want real psychological thrills, rent yourself Psycho or Vertigo and leave the Blair Witch to rest in the woods.",The Blair Witch Project

2303,Ferndahl,"Forget The Exorcist, this is REAL horror!",10,20 October 1999,"Prior to seeing this flick for the first time, Scream was my favourite horror movie.  Now, don't get me wrong, I still love Scream (sequel sucked in a big way - still lookin' forward to 3 though) but with Blair Witch I came to realise the way in which the previously (in my eyes anyway) infallible Scream failed.  Despite the sexy, beautiful girls and cool guys, despite the witty, fun pop culture refs, despite the neat little murder mystery, Scream still spoon-fed the audience, albeit in a more interesting way.  The opening scene with Drew was and always will be an awesome piece of cinema, but at the end of the day, there's a psycho, with a knife, wanting to kill a pretty girl - it's something we've all seen countless times before and if you're a hardened horror fan like myself, something you kinda grow numb to.  It doesn't really have any effect, or at least not the effect the director wants it to have.Blair Witch treats the audience like a sadistic little kid to his younger sister.  He wants to scare her, he loves getting a rise out of her, he knows what buttons to push.  TBWP invites you on a trip where our everyday common fears come into play - most people were at one point of their life or another scared of the dark, or at least wary, some still are.  The horror accelerates in a painfully real way, where we are at first allowed to know the characters and can easily view them as real people, none of them remotely conforming to any movie stereotype, each with faults and shading - we can relate to them and when the **** hits the fan, we feel all the more for them, thus the fear we will feel becomes far more palpable and painful than Scream could ever hope to achieve.I've noticed how, on the IMDB Blair Witch voting page, 10 is, of course the most popular mark, while 1 is the second most.  What can I say, people still need to be spoon-fed, like little babies.  They bitch about how there's no blood or monsters to be seen, how there's too much shaky camera or about the swearing, the arguments.  To these people I say ""feel free to use your brain once in a while - that's what it's there for.""  Oh yeah, and go watch The Haunting.",The Blair Witch Project

2306,JohnS471,An atrocious waste of money!,1,18 August 1999,"Being an avid movie-goer I usually check out every major film to come along. I had heard about the BWP for a while and was looking forward to it.  I did read some reviews people had written on this site but I chose to be skeptical(I am a skeptics-skeptic)  The movie did cause me to feel nauseous because it was filmed with the camera being deliberately shaken to make the film look amateur.  I found myself focusing on the seats in front and the walls and exit signs to reduce my eyestrain...from trying to follow the actors movements on the screen!  The lead actress was repulsive(big ass, and her face looked like the lead actor in that prison movie,  his wife is/used to be S. Sarandon) and did a horrible job acting--actually overacting--trying to appear terrified which wasn't believable.  The other two males acted like your typical stoned/half-baked college kids(they were supposed to).  The movie began with nothing,  had nothing in the middle, and ended with nothing and it made over $100 million!!!  Save your money and rent Evil Dead 2 and get a few good laughs and be entertained--this one is a stinker!!!",The Blair Witch Project
2307,Barley-2,ho hum,1,18 August 1999,"Nothing about this film, seen or unseen, is particularly frightening. As the ""actors"" were freaking out about the ""eerie"" noises around them, I kept thinking, ""Have these people never gone camping in the woods before?"" I'm sorry, but little piles of rocks & dangling twig-people just aren't other-worldly enough to give me the creeps, even if I do find those things beside my tent. And while this is certainly an interesting exercise in improvisational scripting, it's no match for a well-crafted script with a beginning, a middle & an end. Good film-making is decidedly NOT about gratuitous gore or special effects, etc., but it IS about plot & dialogue & the movement of a story. Blair Witch fails to deliver any of these things. It's a much more successful exercise in hype & marketing than film-making.",The Blair Witch Project
2308,Evita-6,"Great Movie, if you are willing to pay attention!",10,19 August 1999,"It really irritates me to read all these summaries trashing THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  The people who write these reviews are the people who go into the movie excepting a slasher movie such as Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, where you don't actually have to pay attention to the dialogue, you can just watch people get killed.  Furthermore, its hard to be scared in a crowded movie theater, especially if you go in there determined not to be scared.  SO FOR ALL YOU PEOPLE WHO ARE DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT TO SEE THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, IT IS A MUST SEE.  IF YOU ARE ACTUALLY WILLING TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE DIALOGUE(SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHATS HAPPENING) AND LET YOURSELF GET INTO IT, IT IS ACTUALLY VERY SCARY.  IT WILL GET TO LATER.

It scared the **** out of me! I hated it!""Perhaps, in an era of big-budget thrills and CGI scares at ever-increasing cost, we needed this film. Yeah, I'll concede that it was NOT the most brilliant work of art I've ever seen. But it serves as a reminder that today's jaded audiences can still be scared. And, to be perfectly clear, I liked it. I'll take a shorter cut, if it could retain the feel - the arguing did seem to drag.

The most scary movie I have ever seen has been The Exorcist, but I would have to say The Blair Witch Project conjured up the most fear. There is an indescribable fear that you get when you watch the last five minutes of this film.

2316,nintendo-3,As horrifying as you allow it to be.,8,23 August 1999,"When I left to the theater to see the Blair Witch Project, I thought it would be so incredibly horrifying that I would have nightmares for days on end.  However, five minutes into the film, I felt completely natural and at ease.  Blair Witch is the kind of movie that you would think would gross you out, but there is surprisingly very little gruesome imagery; most of the film's chills are derived from medieval witchcraft that the film-makers come across; and most of all, it's truly what you DON'T see on the camera that will freak you out.But then again, you won't be really scared until the last ten minutes.  And how scared you'll be depends on your imagination.  The film goes on and on with other things that you find yourself waiting for something to happen. The first half-hour of the film is really just a funny home video (although it is quite enjoyable).  There's quite a bit of unnecessary language, and the camera is consistently shaking up and down for most of the film.  Of course, this makes Blair Witch's characters and presentation very believable.The Blair Witch Project has an interesting approach to the horror genre, it's like NOTHING you've seen before; the satisfying ending will leave on the edge of your seat screaming for more, which makes it a worthy film experience.  If you want to see a big-budget horror-flick with tremendous special effects - where seeing IS believing, then Blair Witch isn't it.  If you want to see a scary home video or something that's different from other films, then I highly recommend it.  This is a true horror classic.",The Blair Witch Project

Well, the Blair Witch Project proves that you can have horror WITHOUT computerized special effects...REALLY GOOD HORROR.  The best horror is that which reflects the true darkness each of us harbors deep down in the pits of our souls.  It is this darkness that really comes out to play in the movie.  Sure, the plot sounds like a Grimm Brothers fairy tale (imagine Hansel and Gretel lost in the woods, til they find the witches house).  But the story is nowhere near two-dimensional.  Instead, you watch as the characters slowly pass from annoyance, anger, and exhaustion to dread, paranoia, and yes, fear.  That is the real theme of the movie.  The plot is so much window dressing.  Pay attention to the very beginning of the movie, as it proves pivotal in understanding the bizarre (and TERRIFYING) ending.  The plot is interesting, and you wonder if the legends really are true, but the most effective part of the movie is the level of self-identification with the characters.  A warning though: you may sit and laugh during the whole movie, but when the full effect of the ending hits you, I promise you too will be scared of the woods.  I did not watch this in the theater myself, but rented it on video.  Watching it with the lights off was bad enough, but lying in bed that night watching the shadows on the wall was worse.

The story was well conceived and the sheer reality of the filming effects helped to make it more believable. The acting was fine given the premise of how the directors operated (limited scripts and a lot of adlibbing)and the scariest movies are the ones that really make you think and disturb you for days afterward (which this one did). The shaky camera technique and the disappointment of never seeing much of anything kept the movie from being more enjoyable. I think even a glimpse of what they were seeing would have been sufficient. I view this film as being much like an episode of the X-Files, but not even as good as some of those. At least with the X-Files there's a payoff...and although things on that show are not often wrapped up in a tidy package that's easy for everyone to live with, there is a creepy chill that stays with you, makes you think and long to see more.

2335,Effygirl,GREAT MOVIE,10,11 September 1999,This is a totally great movie. I can't see why anyone would dislike it. If they know the facts behind the documentary it is a totally scary movie and totally one that makes you sit up and watch. I would love to know more about it but that is one thing that makes it so good. You really have to decide for your self if it is real or not. Did 2 kids go out looking for info one this place and never return?? By all reports that is exactly what happened. Therefore what happened to them???? One that you have to decide for yourself.

Moreover, I got so bored that the only thing I waited for was the end of the movie. Although I must accept that the idea was quite good and that the film did had the chance to become one of the most terrific ones in cinema history, to my opinion it hasn't reached its objective. The cause of my complaint is that I was promised fear and I couldn't find it in any moment.

2339,dgdixon,Sorely disappointed local demands a refund.,1,22 September 1999,"Spoiler Alert: This film contains the scariest heaps of pebbles and most menacing twig-wrapped chicken giblets ever to grace the screen. Real Spoiler Alert: Nothing happens in *The Blair Witch Project*. Nothing.There's no witch, there's no suspense, no chills, nada. There are three grubby-looking drama queens running around in the woods, painfully aware that they've been instructed to scare up a little fear. It's possible to conjure terror out of the ether; Dreyer's *Vampyr* did it more than 60 years ago. But there has to be some sort of intelligence behind the camera, if not in front of it. Horror is a genre that depends on phrasing; it thrives on tension and release, created on film much as they are in a piece of music. The structure could have come together in the editing room, but it didn't.Nothing in the movie is phrased properly. Mike freaks out much too soon, bringing disagreements to a head before they're motivated. The tedium of our unhappy campers fails to translate into a sense of their tiredness. Heather emerges as a doggedly faithful chronicler, improbably refusing to relinquish the camera, though she (and Josh) record nothing cinematically effective. Everything's a stolid closeup or a jerky pan. There's only one advancing shot that gives any sense of an ""out there"" that could be inhabited by unseen evil. The eye simply bounces off the rest of it. Not that we ever believed in Heather's film credentials. In the beginning, she undermines the impression that she's a documentarian by failing to conduct a single successful interview. She interrupts each of her subjects before she gets a usable quote. By picture's end, we want to see her get it in the neck, but, alas, are denied even that pleasure.The actors are clearly at a loss. They never refer to ""the map"" when ""the f**king map"" will do. There's nothing wrong with a little profanity, even a lot of it. But our trio uses it desperately, lamely attempting to create an atmosphere of urgency by ""f**king"" their dialogue to death.I live four miles from Wheaton, MD, where some of the early scenes were filmed. I saw the movie in the theater closest to Seneca Creek State Park. Intrigued by the concept and bolstered by the hype, I was rooting for the home team. But I feel ripped off.

I am certain that The Blair Witch Project is in fact a marketing test. Thought out carefully by some brilliant marketing manager who has made a bet amongst his friends that he could market anything with his skills.They gave him the impossible mission. Market a lousy, boring, independent movie made over an week-end by some collage friends. This marketing genius sat many long nights thinking about how this would be done. Then it came clear to him... HYPE, hype the movie on the net. Start with some false rumors about how great this movie really is over the Internet and take it from there.Obviously this worked far over all expectations. The movie became a super hit, almost as big as a Blockbuster and with only a 60 000 dollar budget. This movie really is something special, I have never seen a worse movie. And I have seen a lot of bad movies. The thing that bothers me the most is that people keep falling for the HYPE saying that it is so scary and well thought out. It is noting scary about Blair Witch except the HYPE. I can only draw comparison to Germany 1939. Everyone there fell for the HYPE.This really shows only one thing. It could happen again.Blair Witch is shot with a first person view through out the whole movie. It is shaky camera work, lousy acting, bad script and a boring result. The only persons that can be afraid of this movie must be 12 years old and never been out in the forest or in the cinema. The last 30 seconds of the movie have some excitement but that is all... and last time I checked that was not enough... but hey... maybe that changed too.All the people that comes out from the cinema saying that they enjoyed the movie must have watched it with their eyes wide shut. Wake-up and smell the coffee. You have watch the HYPE FACTOR and you got crushed.No one says it better than Chris Rock at the MTV music awards.  - Someone is walking around with 59 000 dollars in their pocket. - I hope so, cause I could have made this movie with 1000 dollars and a free week-end, says I.",The Blair Witch Project

Speaking about Heather: already after 15 minutes I began to feel the urge to shove the camera through Heathers' throat so she would finally shut up, what an annoying girl. She surely gets my vote for worst ""actress"" of the year.If you like movies where half of the script exists out of actors saying ""F**k"" and ""Jesus"" and get scared by a pile of rocks, this might be a film for you.

Where were the scary parts?

2357,Paul-21-UK,"No Spoilers, Just The Facts...",5,31 October 1999,"Oh dear.  What a calamity.  This movie had so much promise, so much potential greatness - so what happened?  Why did this excellent on paper movie, not do the business on film?I know exactly why - a weak script, average performances and too much pre-release hype.  To go into more detail..Before I begin, the movies as most people clearly know is far from original - we have seen this done before and far better in Cannibal Holocaust, so we are not seeing anything new, irrespective of what Hollywood will tell us.
OK, the initial premise is good - it makes you want to see it, and to see how the future of these guys unfolds.  However, the main problem lies within - you never feel as if you are with these people.  At times, you feel yourself rooting for the Blair Witch.  I could have produced very similar results if I took 2 friends camping ANYWHERE in England, left a Hi-8 camera running throughout.  There was a severe lack of substance in this movie - although you may think that a lot happened as you leave the aisles, nothing really did.There were some good moments in this, and as a whole, I was intrigued to see how things would unfold - at several points, I found it difficult to take my eyes off the screen.  However, the other 75 minutes of this movie left the viewer wanting, and delivered nothing.  As we know, this is an amateur production - myself being an amateur film-maker, I spent a lot of the time figuring out how shots were produced - but this also was it's major downfall.  Scenes of argument and confrontation, always seemed 2 seconds away from total hilarity, as if the actors were ready to roll around the floor laughing.

Get more lost. Get dead. Oh, and swear lots. And lots.And that really is it. I spent the entire film wishing that they could at least point the camera forward not at a point 6"" in front of their feet, that maybe they'd breathe a little quieter, so we could hear the noises that were supposed to be so scary, and that most of the wandering around in the daytime had been cut.Oh, but the last 3 seconds made me jump. The rest of it just made me (and the rest of the cinema) laugh. However. As another reviewer has already pointed out, why didn't they just follow the river?

I was amazed that they could be that terrified and still have the awareness to keep the camera rolling and pointed in the right direction.  Let's face it running through the woods in the middle of the night is tough enough, but to hold a video camera up to head level and try to do it would be crazy.If they had wanted to have done this right (not that it really would have helped.  I don't think anything could have done that), they should have combined the movie and tv special.  Put clips from the TV at the beginning of the movie so you get a sense of what was going on, what happened, and who the blair witch was.  Then go into the ""recovered"" film.

A willingness to allow your imagination to submerge itself deep into the narative is the key to enjoying this film. Let your darkest fears and anxieties run riot and ""Blair Witch"" will scare you. Watch it with a cynical attitude and you wil leave the cinema smug but disappointed.This is an excellant psychological horror that in the main shows nothing but suggests everything.

2364,omeletboy,One of a kind,10,9 November 1999,"Reviewed by: Steve LosieFrom the opening shot in until the last heart-pounding scene, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is breathtaking. Its style, is easiness, its truth permeates every shot, every inch of this movie. Simply, it is a masterpiece-perhaps the best horror movie ever made. The plot is fairly simple: Josh, Heather, and Mike are film students making a documentary on the Blair Witch, a local legend in Burkittsville, Maryland. They begin by interviewing several locals, asking them their opinion of the Blair Witch. Before long, they are in the woods where the Blair Witch legend has it that the witch haunts. They shoot a few scenes and then head to a cemetery. Days pass, they don't find the cemetery, and realize that they are lost. Meanwhile, every night they are being scared to death by different odd instances: it starts out with eerie rock poundings and escalates to screaming childrenand then worse. The ending does not provide any twist, but is exhilarating none the less. The writers and directors took an old rehashed idea (""Witches are scary!""), but turned it into an experience. By using handheld cameras, the movie takes you in as a participant. Along with Josh, Heather, and Mike, you too are lost. You become confused, frightened, and weary. One of the most amazing aspects of the movie is its character development. Most of the dialogue was ad-libbed, but the characters transform throughout the movie as the haunting Blair Witch experience eats away at them. From the start, Heather is who we identify most with. She narrates: every thing she sees, we see, and what she hears, we hear. Josh seems to be the laid-back dude who will keep his cool no matter what happens. Mike is the most flappable. He is skeptical and jittery the moment they walk into the forest. As the Blair Witch begins haunting, there are many role reversals. Their very first scare, Mike won't even leave the tent. As time wears on, Josh ""loses it."" A combination of his weariness, the ceaseless hiking, and the horrible nights finally get to Josh and he nearly gives up midday. Heather insists they keep going, but Mike wants to make sure they keep their sanity. Later, Heather bursts into tears. She is emotionally drained. Flipped-out Josh begins pointing the camera on Heather, and she blurts, ""It's all I have left."" They aren't making a movie anymore; they need to keep it together. Through all this, Mike seems to unite them. Whenever a fight occurs or a nervous night wears on, Mike takes control to see that they are okay in the morning. By the last scene, Mike has taken command of the group from Heather, as he is the only one left who hasn't ""lost it."" Some of the highlights of the movie include Mike's admission that he threw the map in the river and the ensuing fight, Heather's tear-filled confessional (which should go down as one of the most personal and truthful monologues in movie history), and the last scene in the spooky old house. A twist here and a twist there keep you on your toes. Still, the way that the movie was made make all the difference. You forget that this is a fake. It feels real. It is real. Where most horror movies work by keeping you on your toes, waiting for what will happen next, this film does the opposite. It utilizes the fear of the unknown. Every night, they know what is coming. They just wait. Day after day, and everything feels so lost and helpless. There is no way out. It is only a matter of time until the inevitable hits. ""The Shining,"" for instance, works by pitting good directly against evil. Nearly every suspenseful moment relies on the fear, ""Can he/she get out of there in time?"" ""The Blair Witch Project"" has an element of the fear (""Will they get out of the woods in time?"") but that soon fades. Other questions are raised, such as ""Will it come back tonight?"" , ""Will we ever find our way out?"", ""Who is chasing us?"", and ""What will happen to us?"" The film works on multiple levels, as well as being an artistically beautiful vision carried out. It is, perhaps, the best picture of 1999. Heather Donahue's performance is particularly outstanding, while the creators-Eduardo Sanchez and David Myrick-deserve nominations for both ""script"" and directing. They took a leap into making a very experimental film, and came out on the other end with one of the most original and exciting movies of all time.",The Blair Witch Project

I think those who have not enjoyed it might have been expecting the usual serving of special effects, a menacing soundtrack and slick editing. There is also that group of horror fans who approach each film as if it was some macho challenge where they are determined not to get scared. The Blair Witch Project is amazing because it does not relay on the usual ingredients but still manages to deliver. I watched this in a plush cinema with a group of friends, however, I think it would work even better if I'd seen it at home with no one else in the house.

To those who have not seen this movie, make sure that you watch the beginning. If not, then you won't get the movie. The beginning tells you about the things that the Blair witch has done to others and explains the events that happen later in the movie. If you don't see this part you will become confused!

When it seems their wish is just about to come true, the one-time jovial banter, cockiness, and ""machismo,"" soon turns into utter desperation. It is scary. It is eerie. And, it is troubling.

After I saw the DVD release in a video library and a short discussion with the employee (""C'est pas mal, Il faut éprouver l'ambience"") I decided to take as the 4th to loan. Take three get one for free. So I could at least say that I didn't pay anything to watch it. What I got to see was really horror to me. I've never seen a film of less quality before that. Does the young US population really speak like that. I really started to count the words like ""f**k"" and ""s**t"" but after 500 I stopped...poor US culture. Another disappointment was the story that could told in three lines. ""Small groupe of highly educated Americans go in the woods with a map. Because they can't read it the can't find the way out and have delusions-probably drug withdraw"". Actually I fell asleep watching this ""movie"". I admit that this happened with other films before, but it was the first time that I didn't retake the ""overslept"" chapters and in the end I didn't regret it. What does the film leave behind to me. Only the regret to have lost less than one hour of my life (I was sleeping the rest of it) and it didn't really improve my views on American (Beauty) society. If you there over the sea like this kind of holiday video that much, I will buy a camera and present my own in the cinema. At least it proved one thing. In the USA anything is possible.

It is refreshing to note that money, special effects and big names are no substitute for a good story, good acting and fantastic direction.  The suspense gradually builds and eventually seems to exude from the screen and grab you somewhere in the chest until the shear horror of the characters situation hits you.  The picture and sound quality are poor due to the financial restrictions of the project but they just serve to enhance the feeling of realism generated by some superb acting.  This may be a low budget effort but having seen it, I know for a fact that no amount of special effects or big name actors would have enhanced this movie.  I saw this film three weeks ago and I still cant get the ending out of my head, what a clever film this is and you must do it justice by viewing it in a dark room and on your own and leave the rest to your imagination.",The Blair Witch Project

I'm one of those that loved it.First, the movie has this ""feeling"" of reality, that convincing look, that strange resemblance with the everyday people and live. I found that kind of ""ambience"" in only one more feature: The Simpsons TV series, although for completely different reasons.In the Simpsons, i think that the sounds and the voice acting were extremely reality-inducing.In TBWP, every part of it (picture, sound, acting, improvising) transpires a strange sense of real life happenings, that no special effects can buy...The movie is quite slow for some time, i must admit. But thats part of its ""magic"": the viewer must be given the change to ""relate"" with the characters, to know then, to care for them.I think that it didn't work for some people, but then again, some people loved Holywood's Godzila, which show us that we are all different from each other... :)Anyway, the last 20 or 15 minutes are the most dense and mind blowing piece of movie that i've seen for quite some time... i actualy got scare a couple of times, even though we don't see much ""explicities"" on the screen. Its our own mind that scare us.Just to finish this lenghty review, i would like to say that the ending is just p-e-r-f-e-c-t, a wonderfull climax to those last 20 minutes of adrenaline and worries.My advice?

2397,steves97,"Loved it, but you might hate it",8,21 June 2000,"Like most movies, whether or not someone likes TBWP will usually depend on what they're looking for.  Many people enjoy horror movies because of the special effects, gore, shocks, and, in some cases, the high production value.  Since TBWP came from a small independent film company that cost less than a hundred grand to make, can a moviegoer really expect all that and have a good time?  I honestly don't think so.Myrick and Sanchez had a terrific idea for a film: make a frightening mock documentary that was supposed to look like it was done by some amateur college students.  Some people seem to be under the impression that the movie was about the witch, when what it really was about the mental and emotional breakdown of the three film students.  I feel that once viewers could accept the low production values and the improvised script, only then could they deal with Heather, Josh, and Mike.  Until they do that, the film would never work for them.I just put myself in their position:  I'm lost in the woods, I'm tired, I'm hungry, and I've got the added stress of returning borrowed equipment.  The weather is getting colder, it rains just enough to make life miserable, and something is waking me up each and every night.  Now, I'm exhausted, grouchy, scared, and I having troubles thinking clearly.People might have hated Heather because they she was bitchy and annoying, but all three of them had their moments, good and bad. Many people might have also hated the fact that not everything was explained to them, and that they never got to see the Blair Witch.  Many other people may have resented Artisan Entertainment's marketing campaign, although they can't deny just how effective it was.  All the filmmakers and actors asked was that filmgoers understand the spirit that was intended; without it, they knew the film couldn't work for anybody.As you might already tell, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  What Haxan Films managed to do with what they had is not only revolutionary, but is also inspirational to independent filmmakers everywhere.  I found the backstory interesting, the plotline well thought out, and the characters extremely developed, considering the lack of structure and guidelines within the film.

You might not like it, especially if you were expecting the formula, but if you are looking for something fresh and creative AND very very scary, I can recommend this one highly.  The concept -- the actors actually filmed most of the footage since they are supposed to be making a documentary -- is brilliant.  I think some might under-estimate this film because it looks amateurish -- but that's why it works so well!  Afraid of the dark?  Half the film is black, threatening, night footage.

And maybe if it had actually been original and realistic it would have actually been scary. But this movie did nothing different than any other typical horror movie. Stupid kids can't keep it together to stay alive and get out of the woods. I was glad they were killed.

A lot of viewers were upset about the fact that the killer witch was never shown. I personally think that sometimes things are best unseen or unsaid. That is why I think this film would of been a very decent scary horror film if the movie was just filmed regularly. Instead of three Idiots just filming their way through deep into a woods, and actually pretending they got lost, and killed one by one by a witch, making the viewers believe the footage was real and they were really missing, never seen again. The part that made me laugh was a scene in that movie when they were supposedly lost, You could see a gap into the trees witch lead to a visible road. The plot had the right idea. The acting would of made it by. The filming was just pathetic.",The Blair Witch Project

2417,stellablue325,Once and for all....is it real or not?,7,19 October 2006,"I am confused. I would like to know one way or the other from someone who knows FOR SURE if the Blair Witch Project was real or not. I saw it in the theater when it came out...but I also bought it on video and watched it again last night. It had a short news-like video that came with the movie itself. In it were news clips of the three of them disappearing and a guy talking about how the film reels were found buried in the rubble of that house in the woods. I am having a really hard time figuring out whether or not it is real. I thought that it was real actual footage that they took before they came up missing...and that they are still missing...and that the movie was made by whoever found the film and picked up where the three of them left off...which would explain why there is a crew and a producer and such. Is that incorrect? Even if the whole thing was made up, it is still a scary movie that was well-made...but I just want to know the truth! So did it really go down the way that the film leads you to believe, or was the entire thing just a pretend thing that is entirely fiction? Are those three actors/students/whatever still alive or not? I hate being confused, someone please help my mind stop racing about it, will you? e-mail me at: stellablue325@yahoo.com Thanks",The Blair Witch Project

Its not the low budget that bothered me but the fact that it was so obvious that this whole thing is a set up. Its obvious that Heather set it all up and I reckon she did the other 2 in and is probably walking the streets somewhere still alive and well. Although I don't doubt the other 2 guys were genuine if people think that this is all real than people are still gullible these days. I mean really lets look at the facts. At the end of the movie they walk into a hut that is supposedly burnt to the ground????? I have no doubt it was not the original hut they made it out to be and probably one that Heather already knew about. And did anyone else notice that whenever they found something it was conveniently near Heather. Like the rocks for example, they just happened to be right outside Heather's tent. And of course the stick figures... yep Heather again.

2425,sweet_mate88,The Blair Witch Project Review,8,7 January 2007,"The Blair Witch Project Review - Oliver Sequeira. BWP is a great film shot on a low budget, and this amongst others is why i class it as such a great film. The film is about three young film makers, Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard and Michael Williams who set out to find out more about the myth of the Blair Witch and venture to the place in which the supposed being is meant to have once lived. It starts with the trio documenting themselves and preparing for their trip down to Burkettsville in Maryland. As the film progresses the trio begin interviewing locals and ask general questions about the place but as the trio dig deeper and enter the woods to find out the truth for themselves, they find that they are unwelcome and aren't to be taken to too kindly. The intentional Hype surrounding the film brought its fame and i believe its success was largely based upon this, although it must be said that the film is good and is a shining example of how successful independent filmaking can still be.",The Blair Witch Project
2426,tomcartwright1988,Blair Witch Project,7,10 January 2007,"I have watched the Blair Witch Project numerous times and have come to the conclusion that considering the budget it was made on it is a very good film. It is not the scariest horror film of all time but it will make you shiver. The hand held cameras can start to irritate one after a while but if your a film lover then it is definitely worth watching. The film uses loud screams and dark lighting to scare the audience into the back of their seat. When the first came out the viewers believed that it was real until the truth behind it was released. All characters are interesting and are well acted. The story is about three teenagers who are filming a school project, they disappear into the woods looking the Blair witch legend. All three are killed by her and the footage is found a year later. It is not a gory film but by not seeing the violence it makes it scarier because you have to imagine it.",The Blair Witch Project
2427,apdent,Misunderstood...,7,29 October 2001,"I totally skipped this two years ago when it first came out, based on the (first) super positive buzz and (second) on the following super negative buzz. Anything that's so hyper-exposed is something I generally don't have interest in.SO, when I caught the flick on the idiot box the other night, I was genuinely surprised at how effective the film was at fulfilling it's relatively modest goals with so little in the way of standard movie making ""stuff""...like props, sets, a script, FX, decent sound; really, like the stuff you get with even a modest budget.Understanding that the film had a 20G budget and was basically made by the three actors themselves with no script (in fact nothing but their backpacks and film and camping gear), I believe the performances and gradual and effective building of suspense was remarkable. None of the characters is particularly likeable, but they're also not in any way two-dimensional or unbelievable. They're real people, an effect of the film being largely ad-libbed along the way, with a minimum of guidance by the producers in the form of notes left at the campsite every morning.Sure there was stuff in the performances that didn't quite hit the mark (I would give an example but don't want to be accused of ""spoiling""), but those that focus on the imperfections are missing the point: this is a film that makes a goal of examining our most basic, animal fears; the frehman year of college ghost stories or the ""monsters in the closet"" that we've all at one time or another experienced and had some kind of reaction to. This is a terrific ""bump in the night"" film that is most remarkable for what it achieves without the aid of any kind movie magic; it is creativity personified.",The Blair Witch Project
2428,tanita-5,Absolute garbage but scary garbage.,8,2 September 2007,"Making a fictional tale look like a real journal left by someone, who died in a strange way and knew they will not live long enough to tell there story is tradition in literature (Edgar Allan Poe's ""Found in the bottle"" for example) but we hardly ever see films like that, I've heard about ""The Cannibal Holocaust"" but never had a chance to see it. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a nice attempt to convince the audience that they are watching a document and for that I give the first point. The document is made by three students: Heather, Josh and Mike, who inspired by an urban legend about a mysterious baby killer known as the Blair Witch set off the woods of Maryland with cameras. There plan is simple: film some interviews with the locals, film the forest, get back home before the end of the weekend and remember the whole thing as a great adventure. They only manage to accomplish the first two points, for when they try to get back to the car they get lost in the woods, the map disappears and something - the Blair Witch? - is after them. The film was promoted as an account of true events. I am sure that people who believed that this really happened, saw one of the most frightening things ever. But what is left for those who know this fiction? Not much really: the film's got the quality of home made movies, the plot reminds me of ghost stories, I wrote in my junior high days, the whole idea that one can get lost in a forest these days is ridicules- just follow a stream until you reach civilization-and the characters aren't particularly complex or interesting. Frankly this film is a peace of junk, which leaves anyone who has seen it with an impression that they can do something as good. I'd love to criticize it all the way but I can't. Why not? Maybe because I found this movie really scary, moving and memorable. The closer the characters were to their horrible end, the more I was dreading that moment. From the beginning we are focused on the three of them, we see everything from their point of view and can witness their change from a bunch of fun loving kids to desperate, angry, frighten people. We see them jumping to each others throats and comforting each other. The film really shows us what must be going on in the mind of someone, who heard some creepy stories, got lost in a strange place and feels that theirs life is endangered. I said the characters aren't complex but I don't have a problem with that, as I began to treat them as real people who don't deserve to die - interesting or not. That makes a huge difference between BWP and gore horrors like ""Hills Have Eyes"" where people are just peaces of meat with ought to be torn by the bad guys and I couldn't care less who dies. As for the amateur cinematography, it makes this film different and unique (although I am glad most movies aren't made like that) and I always believed that black and white are the best color's for horrors. I am not sure whatever this film is so good or modern horrors are so bad and I don't care. If you want to see something scary and don't mind the shaking camera, see this.",The Blair Witch Project

The reason the ending makes sense is because in the beginning they were talking about a guy who lived in that town a long time ago, who would kill little children. He would kill the kids in pairs and make one stand in a corner as he ruthlessly killed the other one. It only makes sense as to why Mike was standing in the corner. He was killing Heather, who had followed Mikes voice to the basement. Mike simply complied with the killer. Josh probably only disappeared first because they were in a group of three, and the killer only killed in pairs of two. The killer only ""killed"" Josh to lead the other two to him, so he could kill them... I don't know about you, but it makes perfect sense if you look at it that way.",The Blair Witch Project

2435,nerdsunited363,"Creating a school documentary, a group of students go in over their heads.",10,20 July 2007,"""The Blair Witch Project"" is undoubtedly, unquestionably, flawlessly the most creative horror film in history. It takes on the concept of deception and friendship, tormenting us with its ability to make us wonder, as the three protagonists are baffled, attacked, and ultimately, fall victim to the demon in the film. ""Blair Witch"" displays three college students, hoping for nothing but a good grade and some fun along the way, who create a documentary on a local ghost story. They interview people who claim to have seen or experienced the presence of that ghost, commonly known as the blair witch. The groups leader feels she needs more though, and alongside her fellow classmates, ventures into the forest, where the witch is claimed to lurk. The terror starts slightly, and almost unnoticeably with small fragments from the interviewees tales. From there, they grow, into late night catastrophe, hearing footsteps, screams, and experiencing voodoo like symbolism. From the second, the team enters the forest, we become tense, waiting for a nightmarish feat to be done upon our three, hopeless characters. The movie travels down a twisting, turning road of betrayal, uncertainty, and overall humanism. It's realism in cinematography, screen writing, and acting, makes it an even more superb film experience for, in the words of Hitchcock, ""Our terrifying delight"". It's a movie that will haunt our lives for the rest of time.",The Blair Witch Project

Moreover, there is a clear lack of ideas. The plot and the scenes that are supposed to be scary are ridiculous and banal. It's not really the fact of being home-made. There are home-made movies far better than this and with a lot more of ideas.The only explanation of its commercial success is, in my opinion, the huge advertising campaign and the smart abuse of the ""urban legend"" voices that the authors their-selves spread around.",The Blair Witch Project

The whole map debacle I'd say is the high point of the movie and quite frankly I couldn't stand to hear the word map or another swear once more after 15 seconds into the argument.The ending I don't even want to mention, pure disappointment...

2439,dyl_d_r,"Thrilling, absorbing, and sh*t scary!",8,8 October 2007,"With no blood and gore, no disgustingly disturbing CGI monsters, and no shocking moments to 'jump off your seat' the average horror film watcher would flick this film to the side without a second glance. However, so fresh and new was the way in which The Blair Witch was shot, and so convincingly acted by the three characters, that The Blair Witch Project makes a very chilling and disturbing horror.There is no way that this film would have been as successful as it was without its cunning yet controversial promotion campaign. Cinemas filled on the opening week, full of audiences expecting to see what they thought was real footage, found a year after the three main characters had disappeared in the woods down in Burkettsville, Maryland. The way in which The Blair Witch was shot, no matter what critics say, only added to the horrific experience. Even though I knew this was fake footage the hand-held camera dragged me right into the three characters bleak position, leaving me to ponder what I would do if in their shoes. The use of the two cameras, with only one camera having sound, proved very effective. In the last scene (without giving anything away) the use of one camera seeing the action while the other camera picks up the sound of the same action creates an even more weird, confusing and sickening noise. The noises heard in the nights sound so unfamiliar that it is hard to connect them with anything comforting, while the scene where the tent is pummelled by 'something' while Heather screams ""What the F**k is that!?"" leave your heart thudding and your brain working double time in an attempt to make out what is going on.The most impressive component of this film is the way the audience are forced to use their own imagination. Never before in a horror has the whole film been based around the unknown, leaving the audience to create their own image of what the 'hunter/hunters' may be. This image created in the audiences head can be much more horrific than any CGI monster.As you can already tell I thoroughly enjoyed this film, finding it hard to pull my eyes away, dreading what was to come as each new night bought a new horror. I would suggest this film to anyone, as long as you don't mind losing your ability to spend a night camping in the woods.",The Blair Witch Project

I've seen episodes of Scooby Doo that were scarier,  & pornos that had better plots & character development. If you want to see a truly disturbing psychological horror film, watch Repulsion or Peeping Tom. If you want to see a scary supernatural film with innovative cinematography, rent Suspiria or Kwaidan.

2453,HAPPYDAVES,The Artisan Marketing Project,1,10 December 2002,"SPOILER:The Blair Witch Project is NOT real, in fact, people, it isn't even a good film, let alone a horror classic.  Classic horror films don't need a marketing scheme (brilliant as it may have been) to lure teenagers onto the website months before the film is released pretending that it is actually based on real events. First of all, if it was based on real events, it would not be shown in movie theatres; it would be a police record. Second, there was no UNCUT version that many people were led to believe: it's just a MOVIE. The promotional gimmicking that Artisan did prior to release was a stroke of genius; unfortunately the movie did not live up to the hype. If you make an independent movie, at least have SOMETHING happen. The camera work was so deplorable even if there was SOMETHING there in the woods, you wouldn't have seen it anyhow. The acting was unbearable; the ending was non-climatic and made me realise that teenagers were actually PAYING money to see this uninspired piece of horse manure.",The Blair Witch Project

But in my way home, chatting about it with my boyfriend, I finally understood the end of the movie, and I came out in goose flesh. So I think is a good horror film, in the line of Ringu.

2460,Tribaltwat-lover,I was so... bored.,2,16 May 2003,"'The Blair Witch Project' was one of THE film phenomena of 1999. It managed to do something that few 'horror' films do - audiences were enraptured and critics applauded. Well done. The film was original in its approach and atmosphere was quickly projected. Unfortunately this seems to be all the film has going for it.Spoilers herein.Centering on three young people making a documentary about a local myth in order, it seems, to find out whether there is any truth in it, the film follows the protagonists into woods around which the 'Blair Witch' myth centres. They hear noises in the night, see some blobs of light and get lost in the woods. Soon, they begin to become agitated with one another sporadically, and tensions rise within the group. One of them disappears and leaves his teeth behind. The pair left behind worry for their friend and follow his voice to an empty house where they get killed. Boo-hoo.My summary may be only skeletal, and biased by my distaste for the film, but it gives one an idea of how inherently awful the plot is. Of course, plot is not everything, as so many have proved before, but unfortunately the film also suffers from a terrible script. The characters, while not suffering from one-dimensionalism, fail to convince because they seem so utterly motiveless in everything they do or say. There is some improvisation, which utterly fails to convince due to the chronically opaque acting during the second half of the movie. Development seems totally absent. The closest thing is the repetitive structure of increasingly emotionally tense days followed by increasingly noise-filled nights. Unfortunately this is all that happens. The emotion merely increases and the noises merely get louder.Much of the 'footage' at night is punctuated by long moments in which the viewer merely sees a blank screen and listens to some heavy breathing (and wonders why they were foolish enough to PAY for the privilege). When finally, the plot moves along somewhat, it is exceptionally dull. The characters supposedly begin to 'lose it' and become feral enough to begin running around screaming, jerking around their camcorder just a little bit more than necessary. They enter a house, scream some more and lose sight of each other before dying.But, alas, I have explained why the bad constituents are so awful far enough, I hope. Now I should perhaps state why the good parts don't work. Firstly, the film's original approach. The pretense that the film is 'footage' left behind serves to allow the camera to be extremely subjective. One would surmise that this would draw the viewer in to the picture, but it in fact alienates the viewer due to the camera's own self-consciousness. Presumably this is because the actor's apparently filmed much of the footage themselves (or so I am told). Whether the directors wished to alienate the viewer intentionally I don't know, but it does not work with the hyper-personal nature of the film.Secondly, the films evocation of atmosphere. This is the one thing that the film does very well. Very quickly the viewer's mind is filled with ideas of witchcraft, the supernatural etc. The power of the horror genre lies in its ability to take one's fears and twist them into something worse inside your head. This film doesn't do that. It merely continues those fears' natural proliferation in a boring manner.I will not recommend another film, but rather suggest that you think about the supernatural, or demons, or whatever, and then go and sit in the living room late at night with the lights off. It will be a wholly more interesting experience.2 out of 10",The Blair Witch Project
2461,jessica-cunningham,Brainwashing spectators with something so lazy,1,27 August 2012,"'The Blair Witch Project' is much like a polished dog turd. It doesn't matter the reviews, or box office ratings, it is still a dog turd. It is perhaps the laziest film EVER created! Enduring the terrible acting, dialogue, and perhaps the entire storyline, I had high hopes that there would be a plot twist. But no, I expect even the studio gave up with it.What is worse, is that people will agree to this film being 'a true horror', by agreeing to some intellectual banter of it being a new style of production, just to feel like a true horror buff, and to fit in with the crowd.If you believe this film to be worth anything above 3 stars, you are either the wimpy horror buff, or the starving intellectual.",The Blair Witch Project
2462,CCFilmFan,"I finally forced myself to watch this, and I'm glad I did.",8,15 March 2015,"Let me first say that I almost always hate the 'found footage' type of horror film because, let's face it, you're fooling no one. It's just a cheap and easy method to add some scare to the audience by attempting to make them believe that what they're watching actually happened and, although unlikely, could potentially happen to them.But TBWP was different, although it's a clearly fictional plot, I got really into it. The acting that's been criticised as 'amateurish' for me, made the movie. You're meant to believe that this trio are making their own documentary, so their acting is going to be that of amateurs and, for me, Donahue Leonard and Williams all did a fantastic job of portraying this to the audience. With the addition of the hand-held camera style of shooting, it all comes together to really make you feel like you're in the woods with them.The storyline is a great idea and very original, but I can see why others hate it. If by watching a horror movie you're looking to jump out of your seat or see something gruesome then no, this isn't for you. But the spikes of suspense created in this film makes you really on edge and even though you know from the start what happens to the three characters, you're more and more anxious as to how it all happens as the film goes on.A definite must-see for any horror movie lover, 8/10.",The Blair Witch Project

2465,Revolution698,This movie deserved some more recognition,9,14 May 2006,"Personally I thought The Blair Witch Project comes close to being the scariest movie I have ever seen. The publicity and hype about the film originally got me fooled into believing the entire story and footage was real, and that played a big role in making it even more effective as a scary/horror movie. They kind of got into your head a little bit.What's more is that this is the only movie I have ever seen that seems to be improvised without a script(at least thats what I've read). The acting is so dramatic and real and makes you feel like you are with the characters.I actually think these actors and actresses involved deserve Oscars.Unfortunately, the horror/scary film genre has never truly been properly recognized and respected in Hollywood or the Academy Awards, so one can only hope that someday a scary film will come along that people will finally see as worthy of recognition by nominating it for an award.This film truly scared me, and the suspense alone makes it such a unique film because not much is really shown as much as heard, which brings to another point that sound effects are also important and crucial to a movie, so the sound engineers and collectors who go out and record spooky things also deserve some recognition. Its not easy to get some of the sounds they often do.All in all I give this movie a 9 out of 10. I don't believe I've seen the scariest and most gut-wrenching movie of my life yet, but this one comes close (and so does the movie Saw). Definitely worth a rental, if not purchasing it, because it really is a unique film and there's nothing else like it.",The Blair Witch Project

I am really not able to understand how many of my favorite critics rated this film 4 stars and up. I agree we cannot reduce any movie to only a number, but in this case I'm really perplexed. First of all, the characters are undoubtedly annoying! I didn't like them in any way. It just seemed they used the whole swearing thing to look more real, but it ended up sounding artificial and nothing more than that. Analyzing them, I noticed Heather was the more developed one, though she was the most irritating. Josh and Mike had no definite personality, they kept changing from nice guys to completely pugnacious. During the day shots, all I was hoping for was to get dark quick and perhaps feel a bit frightened. However, the scenes at tent were also boring where the listened to inaudible (for us) sounds and overreacted to pretty much everything.Even though, it's not anything like a good movie (in my opinion) I still encourage you to watch and draw your own conclusions.

Personally, I fell on the side that found it less scary, less interesting, and less exciting than watching grass grow.People who have actually been in the woods before, and have some shred of self control, mental stability, and the ability to think rationally, will find it impossible to relate to the characters, and impossible to share in their terror. If, on the other hand, you were raised as a spoiled, emotional moron, whose experience of nature consists of occasionally flipping past the nature channel with your cable remote, the movie might scare you ... not because it's actually scary, or because anything actually happens in the movie, but because your own imagination might manage to scare you all by itself.

There is no real story, per se, just the stupid students swearing, bickering, and whining like babies.  Not to mention the fact how totally IMPLAUSIBLE their situation is.  They are supposed to lost in a forest in MARYLAND... the state isn't big enough to get lost in!!!!  If it was the middle of northern Ontario, then *MAYBE* it would have been more plausible.  All they had to do was pick one direction and walk in it, or follow the river downstream... they would have eventually (and probably within a couple of hours) found civilization.  And one of the students throws away the map... and they even had a compass!  By using the river, there would have been NO CHANCE of them walking in circles.  And ooooo scary piles of rocks, noises, and twigs in the trees... gimme a break. I've seen kids at summer camp make scarier things in arts and crafts and heard scarier stories by the campfire!

2477,rafa_lombardino,The mean which that turned capitalist!,8,25 May 2005,"""The Blair Witch Project"" may be considered a great revival for the supernatural pranks we have all participated in during our teenage years. Being interested in the unknown is something natural for those who had their imagination stimulated year after year by ""The Twilight Zone"" during the 50's and 60's, by ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" and ""Unsolved Mysteries"" in the 80's, or by ""The X Files"" more recently. Each time had its monsters and presented them as it suited their audiences: scientists experimenting without any conscience, aliens taking over the Earth, mutants resulting from genetic engineering programs or simply the dark side of human beings.The idea of creating a legend, making a movie, and having fun at the same time may have been ingeniously conceived by directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who probably couldn't anticipate how profitable their project would be. However, the movie was produced with extreme perfectionism, from casting to experimental screenings to test the public's reaction, besides their innovative filming methods.Using two cameras  a 16mm and another one for ""homemade"" videos  Myrick and Sanchez depicted the escalating fear manifested by Heather, Mike, and Josh, the three characters who are lost in the middle of a forest while trying to collect enough evidence to prove that the witch does exist. In order to obtain total realism from these amateur actors, the directors limited themselves to direct from a distance, handing them a draft for the script with a list of scenes that were going to be filmed during the day along with some food and a map that would give them a clue to where their next meeting would take place. The directors' objective was revolutionize the Hollywoodian way of making scary movies, refusing to give away when those typical scary moments would come and when the audience should scream. That was why the actors, while really exploring their field, were constantly scared by their directors' pranks.Another differential was not showing the characters on a daily routine. Sex scenes? No way! Who would feel romantic about being lost in the middle of the woods? There's only place for exhaustion, frustration, and total shock  what led audiences to believe that they were watching a real documentary. The only thing that seems to have been surgically analyzed is the psychological pressure the movie would put their audience under.The great marketing force behind the ""Blair Witch"" must be attributed to the company that was responsible for the distribution. After considering how critics and other entertainment authorities rejected the movie at the Sundance Festival  which was the first time it was presented in its final format after all the experimental screenings  Artisan decided to heavily invest in the box office. The core of their marketing strategy was the movie's website, which was updated on a weekly basis and affirmed that it was all a true story: three young people from Maryland had disappeared indeed. Several ""news articles"" would back up the fact that the witch is the ghost of a woman who had been burned to death during the Inquisition, besides quoting witnesses to a mass murder from the 40's when a man killed seven kids after being told by the witch's ghost to do so. This was such a fool-proof plan that the website even presented statements from the missing kids' families and day by day more tapes were being found by the students' friends in the woods.Actually, this mockery is not talked about at all. How far can studios lie to get a blockbuster? Well, we should say that lying is out of question, but in these days when everybody has to gamble in order to profit, this may have been one of the most brilliant ideas in a long time. Besides, it's stupid to think a website could have attracted so many followers, right? Or may not",The Blair Witch Project

(ofcours a marketing trick but at least not a cheap one like todays movies affairs & all...) the trick worked great and movie hit the charts. The rumors about the movie's story were produced even MOCK interviews of people supporting that story is true & of the parents of so called lost students were produced. The movie was shot like a documentary from actors themselves giving the original & amateur touch to it.The movie's like this-3 film students Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard & Michael Williams set to make a documentary on the old myth of Blair Witch in Burkistville,Maryland area.They start their shoot from the local cemetery & begin to interview the people in village. 2 locals tell them about the man named Justin Parr who kidnapped the 7 children & killed them during 1940-41. Justin took children to his house in woods which were said to be haunted by a spirit of lady killed in 18th century for witchcraft. Later when Justin was captured he told police that the witch in woods possessed him to do so. He used to kill the children cruelly he wold take 2 children in basement & kill 1 of them while other stands there facing the corner then he would kill the other too. Also a woman told 3 of them that she had an encounter with the witch in woods. All interview are shown like real interviews in documentaries, which sets the mood.Next day they start to search the woods for shooting the evidence of Blair witch. They left their car on road & start to walk toward the coffin rock, where 5 men found to be killed ritually some years before. In their way, fishermen warn them about the woods being haunted. They shoot coffin rock & camp there for night. Next day they went deep into the woods. But unaware of their exact location on map. At the eve they find the place like old cemetery, & saw the 7 small heaps of rock(cairns) on the ground. They set up the camp & in night return to shoot the cairns. Accidentally josh disturb cairn by his leg, which heather hastily repair later. In night, heather hear the strange noises in the night. Next they they start to walk to get their car. But at the eve they come to know that they are lost. Slowly temperature between them start to rise.

Next morning, they find 3 cairns around their camp. They again try to find their way out, but map is also lost & near daybreak they discover the stuff like voodoo on allover the trees they get a another shock when they realize that they are standing on same place from where they started in the morning. The arguments in between starts to intensify out of frustration. That night with noises of children, they also feel the movement outside & rattling on their camp walls. Being Terrified, they run out & for a whole night remain out in woods. In morning they find their camp in all mess.

2480,tfadale94,What the actual...,1,21 February 2013,"Literally the worst movie I've seen thus far, and that includes screening for undergrad film majors. What are you people thinking giving this high ratings? Let me break it down. ""You had to have an imagination/it's all left up to the imagination."" Okay, so yeah, it's supposed to be psychologically scary. It's a little difficult to be lost in your inner fears with Heather screaming like a self-centered crazy woman. Seriously, shut up. If she would have been even a tiny bit less annoying, it'd have been easier to go into the ""...what if...""'s that my mind wanted to throw out there. Make Josh disappear sooner and perhaps have him scream every night for two nights or more. That's the only part in the movie when I was a little scared. What happened to Josh? Why is he yelling? AH!But we never know, and the mind takes it to the goriest, most painful experience imaginable. Only well-done part of the movie. ""The editing was spot on/first person camera is so immersive!"" I'm sorry, but what person jiggles and shakes around that much when walking in the woods? Try it. When you walk, your vision does wobble a bit, but not in the nausea-inducing way the cameras do in BWP. I didn't feel like I was there, I felt like I had a migraine coming on. I get it, it's supposed to be that the viewer found the footage in the woods. But... it didn't feel like that. For that to happen, I would have preferred a police officer or something to introduce us to the footage, not just a black screen and words.""The ending was so scary/the locals built suspense!"" It wasn't suspenseful. The moment it was mentioned how the kids were killed, we all knew what was going to happen. Seriously people. NOT SUSPENSEFUL. ""The acting was so honest/believable/ad hoc!"" Cut out Heather. Just get a new actor, she isn't believable as a person, an actor, or a character. About as ""deeply sorry"" as Hitler. Annoying enough to make me WANT her to die. Incessant talking? No. Just, no. Stop. And the way all the actors sort of faced each other awkwardly like a school play for a good majority of the film? Unprofessional and not believable one bit. They didn't work together one bit. Just burn it, and start over.",The Blair Witch Project

I decided to watch this movie with another two friends because it seemed interesting to us and has also a good rating here on IMDb (as regards horror movies). The first hour was one of the most boring of my entire life. Nothing happened and there wasn't that sense of thriller and terror that everybody would have been expecting. I hoped somewhat for the last 20 minutes to be something else and change the fate of the movie, but nothing. I don't know how such a movie could be depicted as intelligent and revolutionary, it's boring, almost unwatchable. Do not be attracted by the thousands of positive reviews and do not waste your time with this movie. It is not a matter of opinions, it's simply a terrible movie.

2483,tooxshort,differences from 1999 - 2005,7,18 July 2005,"I'll admit that when I first watched this film, I couldn't sleep that night ... the more I thought about it, the more it freaked me out! It was more of a psychological fear rather than a visual one. I went out to a local independent theater (The Bridge in San Francisco) to see it on the second night of its release. Months later, it was released into mainstream theaters like AMC and CENTURY theaters. By then, however, its marketing strategy of the ""missing"" students was used up and we all knew it was a big ol' hoax! (although, in my heart of hearts, I knew they couldn't possibly release a film with actual footage of people being killed for our viewing pleasure)If you read the reviews on this film, there's a huge difference of opinion from its reviews as a fresh new ""indie"" film up 'til now. I would have to say that this was never meant to be a film to last through the ages. It had its 15 minutes of fame and it's all done with by now. I didn't quite enjoy watching it. It made me dizzy, but the mental horror it gave me was great in the end.The Blair Witch Project is historical for its ability to bring audiences in through sheer curiosity and great marketing. After I saw it, I looked it up online and they had a whole site dedicated to the hoax with ""evidence"", ""interviews"", photographs, and more. I totally bought it! Marketing to an internet audience was never done like this before in 1999. Keep in mind that, back then, the internet almost seemed like it wouldn't lie to you. I had used it more for information rather than entertainment.A lot of people complain about the lousy acting, editing, sound, lack of plot, but, come on! It was meant to be a shitty looking film. It allowed a lot of us to just take in what little we knew of the story and create it in our own heads. It was more real than a lot of people give the actors credit for. They really did feel like crap out there without much else to do, but keep improvising and moving along in the woods. If it was meant to have good acting, the movie would have failed. Don't knock a film that was meant to look as crappy as it did.All in all, I don't think the movie itself was great (once I found out it was all fake!), but I think, for its time, its still a cult landmark.Also, visit http://www.blairwitch.com to see why the internet buzz was so hot back then!",The Blair Witch Project

That number has to be a joke for many reasons.1) The movie had no real plot or content. 2) The filming was so shaky it made you dizzy. 3) The acting was horrible with people without communication skills. 4) As we were leaving the theater we noted no one looked at each other as they appeared to be too embarrassed for having spent money to see this movie. 5) I am sure you really don't want me to go on .........",The Blair Witch Project
2486,horrormaster123,The Blair Witch Project,8,15 December 2004,"This film is not scary unless you have a good imagination! First of all, I would just like to criticize those certain people who rate this film as pathetic. Most of them probably don't have an imagination and probably fell asleep halfway through the film because they could'not think of the horror that was unfolding in the woods. As I said before this is because they have a very poor imagination. But many people who can imagine things and enjoy this film can picture a terrifying image in their mind of the Blair Witch and what she is doing. And there is also a freaky end scene that made me stay awake for days!Now let me tell you about the film. It is basically about three students who go around with a camcorder recording everything. They then visit Burktsville and ask the locals about what they have seen or heard about the Blair Witch. If you have a good imagination then you can build up a terrifying image of the Blair Witch in your mind. They then go into the woods and get lost. That is when terrifying events start to unfold and the end scene will leave you looking around every time you hear a bump!This film deserves an 8/10. It makes you feel like you are with the group as the footage is all shaky and it is a very low budget film( about $30,000. However if you have a bad imagination and cannot picture things in your mind very well then this film is not for you. But if you can picture things in your mind and let yourself imagine what is happening then this film is scarier than any other you will ever see. Oh, and if you really want to petrify yourself watch this film in the dark at midnight when no one else is in your house!",The Blair Witch Project
2487,FJN1864,Why?,1,8 January 2005,"Why am I still talking about this movie over 5 years later? It was (and still is) the most over-hyped , BAD movie ever made!

I can proudly state that I had nothing to do with this movie being a multi million dollar grossing film. If you get the chance, maybe this film will interest some of you out there. Then again, Attack of the Killer Tomato's is just as good. If you need to see this, see if any of your friends, relatives, or even the Public Library have copies you can borrow/ check out.

2488,major_combover,Scary? Bambi was scarier...,2,12 February 2005,"I had heard some mixed comments about this movie, so when i rented it I really had no expectations. I'm glad i didn't, because this is one of THE WORST films i've ever seen. Not only is the plot weak (although the idea of this story being real was very well marketed), it was not at all scary! Let me just say, I scare fairly easily, and yet by halfway through this film, I was falling asleep with boredom. The movie follows three teenagers on a film making adventure into the woods to create a documentary on a local legend - the Blair Witch. Then while they are in the woods, (suposedly) creepy things start to happen... Thats pretty much all there is to this film. Not even the descent into helplessness by the main characters as the journey unfolds could hold my interest (and I sat through Gosford Park...twice). Nothing scary ever happens, just a few weird noises and abnormal rock formations, and thats basically it. I suppose the scares in this movie are meant to come from fear for the main characters in their somewhat unfortunate situation. Sadly, because nothing seriously dramatic (or even attention grabbing) ever happens, as a viewer I couldn't see what the big deal was. I know its supposed to be realistic, and we're meant to see ourselves in that situation, but by that stage I was disenchanted with the whole painful ordeal. Of course, there is the question of the mysterious Blair Witch herself. She is supposed to command fear because we never see her, leaving her as an invisible force of danger. Sorry, still not good enough. Because we are never shown the witch in the act of moving rocks or stalking the teenagers, we are meant to assume it was her, I quite honestly didn't feel threaten at all. Even the (exciting?)climatic sequence left much to be desired, such as an actual conclusion, and I found myself relieved that I could then find a more riveting was to waste my time (such as watching paint dry). If you are one of those people who thought that The Blair Witch Project was the scariest film of all time, I suggest you watch Bambi. It'll scare you senseless.",The Blair Witch Project

There wasn't even a payoff at the end after putting up with all that BS. If i'm missing something please enlighten me.

However, some people find this movie very boring and lame, however I find it extremely scary that nobody can see what is really happening to the characters when they are filming this movie. However, I didn't find the whole body of the movie as scary as some people make it as, but there are definitely some very scary parts that are just very atmospheric but not gory or violent. For example, the discovery of the pile of rocks was very scary, the discovery of the wooden ""witch stick figures"" was also very scary as well. The scariest part for me however, took place in the abandoned house...enough said, this movie is scary...don't watch it alone and in the dark.

2492,david_e_bond,So real it had me fooled,9,19 March 2005,"I write these comments a few hours after accidentally flicking over to this movie on TV when it was already half-way through, not knowing what it was or anything about its background. I came in at the point where the three characters were groping around in the dark wondering whether the noises they were hearing were deer. My initial belief was that I had tuned into one of those dreadful survivor-type reality-TV shows. In fact I almost turned it off when an argument scene developed and the language became obscene. However the intensity and realism of the fight, plus the fact that it was acknowledged as being hand-filmed by the actual characters, compelled me to keep watching. What was this I was seeing?When adverts intervened and showed the title, 'Blair Witch Project', I recognised the name but that was all. So I consulted the TV guide and read the brief synopsis about 3 students going missing etc.So what kept me totally hooked into seeing this movie through to the end? The fact that I was honestly unsure whether what I was seeing was fact or fiction. And I didn't clarify this till the titles at the end!Call me a sucker, but the suspense of believing that this might actually be the missing students' footage kept me riveted. With this possibility lodged in my mind, the behaviour and demeanour of the characters in the worsening situation seemed utterly realistic and totally unlike any cheesy 'Reality' show. If this was not the real thing, then I assumed at the very least it must have be a re-enactment of a true story.Keen to find out more once the movie it had finished I checked out the official web site www.blairwitch.com and still found myself wondering how much of this was true!So for me, having no prior knowledge of what this movie was all about, gave me a compelling viewing experience and left me very impressed at what the movie makers had achieved.",The Blair Witch Project

Once i saw those credits rolling at the end of the film i was in pure amazement of this great creation. This movie was so greatly put together. The acting in the film was incredible, and thats an understatement. It had me questioning whether this movie is really real. You just can't fake the emotion that those people had. But the reason i gave it a 9 was because of the only flaw, they just keep the camera rolling, if i were lost in the woods i wouldn't keep the camera rolling.

First, its them talking to people about the blair witch. then i goes to them preparing to go to the woods where the blair witch is. a few creepy things happen and since they lost the map and are out of cigarettes, they lose it. When they hear voices, its like OH MY GOD! the scene with the crosses was weird and didn't make any sense. And the ending sucked.

Disregarding the low budget, Blair Witch Project is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The idea of having unknown and unschooled actors for a documentary type film, isn't a bad idea. But in this movie, they are so annoying that you are hoping something really bad will happen to them. I remember the tagline said something about this would be the scariest movie ever made, after I had seen it, I couldn't really grasp that statement.

2497,kaitlinvalerius,Unexpected Expectations,3,26 May 2014,"First off I'd like to say that I understood the film 100% and I don't need people claiming the opposite, because overall, there wasn't much to understand.All I saw was a bunch of teenagers running around the woods throwing f-bombs at each other a mile a minute. The acting was excellent (not going to lie); though the storyline was mediocre. I was bored half to death during the entire course of the movie. To be honest, the only part which creeped me out was the discovery of all the voodoo figures. What made three helpless teens think it would be a dandy idea to venture off into the middle of the woods to search for a supernatural entity which could have been the cause of many disappearances over the past century is well beyond me. Another annoying aspect of the film was Heather's constant babbling and filming of every little nook and cranny of the woods to capture this so called witch instead of fleeing to safety. First, she gets the group lost - twice - with a map (although Mike ends up idiotically discarding the map later on). Second, the day after Josh mysteriously disappeared from camp, Heather wanders off as usual and finds his bloody remains tied up in his plaid shirt, which is then stuffed into a bundle of sticks and keeps the information to herself. Lastly, she is either really out of shape or she is really stupid. I'm going with the latter. The last scene of the films ends with Mike and Heather entering the house searching for Josh. As the two teens pace across the broken floorboards of the creepy house, we can clearly see little bloody hand prints scattered all over the walls. At this point I would figure out that Josh is dead and leave, but this is a movie so we must venture on! Mike suddenly hears screaming from the basement and sprints down the stairs to rescue his not so alive friend. Instead of chasing after him, Heather decided it'd be in her best interest to instead trot behind him at 2mph and continue to shout at the top of her lungs. The last clip the audience views is Mike seen facing the wall followed by Heather dropping her camera - although we don't see her because it cuts straight to the credits. Boom! The end.What? That's it? I honestly don't understand why this particular film was hyped up so much. I was excited to watch this because of all the commotion surrounding the movie, however it did not live up to my expectations.If I rate below a five, it means I personally think the movie/TV series was dreadful, which is the reason 3 stars out of 10 were chosen.Thank you for reading.",The Blair Witch Project
2498,justinmic-justin,Greatest Horror Movie of all time ***CAUTION:SPOILER ALERT***,10,10 June 2014,***CAUTION:SPOILER ALERT***The Blair's Witch Project was fantastic but very scary. I am 13 and just watched it nonstop on netflix with no interruptions. I admit I may be too young but I've seen many scary and adult movies. Pulp Fiction The Green Mile The first 3 screams Interview with a vampire The shining and many more I cant think of off the top of my head. But this is a whole new level of creepy. When I put it in I was expecting ghostbusters not Halloween meets jack Nicholson's crazy behavior in the shining meets jaws (when they don't show the witch and the directors skill) When they mentioned it on Dawsons Creek for that one episode I thought maybe it wouldn't be that bad I mean I had gotten to find out about and see Jerry Maguire its a wonderful life and close encounters of the third kind from that show. My mother said it wasn't too bad she just got dizzy from the cameras. ***SPOILER STARTS ABOUT HERE***I did expect it to start off worse but it was pretty calm with the hotel and the interviews. But that just made it better it got my guard down making me expect it to be sorta like that even though in the back of my head I knew it would get worse. And it certainly did. From they left the car it got frightening. The noises in the night especially when they found the rocks. But the worst meaning scary nothing was bad was the bundle. I expected it to just be a piece of josh's clothing when I saw the plaid. But then I heard blood and thought it might be some of his blood what came next I never would have expected. It was body parts like what I thought was a thumb or tooth maybe both and nose. Even that was mild compared to what was coming. The baby crying were nothing compared to josh screaming. Just writing about this freaks me out. From all the seasons of supernatural I've seen I know running into the woods never ends well especially one with a legend of a possessing killer witch 10000000 times worse than the one of the west. My anxiety worsens when I see the old burnt house with symbols and children's handprints on the walls possibly bloody. And just when I don't think it could get even scarier they go into the basement. I was aorta expecting it and aorta not. I remembered the part of the man possessed to kill children in his basement and make one look in the corner while he kills the other and then takes the one in the corner out once hes done and kills that one as well. Once I saw the handprints I thought I kind of knew what was coming but wasn't sure. Once I saw the basement I knew what I signed up for a haunting thrill ride I will never forget. I honestly didn't expect such of a creepy ending I thought I wouldn't get too frightened and would continue my life with another classic under my belt. But. instead I got a whole bother experience. Sorry of I built it up too much even though hopefully if your reading this you've already seen this. You see Mike standing facing the corner not moving to heather's screams. Then you see the camera fall to the ground film for a few more seconds until credits appear. I am proud to say I understood the connection the second I saw Mike. I am not proud to say I have never been this scared in my life. Incoviniently on a school night and its almost 11:40. I really hope parents wont allow their child to watch this. I'm 13 and I've seem many scary things.Butafterseeing this I'm ready to jump in bed with my father. I certainly thought I would come out of this unscathed but I am jumping at every noise (doesn't help I have cats) and I cant turn off the light let alone sleep and from what I've heard many grown adult have done the same maybe even worse. Its up to you but I strongly advise you to have only adults watch it unless parents want them sleeping with them until the kids 17 (no exaggeration) they should refrain from letting them watch it. But as I said earlier its your call. I have a feeling I will be mortified for a long time. Most readers may think Imjust a kid who got scared from a little horror movie so if you doubt me watch it inahouse with many windows and a doer connecting to a porch right next to it. At 9:00 To 10:00 with no lights on all alone then tell me its just me when people over 20 years old are totally freaked out.

Intense thriller, found footage categorized, this is very realistic to the core. And the idea that there is no reveal of the 'scary characters' that is normally expected towards the movie ending makes it more realistic and scarier.During the course of the movie, you will love (or hate) the characters surely it doesn't matter but you'll get attached to what is happening out there.

Last night it was being shown on t.v so i decided to watch it seeing there was nothing else on. By the end of the movie i could actually feel and hear my heart beating though my chest. The way it was put together....how it made you wonder what was happening made it surprisingly more terrifying then if you could see everything.

2503,ZAKobza,The Way Horror Movies Should Be Made,8,5 December 2014,"This movie is the perfect model of an independent film and of horror movies in general. According to IMDb, this movie had a budget somewhere around $60,000 and made $140,539,099 over its lifetime according to Box Office Mojo. So, if you judge the success of a movie based on the money it made, The Blair Witch Project is a definite winner, but is it actually a good movie? Well there must have been something bringing that 140 million dollars to the box office over its lifetime, and I believe that was its creativity and its realism. This movie is the inspiration Cloverfield and Chronicle, and all the other found footage style movies we have today. The acting and camera-work is so believable that, at the time of its release, many people believed it to be a true story! Honestly, the characters were relatable and often times said what I was thinking while watching it. When you watch this movie, be sure to keep the volume up in order to really get immersed and hear all the creepy and disturbing noises the characters are hearing. This movie does horror right! I personally believe that jump scares are a cheap way to ""scare"" the audience and filling a movie with jump scares does not make it scary. In The Blair Witch Project, there are no jump scares, so be sure to keep the volume up and get wrapped up in the legitimately frightening story that it is.",The Blair Witch Project
2504,meikemmulder,Its only merit is suggestion,4,20 January 2015,"The Blair Witch Project is, according to what I've read, supposed to be a scary movie that plays cleverly on psychological suggestion and I shouldn't watch it alone!So I did.First of all, I must say that the acting is rather convincing in terms of 'realness' of the characters; perhaps the 'raw footage' style filming helps in that but purely in terms of acting and the tapes seeming authentic in that regard it's well done. It was a clever combination of acting, seemingly raw footage and improvisation and the actors not knowing IRL how it will all exactly unfold. The characters are annoying though and especially Heather is the last person you'd want to go on any kind of trip or holiday with. That aside, as the story began I had some hopes due to the reviews about how nerve wrecking it'd eventually become but I found myself waiting all the time for that moment to come. In the movie, the situation gradually starts to get more out of control and the group (which wasn't a winner combination anyway) experiences disputes and distrust almost right from the get-go. However, it gets out of control because of the sheer stupidity of the group, NOT because of the horrors that lurk in the woods. Okay... fine. So there's that. The nights are supposed to be the moments where your tension really starts to rise. Creepy, weird things happen that gradually increase in severity but nothing completely overly dramatic, I suppose to still give it a sense of 'realism'. The days are used to illustrate how they mess up the situation, how the group is getting more lost every day and how the morale dies a not-so-silent death. In that sense it's a nice dynamic but I didn't find myself dreading nightfall, and the only 'fear' I felt was more close to by proxy annoyance caused by imagining how it must suck to be stuck with these people, being lost in a forest with a decreasing food supply and understanding that the situation in general wasn't fun at all. But... the 'witch' was hardly a part of it! If well done, certain creepy things, hints or ''how is that possible/where did that come from''s can give you this creeped out gut feeling, the feeling or thought of 'what the hell...!' In the Blair Witch Project there was an attempt to do specifically that but this time it really didn't work for me. Perhaps that's just my (lack of ;) ) taste but I'm the kind of person to be creeped out by suggestion more than the plain monsters yet this didn't really do it. The piles of rocks and the wooden sticks were slightly odd and don't ask me why as I lack the answer, but it somehow wasn't significant enough to give me any hint of ''that's creepy'' or ''wow that's weird''. The daylight parts are to illustrate how the group falls apart and experiences all kinds of stress but it doesn't really build tension for me. There's little mystery and I'm watching the constant arguing, immature behaviour of annoying people who're lost in a forest but there's no increase in 'scare' for me. The nights feel like unrelated intervals. So we have the combination of getting lost in a big forest, weird sounds and other occurrences in increasing severity in the night, the increasing arguing in a per definition doomed group and eventually a big anti climax. I get the thing about suggestion and the group losing unity, it supposedly adds to the scare that nobody knows what to do, that they're basically trapped and that everyone's getting really stressed out. Then there're the 'definitely creepy' things like the rock piles. I get it! But it doesn't do it for me. When I dread the thing of 'being lost with these sucky people in a big forest with no food' more than 'being lost and there's the main antagonist of local horror legends playing mind tricks with us' it has missed some marks. Perhaps too heavily dependent on suggestion and thereby going too far/a bit overboard, or maybe it's the lack of actual build of tension other than showing a stressed out, angry group, but it didn't leave me scared. I'll give some stars for the concept because that could've been great and the acting was convincing.",The Blair Witch Project
2505,AgentOfTerror,"Exactly what I hoped it would be, and much more than I expected!",9,16 April 2015,"I've known of this movie for the past 16 years, yet only got around to watching it today. Having seen the trailer, known the plot and read the reviews, I admit that the reason I avoided this film for so long was due to my incredibly low expectations of it, both as a horror film, and as a film in general.Yet I was drawn into the story within the first 30 minutes and couldn't look away until it was over.While I can understand the generally negative reviews of this movie, I strongly believe that in order to fully appreciate this film, one only need use a bit of imagination. This isn't an artistic film, this isn't philosophical and this isn't about character development. This film is purely mindless entertainment that delivers quite well as a horror film if one is willing to imagine that these events truly occurred.The film plays on a lot of essential horror elements that give the viewer the unsettling feeling of fear and uneasiness, while delivering these in a realistic manner. You won't get some CGI scares or a guy running around in costume, there is no eerie soundtrack. The feeling of fear that this film provides is entirely based on what is happening to the three film students.Indeed, a certain sense of dread creeps up on the viewer from the very moment the group leave the car by the road. Perhaps this is because the viewer is told that the students will not survive from the very start of the movie.To me, the most unnerving and frightening element in this film was the feeling of hopelessness that the group share upon realizing that they are truly lost. This, coupled with the strange occurrences, definitely makes for a terrifying experience as the film goes on. The subtleties in the supernatural elements keep this movie from becoming another overdone horror film in which a certain climax is reached; we never see the witch. The group can never really know that the strange events are anything truly supernatural. We never see anything to indicate that a witch exists (though the careful viewer may notice that all the events do make sense when remembering the stories from the start of the film.)Although the characters lack a certain feel of realism and depth, and I felt that this film did have room for improvement in certain areas, these were minor drawbacks and they did not for a moment take me out of the experience. As stated earlier, this movie was about one thing: horror.I feel that this film did an amazing job in entrancing the audience on a low budget. It stayed authentic from beginning to end and left room for speculation as to any possible meanings at the end. Personally, I enjoy a film that requires one to think about its meaning rather than just laying it all out for the viewer.As a fan of both classic and modern horror made on a budget, I found this film to be exactly what I hoped it would be, and much more than I expected. I already know that this movie will stick with me for a long time.",The Blair Witch Project
2506,brettault,"Very unique (for it's time), but very poor",1,23 April 2015,"If you're still stuck in any time before 2005, and haven't seen any found footage type films, or if you're one of those people that think all Indie films are instantly masterpieces purely because it's Indie no matter how terrible it is, or if seeing three tired teenagers arguing through a shaky camera lens entertains you, you might find this film interesting. Otherwise, this film is absolutely terrible. Definitely not a film you should waste your time on if you want a scare. It consists of 10% people telling a story followed by 80% of arguing teenagers, 9% crying and the final 1% is a slightly tense moment, but probably only made intense because you think something more exciting than exhausted, depressed teenagers arguing and crying might happen. I can see how this gained it's popularity on release due to it being an original take on horror films in relation to the films in it's era. Maybe selling it as real, actual footage probably helped it's reception too. But in modern times, when it is no longer unique, it is just a very boring film about three college students arguing",The Blair Witch Project

It is so terrible and annoying that I had a difficult time sitting through it. It may have been the 'first', but it does not hold up in any way to its descendants.

2510,sierrabonny,"The ""Bored"" Witch Project",2,21 April 2016,"The Blair Witch Project follows three teens (Heather, Mike, and Josh) as they trek out into the woods to do research behind the legend of the Blair Witch. They begin by interviewing several of the folks that live in the town near the woods, and almost everybody knows something about this witch. With the creepy tales of the witch swimming in their minds, they venture into the woods for what is meant to be just a three day camp out to shoot some scenes in the home of the ""fictional"" witch. Once they enter the woods things start declining from there. The first problem is that the circle- walking begins. Classic in any ""woodsy"" horror film. Because of the bewitchment of the woods, Heather, Mike, and Josh become hopelessly lost wandering in circles. While things definitely do get worse for them, the circle wandering is a very large chunk of the film. After they become lost in the woods, the film really has only 2 elements to it: wandering in hopeless circles in the woods, and listening to sticks crack at night. Are both of those things scary? Yes of course! Scary for an audience to watch for an hour and forty-five minutes? You can answer that for yourself. After they become lost in the woods, they begin to hear many strange noises and find mysterious, unexplained symbols placed all around them. Slowly the characters are forced to come to the realization that they aren't just lost. They are hunted. Josh is the first of them to disappear, then suddenly Heather and Mike are left alone to walk in circles and listen to sticks crack. Oh no! The film comes to what could be called a climax in the last five minutes when Heather and Mike venture out to find Josh, for the third time, and they are lead to an old abandoned house. Once inside, they follow his screams, and wind up in a basement where the film ends as you see Mike standing in the corner of the room. The camera goes black. After at least fifteen minutes of pure running, screaming and chasing, that is the end it comes to. Everyone dies. But are we really surprised?",The Blair Witch Project

2512,maiira,A truly unsettling film...,8,29 May 2006,"I do not usually feel compelled to write reviews on this site, but for this film, I felt I had to say something. I don't entirely know what counts as a ""spoiler"" in this film, but I'm going to mark this review as having them, just in case.For the first thirty minutes, we see Heather (the bossy director of the project and principal camera operator), Josh (Heather's friend and secondary camera operator), and Mike (the sound guy) doing some half-hearted interviews, and goofing off. Heather, it seems, isn't a very good documentarian, or interviewer (I kept wanting to tell her to shut up and let the interviewees speak, instead of interrupting them with her own ideas half the time). After a night of drinking, they start out into the woods. Then, at around thirty minutes into the film, some things start to happen. The group gets lost. They lose their map. Their food and cigarette supplies dwindle. Their tempers run high. And, worst of all, they start seeing strange sights, and hearing strange noises at night. Gradually, all of them start to lose their minds. When one of the group disappears completely, it marks the end of the project, and the beginning of the group's fight for survival, which the viewer already knows they will lose. And in the last ten minutes...well, I'm not even going to say what happens in the last ten minutes. It's intense, terrifying, and very ambiguous.If I had never had any sort of experience with the outdoors, I doubt I would have been affected by this film at all. But since I have been camping many times, I was perfectly able to put myself in the three filmmaker's exact situation, and I know exactly how I would react if I ever experienced what they did (which is to say, I would sh*t my pants and die of fright). That is why this film is so scary. I remember what it is like to be outside, in the woods, at night, away from everything and everyone you know, sleeping in a tent. Your tent, once seen as a thing of comfort, now seems woefully insufficient as a shelter when you consider how thin it is, and how lightweight. If someone, or something, wanted to come in, it most assuredly could, any time it wanted to. It is dark, and cold outside, and every single noise is magnified many times. A single deer ambling outside the tent sounds like a herd of elephants. Now add in the fact that you're lost, hungry, and being stalked by an unseen supernatural being or force, which you can neither see nor control. It's a very sobering thought. With this film, it's what you don't see that is far more terrifying than what you do see. The ""witch"" is never shown, so you're forced to use your imagination. Even if you're not initially frightened by the film, you're hearing noises and looking over your shoulder afterwards.So, for those of you who were not scared by this film, I suggest you go out camping out in the woods sometime. If you do that and you still say the film isn't scary, I say you're a big fat liar. This film is scary. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.",The Blair Witch Project

2514,piteco_e_thuga,Most creepy and disturbing movie I've ever seen. This movie is the reason why I hate horror movies.,10,19 May 2016,"I watched ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 2000 when I was about 9 years old with my older cousins and I remember I was in the room with them, because I thought it was just another documentary on Discovery Channel. I really believed everything I was seeing was true. Just imagine the impact that this movie made in my mind at that time. Those final minutes of ""The Blair Witch Project"" was the truly hell and nightmare on screen. I had never experienced that feeling of dread before. After I understood it was just a movie, but by then it was late. The scenes and disturbing sounds stuck in my mind for weeks and I take weeks sleeping with the light on to recover. I grew up with the certainty that I'm not a fan of horror movies.Every horror fan is naturally a masochist. It's the pure masochism to love being scared and distressed for hours, days and even weeks. This is not my case, so I always avoid to watch this film genre. But I need to give ten stars for Blair Witch, because this movie really was able to mess with my most instinctive fears without show in no time the witch's face, or whatever the hell was that thing that was chasing those adolescents. This movie was creepy because the fear that it brings is the fear of the dark, fear of being lost walking in circles, fear of unknown sounds at night. That alone is scary enough, but there was also the growing fear of someone or something is stalking you and that there is no escape. Today I think the most brilliant thing is that the movie does not deliver anything ready for you. The plot just forces you to imagine what really happened to the three teenagers - and every possibility is more sinister and darkness than the other. Thinking better, there are certain things that are better not be seen. No doubt, the most disturbing and creepy movie I've ever seen. Well, I'll never see it a second time, but if you are a horror fan, mainly psychological, then this movie is for you.",The Blair Witch Project

Heather was in command of the three-some until they really did get lost in the forest and the precious map was thrown into the river. From there on, the three were hopelessly lost in the woods without food, matches for a fire. They became more and more frightened and began loosing their sense of self and sanity.

2521,taylorcabral,Frightening And Unsettling,9,17 June 2017,"I'll be honest: the first time I watched this movie, I wasn't even able to get through the first half hour of it due to boredom. Because of this, I didn't think it would scare me when I decided to give it another chance. However, as the movie began to intensify and the paranoia of the characters began to settle in, I finally realized what made this movie so unsettling. Basically, a bunch of students venture out into the woods to film a documentary on the Blair Witch (after interviewing various folks about their thoughts/opinions on/experiences with the mysterious figure). Things soon begin to go awry in the group as they realize that they've lost their way out of the woods. Odd and creepy things begin to occur, adding to the fears of the characters. And that's what makes this movie so creepy and unsettling: the complete and utter vulnerability of it all. What makes this movie scarier than the Paranormal Activity movies (another found footage film) is the fact that these students are in the middle of nowhere. They don't know their way and they even seem to be going in circles every time they attempt to escape the woods and find the car. I felt the fear that the characters were feeling; I was immersed in the movie, which really doesn't happen to me much in horror/thriller movies. The grainy imagery and shaky camera-work adds to the sensation, making it seem like footage from a rugged, armature-ish documentary. Now, the reason why I gave this film a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 is because of the odd ending. It's not really a ""bad"" ending, I just feel like it could've been done differently. Although the movie takes awhile to get to the scary stuff, it contributes to the whole ""starts simple but gradually gets creepier"" vibe. 9/10 movie, definitely worth a watch.",The Blair Witch Project

One of the things that made this film quite exciting was the Internet marketing before its release. The information given on Internet websites told viewers about an allegedly 'true' story about the legend that is the Blair Witch. The great marketing provoked anxiety and a craving to know more about this documentary that went terribly wrong. Even to today, there are many people who know about the Blair Witch legend, and still have not seen it. However, I believed this to be one of the film's downfalls. As with many other audiences, I had high expectations of what was suppose to be one of the greatest horror films ever. It in fact was quite uneventful and the ending left me baffled.Basically, the film is about three students (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams) who go to make a documentary about the Blair Witch. There are interviews with random people who are in fact not actors in which creates a realistic investigation. The students then go out into the woods and eventually get lost and it goes pair shape from then onwards. Weird things start to happen to them which include Josh getting kidnapped and the findings of severed flesh being delivered to them which a pile of twigs- very scary right? No, it was a bit icky but not that scary. Anyway, Heather and Michael find a crumbled house whilst searching for Josh and eventually they get killed while we thoroughly try to get a glimpse of the witch. The film ends with quite a disappointing tone.On the other hand, it must be said that the use of camcorders in this film does create a personal and interesting experience. Not only do we get to watch the interesting parts, we get to see them doing normal activities which helps the audience to get closer to the characters. The use of only three actors in the whole film reinforces the idea of isolation but it can also become quite boring from time to time. I admire the use of suggested violence and the presence of the witch that certainly segregates this film amongst many other typical horror films.The main problem with this film has to be the ending; it is disappointing and left me confused. In addition, watching a bunch of students wonder around the woods for ninety minutes did not satisfy my expectations. I appreciate the new ideas produced here to the horror genre but perhaps they should not have used propaganda to such an extent.Have to applaud the film for doing so well with such a low budget however, I would not recommend this film as you may feel quite annoyed at the end.",The Blair Witch Project

2530,j_dockeray,the beauty of simplicity,8,8 January 2006,"The Blair Witch project is a film that is perfect in its simplicity. It is a tribute to the film makers that they manage to do so much on such a small budget and with so little. the reason for it's success is its masterful playing on two central themes the first of these being isolation. in the cases of the characters who are isolated in a wood it is particularly crushing as they are so close to civilisation but yet so far. The theme of fear of the unknown is exploited by the film makers because we never see the witch that is hunting them and perceive no limit to her power. this is all the more scary because our minds are left to wander over her seemingly limitless power.The use of a hand-held camera to do the filming, genuine people as actors when possible and a lot of improvisation gives the film a gritty realistic edge. something that magnifys our fear as in our minds we do not see the famous actors and all to familiar Hollywood sets that would usually allow us to disbelieve but the truth.when this film was released in 1999 clever promoting and rumors that the film were true meant that it arrived with a lot of hype. This may of contributed to its success but its simple story line and good Acton sti9ll make it a cracking horror film.",The Blair Witch Project

no horror
no camera quality (obviously the theme is not relative) but it needed to be in HD camera atleast if you're not showing the original footage.I remember I saw a movie ""A Question mark"" an indian movie which was based on this ""The blair witch project""... But let me tell you ""that remake is a way better project (obviously you won't see it as that's in other language.Anyway my main review is ""I thought about it when I saw donnie darko and american psycho, But now I've decided not to believe imdb rating and viewslist"".",The Blair Witch Project
