0,nogodnomasters,Alice Saves,7,12 April 2021,"The film opens in Bainfield Mass. In 1845 with a girl being killed by a vigilante mob. We then fast forward to the present. Gerry Fenn (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is a journalist who has fallen from grace doing ""National Enquirer"" type of gigs. While investigating a Metallica symbol shaved on the butt of a cow he accidentally sets off a series of fantastic events by breaking the doll he found in the field used to bind previously killed girl. Everything goes well until he realizes he must get the genie back in the bottle.Jeffrey Dean Morgan gives us a good performance of his character. Climax lacked length and horror.Guide: No sex or nudity. Don't recall hearing F-word.",The Unholy
1,paul_haakonsen,Was that really it?...,5,27 May 2021,"I was recommended to watch the 2021 horror movie ""The Unholy"", so of course I sat down to watch it.And I will say that the movie definitely was watchable. Yeah, hold on now, because there is a but here; but, the movie just wasn't outstanding. The movie from writer and director Evan Spiliotopoulos just was a bit too predictable and generic, relying on jump scares that you see coming a mile away.When I sat down to watch ""The Unholy"" I must admit that I was stoked, because of the movie's title, its premise and because of a rather unique and interesting ensemble of cast.But even with the likes of Jeffrey Dean Morgan, William Sadler and Cary Elwes on the cast list, then the movie just never really managed to get out of the mediocre lane given the somewhat lazy writing and the predictability of the movie. It felt like these performers weren't really allowed to unfold and give the performance a full 100%.""The Unholy"" is a fairly generic and mediocre horror movie actually. But if you are new to the horror genre, then of course you will be in for quite something here. But for an avid horror fan such as myself, then writer and director Evan Spiliotopoulos just played it way too safe by following the how-to-make-a-horror-film blueprint.I will say, though, that the visuals in the movie were interesting and for the most part quite good. The CGI department did their jobs quite well here. So if for nothing else, then ""The Unholy"" is somewhat salvaged by the visuals.""The Unholy"" wasn't the movie I was hoping for, so I sit here with a somewhat flaccid sense of 'was that really it?' here as the movie ended. I felt somewhat bereft out of what could have been a great horror movie, and was instead served a lukewarm plate of predictability.My rating of ""The Unholy"" lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars.",The Unholy
2,BandSAboutMovies,Good Lord,1,27 May 2021,"As a child in the pews of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church, I always wondered, if the First Commandment is ""I am the Lord thy God, thou shalt not have any strange gods before Me,"" why are we spending so much time and energy praying to the Virgin Mary instead of God?James Herbert, in between thinking about hyper intelligent rats destroying humanity, must have had similar thoughts when he wrote the book Shrine in 1983. The book combines so many of my favorite subjects - religious ecstasy, demonic possession, faith healing, fanatical Catholicism and hysteria - and seems like the perfect tale to make into a movie.So imagine my delight when it really did become a movie and Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert were the producers. My mania got even more intense when they picked the very William Castle release date of Good Friday to open the movie, which pretty much disappeared so quickly that I had to pray to St. Anthony to try and find it. At the time, I blamed the pandemic and the fact that there really aren't enough theaters yet to support a movie's release.Then I finally watched The Unholy at home and, well...This is legitimately the worst movie I've seen in some time, which is a miracle in and out of itself seeing as how many Bruno Mattei and Jess Franco movies I watch. Director Evan Spiliotopoulos has a career mainly in writing and most of those films are animated sequels, such as The Lion King 1 1/2, Tarzan II and The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning. I have no real idea how he made the move from screenwriting to directing a film that came out from a major company like Sony, because this is a movie rife with issues.I don't expect everyone to be Mario Bava and obsessed over color palette, but the tones of this movie shift to the point that it becomes hyper-distracting. I don't just mean that each location has its own color choice. I mean that there are times that the film looks like its from the late 90s/00s world of crushed black and that silver and blue colortone over everything. At other times, such as inside the church or the tent service that closes the films, the black tones are so clumped up that you start to lose parts of the pictoral integrity. This also makes the movie look like its shot on multiple stocks of film, like Natural Born Killers without a plan. So there are moments when The Unholy has the look of an artier horror movie and others where it looks like it was made for Lifetime. I mean, this had a $10 million dollar budget, so you think that'd be something people would look into.There's even an opening of a woman's spirit being placed inside a doll when she dies so that the reveal of what happens in the movie is completely spoiled, like I am doing now. My reasons are to keep anyone from enduring such a pointless film, while the filmmakers should have been to surprise you later in the movie, seeing as how the central conceit is whether or not Alice Pagett (Cricket Brown) is on the side of the angels, fallen or unfallen.Disgraced journalist Gerry Fenn (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who deserves better) is in town to get a web story about a possessed cow. He's only getting paid $150 for driving across the country, which makes me wonder if he's ever heard of Upwork, which he could use to to find way better work, or even retail, which would pay better. Instead, while in this town, he breaks open the evil doll to create a fake story, the doll's spirit goes into the deaf mute Alice, who suddenly starts speaking, hearing and healing everyone in town.Much like the Amazing Randi vs. Faithhealers debate, Gerry wonders if this is all a placebo effect. The Catholic Church seems more than willing to instantly make this a miracle. For all the scorn you can toss the church's way, they're bigger skeptics than nearly anyone. Maybe it's all Bishop Gyles (Cary Elwes, who also deserves better) wanting to erase the sins of the past few decades.Meanwhile, Alice's uncle Father William Hagan (William Sadler, who...yeah, but way more than everyone else) starts to not believe that this is all divine, even after his emphysema is healed. Also, Katie Aselton from The League is in this and, yes, she really should have followed the lead of Jordana Brewster and escaped.The Unholy has some of the worst effects I've seen since the early days of CGI, moments of demonic shadows and static that look unfinished at best and hilariously inept at worst. It's hard to get into a film when you're nearly seeing the effects fall apart. They looked great in the trailer, but that's because, you know, you can cut the trailer to take off the bad edges. When they're up there on screen for an extended period, they're just plain horrendous.The movie ends with the most ridiculous montage of religious imagery, stuff that looks like a slideshow someone made in iMovie. We also get St. Matthew 7:15 up there, telling us ""Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's. Clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.""I'll answer this movie with my own quote from the Bible. Let's use Pslam 101:3. ""I will not set before my eyes anything that is worthless. I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me.""",The Unholy
3,CinemaSerf,"It's holey, very very holey....",5,9 June 2021,"Well, who'd recognise Cary Elwes from the ""Princess Bride"" is this derivative horror movie, eh? That's about all there is to say about this film. It seems based around half a dozen old Hammer films with a bit of Joan of Arc thrown into the mix. The acting is adequate - Cricket Brown (""Alice"") being the young girl who recovers the gifts of speech and hearing after ostensibly being visited and spoken to by the virgin Mary. The good lady continues to bestow here benefits causing other miracles to happen in the rural Massachusetts community until it all starts to go a bit pear-shaped and we discover that the guiding spirit isn't quite as benevolent as we had initially anticipated... One could forgive the lack of innovation if the characters were a little more interesting, the dialogue a little sharper and the pace - well, yes, we could be doing with some of that - but as it is, it presents us with a collection of mediocre acting and flat writing set amongst some beautiful scenery that takes a very well trodden path. It's not rubbish, but maybe just wait til it comes on the television late one Friday night when it's dark and cold outside - even then, prepare not to be remotely scared!",The Unholy
4,oscaralbert,"The SPOTLIGHT is back upon religious kooks in Massachusetts, as the . . .",8,28 April 2021,". . . Roman sects cultists urge the gullible to join the Legions of Lucifer. THE UNHOLY depicted here represent a Clear and Present Danger to Real Life America, as they and their Fellow Travelers from the Biblical Death Penalty champions currently monopolize ALL NINE of the seats on the USA's Highest Court. Lacking a single voice or vote from a U. S. Mainstream Faith, these devil's minions are likely to sell us out to the Dark Side, just like the Bishop leading THE UNHOLY charge. If nothing else, this film advocates the immediate liquidation of such Imminent Threats. As the Good Book says, ""Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide in the fight 'tween Truth and Trumpets for the Good or Evil Tide. Some thought flaw, some grand malarkey steering dopes down Chutes of Doom: Then the door bangs shut forever, making the Righteous lots more room!""",The Unholy
5,neil-476,Decent but unexceptional,7,20 May 2021,"Disgraced reporter Fenn happens upon what appears to be a case of a genuine miracle when a lifelong deaf mute girl is able to spontaneously hear and speak and, through her visions of Mother Mary, heal others. But we saw the 1845 prologue, so we know all is not what it seems.This is based on a novel by the late James Herbert, a British horror writer, and it's a decent enough tale. A few more question marks in it wouldn't have been difficult to arrange and might have added a bit more texture, because you're never in any great doubt about where the story is going. But it gets there efficiently.It's not hugely frightening - there are some made-you-jump moments - and it's not especially creepy or suspenseful. I would say it's satisfactory but not wildly successful.",The Unholy
6,deloudelouvain,I've seen worse in this genre.,6,2 July 2021,"If I could I would rate The Unholy 5.5 stars instead of 6. It's just not that exciting to be honest. But I guess it's good enough for a one time viewing. The story is decent without being too refreshing. It all feels like déjà-vu at one point. The CGI's are not that great, well certainly good enough if the movie was made thirty years ago, but that's not the case here. About the horror it basically consists of jump scares, so to me not that thrilling. My wife gets a greater kick out of it though. As for the acting it was all okay. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and William Sadler appear in a lot of movies and series, almost never leading roles but always good enough to not be annoyed by their acting. Cricket Brown was decent as well. Overal The Unholy is okay for this genre, just don't expect something wild and frightening because that's hardly what this is.",The Unholy
7,Edvis-1997,6,6,16 May 2021,"I would say it was pretty decent. At these days, it's very hard to find good horror/scary movie. To compare this film with other similar movies I can clearly say it wasn't bad. The main pros: acting was on point, idea of this movie is not ordinary, I could even say it was kind of unique. Cons: CGI/visuals very disappointing( it looked very cheap and not real), there too many scary jumps, I likes when it happened twice, but when it's happening constantly it's just getting boring and terrible ending. Everything could be good, but ending, come on. Ghost/witch/demon or whatever you will call it, defeats itself by killing family member and then God brings her back? Who taught it was a good idea... To sum up, despite cons, I would watch it again because the time flew fast and it didn't get boring.",The Unholy
8,MLDinTN,any movie in which you get deceived by the devil has got to be good,6,30 October 2021,"We've seen this type of plot before. A young girl, Alice, undergoes a miracle and can now hear and talk after being a mute her whole life. She supposed sees the Virgin Mary. Reporter Gerry, in town to do a story on cow mutilations, picks up this story. She heals a disabled boy and cures the priest, her uncle, of cancer. Soon, the media runs with the story with Gerry as the main access point. Soon, he starts to realize something dark and evil is going on. The priest finds an old book that reveals whom the real Mary is. Mary kills the priest but Gerry and the friendly doctor lady is on the trail and they find the book and learn Mary is really a witch/demon doing the devil's work.

9,westsideschl,Redux of a Borrowed Script,2,27 June 2021,"This script is basically borrowed (or a stronger word) from tales & movies done many times in the past almost verbatim. We have an innocent young female (never a male?) who sees the image of the Blessed Virgin mother of God (technically there can only be one God creator of all) of course in a field under a tree. Of course we need an investigator; sorta a journalist in this case. (Note: Questionable relationship between older journalist & our female.) Usual miracles of talking, walking, etc. Near instant curing begin. Background takes us to a witch trial at the same tree 100 years earlier. Usual creepy evil thing appears.

10,ops-52535,its a faint echo...,6,26 May 2021,"Of religious catholic horror from the late 70's and 80's, just a cheesy try, where the elements of fear does work, and follows the film ''omen I'''s footsteps. For a vast new generation that has grown up with stupid kids on the cabin trips, and halloweenique scream factoricing thematics, where the loonies and serial killers are the carrier of evil, this film brings forward the holy shrines of christianity, namely the holy mother of jesus, mary. There hasnt been made great titles over the trinity lately so it may start a new wave of its kind.I do think this film has a cold driving down thy spine if youll let it, the acting is what the direction and screenplay allows, some of the cataclysmic effects in the final sequence though gives a cheesy smell of budget limitations, and the flame-bouyant visual effects, and the hissing and clicking sound effects lacks originality. Scarejumps youll get, and the feel of icecold uncertainty will challenge even the biggest disbeievers on the skid row to hell.So my recommendation must be to have a try, i think youll catch the bait at some point, the premisses are all there, its just not used brilliantly enough thinks the grumpy old man. Doupt is the keyword to the film, dont let that scare you away from a view into the realms of religious spiritology.",The Unholy
11,Thanos_Alfie,Good enough...,5,22 June 2021,"""The Unholy"" is a Mystery - Horror movie in which we watch a young girl starting hear and speak after visited by Virgin Mary. She also help other people by curing them and more people come to her seeking help. Despite that, some terrifying events start to occur.I liked this horror movie because it had a simple but interesting plot consisted of some nice plot twists. The duration was good but I did not like some really unnecessary jump scares and bad CGI's that made me reconsider my opinion about this movie. The direction which was made by Evan Spiliotopoulos, it was good but I believe that it could be even better. The interpretations of both Cricket Brown who played as Alice and Jeffrey Dean Morgan who played as Gerry Fenn were very good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Unholy"" is a nice, entertaining horror movie to watch and spend your time so, I recommend you to watch it especially if you are fan of horror movies.",The Unholy

14,jtindahouse,Offers nothing to make up for being PG-13,4,28 May 2021,"PG-13 horror isn't a death-sentence for a film, but it is an awfully steep climb uphill to make it work. You have to have great characters, an investing story and a way to create tension and keep audiences on the edge of their seat. Unfortunately 'The Unholy' has none of those.The characters are painfully bland. Jeffrey Dean Morgan has a little bit of charisma and is mildly watchable but everyone else is playing a poorly written character - and playing them poorly to boot. The story here isn't investing in any way. Any twists the film think it has can be seen a mile off and because we have no care for any of the characters there is no reason for us to care at all. And the film never creates any tension. It has a lot of poorly executed jump-scares but nothing that is going to scare anyone in anyway. The PG-13 rating also ensures it can't actually show anything graphic when something does happen.This film is a mess. There are some really good horror movies that don't get cinematic releases, yet this one somehow did. Films like are ruining the genre. We must do better.",The Unholy
15,stevendbeard,Better Than Usual Storyline,6,3 April 2021,"I saw ""The Unholy"", starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan-The Walking Dead_tv, Rampage; Cricket Brown-Dukeland, Cheyenne; William Sadler-the Bill & Ted movies, Die Hard 2 and Cary Elwes-Black Christmas, No Strings Attached.This is a horror movie with a better than usual storyline. It's based on a book by James Herbert called 'Shrine'. Jeffrey is a down on his luck reporter. He was caught fabricating facts in his stories and summarily dismissed. He works freelance now and goes for the weird stories such as cattle mutilations. While investigating just such a story, he comes across Cricket. Cricket is a hearing impaired 18 year old girl that uses sign language to communicate-she doesn't talk at all-and lives with her uncle William. William just happens to be the priest at the local church. One day, Cricket starts talking and starts performing miracles. She makes a crippled boy walk, heals a man of emphysema, etc. She says that the Virgin Mary talks to her. Jeffrey has his doubts and thinks that it might be a different Mary talking to Cricket-one that might not be a virgin, perhaps? That's when the Bishop Cary comes to town to verify Cricket's deeds. There are several jump/scares; you know, like loud noises, sudden apparitions coming right at the camera, etc. At the end, there is a biblical passage shown on the screen from Matthew 7:15. If it's been a while since you went to Sunday school, it goes something like this; 'Beware of false profits, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves'.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, terror and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",The Unholy
16,kevin_robbins,This is a slightly above average addition to the genre I'd recommend viewing at least once,6,27 April 2021,"The Unholy (2021) is a movie the Mrs and I caught in theatres this week. The storyline focuses on a reporter who accidentally unleashes a spirit that has a history of possessions in a small town. This story has the chance to jumpstart the reporters career but at what risk? This movie is directed by Evan Spiliotopoulos in his directorial debut and stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Walking Dead), Cary Elwes (Princess Bride), William Sadler (Demon Knight) and Cricket Brown. The storyline for this movie is just okay and reminded me; in terms of pace, look and feel, of a newer revitalized Darkness Falls. The acting in this is okay and I loved Jeffrey Dean Morgan's performance. Sadler also delivered his performance very, very well and you could relate to his character. The scare elements, while relying heavily on CGI, is very well done. There's several well done scenes that causes jump scares that are fun. I also liked all the scenes with the spirit and thought they presented her well. Overall this is a slightly above average addition to the genre I'd recommend viewing at least once. I'd score this a 6.5/10.",The Unholy

Morgan is a good actor & you like his character & he's decent enough to follow on this tale of demonic Religious horror. Father Hagan played by one of my all time favourite actors: William Sadler gives a decent performance as the small Religious towns Father of god but he does do some stupid things such as continue smoking even when he's given a second chance at life!!! Stupid idiot but Bill Sadler is good & just having him in this as a supporting character gives the film a bit more quality as Sadler is a genre favourite & seeing his name come up is exciting right away.The small country town with it's chilly winter setting makes everything feel more creepy & gothic & it looks good & reminded me of 90's Stephen King films for some reason but i dug it's old school vibe. There is a spooky atmosphere at work & nice moody cinematography.I'm an ATHEIST & think all that Religious stuff is bull & weird cult stuff but i Don't mind it in a film because hey it's all made-up entertainment.Here a small town becomes a major site for Miracle phenomena & supernatural stuff when a local hearing-impaired girl starts to hear the virgin mary speak to her & use her to get her messages out to the public & start healing the locals but of course all is not what it seems as an evil demonic spirit has taken the form of Mary & is tricking the world.Lots of silly but fun stuff happens in this Religious themed horror & it's just a fun late-night flick that i did enjoy.",The Unholy

25,aidanratesmovies,Religious Horror for a new generation,7,1 July 2021,"Although it can be rather predictable, The Unholy is thankfully a very entertaining and well acted little horror flick that does what it came to do. This is not a bad film, but rather an enjoyable horror flick that has its problems. Some reviewers may disagree with me, but I enjoyed the performance of Jeffrey Dean Morgan in the lead role, and felt he was pretty much a perfect fit for a lead throughout the film. Cricket Brown as Alice though is by far the films greatest standout, as she not only is the best actor in the film, but does a great job making you believe her as well as care for her throughout the films entire run. The script is a bit formulaic, I definitely felt it wearing down to cheap uses of the formula towards the second half of the film. It starts out rather intriguing, but it feels like it cuts too many corners as it goes on to be as good as it potentially could have been. Some of the CGI in the film is quite obvious, although I like the look of the demon nevertheless. The look of the film in general is fantastic- a haunted winter look that truly fits the vibe of the film- and the cinematography is quite good as well. Scenes can be tense and creepy, but you won't exactly get any huge scares throughout the film. Atmosphere is its main intention, and greatest asset when it comes to its scariness- and its jump scares can feel a bit cheap. The film itself though is very entertaining to watch, and you most certainly will not be bored while viewing it. It also provides some fascinating dialogue on truth and faith that I also feel are some of the stronger moments of the film. In the end, The Unholy is far from perfect, but it is an enjoyable horror flick nevertheless.My Rating: 7.4/10.",The Unholy
26,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Concept to a Tough Genre to Do Well,8,7 April 2021,"This was a movie that I actually have to thank Kate Pollack for turning me on to. We were chatting on a post about sub-genres we enjoy and she asked if I planned to see this. I don't watch trailers, but I did look into this and it peaked my interest. Jaime decided to see it with me as well when we went to a local theater. The synopsis here is a hearing-impaired girl is visited by the Virgin Mary and can suddenly hear, speak and heal the sick. As people flock to witness her miracles, terrifying events unfold.We start this movie off back in 1845. We are seeing a point of view of a woman being executed for being a witch. The mask of Satan is nailed to her face, she is hung from a tree and set on fire. What I found interesting here is that we never move away from this and it is quite horrific what happens to her. The last thing is that the man in charge holds up a doll that is wrapped in a chain to prevent her from coming back.The movie then takes us to Gerry Fenn (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). His editor wants him to investigate a lead about a cow in New England that has a mark on it. Gerry is reluctant, but we see he is on hard times. What we will learn later was that he was one of the top journalists in the world, but he was fabricating stories and was caught. The lead he follows turns out to be nothing. Something catches his eye by an odd, old tree and it is a doll. The farmer states it is a corn baby for luck. Gerry notices it has the impossible date of February 31st, 1845 on it. To help beef up his story, he breaks the head of the doll and takes pictures of it.That night as Gerry heads home, he almost hits a woman in the road. This causes him to crash and he gets out seeing what happened. The young woman is Alice (Cricket Brown). He follows her through the woods to the tree from earlier. He hears her whispering to it and touches her shoulder. She is taken to the local doctor of Natalie Gates (Katie Aselton). She is irate with Gerry and warns him if anything happens to the young woman, she will see he's put in jail.Gerry stays the night and the next day goes to church. Alice is an orphan and stays there as Father Hagan (William Sadler) is her uncle. Alice is also a deaf/mute, but Gerry thinks he heard her talk. Something amazing happens. Alice is hearing something and it causes her to stand up in the middle of Father Hagan's sermon. She goes outside to the tree and all of a sudden, she starts talking. She says that the Virgin Mary has spoken with her. That she has healed her and that they should all pledge their faith to her. Alice the next day also feels a little boy with muscular dystrophy.As word gets around, Bishop Gyles (Cary Elwes) and Monsignor Delgarde (Diogo Morgado) are called in to prove the validity of the miracle. Gerry also befriends Alice and obtains exclusive rights to report on this. This seems to be a shot at redemption for his career. The problem though, is the entity speaking and helping Alice really the Virgin Mary? Or is it something much more sinister?Where I want to start with my analysis here is that I should lead off stating this is one of my favorite sub-genres of film. It is interesting as I'm not religious, but religion does fascinate me and even more so with the conventions that this movie is using with it.Since this movie is starting off with the execution of the witch, I will start there. We get quite a bit of films on either side here where they are actually killing a witch or doing it in error of a more barbaric time. This could be considered a spoiler, but Mary Elnor (Marian Mazepa) is actually a witch. She did have a pact with the devil. I do like that there are records in this movie to help fill in this back-story. Going along with this, I do have a minor gripe that the mask of Satan wasn't removed, as it is something that is supposed to limit them. It does make for cool images so I get why keeping it until a reveal later. There are also hand drawn images of popular things that will pop up regularly in movies like this.Where I want to shift to next would be Gerry. He was on top of the world in his profession, but we learn as it goes on, he did some corrupt things to stay there. I like that he is capitalizing on what is in front of him. He is greedy and prideful. He is also the reason that everything happens in this movie as well. I do believe he would do these things and Morgan's cocky attitude he brings to the role helps a lot. This also becomes a redemption tale for him that I liked.Next I think I will take on the elephant in the room for this movie, religion, and the corruption there. Father Hagan is a good guy. He is raising Alice, who since her parents died has grown up in the church. She is innocent and this entity is capitalizing on it. It also heals her hearing and ability to talk. The seduction there makes sense. Father Hagan is worried as the word of what happened here gets out, ruining Alice's life like it has for others that discovered things like this. They used real events which makes it even more impactful. Father Hagan wants to protect her. This is all good aspects to it though; I do need to say that. Monsignor Delgarde is also good in my opinion. He is there to try to disprove it, but I think we should question our beliefs. Despite him coming off as hard, he just wants to make sure the validity and does seem to want to protect Alice as much as he can.This movie does explore the horrors of Catholicism and religion in general. Bishop Gyles really just wants to further the church whether it is through publicity or monetary. He seems nice at first, but is a scoundrel. We also have all of the followers who come and believe in Alice. I really think that this movie is pointing out the fact that many followers of religion do it blindly. I can see getting sucked in. Alice can talk and hear when she has never been able to. Toby Walsh (Danny Corbo) couldn't walk and now he is. Father Hagan had emphysema and she cures it, which at this time isn't possible. There are things there that can blind followers. This movie has a commentary on not blindly following and to question at all times. There is also a miracle that happens in the movie I wasn't a big fan of. I get why it is there though. It just goes against a personal preference for me.I really think that is everything I wanted to go into for the story. Next I want to talk about the acting. Morgan fits his role perfectly. He brings a bit of sarcasm and just charisma to the role. I feel like he would be this photographer. Elwes is actually solid here as well. I like that at first he seems like he could be good, but there is something there you don't trust. It makes sense as the movie goes on with reveals. Sadler is solid as Father Hagan. I'm not sure I've ever seen him in a bad role. Brown does great as Alice. She has an innocence about her that is needed. Aselton, Morgado and the rest of the cast fit for what was needed as well. The last person I would give props as well to Mazepa who is the witch of MarySome thing else that I needed to go into would be the effects. This movie does relay on jump-scares. I'll admit, there was a couple that got me which doesn't happen often. I will say that seeing this Jaime might have been part of the reason, but I'll still give credit. I do think that when they go with practical effects, those looked good to me. Seeing the dark entity I thought was creepy. Also getting to see what Alice is seeing with Mary bathed in light was good. There is some CGI fire that doesn't look good though. I did notice some other parts here as well with the CGI that don't work for me. Aside from that I would say that the cinematography was good as well.Then really the last thing to go into would be the sound design and soundtrack. For the former, I think they use it strategically. I like they quickly establish that Alice is deaf with having no sound. It has a subtle shift that she can now hear and I liked that. There are some musical cues for jump-scares. I'm not always the biggest fan there. I would say that on the whole though, the music works for what was needed.In conclusion here, I really liked this movie. Seeing the score on the Internet Movie Database and hearing that this was paint by numbers for a movie like this, I can see that. I'll probably be higher than most due to the social commentary and what I can take from it. I think the concept here is interesting. The acting was good in my opinion. The effects I'm positive on for the most part and I would say about the same for the soundtrack/design as well. To close this out here, I don't think everyone really enjoy this as much as I did. I'd say for me this is a good movie and would recommend if this sub-genre works for you. This is another movie that I do want to revisit before the end of the year as well to see where I said with a second viewing.",The Unholy
27,vengeance20,One Of The Best Supernatural Horror Films I've Seen In A While!,9,20 May 2021,"So, I've just come back from a viewing of this & was quite surprised as to how good it was!The film follows a young girl who suddenly has the power to heal people through the Virgin Mary Spirit, but a dark & twisted revelation is about to be uncovered by a journalist.I found the film to be very good! It was engaging, sinister & had plenty of creepy scenes & visuals through it's every growing story which locks you in from the start! The pacing & runtime of 1 hour & 32 minutes was pretty great & the ending for once in films like this, was happy & conclusive!There were a few familiar faces I noticed from others Films/TV Shows. William Sadler from the epic Die Hard 2 & Cary Elwes from the Iconic Saw Films! So that was good, even though there were a lot of other unknowns I didn't notice but that was alright for me!I don't get the negative reviews for this film at all, it's one of the best Supernatural Horror flicks I've seen in a long while & this is coming from someone who usually loves gory slasher films!Overall, give it a watch, you won't be disappointed! 9/10.",The Unholy
28,omendata,As a James Herbert Fanatic this is slightly disappointing but not unexpected!,6,7 June 2021,"I have read every book the horror genius, that is James Herbert, has ever written. It was a very sad day when he passed to the other side and to be honest, I do not think it is possible to convert any of his books, realistically, to a movie format; although possibly the best and truest to the book from which it came was ""Haunted (1995)"" although while not a good port from the book I also enjoyed ""The Survivor (1981)"".There is really no way in hell (pardon the pun) that any movie can take the atmosphere, character development, story development, and creative horror genius that exists in the writing of JH (Who incidentally, I rate above Stephen King and even Clive Barker as the best horror writer of all time). What can I say? I have read all the books and never been disappointed with any from the Rats to the final Ash novel, he will be sadly missed.As for the movie, who does not like Jeffrey Dean Morgan? From TWD and his masterful performance as Neegan to his role in this, he never disappoints and to be fair, although the movie really does not do the book any justice, how can it? It would take a series to convert any James Herbert Novel to the silver screen but the problem with this is that it is not really very scary and the horror is somewhat tame with a really poor ending that feels so rushed, it really leaves the viewer feeling rather cheated!It is unfair to compare any movie to the book it was taken from, so I am merely reviewing this impartially as an honest review of a new horror film without pointing out where the book differs or criticising it based on that and so I am giving it a fair 6 hatchets out of 10 on the horror scale - JDM elevates it above the base average 5 stars it would have been without him!",The Unholy

Since Rosemary's Baby and the Exorcist, there have been some pretty good religious horrors every now and then. But they are far less and less frequent in the present. I don't know if it is the new film directors who don't know how to make them right, they don't care or that society has become almost completely secular. But the current films show little imagination and plagued with mediocrity and inaccuracies, that my affection for this genre has all but disappeared.Straight off the bat, the CGI creature ruined it right from the beginning for me. There isn't a build up of mystery. This is just another dumb jump scare film. Even the religious statues look dopey.The writer doesn't understand Catholicism, yet he feels he is qualified to make a Catholic horror movie based on what I suppose might have been watching dozens of other failed films projects and copying their ideas.This film is a complete disappointment.",The Unholy

The ""twist"" of the film was already obvious, but they decided to remind you of it several more times in different scenes.Was it so hard to refine the script to make it at least interesting to watch? The obsolescence of the story itself is also very much felt, my God, if the director had ripped off at least the 1994 X-Files episode ""Miracle Man"" and added his non-scary spooky CGI stuff to it, it would have been somewhat watchable.Who thought that badly rendered pixels running after the main characters would scare anyone?The ending is just a clownery of bad computer effects, no more no less.At first, certain actors even tried, but in time they realized what have they gotten themselves into and stopped caring. Thanks at least for the chance to laugh at the dialogue between Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Cary Elwes, in which the priest asked why JDM wanted to sacrifice his career for this. I'm pretty sure he was talking about the movie, and his chuckle was absolutely sincere.Actually, it's so bad and incompetent that I even stopped laughing at the dumb dialogue at some point.I personally ask the director, please don't make any more horror movies.

36,Hayden-86055,Solid thriller relying heavily on religious themes (hence the title!),6,29 May 2021,"If I was to best describe this film I'd call it a mix between the Conjuring and the Omen. It is a good film, no doubt there, the acting is technically good, the effects are strong (shocking frequent criticisms of poor CGI, I thought it was fine) and the plot holds together in such a way that the film is genuinely interesting.However, I think the characters could have been developed better. There are scenes that edge on character development like Mary being given a music CD by Gerald but we never hear from it again or how she enjoyed it or whatnot, even a 30 second scene of her listening to the music would have strengthened her character and reminded us of their relationship but we weren't given that. Cary Elwes's character, who's a bishop seems to be painted as one of the main villains who wants to profit (maybe?) from Mary's visions but we're never really shown his true motives, indeed the fact he sent a sceptic there to try to disprove them hints that his motives are contradictory and confusing to an audience.Overall the film does hold together and despite valid critiques it doesn't deserve low ratings (just 5/10 at the time of this review)6/10: Nearing on a 7 but there are too many faults to overlook in an otherwise enjoyable horror flick with expertly crafted jump scares and a scary monster.",The Unholy

Quite woefully things didn't go as planned! Largely on account of its pathetic writing and borderline whimsical presentation.I would like to pose a question, What on earth is this about? The redemption story of an unscrupulous journalist? A deaf-mute teenager's uncanny encounter with shady miracles? A century-old evil spirit's long-sought vengeance? Or is it one of those undisclosed chapters from the book of John Winchester?! (Supernatural fans could relate) :-DJokes aside, I have always been in favor of exploratory projects. Especially in the context of Storytelling and differing approaches! Besides, Looking at the somber situation that has slowly become of Horror films nowadays; some unorthodox & offbeat creativity wouldn't do much harm!Or so I thought!What we have here is a tragically uninspiring script with equally oversimplified character depictions. Regardless of technical competency, it is indeed an unmindful execution fraught with redundant genre-specific Clichés that couldn't be of much help! In the meantime, many lousy and irksome acts from the entire cast (Including Mr. Morgan, yeah you read that right) served as the final nail in the coffin!Horror movies are meant to be scary and unnerving right? They shouldn't come close to being anything comical, do they? Hate to admit, that is exactly what had happened here. I didn't get scared; not even for a minute.

But my opinion worth of sticking to this movie rather then watching Last Exorcism crap I thought this movie was well made I thought Jeffery Dean Morgan did well as main lead he did great job in movie as lead I always loved Jeffery Dean Morgan you can never go wrong with him he is a great actor as well always loved Losers, The Courier, Bus 657, Rampage, and him as Negan Walking Dead show I also liked his character that's what made film for me worth watching it wasn't just that it was more I liked story and direction they went threw, it was fast pacing and it wasn't that of bad movie it did have flaws but I handle better then those stupid ratings nowadays. I liked creative staff in film camera shots, the way how it was filmed it was creative very shots, special effects the look of demon was very well done funny enough this film was shot last year.

When filming resumed, due to CDC guidelines there could be no more than 10 background actors on set together at once, forcing director to use ""the same people in five different places I doubt it was tough to film during COVID-19 while it was happening last year I hoped everyone was saved during filming a horror movie that has something to do with faith and religion during COVID-19 hoping everyone to be safe.Story follows an a disgraced journalist Gerry Fenn (Jeffery Dean Morgan) he is also a drinker and specially he drinks and drive witch makes him more disgraced and also he got people fired in agency for some reason because he staffed up look his character is kinda of d*ck for being a disgraced character but it's not like you wanna hate him or say I hope his character does die no you like his character but sametime he is nice person clamming as well. Gerry hopes to revive his career visits small new England town to investigate about this girl allice (Cricket Brown) is a young 18 year old girl with hearing impaired witch means she is deaf as word comes to her after supposed visitation from Virgin Mary she prayed to her everytime then a miracle thing happened to her is now she can hear, speak then when she had a power to heal people she starts performing miracles. She makes a crippled boy walk, heals a man of emphysema, She says that the Virgin Mary talks to her. Gerry has his doubts and thinks that it might be a different Mary talking to Cricket-one that might not be a virgin, perhaps? That's when the Bishop Cary comes to town to verify Cricket's deeds. Gerry investages more about it he starts asking questions like phenomena are in works of Virgin Mary or if it's more sinister that's what you find out in this movie and also her uncle, Father Hagan (William Slather) didfine in film he does what he does in film. I thought this had many flaws CGI and jump scenes weren't the best at all and many more witch their is too many to explain so many punching holes on movie but what made it enjoyable is Jeffery Dean Morgan as lead he does fine in movie he has Morgan fits his role perfectly. He brings a bit of sarcasm and just charisma to the role. I feel like he would be this photographer. Elwes is actually solid here as well. I like that at first he seems like he could be good, but there is something there you don't trust about him witch other side of his character is a disgraced journalist I thought jumpscenes just don't care about it at all jumpscenes if it scares you that's fine but I thought 1 scary scene scared me rest of it didn't. Talking about cast I read somewhere apparently Jordana Brewster was gonna be in movie but somehow she didn't appear witch it was strange it didn't say if she dropped out or left role or couldn't go out state because of COVID-19 I was wondering what character was she gonna play?? Was she gonna be Dr Natalie Gates as (Katie Asslton) role to me I think that would be her role it seems like it she is 40 years old now and and Katie Asslton is 42 years old make sense but I would prefer to have Jordana Brewster in movie as Dr Natalie Gates I don't know why but I think because I know Jordana Brewster from Fast and Furious franchise and many more films and shows she is known more like Lethal Weapon show, Dallas many more. Director Evan Spiliotopoulos director of film is his first film but he is more of writer for movies then a director I mean it's his first film not his 10th or 20th film but I thought it wasn't his best but I thought he did great job making film but writing and ending was just so many punching holes in film he made storyline of film fun ride and it had so much potential in it but in sametime it's time waster film I wish it was a Netflix film rather then a cinema release this is a type of movie you will see it at Netflix, and theirs not much to movie as well finale wasn't huge wasn't big huge but I think because of COVID they couldn't spend too much time for movie that's why it goes for 1 hour 1h 39 minutes I am suspired why finale of film wasn't huge.

Actually, despite the summary of it all, ""The Unholy"" was quite decent at times, especially when it didn't try to scare us.Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays a journalist who likes to scheme a little too much - after yet unknown hiccups in his life, he's looking for stories in a small town, and lands a huge one, a miracle. A local hearing-impaired girl is visited by the spirit of Virgin Mary, who cures her, and makes her able to heal the sick.

Based on a very notable horror novelist James Herbert's work, ""The Unholy"" offers a known, but intriguing premise, and works best when it's a performance/character drama. Said premise is, in the end, pretty thin though. Anything more than the synopsis would be spoilers. The future plot lays out clearly and fast, making the already choppy pacing even less gripping. Every performance is solid, and every time I keep hoping that the next Morgan's horror movie won't land straight into the oblivion of forgotten films. This is the fourth.It's a flick that doesn't raise whole lotta discussion, but how about those scares? Rarely have I disliked a horror movie for being a horror movie... The evil Unholy is mostly whacky cgi, uninspired spook design, real lousy jump scares, and brings with itself the atmosphere of cheese and goof. I'm almost certain ""The Unholy"" could've been a better movie if the fears were psychological and in the air, rather than jumping around screeching.

It's a shame.The idea of a demon posing as the Virgin Mary in the body of a once mute/deaf girl, who is performing medical miracles in exchange worshipping devotion, is original.The idea of evil hiding in plain sight (Guy Pearce's The Seventh Day, among others comes to mind) isn't new - the backstory was. A dash of Salem Witch trials mixed with local lore surrounding kern-babies and some generic pure evil from Hell.The miracles are being documented by a disgraced reporter who is seeking redemption and an underdeveloped young priest, who the church has assigned to verify the veracity of the miracles. All great...
...and then cheap jump scares accompanied by loud music and a hokey creature quickly take an intelligent horror story and turn it into forgettable nonsense - one scene is borrowed directly from The Nun, which is in contention for the worst franchise picture ever made.This could have part of the Conjuring Universe - a few tweaks to the story...and bam. Instead of a reporter, you'd have Ed and Lorrain Warren...ending with a Kern Doll being carefully placed on a shelf in their ""off-limits"" room.With all that, I think the good outweighs the bad here and the parts that work are very good. A score of 5 (average) is fair.Cheers.",The Unholy

Director: Evan Spiliotopoulous
Starring: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Cricket Brown, William Sadler, Cary Elwes, Katie Aselton, Christine Adams, Diogo Morgado etcOverall rating 67/100The unholy is about a hearing-impaired girl who is visited by the virgin Mary and can suddenly hear, speak, and heal the sick. As people flock to witness her miracles, terrifying events unfold. Are they the work of Virgin Mary or something more sinister.The unholy was pretty good but had the potential to be so much better. The opening was very effective in setting up the tone of the film. The cinematography was excellent, I liked the clever links with previous scenes. The creature designs were pretty good. The main characters were pretty interesting, and their connection and chemistry was strong. I liked the balance to the main conflict of the film. The main character was very likeable. Towards the second half of the film the jumpscares were very effective and the scenes were very tense. I liked the development of the plot, the clever links to the flashback which pieced the film together well, and the final act was scary and entertaining.However, it was fairly generic. There was predictable and frustrating character decisions. There was a lot of lapses in the logic with some scenes. The editing was very poor in places, making it feel very choppy and unprofessional at times. There was way to much exposition with the main character. The pacing was fairly slow, with too many filler conversations. The film took a while to find its feet and actually get scary. There was also a lack of character depth, some scenes were very repetitive, and I thought the ending was terrible.So overall, The unholy is a fairly effective horror, with interesting themes, with good tension and jumpscares. And the cast did a pretty good job with what they had. But the film had the potential to be so much more, and got too caught up in its own mistakes that it came across as cheap and poorly done.",The Unholy

57,movieman6-413-929510,"By doing too much himself, the director ruins his own fan film.",3,19 July 2021,"The Unholy is a new horror film directed and written by Evan Spiliotopoulos, this is his first work as a director.In the film, after a visit from the Virgin Mary, young deaf and mute Alice (Cricket Brown) is able to hear, talk again and is given the gift of healing other sick people. Journalist Gerry Fenn (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) investigates Alice and the miracle that happened to her in hopes of restarting his career. During his investigation, he begins to wonder if all the miracles are really the work of the Blessed Virgin Mary or if there is something dark behind all the miracles.The director of this film wanted to make the film after reading the book Shrine by writer James Herbert on which he based the film. You can see from the film that this is the first film that the director has directed. The director chooses to show and let you know more as a viewer than the characters in the film. This way you as a viewer are ahead of the characters, so that the film quickly gets a predictable and slow playback speed
The bad effects also show that this is only the director's first film. He has chosen to quickly reveal the entity behind the miracles in the film to viewers. So you can quickly see that this creature was placed in the film with cheap CGI. The incredibility of this creature makes you laugh almost more than it really scares you. The fire in the film is also clearly CGI rather than real fire. The director also tries to scare the viewer more by only using jump scares, most of which are too predictable to work.The acting isn't done very well in the film by the film's cast either, as many characters don't seem very impressed with what's happening in the film. This is probably because the actors couldn't watch or really react to anything during the events of the film. Jeffrey Dean Morgan tries his best to carry the film as the lead, but due to the bad script, he doesn't really succeed. For a better horror movie starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan, check out the 2012 movie The Possession.",The Unholy

59,darkreignn,Painfully generic - what a waste of a unique premise,4,5 April 2021,"""The Unholy"" has one of the most interesting premises for a horror movie that I've seen in recent years: What if Marian apparitions, though apparently divine, were in reality demonically influenced? It's a really intriguing plot that I was looking forward to experiencing on the big screen, so I headed down to the theatre on Easter Sunday (sacrilegious, I know), and I was honestly pretty excited. And I'm proud to announce that this movie is akin to a religious experience, because when the credits rolled I prayed for forgiveness for wasting my time watching such a mediocre movie.""The Unholy"" isn't a bad film - it's just painfully average and generic. It has a goldmine at its disposal with its clever premise, and instead it throws every good idea by the wayside to instead fill its running time with cheap jump scares and lazy exposition. You've already seen all the tricks this movie has up its sleeve, and you've seen them done better a countless number of times before. A demon infecting a computer? Check. A face popping out of a body of water? Check. A character turning around and getting scared by a demon lunging toward them? Check. I was shocked to see all of the exact same excuses for scares that have already been utilized so many times before.At its core, the movie follows Jeffrey Dean Morgan as he reports on Cricket Brown's character, Alice, a deaf, mute girl who suddenly can hear and speak after a visit from who she claims is the Virgin Mary. Jeffrey and Cricket were the only good things about this film, and the movie was honestly lucky to have them; Cricket was especially good in her role, convincingly playing a sweet, overly religious girl who thinks that, for once in her life, she's being chosen for a higher purpose. Every time Cricket is on screen she steals the show - unfortunately, she isn't on screen for that much, and instead the movie focuses on horrendously boring exposition.A large majority of this film centers on Jeffrey's character speaking to other characters about things that are happening, or things that have happened. I'm not even going to go in any more detail because it was extremely boring to watch, and I don't want to relive those moments through my words. Instead, I'll talk about another thing that the movie did do well: The scenes where Mary was working her magic through Cricket were genuinely riveting, displaying a talent in front of and behind the camera. Mary, through Alice, heals the sick and makes the disabled walk, and the scenes are filmed beautifully and feel holy. They're a nice contrast to the inevitable evil that's displayed as the film goes on, but unfortunately, nothing comes close to the competence demonstrated in those scenes. The rest of the film is a generic slog, jam-packed with highly telegraphed jump scares and lazy dialogue.If you're a fan of horror films, you'll probably want to check out ""The Unholy."" And if you do, may God have mercy on your soul. This isn't a movie that I hated watching, but it's one that I found highly disappointing due to the squandering of such a unique premise.",The Unholy

It focuses more on the human characters rather than the demon for the first half. You see sprinkles of the demon popping up here and there, but it's mostly faith based. The story surrounds a girl who is deaf and then can suddenly hear, and claims that a holy entity called Mary, healed her. Others gather around her and want to be healed as well, while others in the religious community are skeptic. Meanwhile there is something sinister lurking underneath the surface.

94,seige-hound,Sunday School Lesson disguised as a horror movie,5,15 April 2021,"Listen, I have no issue with religious themes in movies, including horror movies. One of my favourite films is the Conjuring, which is also very heavy handed in its religious themes. However, The Unholy takes the cake in this regard, to the point where the film ends with a Bible verse, as if it was an episode of VeggieTales.So the Unholy follows two main characters, a down on his luck journalist who makes ends meet by working for a shady conspiracy website, and a young deaf woman, who inexplicably gains the ability to hear and speak, and credits the Virgin Mary as the source of this healing.The film is more or less a parable about false prophets and healthy skepticism even within religion. One of the side characters is in fact a priest who is hired by the Vatican to approach the alleged miracles committed by the Virgin Mary with a sense of skepticism. In this film, God exists, but is a more distant, measured version, while the Devil takes the initiative and pretends to be God to fulfill his misdeeds. This moral is very heavy handed, which leads more atheistic horror fans such as myself wondering if I'm the intended audience, or if this is a very misguided attempt at making a movie to show at Youth Group.Aside from this, there's a few other issues with the film. The main antagonist, the false 'Virgin Mary', is not very scary. In fact the design of the character is very odd, especially after she is 'unmasked' at the end, looking like a cartoony version of Red Skull. The creators of the film get around this design flaw with copious amounts of jump scares, which begs the question as to why any of the main characters believe that the false Mary is the real Mary in the first place, if every second or so she is jump scaring one of the main characters.However, I will give the film credit for at least having a bit of imagination, and not being as ashamed of its religious themes as many other supernatural horror movies out there are. This film at least has some gusto to name drop the Virgin Mary, Jesus, and God, which is surprisingly rare in these movies. Even in movies where the Catholic Church features heavily, movie producers seem to try and fenagle their ways around being explicit in their themes, in order to not offend or alienate anyone, but this movie does the opposite. It is a very Catholic, very Christian movie, for better and for worse.I didn't hate it, probably as much as I should, but it could have been a lot better.",The Unholy

As Gerry pushes the story of miracle to the world he senses something sinister might be lurking behind the shadows.The Unholy is a merging of two different films.

Creepy atmosphere, great acting, fitting soundtrack and some effective jump-scare.It would have been a great film if it continued in the same direction but the second half took a different direction. It focused on discussion on faith vs. Doubt, god vs. Devil. I found it a bit like the Messiah (2020). The production value dropped a bit in the second half as well.Over all this is an entertaining film that deserves higher rating than the current...

It just wasn't anything special. The acting by JDM and the girl who plays Alice was very good. I would have liked to have seen their dynamic explored a bit more. They obviously felt a kinship, but why?I don't usually include spoilers in reviews but two things really bugged me about this movie. First off the date they hung the witch was 1845? That was 20 years before the civil war, I don't think witches were still a big thing then. Would have been much more believable if it had been 1645, around the time of the witch trials. The other thing is Mary was only able to manifest through her decedents so when Alice dies, Mary dies. Then JDM goes and prays Alice alive again and she comes back to life. Doesn't that open the door for Mary to come back as well? Maybe they just did it for a sequel but it kind of defeats the whole point of the story.

Produced by Sam Raimi through its Ghost House Pictures banner, it stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Katie Aselton, William Sadler, Diogo Morgado, Cricket Brown, and Cary Elwes.Being one of the first major horror releases of 2021, The Unholy comes with a fairly interesting concept. After seeing the trailer I thought such a concept could lead to some thought provoking subject matter. But this does boil down to being a pretty textbook and bland movie. A spirit has influence over somebody, can our hero exorcise the demon?The acting is pretty good. Silly things happen like, a character walking into a room and finding a book that tells them the entire history of the demon, he does research in the archives and finds out some insignificant information that's supposed to add new depth to the story but doesn't. The monster looks quite awful and we only see practical FX for the monster in the final scene. The final act is brutally rushed. They completely neglected the corruption of the church plot line, terribly underdeveloped.Truthfully just not really many positive things to say about this one.

The Grudge remake was terrible.This movie tries to be serious albeit at times it should be, especially when it comes to talking about the mixed topic of spirituality/rationalism and the (most) unholy, the multimedia networks. HOWEVER, the conversations about the topic of faith are reasonable and the ending should please people of both sides.Jeffery Dean Morgan. That's all I have to say. The man is Negan and you'll see his a**hole antics as well his emotional side as well (Walking Dead reference)They do talk about real-life shrines where humans may have witnessed signs of the Holy Mary; though used to push the plot that maybe it could have been evil. Whilst the message is ""When God builds a church, the Unholy builds one next door"" is a good message it's kind of bad-taste to reference historic events as if they were akin to it being evil. That's my only gripe about it. Believe in what you want as long as you aren't physically hurting other people. I'm a certain denomination/non-denomination of Christianity and I'm fine with skepticism. Conversation is important instead of hate.The special effects are piss-poor until the ending of the third act. I don't know who's pulling Sam Raimi's puppet strings but he is way better than this. Every jump-scare you can intercept as if you were watching The Curse of LaLlarona. You can see Sam Raimi's attempts at making a monster and it definitely shows at the end, however, the only true scary moment is the beginning where we see the monster's face get a mask nailed into it. I mention Lallarona because the introduction to the movie is the scariest as well.

Of course the male lead did (I'm a big fan of Supernatural, also I hear he's quite good on The Walking Dead which I need to watch). Really, if the acting had been worse, I would have probably turned off the movie.It's a shame such acting was wasted on a lazy story with many logic holes and jump scares. I can't stand cheap jumpscares, and this movie had many. At least 5 or 6 were THE EXACT SAME THING. Also, they were always extremely predictable... and cheap.This movie has 0 concept of subtlety in its writing or its scares.As for the logic holes, it's never quite detailed how the evil spirit (I guess spirit is the best term, since it's unclear if ghost or demon is the cause) is in multiple places at once many times throughout the film, during key moments even. I don't want to give anything away (even though the trailer pretty much tells you what the movie is about).For what it is, it should be a shorter film. It definitely dragged because I was constantly dreading the next jumpscare (I'm not jumpy or easily scared but they make me feel unpleasant). Frankly, this film would have been so much better without the jumpscares (or the amount of them, at least). As I said, the acting was great, the premise was great (though not unique), but they completely phoned it in regarding everything else. Well, the main character's story was pretty decent, but helped by the acting of course.For a better recent horror film regarding religious themes, I recommend you watch Saint Maud instead.

Alice has gone from 9 to 18 to attract teen boys presumably :DJames Herbert is a horror legend and is my main inspiration for my own writing (under a pen name) so to me this is like pissing on his grave.If you haven't read the book - 6/10 - if you have 3/10.

For the movie I'm not sure if all the family names are true, at least some are I believe. This Genre is part horror, maybe part gothic, and part religion and women's right in the 1600's. The actors are good also and really show the rank of the Church from Bishop, Priest, Padre, sinner, and sacrifice to God. I usually rank films in horror by if there's been many released that year, how good it is compared to other films and if it original and not a copy of another film. I enjoyed it, special effects are good, it seems like a 90 minute film and that's what I expect and they weren't trying to make it worse or better than it is.

The cinematography looked like something made by CBS. And honestly, I think this would work as series. The Walking Dead is about to run its course and JDM needs a new tv vehicle. This would sit well on FX, AMC, or maybe streamer. Obviously, other stories would have to be explored, but 'Gerry Finn' could certainly carry a demon-of-the-week series. Yes, it would feel a lot like ""Evil (CBS)"" or ""The Exorcist (Fox)"" but I think it could be its own thing. Surely we could squeeze 3 or 4 seasons out of it.As for the movie, it was exactly what I expected it to be. Reviewers who said they walked out, or gave it a 1 star review just expected more than this was ever meant to be.

A priest no longer shows any trace of his terminal lung cancer. This causes a sensation and media/social media frenzy leading her to be identified as the chosen one.But things are about to get more complicated as the beginning sequence of the film foreshadows. Suddenly terrible things begin to happen. Is this really the work of God, or the devil in disguise? To the detriment of the film, you won't wonder too long because the movie too soon explains exactly what's going on. This ultimately keeps the film from building any real tension or suspense.I was hoping this would be like The Omen or The Exorcist. But instead of getting chilling, unnerving, and creepy, I had to settle for a bunch of The Grudge type jump scares and CGI demons.The film is not a complete loss. I wasn't bored.

I mean the big character is supposed to bet he girl that is supposed to be deaf and mute but within five minutes of the movie she is already talking so you can't even get invested in her. Then she just talks so much. Then you have the main guy that was supposed to be disgraced for writing some fake story that you never find out what its about and now he's this hot shot. I don't know maybe something happened at the end.I mean there is nothing about the characters that make you want to root for them, see them succeed, see them do anything.

Hmmm I would think thats a red flag.So they go to the church archives and find the same book that the priest had that proved Mary was a demon...hmmm..I dont buy it. When did he bring it there and why would he bring it there? Why not bring it somewhere so you can tell people and show them the proof that its a demon doing these miracles.Also they found that book in the basement pretty quick. They barely had to look.So if I tell people I made the story up they are going to believe me over the boy who couldnt walk and the girl that couldnt here? Come on now...Hey I guess thats the placebo effect.Lastly if the girl was the last descendent and now shes dead so the demon is dead why would you want the girl to be alive again.

Third, even though the cast was full of unknowns (except the parish priest, who I've seen in other films), the acting was thoroughly natural and believable enough to keep me engaged.

203,hancifatih,Are these reviews for real?!,1,13 August 2021,"First of all, I agree that this movie deserves more than 1 star, but these reviews!!! Who tf gives this a 10?! During the pandemic people must've forgotten what a movie deserving of a 10 should look like. I had to BALANCE. So should you.Seeing that 13K+ people's votes landed this movie at around 5 points, I expected a decent, modern take on the good ol' religious topics. Yes, I was both wrong and right: this is one of those movies that you watch when you don't have anything else to do, and forget about it the other day.The premise is good. Not another exorcism movie where the lead has to crack her neck every other scene to make us believe that she's possessed. The main idea that's summed with one reference to the Bible in the end may not be totally original but it's a great dough to shape. Actors played well, blah blah blah...HOWEVER. Firstly, the CGI. Even YouTubers use better effects. The ""villain"" that was meant to scare me, or at least make me feel uncomfortable, MADE ME LAUGH. What was that?! The design of Mary's outlook makes so much sense actually and I would LOVE it, if it wasn't executed so badly. The movements, God, the movements... I lost count of how many eye-rolls I did. I think it'd be 10x better if it just hovered in the air like the classic ghosts. The ""I knew it was coming, and I actually hoped it wouldn't come, 'cause it is so cheap that it feels offensive"" scare-jumps didn't help either. And another, huge thing; the sudden change in characters' skepticism... and the dialogues that this caused. The contrast between the main characters would make the story a lot better, but suddenly everyone believes everything without questioning! It was way too fast for one of the characters to drop their disbelief, especially with the job he had, while he had been giving small but visible signals of a conflict coming up - but it never came. We don't even get to see the the story of why he was an ""outcast"", so to speak; it was like ""Yeah this character is not trusted because they did something in the past but we won't exactly tell what""... Umm... Ok? I guess... Moreover, he goes against his own personality and chooses what he's just (suddenly) started believing in over what he has wanted all his life... I mean, for a character to change this dramatically, something huge needs to happen. But nothing *that* huge happened in the movie; the lead could be a psycho, there could be an organisation behind all these, possibilites go on...Anyway, there were really a lot of spots in the story that had potential, but they would work only if the movie was shot as either an old-school horror, or a modern, slow-burn, even silent thriller. I guess soemone wanted to make it more ""scary"" while referencing other productions like Stigmata, The Grudge, Messiah and even Harry Potter (the death scenes are IDENTICAL), and they didn't want it to be more than 1.30 hours. Such a pity 'cause the connections between the characters, places and... items(?) could really serve to a better-executed story. DEFNITELY DOESN'T DESERVE MORE THAN 5.",The Unholy
204,cmhouser,Not a 10 and not a 2... see the forest through the trees,6,25 May 2021,"While The Unholy is DEFINITELY not a 10 or a 9... it ALSO isn't a 1 or a 2 (even a 3). First half of the movie feels like a different flick than the second half. First half sets things up and it's creepy and exactly what you'd expect. Second half, feels like a rush to the finish line. Almost like two different directors made this movie.I think people that are genuine and gave the movie a low score... likely had an issue with the script and pacing. However, it's definitely a fairly original take on the classic horror genre (demonic/possession). I'll admit, I'm a bit of a sucker for horror movies based around religion as generally they seem to be more interesting to me.That all said, I think the cast was good. Jeffrey Dean Morgan, William Sadler, Cary Elwes and Cricket Brown were all great. Cricket Brown was especially impressive because I believe this movie is one of her first larger productions and she gives the impression of being a pro in this department. At times, it felt like the cast was not as connected to the movie as they could be. Of course, the movie didn't feel connected to itself after 52 minutes and goes wildly into warp speed conclusions.Directing and Editing were just OK and could have been better IMO.. The script however could use some work. Even though the story felt like one we've seen a million times, I liked the premise and overall theme but the movie veers off and hits walls, then takes off at full speed before veering off into more walls. It provides the conclusions verses letting the audience figure them out. First half of the movie does a good setup job for the characters and direction. Second half of the movie ignores the setup, ignores the characters and goes straight to the source of the problems. It's like they spent a year recording the first half and a month on the second.Overall, not a bad movie. Entertaining for at least half the movie. Good premise. Good acting. Great new acting with Cricket Brown. But, hits a wall halfway through and never recovers. Solid 6 IMO due to acting and overall theme.",The Unholy

208,samthompson17,Jeffery Dean Morgan Chose This Film For A Reason,10,28 May 2021,"Without spoilers. I'm not in the habit of making reviews especially long drawn out ones. Unlike your usual jump scares and what's going on and befuddling it gets straight to the story. A underpaid journalist who used to make up stories that sell he now is doing stupid assignments for stupid money like $150 bucks after getting sacked for old antics. He's broke he's desperate, and Is told to look at some tedious case, he tries his old antics by making it into a story only this time he doesn't have to make anything up as he realises. It's faced paced. I love the interaction with him and the young girl, it's them who make the movie shine. It's not making your head explode with long drawn out moments. It gets into the heat of the story from the get go. It has everything for everyone even if you aren't a horror enthusiast but someone has made you watch it with them. It's original and that's why I see why JDM chose this as his next film project. Please don't listen to the bad reviews with a decent actor playing lead and the leading young lady whom they share a great connection in this it just makes you want to watch it more. Decide for yourself.I'm 30 mins in and I'm gripped and usually I turn off about then as some horrors are bad dialogue etc.Horror movies are always going to have bad ratings & reviews as they aren't real or realistic but that's why people watch them which is what these bad reviewers forget. It's a lot easier to be negative in this world then positive especially behind a keyboard. I've made a bad review don't get me wrong but it's not often I review anyway & it's only when I need to give a bad review.I'm going to review every movie I watch from now on if time. It won't be long but it might help get good films seen. It's why I always rate the movie once I've saw it, so it helps the rates but reviews are what makes a film be watched. I encourage you to do the same even if it's a few lines especially if you liked it but there's to many bad reviews. It will help some poor soul have faith into watching it.A TIP BELOW THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS MOVIE, IT ALSO GETS YOU MORE INVOLVED WITH IMDB, it will also help IMDb to recommend you with films your interested in.I also create lists, movies that I've watched, movies to avoid, shows I've seen, my fav shows etc. I do this as well cos boy I watch a lot of films/shows and due to that I forget what I've watched. So now after watching a film I add it to my list of watched. If you don't already do this I'd advise you to start to as I'm sure you've sat down to watch a movie at one point only to realise you've watched it before. Also always give movies 15-20 mins to see if it's your style. Some movies get better as they go along but that's just a select few films that do this.",The Unholy

Great acting throughout that helped an otherwise unoriginal and predictable story move flawlessly. I found this movie generally entertaining which is why I give this movie six stars. The horror genre has definitely been under fire from critics lately and the fact that it becomes increasingly harder to scare people does not help, and this movie is no exception. The visual effects were pretty terrible, the scares were few, but somehow it stayed captivating and steady-paced in the duration of the movie. Definitely a good watch.",The Unholy

They think that if you show scary things that it will automatically become scary. Scary music sounds all the time. It is a weakness: if your storytelling or visually fails, you use scary sounds. Drama and psychology are sacrificed for cheap jump scares. If you want to get scared at this level, you better watch The exorcist or The Omen, which are films that take the viewer and the theme seriously.

220,Umarfilmgeek,What more could you ask for from a horror film?,10,21 May 2021,"Seriously, why the low ratings?Everytime I watch a solid horror flick and I see low ratings, I always say this at the start of a review. I am a huge horror fan.From a young age, I snuck around my house, finding my parent's stash of horror video tapes and have been hooked ever since. I am no novice.Today was the first time in months, I went to the cinema. And boy, what a great movie to welcome me back.I won't go into an analysis and provide a commentary on the film, after all, that's what a trailer and a synopsis is about. I won't include any spoilers, I will just tell people who enjoy horrors, to watch this brilliant movie.Yes there's some clichés, yes there's a couple of jump scares (not that many tbh) and no it's not perfect. But the unholy is a masterful example of a solid horror film.It has a great backstory (yes a little predicable) but the lore is brilliant. The start of the movie is unnerving if you pay attention and that carries on throughout the film.The setting is brilliantly foreboding and the atmosphere is creepy as hell.The ""big bad"" of the film is creepy because it is so relavant to everything we see and encounter in this life. You just wonder, who are we really trusting. The CGI is unnecessary but that's the only bad thing about it. The evil being's voice is actually quite scary in one if the particular scenes, especially with the malice heard in its tone.Some creepy stuff happens during the course of the movie, with some unnerving imagery and ideas that are very thought provoking. All in all, I enjoyed this movie. It kept me invested from the beginning and to the end.If you appreciate a good story, a horror that relies on that story and the imagery and not on jump scares, you'll love this. It's a great movie for those who like horror, it's a good movie for those who are scared of horrors too :). Even if you don't like horror. Give it a go. The 5.2 rating is currently has is absolutely ridiculous.I find critics annoying, because they always rate mainstream movies we're ""supposed to like"" very highly and crap on most horror movies and smaller offerings. Ignore them.Right, enough waffling on. If you haven't seen it, go watch it. What are you waiting for? The virgin mary? 😉",The Unholy

222,bb74,Influenced by The Conjuring and Sinister films,6,18 April 2021,"I heard negative reviews from other horror fans about this film before I went to go see it, but I ended up liking it. It is an adequate, decent horror film for today. Some parts of the film were cheesy and not convincing, but Jeffrey Dean Morgan delivers a convincing performance as a disgraced journalist trying to repair his reputation and seeking redemption in a young girl who suddenly becomes a saint in her community by being able to heal the incurable sick by powers gifted to her by the ""Virgin Mary"".The film's tactics work on cheap scares and scary art imagery; however, its plot remains interesting enough for horror fans to want to know more. The characters are relatable and are easy to empathize with when danger hits them.I would recommend this film to anyone whose interest remains in horror films with religious themes.",The Unholy
223,om-34,Medicore and Offensive,1,27 May 2021,"All right, this film has a hearing actress playing the Deaf character. Of course, there are many Deaf actors and actresses who can more or less speak. Marlee Matlin comes to mind. Why was the hearing actress cast for the Deaf character?The signing skills between two actresses are medicore. They appear to have learn the sign language from the ASL dictionary a few days prior to the shooting. Thus, they do not sign fluently and naturally. Some signs they use are incorrect for the certain words.What's more, the term, ""deaf and mute"", is used to describe her. For a long time, the Deaf community has worked hard in educating the hearing community how archaic and offensive this term along with ""deaf and dumb"" is now. The Deaf people can communicate through the sign language or other forms of communication if they don't use voice or hear. Just don't call them ""deaf and mute"" or ""deaf and dumb""! It's same for the ""hearing impaired"" in the plot and synopsis. This term denotes the medical condition that indicates something is wrong with them and needs the intervention through surgery (cochlear implants, etc.) or through oralism (speech therapy, lipreading, and hearing training, etc.). Deaf people don't like this term at all because there's nothing wrong with them per se.Now, about the film. This horror flick is highly formulaic and repetitive: evil spirit is trapped in the object and is released when somebody accidentally or intentionally breaks the seal. The Catholic Church delegates come to investigate the ""miracles"" and end up exploiting the ""miracles"" for their own gain. Nothing new under the sun.This film has higher-than-usual 8, 9, and 10 stars with very short reviews. In other words, those reviewers are paid to post the ""excellent"" reviews for the medicore film with equally medicore CGI and acting. I would have given the film at least five stars if it wasn't for miscast of hearing actress, for poor signing skills, and for the offensive terms.",The Unholy

It was an easy plot to follow and it seemed to move at a nice pace. I actually didn't know it was a book until after. Go into the movie with low expectations and to have fun and you will enjoy it.

226,gpx_fto,Actually had a good plot + Good message,10,17 April 2021,"The #1 reason I come to imdb is because they show the viewer review ratings first, not the critic rating which cuts down good movies that don't adhere to the critic's checklist.This movie is a prime example of one such movie. It ACTUALLY has a good plot and leans on the plot much more than it does on cheap scares (of which there are a few).Anybody that appreciates the telling of a story in a movie which builds suspends and reveals details as the film progresses won't be disappointed. I found myself watching wanting to know how it ends and was hooked in until the end.My real rating for this movie is a 7.5/10 but I gave it a few extra points to bring up the low rating others have given it.Ps: The reason for a few of the low ratings is that they really could've done without the cheap cgi and some bits they put in there just because they felt they should, but they really didn't need to. For people who were expecting a lot of horror and gore and action, of which I'm sure there were a few, were probably disappointed as they didn't care for a story or a little depth and a very relevant message that isn't brought up much.If you are even mildly interested in the old spooky tales in little towns and like a good story being told, go ahead and take a chance at this unholy.

230,goodolludwigvan,Amateur Hour,3,13 June 2021,"I didn't expect much, as these type of possession / religious horror films are a dime a dozen these days.However, with a name like Sam Raimi attached and a half decent trailer, I let myself be suckered into watching this film.The trailer didn't lie about one thing: the photography is actually quite nice. The shots capture the perfect mood for the film, which could have elevated it above the usual dreck in the genre, but it falls apart due to bad editing, direction and acting.While it's not uncommon for low budget horror films to pad their runtime with slow pacing, it is uncommon for the editing to actually hinder suspense. The buildup of the final scene is a perfect example of how not to build suspense. Random reaction shots, closeups on extra's faces when they're not even reacting, odd choice of camera angles, the main character speaking way too softly when interrupting a crowd, the crowd voices being audibly faded out whenever he whispers his lines - in the middle of what is supposed to be a heated, tension filled scene of interrupting a cult in the middle of a ceremony.Audio and pacing are your bread and butter when it comes to horror movies, and it's been a long time since I've seen those screwed up this badly.It culminates in some very bad looking CGI as many have already mention and can be sort of seen in the trailer. What you can't see in the trailer is how slow the shots are. The camera lingers on the bad CGI for 10 seconds a cut, each passing a second making the bad CGI work more obvious and more ugly to look at. Without the CGI, the scene could have been effective, since the final creature design is fantastic. Congratulations to whoever designed that creature, it's probably the most horrific looking demon i've seen in a movie since Hellraiser's skinless Frank or Julia.The way it's dispatched on the other hand is another prime example of having no ideas. It's akin to a vampire in a vampire film dying after having a cross held up in its face. Exciting? No, you want to see a stake driven through it's heart in an exciting gory finale.With tighter editing, better audio work and without the terrible CGI this could have actually been a nice little horror film, since the core idea isn't bad and the creature design is good.Oh well, the old rule still holds true: stay away from Netflix or Amazon horror films.",The Unholy
231,nonikorn,"Very well written script, solid acting and great use of theology!",10,16 June 2021,"This movie is a wonderful example of the ""show not tell"" rule in story-telling. The exposition is really naturally intertwined and never feels forced as well as all the uses-subtle and overt- of a wide range of Catholic theology and symbols was really well done.Theres also a randomly hot priest so it gave me some much needed 'Fleabag' feels 😂.The script was also SO enjoyable. The fact that quite literally every line had a double meaning, and could be used for both 'holy' and 'unholy' worship was just so clever and really upped the 'creep' factor because it makes you think- how do I know who I've really been praying too?The subversion of miracles was a really interesting plot point and really explains why if Gods whole schtik is self-actualisation and realisation- a lot of the time through suffering- why do they perform miracles in random places and random times? Doesn't everyone deserve a miracle? So on so forth. It really addresses a lot of those contradicting questions we have in catholic theology.In a more esoteric sense, everyone in the film is being tested, and it's only those who are willing to give up their pride, look past worldly short-term achievements and rewards and suffer for whats right come out on top. Which is what the whole catholic story is supposed to be. It's so well done!!On a more film analysis note- the monster design was awesome in my opinion. A good mix of CGI and practical effects. Not so outlandish that once the 'big reveal' happens it was no longer scary, nor relying on the audience never actually seeing the big bad, for it to be creepy. A good amount of time for the monster on screen with slight changes to it that kept it feeling scary and fresh.My only critique would be, I would've liked if the villain was originally a good person who was like a herbologist or something who was healing people, then accused of being a witch and murdered in the witch trials. If that had been the catalyst for her evil deeds, I think it could have spun in the idea of ""cruelty can breed corruption/ evil."" But I still enjoyed what they did nonetheless.This movie wasn't covering my eyes terrifying or anything but it creeped you out by the questions it poses and the doubt that you feel watching it. It was a really enjoyable watch in my opinion and a quality horror. (Also who doesn't love a bit of Jefferey Dean Morgan)",The Unholy

Then again, it's PG13, so maybe I'm just too old and have seen too many of these below average holy-horror movies that the tired clichés are meant to not be so tired and so cliched for the middle school crowd.The moderately above average Jeffrey Dean Morgan does a decent enough job keeping the wheels on the bus at the beginning and is believable enough as an alcoholic down on his luck reporter, but once the movie gets going the humor they likely injected into his character as an afterthought, feels out of place.Cricket Brown is actually a bright spot, but you can tell that she's learned her chops on stage in theater because some of her performance is a bit over the top as a rural town girl from nowhere Massachusetts. She probably has some future in screen acting, but her facial expressions would likely shine on stage.As usual Cary Elwes needs to decide before filming which weird American accent he's going for and stick to it. Maybe I should just get used to it and pretend that he's from a region of the country that I've never been to that's full of Americans who sound like they're very lightly making fun of Brits, but I just can't.Poor Katie Aselton half the time looks like she's genuinely typical nice, sweet Katie Aselton, and the other half looks like she's realized what an awful movie she's agreed to be in.Diogo Mordato and William Sadler are probably the best two actors in this film, but they're limited in screen time. The extras in this are AWFUL. I'm sorry to these folks, because they're likely locals or something, but oh man, they do not help this movie out at all. I definitely blame the director for this, but whoa they're bad. Some of them straight up are overacting like they think they might be discovered in this crap heap.The first half of the movie, while still lazy and disappointing, doesn't prepare you for how quickly the second half becomes a trash pile of jump scares, unimaginative dialogue, and stupid horror tropes.If you're over the age of 20 and have seen your fair share of horror movies, do yourself a favor and avoid this. If you're 15 give or take, and are trying to take someone out on a date and want them to clutch your arm at every jump scare or want to clutch their arm at every jump scare, and realllllly don't care about anything other than that...meh...go ahead and watch it.

I won't even genre it as a horror flick cause the movie gave absolutely no scare from beginning till end. The jump scares were just boosting the volume from 50 to 200% which will startle you. But nothing more than that. The trailer looked much more intriguing plus it was Jeffrey Dean Morgan that pushed me to watch this movie.1) The movie has a very poor storyline. They could have done much better with that unique concept.2) They literally used no practical effects and instead went for CGI which was absolutely shambles. The CGI made it look like a very cheap under budget movie that doesn't even need to be released in a theatre.3) The movie has no scary vibe to it.

The Unholy, and countless other modern horror films have no subtlety, or sensitivity. This film signposts everything with cliché creepy music, uses unnecessary and obvious jump scares far too often and completely wastes an excellent cast.

While the movie does have a few rather predictable scenes, they're mingled with unexpected twists, immensely effective jump scares, and excellent character development. While a few minor characters' acting may be a bit sub-par (which is never the fault of the top billed cast, of course), the raw intensity of Jeffrey Dean Morgan's character more than makes up for it. The CGI doesn't look the best at first, since the initial scene that uses it is in a dream sequence, but after that, it is so realistic that you can scarcely tell that it wasn't done with live actors (it does, however, have an effect around it which serves to make it even more unnatural, which some may find to look bad). A fantastic cast, wonderful direction, great writing, and a terrifying antagonist all work in tandem to make this movie the best horror film I've seen since The Empty Man. It's entertaining, easy to follow, and, to be perfectly honest, I don't remember the last time that an entire (socially distanced) theater full of people all jumped and screamed at the exact same time at an unexpected jumpscare.

I wouldn't say that it was groundbreaking compared to the average horror move, but there were a couple of things that make it stand out as a fun and interesting watch.The first is the mixture of humour alongside the more fearful and suspenseful elements. This is one of the best things about Sam Raimi's movies-- there is often a surprising blend of fun and darkness in the tone.The second strength of the movie is its focus on the theme of cult mentalities. I liked that it dealt with this topic in a fairly believable fashion that emphasized the human elements of cult dynamics.Ultimately, I got the sense that the movie wasn't trying to take itself too seriously. It provides a reasonably satisfying story and set of character arcs, with some fun scares along the way. As long as a viewer isn't going into the movie and expecting total seriousness, then the movie should make for pretty entertaining viewing.",The Unholy

I love religious horror movies so I was pretty hyped up to watch The Unholy, and honestly the first half of the movie was kinda nice. The main actress is stunning, she really plays her part extremely well and this movie is definitely a fresh take in the genre. However, there's three main issues for me: first of all we have Mary Elnor, the entity, that's literally not scary AT ALL - the special effects sucked. Then, I wished they would have gone deeper into the entity itself and her life. Also, the second part of the movie was sooooo rushed, seriously ruined the whole thing. Oh and I just remembered that near the end Gerry said that Alice was Mary's only descendant - maybe I am dumb but what is this supposed to mean? Is Mary Elnor the grandgrandgrandmother of Alice? Ugh this should have been explained better! Overall it's a nice movie if you don't have anything better to watch, but it's unforgivable that the directors didn't decide to split it into two movies and explain the story better.",The Unholy

And what I love about the movie is how it shows vices of my Church and how they can mislead into devil's hand.Don't get me worng, I'm far from preaching about evil, but there is something about unheatly interest in Mary in my Church (She always point to her Son, thats the correct teaching of the Church, and she never ppints to herself, so that was one of the very first sings in the movie that something was wrong, I got chills when Alice leaves Holy Mass at the moment of consecration when we believe Jesus Himself comes to be with us, and Alice leaves in the middle of that importanto moment! The devil literally leads everyone form the church, from God, Himself).Also the undoubtedly commercial part to the shrine! How many times have I seen it? People hoping to gain money from church related things, like those t-shirts, rosaries, 'tears of Alice'. There was also the Bishop with ambition and dreams of grandeur. I have seen this too in real life. Not everyone is like that but there are some like him.And fianlly, all those people, with good intentions, hoping, wanting to believe in something, following the miracels, but lacking in critical thinking. I find it very accurate and in a way chilling. How easily we can get manipulated.Those were very interesting points of the movie.And I loved, simply loved the main character's journey. His character growth! From self serving to sacrificing. I had tears when he prayed at the end.For me, as a person of faith, this movie is great.",The Unholy

The special effects are just right. The look and feel of the movie is also perfect. The camera angles shown here i havent seen in a long time and change the whole prespective of the movie. It feels like every camera angel is thought of before hand and planned in order to give justice to what is happening. I enjoyed it.Those who don't know the technical side of it won't enjoy it. For all you video editors out there have a look at the scenes. They are just brilliant.When the M logo for Metallica is seen on the cow there is a curch bell sound.

It's fast paced with 2 or 3 good jump scares.It's not all suspense and the plot is straightforward, however it's good to see the monster and see people deal with it logically and ofcourse it's really nice that people other than MC can see the monster.Now to the stupidy of the monster (mother)
1- somehow she got caught and killed/imprisoned by the locals
2- when she got back, she did exactly the same thing as 200 years before
3- the father only doubted her ailwntly and she reponded by hangung him inside church, certainly nothing holy their she could have achieved alot by letting him be
4- instead of farming easy souls, she could have plotted better by making her girl get married and impregnated by 2 or 3 kids. And also wait a second generation of her waiting 20~50 years more isn't much compared to ghe previous 200 years
5- killing herself mistakingly, REALLY?! That was too stupid. Like, it could have reduced her power or disappeared or plainly heal her kid after damaging her.

You are entitled to your opinion, but if you disagree with someone else's, don't attribute it to them being paid off by someone.Let me preface with this: not everyone is going to enjoy this film. You may hate it. You may love it. You may fall somewhere in the middle. The same is true for any film. Personally, I loved this film, and I really appreciated the unique twist it put on the supernatural horror genre.Yes, the CGI may not be to the same standard as a multi-million dollar Michael Bay movie, but I find too much is sacrificed today in just making a film look good.If you scratch beneath the surface, you will find that this film raises some compelling questions and issues. Such as, the relationship between faith and reason, the commercialization of faith and the dangers of worshipping a being with Ill intentions. If your focus of the film is the CGI, then you might miss some of the deeper points of the plot.At the end of the day, any review is subjective. What I say really doesn't matter more than anyone else. Only you can decide whether you like this film or not. I would suggest that you give it a chance and see what you think.

It is true some claims of the apparitions of the Blessed Mother of God was found untrue. We know some that would tear up Chaplet of the Holy Rosary for instance. Whether people see things are not we don't know until Heaven proves it to us using the Church's evaluation. The Blessed Virgin is interested in only Divine truth. Bringing souls to her Son Jesus Christ and not herself. Her due role as the mother of the Church of Christ. Evangelism so to say.However, there are authentic apparitions of the Queen of Heaven. She would never ask for souls pledged to her as in ownership but only to put themselves under her maternal assistance through the consecration to her immaculate heart.Understanding her role in the salvation of humanity has been unclear to many and so query why calling upon her for intercession but it is a simple fact that our Lord Jesus Christ would refer to her as ""WOMAN"" in that sense as the New Eve and he Christ the New Adam which has brought about today the undoing of the sin of Adam and Even, the imperfect creatures.At the foot of the Cross before he gave up his spirit, John represented us that's why Jesus didn't call John by his name but rather called him ""son"" there.
