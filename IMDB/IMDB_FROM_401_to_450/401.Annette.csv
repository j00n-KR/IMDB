0,SnoopyStyle,surreal 70's rock opera,6,27 August 2021,"Henry McHenry (Adam Driver) is a famous experimental comedian. Ann Defrasnoux (Marion Cotillard) is a renown opera singer. It's a world wind romance and they have a daughter named Annette which is a marionette puppet.This reminds me of a 70's rock opera. It's a bit experimental with plenty of surreal touches. It does hit a few potholes along the way. The first one is Henry's standup performance early in the movie. It happens a lot when actors try to play comedians. They can pretend to be funny but when they do a full standup, they fall flat. Here, Adam Driver is doing more an experimental art performance than a standup. He's not actually funny and that takes away from the reality of his character. I would chop up his performance to hide its non-funniness. I do like Adam as an actor. He's very magnetic even when he plays a dark unlikable lead and he's unlikable here. This is super surreal. The director is throwing a lot of intriguing elements into this. Not all of it works but it's never not interesting.",Annette
1,CinemaSerf,Curious but fundamentally flawed story...,6,15 September 2021,"First things first, hats off to Adam Driver and to Marion Cotillard for trying something just that little bit different. That said, in my view they didn't pull it off. From the opening scene that looked like something from ""West Side Story"" we are introduced to ""Henry McHenry"" (Driver) an American stand up comedian who is about as funny as halitosis, and that for me started the slippery slope upon which this film descended. He is having a relationship with singing sensation ""Ann"" (Cotillard) and after a while the eponymous bairn arrives - doing a remarkably effective impression of ""Pinocchio"" (only without the nose). Things in the family take some rather tragic turns, but salvation appears for Driver as the baby has an almost angelic singing voice - and soon she is a roaring success... It's all just bit too surreal, the whole thing - and it's really not helped by much Adam Driver's tone deaf singing, some rather implausible plot twists and an ending that though fitting is all just a bit too little too late after what was for me a very long 2 hrs and 20 minutes. I could have done with more of Cotillard, and her signing - but as it is, what we are essentially given is a film with so much emphasis on the look, feel and stylisation of the thing that the story gets thrown under the pram. Not for me, sorry...",Annette
2,ferguson-6,Carax and Sparks fly,7,5 August 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. The anticipation of seeing a film directed by Leos Carax (HOLY MOTORS, 2012), and written and scored by Ron Mael and Russell Mael of Sparks fame, is derived from expecting the unexpected ... experiencing something we've never before experienced cinematically. And although the film is likely to be quite divisive - beloved by some, dismissed by others, confusing for all - the ingenuity, creativity, and risk-taking are quite something to behold. As for the narrative coherence? Well that's quite a different topic.A mere six weeks ago I watched and reviewed Edgar Wright's excellent documentary THE SPARKS BROTHERS, where Ron and Russell discussed their affinity and vision for movies, despite a few near misses over the years. This particular material was originally conceived as a rock opera album, and it's probable that very few directors would even attempt the transition to the big screen. It would be equally challenging as an opera, a play, or a stage musical. In simple terms, this is a musical-drama-romance; however in reality, it's confoundingly difficult to define or describe.The opening sequence begins in a recording studio with director Carax at the sound board as the Sparks band performs ""So May We Start?"" Soon they are marching the streets of Santa Monica, joined in singing the song by the lead actors of the movie we are about to watch. The narrator tells us, ""Breathing will not be tolerated"", which takes on a touch of irony during a pandemic.Adam Driver stars as Henry, an offbeat stand-up comedian, and Oscar winner Marion Cotillard stars as Ann, a popular opera singer. Henry bills himself as 'The Ape of God' and performs an abrasive comedy act that is interactive with his audience. He psyches up for each performance by shadow-boxing in a robe while puffing on a cigarette. Ann is often shown alone on stage (Catherine Trottman sings the opera parts, while Ms. Cotillard sings the rest). The couple is engaged when we open, and they later marry, have a child (the titular Annette), and take different approaches to their career. Henry and Ann are polar opposites and that's best exemplified by how they end their respective shows: he 'moons' his audience, while she gracefully bows in appreciation.Henry is a man filled with love, yet clueless on how to love. He's a tortured soul - the kind that doesn't believe he deserves the life he has and finds a way to self-destruct. Henry and Ann are passionate lovers and their duet ""We Love Each Other So Much"" has the most unusual timing that you'll see in a musical; in fact, the musical interludes (with repeating lyrics) often arise at the most inopportune (or at least unexpected) moments. Ms. Cotillard's talents are never fully utilized, while much of the film's weight is carried by Mr. Driver.After tragedy strikes, the story becomes quite bizarre with Henry and ""Baby Annette"". To say more would spoil that which should remain surprising. Simon Helberg's role as conductor increases in the second half, and his character's past with Ann lends itself to the complexity of relationships. This is a dark love story, and one that befuddles right up to the end. Director Carax and the Mael brothers could slide into the Avant-garde corner, but that might scare off even more potential viewers, so let's use 'fantastical' instead. Sometimes it tries a bit too hard to shock or agitate, and the stories are a bit discordant, but it's all for a good cause: provocation. The film, dedicated to Carax's daughter Nastya (who appears in the opening sequence), sometimes feels like the wild nightmares that you (mostly) don't want to end. And that's about all that should be said to preserve the experience.This Musical opens in theaters on August 6, 2021 and on Amazon Prime Video on August 20, 2021.",Annette
3,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Annette (2021) 7.4/10,7,26 August 2021,"""The plot, conceived by the perennial art rock duo Sparks (brothers Ron and Russell Mael), who is also the sole purveyor of the music here, takes a darker turn after Henry and Ann tie the knot and have their firstborn, Annette. The disintegration of their marriage rehashes the stock case of a husband who cannot tolerate that his wife is more successful than him, the abominable male ego (exemplified conspicuously by the color green, the green-eyed monster) ably shatters their domestic bliss, tragedy ensues and at one point, the film seems head to a haunted ghost revenge tale. However, as the brain child of a sausage party, ruination will befall Henry down the line, but not before giving him an apologia that maybe he could seek some semblance of redemption for being a good father, only, that is moot if Henry's exploitative coloration and wanton cruelty cannot be suppressed.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks.",Annette
4,dromasca,a musical in the world of Carax,8,13 September 2021,"Anyone who ventures to watch a film by Leos Carax must know that he has a good chance of going through a unique cinematic experience. 'Annette', which made its debut at the delayed Cannes Film Festival in 2021, is no exception. Of course, movie lovers can make attempts to place this film in one or more categories - for example musical, rock opera, family melodrama, social comedy - and they will all be right (with a high degree of approximation). 'Annette' is all these but first and foremost a Leos Carax movie - it's weird, dramatic, grotesque, sentimental, absurd, baroque, desperate. It is a film that you can expect a quarter of the audience to leave the cinema hall quite early during the screening, with many of the remaining ones being fascinated and enchanted until the last scene. This also happened at the screening I attended. Needless to say, I'm one of those who are irresistibly drawn into the fantasy world of Carax movies, and doesn't plan to escape from it anytime soon, even if 'Annette' has good chances of disappointing many of his fans.The director warns us from the formidable scene that opens the film that we will witness a musical theatre show - a musical or rock opera, I never understood exactly the boundaries between these genres arelaid. We are invited backstage and on stage before the curtain rises. The actors, the extras, the choir, the musicians prepare for the show, gather and then go out together in an opening number filmed as a single long frame composed of many beautiful minutes. We meet the lead characters, a couple in love who are also celebrities: Henry is a stand-up comedian who balances humour about himself and cynicism. Ann is an opera singer specialising in roles that inevitably end with the death of the heroine. Henry and Ann declare their love in another memorable musical number. They're getting married. A child is born - Annette - who will not be an ordinary child. I stop here with the story so as not to spoil the pleasure of those who will see the film. I will only mention that there are many elements in the story that can be described as belonging to the romantic melodrama, that various and serious themes are approached, and that the rules of the musicals genre are strictly observed in the film which is almost completely missing spoken lines. And, of course, the film belongs to Carax's universe.'Annette' doesn't seem want to be loved, but I loved a lot of things in it. The music belongs to the Mael brothers (a.k.a. Sparks group). Adam Driver's performance is formidable and I think I saw in this film one of the Academy Awards nominees for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Marion Cotillard seemed a little underused in this film. It is also worth mentioning the performance of Simon Helberg, in a secondary, but significant role. The cinematography of Caroline Champetier creates the illusion of a stage show with special effects. The use of the wooden puppet that embodies Annette is worth a discussion. Many will love the solution, I was not excited. I understand that it is part of the concept, but the emotional distancing through aesthetics always makes me uncomfortable. In other of his films, I resonated with the characters of Leos Carax, even if I didn't always fully understand them. In 'Annette' the opposite happened. The characters in the film are open and explicit, but it was hard for me to identify with them. The film addresses some important issues - the star system, the avidity of the media in search of sensational and scandal, the violence of men in relationships, the exploitation of wonder artist children - but, avoiding sentimentality, the director installed a barrier between the story in the film and viewers that I I couldn't get through it completely. When does this usually happen to me? At some opera performances. Maybe, when we think of this film, out the phrase 'rock opera' what we have to remember is 'opera'.",Annette
5,Cineanalyst,La Nouvelle Vague the Rock Opera,7,25 August 2021,"Leos Carax's first English-language feature and my first Carax picture in general, so I won't speak to any of his directorial tendencies, of which I know next to nothing, and ditto the Sparks, but will try to keep it simple and perhaps end up misdirected. To me, ""Annette,"" despite being released in 2021 and by Amazon Studios, seems very much in the tradition of the French New Wave--like a Jean-Luc Godard disciple from Cannes to Hollywood, still playing the same iconoclastic and deconstructive beats.In a gender reversal of ""Breathless"" (1960), the woman (Marion Cotillard) is French and the men (Adam Driver and, shedding ""The Big Bang Theory"" sitcom caricature, Simon Helberg) are American. She's the real artist, and they're exploitative brutes: one a stand-up comic and the other an accompanist wannabe conductor. Their offspring is a puppet, the eponymous Annette, the marionette. Make of that what you will, but Driver's jester is the protagonist here, and so we may just be seeing his daughter through his eyes. In ironic deconstructive style given its French director financed by Americans, the Americans in the movie literally speak-sing what they're doing when performing. Driver doesn't tell jokes on stage; he describes how he's doing jokes and instructs the audience when to laugh. Cotillard and her daughter sing, too, but it's the operatic performance--not merely the performance about the performance. Not just in the sense of a Thomas H. Ince or Natalie Wood on yachts, the American is a killer, of art--the most groan-inducingly angelic and innocent sort, to boot. The entire facade crumbles, drones descending, puppet stringed Lady Gaga style, on the most ostentatious of American stages, the Super Bowl halftime show.To drive home the point that this is art about making art, the entire picture is made self-aware and blatantly artificial, to alienate the spectator from the comfort of the fluff of traditional Hollywood musicals. The picture begins with an elaborate one-take of the cast exiting a music-recording studio, changing wardrobes as they sing, ""So May We Start,"" lest anyone forget they're watching a movie. The series of Annette marionettes, intentionally-unbelievable rear-screen projections, interruptions of tabloid exposition, and, of course, the singing of the integrated-musical genre work on the same level. Comically, they even sing during sex. Moreover, the songs are lyrically repetitive and rock scored as if to even subvert expectations of the usual musical escapism. In the end, Driver completely breaks the fourth wall, acknowledging the camera and audience--just as his character did within the narrative with his interactions with the audience for his stand-up. Something that, again ironically, Cotillard's character didn't do on the opera stage until the curtain call.That all this heightened artifice reflexively calling attention to its own illusion is oft visually splendid and musically sometimes catchy is a compelling dichotomy, both as hostile as Driver and as inviting as Cotillard in interacting with their respective characters' audiences and rather daring one to believe this is about characters and story, perhaps even saying something profound about the nature of celebrity or some such thing. I suppose, ""Annette"" might have a hopeful implication, though, now that the Americans and French have married and procreated, so to speak, to move past feigned nationalist claims, as if either country ever had that much more of a claim to capitalist fluff or the postmodern avant-garde. Then again, these are the states whose cinematic diatribes go all the way back to the art form's origins with such overblown divisions as Edison or Lumière... Pathé or the Edison Trust... Hollywood or national art cinema... film and cinema or digital and streaming.",Annette
6,Thanos_Alfie,Something different...,6,4 November 2021,"""Annette"" is a Musical - Drama movie in which we watch a stand-up comedian trying to balance his life between work and family while his wife, a famous opera singer gives birth to their beautiful daughter.I did not know what to expect from this movie and I have to admit that it was a big surprise for me. It's a completely different movie or musical that I have ever seen and it combines very well drama with romance. The interpretation of Adam Driver who played as Henry McHenry was simply amazing and unique. Another interpretation that have to be mentioned was Marion Cotillard's who played as Ann Defrasnoux and she was equally good. To sum up, I have to say that ""Annette"" is a nice musical with an interesting plot, some good songs and plenty of drama.",Annette
7,damianphelps,Masterfull,9,6 October 2021,"Not your everyday run of the mill movie, Annette is something for those who rejoice in something different.The music is the core of the film as it was written as a tour piece not a film.Its quirky and highly imaginative :)",Annette
8,marmar-69780,Annette,7,23 August 2021,Annette is one very weird and obscure film that will split audiance very much and I can understand that easily.But to me this work is one of those who will be loved by just hardcore Carax fans and thats not me.But still fine and weird work.,Annette
9,paul-allaer,Highly unusual yet profoundly traditional opera/musical drama,7,22 August 2021,"As ""Annette"" (2021 release; 140 min.) opens, the brothers Ron and Russell Mael and the rest of their band Sparks are in the studio, bursting into ""So May We Start"". Ron and Russell soon leave the studio, and walk outside onto the street, soon joined by Adam Drive, Marion Cotillard, and others from the cast. Adam and Marion soon change into their characters, resp. Henry, a stand-up comedian, and Ann, an opera soprano. Henry and Ann are in the middle of a whirlwind romance... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from French director Leos Carax (""Les Amants du Pont-Neuf""). Here he takes and builds on an original story from Ron and Russell Mael, who also wrote all of the music and lyrics. The Mael brothers are of course the brains behind the long-running L. A. rock band Sparks, whose commercial heydays were in the 1970s with albums like Kimono My House, and Propaganda. They thought up this by today's standards highly unusual film, which brings an opera/musical drama to life. As in a real opera, the plot advances slowly but steadily, and runs quite long. In that sense, this is a very traditional opera/musical drama. The title character Annette refers to the daughter born to Henry and Ann, and all I will say is that it isn't your usual baby... Just watch! Let me address the many outright negative reviews on here: what in the world were you expecting? This isn't your run-of-the-mill superheroes movie (the many, many, many Marvel films come to mind) or popcorn action movie (the Fast & Furious franchise comes to mind). ""Annette"" is a one-of-a-kind, completely original film, the likes of which are frankly rarely made anymore these days, and for that we should be very, very thankful. Is the film without flaws? Of course not (for example, Henry's second standup-up segment, set in Vegas, runs far too long and doesn't advance the plot). If you saw the excellent ""Sparks Brothers"" documentary earlier this year, you already knew that a sizeable part of ""Annette"" was shot in Belgium (Brussels and Bruges, in particular). Being originally from Belgium myself, I had a fun time trying to match up which scenes had been filmed there. Last but not least, the production budget for this film was an incredible $15 million, a mere pittance by Hollywood standards.""Annette"" premiered at this year's Cannes film festival to positive buzz. It opened in select theaters for a 2 week theater run, and this weekend it premiered on Amazon Prime, where I caught it. Frankly, I felt that the movie got better as it went along and the drama unfolds before our very eyes. If you are in the mood for an opera/musical drama or simply are a fan of Sparks, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it on Amazon Prime, Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Annette
10,kwenchow,"Another worst film! Too long, slow, and full of annoying overuse scene! Bored to freaking death!",1,16 October 2021,"This film start with a bunch of people singing, and a man ""Henry"" went away with his motorcycle scene! As turnout, this film is about a comedian ""Henry"" need to deal with his daily life surrounding his career, his wife ""Ann"", and his daughter ""Annette""! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as , overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the news broadcasting scene, overuse of the riding motorcycle scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the smoking scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the kissing scene, overuse of the copulate scene, overuse of the changing camera angle scene, overuse of the blackout scene, overuse of the laughing scene, and overuse of the hallucinate scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, Annette visit Henry at the prison! Still have a post credit scene! The crews of this film marching with the lantern! That's it! Wasting time to watch!",Annette
11,yusufpiskin,Overrated,4,23 August 2021,"I say this as someone who loves leos carax; Adam driver said ""I also play musicals, what am I missing from Ryan Gosling"" and gave the money and became the producer of the movie. Most of the lyrics in the songs used are neither related to the scene nor the script, they were written just to rhyme.Even after an hour, you are watching ""so? Where will this scenario lead?""
If adam driver wants to prove he's a good actor, he shouldn't spend his money as a producer on these kinds of movies. We already know that he is a good actor.",Annette
12,masonsaul,Really weird,7,16 September 2021,"Annette is a really weird film that's funny, unpredictable, enjoyably surreal and quite emotional but also too slow and and lacking in narrative momentum at times. Adam Driver gives a phenomenal and unhinged lead performance and Simon Helberg is great. Marion Cotillard is also great but feels underutilised. Leos Carax's direction is extremely stylish, its consistently well filmed and visually inventive. The music by Russell Mael and Ron Mael is excellent.",Annette
13,JuguAbraham,A leaf out of Ariane Mnouchkine's films,7,23 August 2021,"Carax thanks King Vidor and film theoretician Bela Balazs. Bravo! But what about the lady from his own country--Ariane Mnouchkine of the Theater du Soleil and her amazing films ""1789"" and ""Moliere""? That's as sad a commentary as the protagonist of the film, ""Henry McHenry."" I prefer the Carax of lower budgets and the past. Ms Champetier, take a bow for your work with Carax on so many of his films with wonderful outcomes !",Annette
14,xmasdaybaby1966,What the Ella was that?,1,20 October 2021,"I loved Ella Leyers in the first two series of the Belgian version of Professor T (the third series was sadly lacking without her) so I have tried to find her other work but being Dutch Belgian her shows are hard to find.I was joyous to find this only to find she wa in for 25 seconds in 2 hour 20 minute film, you hardly saw her beautiful face and smile and she didn't get to speak.Thankfully, this was in the first 10 minutes so switched off soon afterwards.Artistic I am sure but not my thing.Disappointed.",Annette
15,lambiepie-2,It's Very Artistic - Good Story,8,29 August 2021,"All the artistic elements are here, it's visually colorful, the current fascination with celebrity up and downs are here. I found bits and pieces of this in the beginning but as the film progressed, it got more interesting.What attracted me to it was that it was a 'musical', and I remember the brothers Sparks (Mael) from my younger days. I found them very avant-garde, it was refreshing to hear that they did something like this. I am a huge fan of films like ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" and ""Ken Russell's Tommy"" and on some level I found that I was equating some parts of ""Annette"" to those. This is not quite like those films except for the abstractness of the vision in telling the story of the main character.The story is also predicated on the actors. The thing about Adam Driver as an actor is that it doesn't matter what he's in, he gets you attracted to the piece. You will be very attracted here by his performance of a (spoiler) real POS.Marion Cotillard gives a brava performance here as well as the opera star, and her performance really comes into play later in the film - again another one of those 'bits' in this film that captures attention as well.But as with the other musical films I mentioned above, what one may not connect with is the story as quickly as they should. Takes a bit to get to it like -- 35 minutes or so in the film to me as that's when it gets rolling.Sometimes it did remind me of a avant-garde mix of a La Boheme or a Don Giovanni tragic opera with its famous but tragic Diva that contrasts against a life of a completely opposite crude nightclub comic.And then there is the namesake of the film, Annette. That story unfolds - it's the bits of that bit that captured my interest - as the film goes on. My biggest critique of why I didn't score ""Annette"" higher was because of Annette.Maybe they (the writers, directors, etc.) had a reason of realizing Annette the way they did (I think so), but for me what they ended up doing propelled me back to my childhood of ""supermarionations"" and that's a place I never wanted to go back to. Didn't like them. It became distracting (up to a point mind you!!)Again, some nice bits that got better as the film progresses, interesting to watch, nice sets, nice colors, different, original - stick with it.",Annette

Cool , way to go, great job!",Annette
17,HabibieHakim123,One Of 2021 Masterpiece,10,29 August 2021,"Annette is truly amazing, truly incredible, and it's a truly Masterpiece, Annette is a dark musical movie that i've never seen before, the way they told the story with 90% of the film with only a music while they tell the story is so easy to follow, added with Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard absolutely stunning performance, Annette it's 2 hours and 20 minutes full of depression yet it's incredible, Annette is definitely one of the best films of the year.",Annette
18,Movi3DO,Atmospheric and dreamy,9,8 August 2021,"We Love Each Other So Much...This is not your typical happy and energetic musical. Sitting alone in the theater, I was initially surprised and confused at Adam Driver's character's vulgar sense of humor. I thought this movie would be bizarre and weird for it's whole runtime, and boy I was right, in a good way though.The music dominated every aspect of every scenes and conversations. The characters only spoke one or two sentences before the singing began. While I don't like opera much, I still enjoyed how atmospheric and immersive the music was.The story was also interesting. Initially it was about the marriage between the main two characters and their careers. After that, it's about the daughter character, who had a bizarre appearance. I was confused at first, but then it became clear at the end and I was impressed at the clever concept.However, the best part of the movie was the great Adam Driver himself. The only thing that this man cannot do was probably be bad in a movie. That stand up comedy scene where he made a crazy joke about his wife was shocking. He carried the whole movie and did everything right.Overall, probably the best and most unique musical that I have watched. Defiant try it out in theater or Amazon Prime in two weeks. 9/10.",Annette
19,ronakkotian,"Unconventional, ambitious and admirable",7,19 September 2021,"I'm not familiar with Leos Carax's work but having seen Annette now, I'm very interested to watch his previous films.Annette follows Henry McHenry, a stand up comedian, and Ann Dufrasnoux, an opera singer, whose lives completely change after the birth of their daughter, Annette.This is so far the strangest film I've seen all year but it's also the most unique. What Leos Carax and The Sparks Brothers have created is something very ambitious and whilst not everything works in the film, it's still a film I have respect for. What I really loved about Annette was its style. Carax's take on a musical is something I've never seen before. He includes many strange shots and scenes that'll leave you gasping. The film literally opens up by breaking the 4th wall with Leos Carax starting the film which I thought was pretty creative. Experimental moments like this throughout the film is what made me enjoy Annette and Carax as a director. I love the production design with the colour green being dominant during many scenes. There is a theatrical atmosphere Carax creates with many sequences of Annette, like a scene on a yacht, and it works considering the story. Visually, it's one of the best films of the year. The music in this film was helmed in a way I didn't expect. Rather than having dance numbers, a lot of the dialogue is said in a musical manner. I didn't really find any of them to be particularly memorable and it also came across as repetitive with how many times they repeat the same lyrics. The long runtime didn't feel fully justified either. I wasn't bored at any point but it could've definitely been shorter to ensure a smoother pace.All the acting was solid. Adam Driver has been consistently impressing me and his performance as Henry McHenry is fantastic. His singing could use some work but for the most part he did well in that department. Where I really liked him was during his stand up routines. There are some impressive long takes of him performing comedy on stage and he owns it. Marion Cotillard is excellent as usual and brings forth the angelic presence of Ann very well. Simon Helberg also does a great job for the time he's on screen.I really admire the ambition of Annette. It's a very weird and unconventional musical, unlike any I've seen before, and Carax's abstract vision is something to behold. Not everything gels as well as it could've but it's an experience that you won't get very often and, for that reason, Annette deserves a watch.",Annette
20,lareval,An amazing experience,8,25 August 2021,"This movie is much more an experience rather than a movie by normal standards. It is very much worthy of being witnessed, enjoyed and suffered as equal. The performances are stunning (both Cotillard and Driver give their all), and the songs are sticky and pretty effective. Not to be missed!",Annette
21,latinfineart,"A trite, nothing of a film",3,8 September 2021,"This is a truly horrendous film, it somehow thinks that it's going to be similar to La La Land, but without any of the charm, without any of the pacing, without any of the magic, without the great direction.This is just a simplistic TV version of a Broadway play and a bad musical at that. I'm so glad I didn't have to pay to see this film, it was painful to watch.",Annette
22,sweidman-28016,Strange and Entrancing. Loved It!,8,14 August 2021,"""So may we start?""Annette follows Henry, a stand-up comedian with a fierce humor, and Ann, an internationally renowned opera singer. Together, under the spotlight, they form a happy and glamorous couple. The birth of their first child, Annette, a mysterious girl with an exceptional destiny, turns their lives upside down in this rock opera. Annette is a special kind of experience. It won't be for everyone as it takes a certain type of watcher to appreciate. The same can be said about the talent behind the screen. Leos Carax directs with his strange and unique style he displayed with his renowned feature Holy Motors. Holy Motors is on some whole other level that also takes a certain watcher to appreciate. Annette isn't anymore accessible as that, the only difference is the bigger stars on screen. But Carax does wonders with this film. It's dripping with style and substance it's hard to ignore. He brings so much life into every scene, because if you can get into the story, it's so much fun. Another thing to note is this was written by Ron and Russell Mael (aka Sparks). Fortunately, I saw Edgar Wright's documentary The Sparks Brothers only at the beginning of summer, so I could understand their style, which pairs nicely with Carax's. The story is over-the-top and self-aware which adds to the fun of it. But at its center, there's an emotional core. By the final act, and final song, it's like you're holding your breath to take it all in (which we're told to do by the narrator at the very beginning).When it comes to the performances, they all stand out. We have three main actors: Adam Driver, Marion Cotillard, and Simon Helberg. Adam Driver is incapable of giving a performance less than good. This may just be his best yet. He has the job of entertaining us with his comedy and give a frightening performance as we delve deeper into Henry. Marion Cotillard's may only be supporting, but her presence remains even when off screen. She has a light that shines whenever on screen. One of the songs is her telling her life story, and my personal favorite. And Simon Helberg was an amazing surprise. I haven't seen him in much of anything, but he blew me away. Lastly, Devyn McDowell has one scene and one song that's so powerful. For how young she is (maybe 8 years old at most), that one scene is just incredible and almost puts Adam Driver in the corner. They really did wonders with casting.The budget wasn't too big, but for the production value, it looks pretty good. There's a few different sets that all look good. The standout for me was a scene that takes place on a boat. The costumes are good. One in particular that Marion Cotillard paired with her makeup looks really cool. The camera work is very showy in the best ways. With the well thought out lighting, it looks beautiful all the time. Annette is just one of the coolest movie experiences of the year so far. It's strange and sometimes feels awkward because of it, but I really liked it. Though all of it is weird, if you can get past one aspect of it, you should be good. I can't wait to see it again next week, though nothing will too that theater experience.",Annette

25,parkerbcn,Something different,9,19 September 2021,"Carax movies are not for everyone, but are clearly what cinema as an art needs to keep growing. You have the blockbusters, the standard genre constructed and script dependant movies and then you have the ones that try to do something different with the filmic language. The narrative power of Carax here is breathtaking and his union with Sparks to create a modern musical that is half ""Phantom of the Paradise"" and half ""Dancer in the Dark"" is a glorious one, full of emotion and risks. Also, Adam Driver, after his ""Star Wars"" journey, seems determined to leave behind a brave and rich filmography.",Annette
26,tccandler,"I cared about a flying, singing marionette baby...",9,21 August 2021,"Leos Carax directs Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard in this cinematic opera that explores the nature of family, fame, jealousy, exploitation, obsession and madness. To describe the plot would be madness itself. This is best described as an experience that you will either adore or despise... and possibly both in equal measure. There were times during the film that had me doubting... but somehow, it weaved its magic and had me truly caring about all of the insanity.",Annette
27,TheVictoriousV,The truly strange is the truly original,8,22 August 2021,"I'd like to think Anette is among the extravagant stage musicals helmed by Adam Driver's character in Marriage Story (2019) back when he was a happier, more passionate fellow and that this is the film adaptation he himself got to star in. And to work with this particular director? The man who has been called ""the Jodorowsky of France"" at least once? That's quite an honor.French surrealist Leos Carax is credited with having created one of the most truly original movies of the past few years with 2012's Holy Motors alongside his frequent leading man Denis Lavant (interestingly, the two also appeared together in Harmony Korine's Mister Lonely in 2007, just to give you an idea on the level of avant-garde strangeness we're talking here). Now, he tries his hand at the rock opera.The songs of this particular opera come from the duo Sparks, which I confess I knew very little about. But unlike ""album adaptations"" like Imaginaerum by Nightwish (2012) and Pink Floyd's The Wall (1982), or films that were written clumsily around pre-existing songs à la the Mamma Mia franchise, this one boasts new, original tunes from the band. Just as Dancer in the Dark (2000) got me into Björk, this one's made me very curious about Sparks, the members of which (brothers Ron and Russell Mael) also wrote the screenplay.Carax's films, from what I've seen, are always acutely aware that they're films - and of the capacity of the art form. This one also periodically behaves as if it is a stage play, using rear projections where other movies might employ CGI and having a creepy marionette star as the principal child character (which has an additional thematic purpose that will be obvious to you by the end, as will other things upon your second viewing).As mentioned before, Carax is also exceedingly strange and (therefore?) supplies genuinely original stories. The film stars Driver as narcissistic, fame-seeking singer-comedian Henry McHenry; Marion Cotillard (singing partly by Catherine Trottmann) plays his far more successful wife, soprano Ann Defrasnoux. After the latter's death, the circumstances of which I won't disclose here, Henry is left to single-handedly care for their puppet child, Baby Annette, who has now started singing and humming whenever light grazes her face during the night (her voice seeming to be that of the dead Ann). Henry gets in touch with The Accompanist (Simon Helberg), as he sees an opportunity.It is difficult to imagine that you, the reader, have ever before seen a story quite like this. Even the smaller moments within the larger tale are unique like only a French madman knows how. You may have seen movie characters sing a duet before; you may also have seen them perform cunnilingus. But both at the same time?While I would've liked to, well, like these characters a little more, we understand them well enough through the songs. And this isn't just the sort of musical where you tell the story as normal with occasional song-and-dance sequences. This is on par with Les Misérables in terms of non-stop singing, and some of the bigger numbers left me with several cases of goosebumps, with a dash of tears during the closing duet ""Sympathy for the Abyss"".I had a few minor gripes with the movie; the editing is occasionally just a little too quick (letting vital shots fade out too early and sometimes suddenly overlaying images in a way that doesn't quite work) and some parts aren't mixed quite right - vocals that seem like they should be in the background sound a bit too loud. Sometimes the voices also get drowned out by the instrumentals and the lyrics of some numbers can be hard to make out in general. I guess that's opera for ya.",Annette

30,justinwfirestone,"A huge disappointment, being a Sparks lover",4,10 August 2021,"Poor, poor Annette, a love-child of Sparks and Leos Carax, no doubt doomed from her and its inception, for what did we get after 50 years of the Mael brothers struggling to find a more global sense of acceptance of their ear-worm pop music? We ended up, most unfortunately, with Annette.As a musical, the opening number killed it, filling the room with a tingling joy and happiness of seeing Ronald and Russell in a far more dignified performance than their first go 'round in Rollercoaster (1977). The opening song, ""So May We Start,"" is fantastically catchy and dancy and imparts a sense that the you are in for a real treat for another two hours. Ah, but no. The rest of the songs are a digression into classical operatic approaches, and a typical Sparks fan would likely find little thematically to link the band to the arias and asides. Where gone to was the fun of Lil' Beethoven?Regardless of the story, and certainly because of it, the score and the story beat each other to a wet, hot, and drunken mess, so much so that a better use of time would be listening to Angst in My Pants twice or more, but not watching Rollercoaster (1977).The world of Annette is largely amoral, but given the poppiness of Sparks, one might have expected a plot and score that more closely reflected the joy imparted by their music and live performances. Fans understand that Sparkian lyrics often engage themselves in clever wordplay and multiple meanings as the melody and key changes. As a fan, ""I Made It Through Annette.""",Annette
31,theredsky,Annette Review,8,27 September 2021,"An oddly experimental film that I throughly enjoyed. This film definitely isn't for everyone however, I really loved its presentation. A lot of this feels like a weird musical and I think that's what it was going for. All of the music here is great and since the music and writing go hand in hand here, that means I think the writing is excellent too. Sometimes it's a little weird with its presentation and writing but those moments were usually few and far between. Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard did an excellent job in their roles and I hope they get some recognition for it during the awards season. Leos Carax's directing is one of the best of the year so far. His style and tone is extremely clear and feels unique to this genre. There a lot of moments in this film that kept me extremely captivated and I loved that Adam's and Marion's characters daughter is a puppet most of the time. It gets its point across clearly and I loved the daughters inclusion. There were moments here where the film subverted my expectations in different and unique ways in terms of character development. The final scene between Adam Driver and his daughter is heartbreaking and leaves you feeling both joyful and heartbroken. It's a film that isn't going to be for everyone but I would definitely recommend checking it out if you like weird and unique musicals.",Annette

33,BijeshNagesh,A Depthful 'Sparks Brothers Musical',8,23 August 2021,"One of the most distinct movies of 2021, with its own unique flavour, I found ""Annette"" equal parts entertaining, amusing, captivating, and unforgettable.The brilliant bizarreness and compositional frenzy of the Sparks Brothers was in full form throughout this musical. Ron and Russell Mael also provided the original story. I must state that this movie wouldn't have half its artistic flavour if those two legends weren't part of the project. Each of the songs feels new yet familiar. Some of the tunes could potentially get stuck in your head for days.This is unlike any movie you'd have seen this year. It's crazy, in a good way. Leos Carax's direction worked cinema-magic on the film, rendering ""Annette"" a worthy watch on Amazon Prime Video.Leads Adam Driver as Henry McHenry - I have a feeling he was channelling the Sparks Brothers, in more ways than one - and Marion Cotillard as Ann Defrasnoux - her subtlety and soprano were amazing - gave performances that I'm sure will draw and maintain all eyes on them. Scene-stealers, both.The titular character is Henry and Ann's little daughter, a child-caricature 'marionette-doll' - plenty of symbolism and allegory enveloped this character. Devyn McDowell made a brief appearance as real-life Annette later in the movie, and she was wonderfully compelling for all those few minutes she was on screen.Special shoutout to Simon Helberg's acting as The Accompanist. He was amazing, and gave a signature character-centric performance.Caroline Champetier's intimate style of cinematography took the film to new heights. She captured every fine detail needed to keep one's attention on the moment. Nelly Quettier must have had quite a circus going in the editing room, because this movie had so much musical and story content. The way she patched it all together was astounding.Set decoration and production design did great work. Kudos to Marion Michel and Florian Sanson, respectively. Costume design took things up several notches, especially when it came to finding the right colours and pieces to suit the theme of this or that song from the House of Sparks. Hats off (sartorial pun un-intended) to Pascaline Chavanne and Ursula Paredes Choto.The sub-teams under all the main categories must have come to work coffee-primed, because the result was a film that turned out superbly entertaining and thorough. Amazon Studios' ""Annette"" was nothing short of transcendental.The entire musical felt like a radical version of your average rom-com. It was deeply dramatic, and contained several modern real-life parallels portrayed through song. The plot took dark paths less trodden, and turned brutally honest when needed. I'm sure viewers will appreciate how different this film looks on screen.It was real life allegory realized in cinematic form with stage-play embellishments. It was psychedelic and unashamed, bombastic and dramatic. Such sweet satire... Such rebellious relish... It was far from anything you'd call original, but the manner in which it was taken and the way the artists delved into their characters' humanity spoke volumes on the movie's behalf.The professionals who worked on ""Annette"" made every scenario and musical number work. I didn't believe the hype until I saw it for myself. This film isn't for everyone, but for a Sparks Bros. Fan like myself I was happy to see the duo back in full form. One may even call Amazon Prime Video's ""Annette"" a bona fide 'Sparks Brothers musical'.",Annette

If you ask me what is the movie about, I have no clue, I was hoping to get something from it but it was just pointless.

37,pronitmallick,Abstract musical approach,4,26 August 2021,"Annette is a movie that in the first hand feels like a soothing musical approach that we may have experienced before or not. In the first few minutes of presentation director Leos Carax throws a bunch of details of the characters and the setup of the film. The pacing in the first act feels normal and reasonable but as time goes by, it feels stretched and after a while overly stretched. Performance of the main two attractions, Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard delivered quite a performance for this musical number which makes us both intrigued and kinda confused. The elements in this movie flows in such an abstract way that you don't understand when time passed by so quickly. In the second and third act the movie seems quite predictable and the potential of the screenplay starts to fade out. Right in the last quarter of the movie you just wants to skip to the very end and question yourself that, 'Was it worth it or not?'. Story itself seems like an approach that will only take your time but not return anything that worthwhile. Overll it's a film you can approach for once and let your instincts decide that if you wanna walk past it again or not.",Annette

45,afrocut,Cut strings,6,18 September 2021,"Wow, this is something so different, so unusual and so interesting that it almost begs to be seen. This way it can Creep into your subconscious as it has mine. ""Annette"" is a Musical Drama written by the Mael brothers, from the unclassable band ""Sparks"" and directed by Leos Carax, director of ""Holy Motors"". It stars Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard as a famous Hollywood couple in love, maybe with each other, possibly with the spotlight and even more so with themselves. We watch as they do their insanely different, but oddly similar, stage shows, he's a wildly popular comedian who ""kills"" his audience with laughter and she is a super star Opera singer who saves her audience through her nightly tragic stage deaths. We follow, like their adoring public, as they Marry, get pregnant and then, of course, give birth to a wooden puppet child named Anette. This is of course a metaphor, one that is a little to apparent, but strikingly odd and intriguing nonetheless. Annette is an object, just like many children who's parents have them out of need to hold the marriage together, to give them purpose in life. As such we follow along with the downward spiral of their celebrity, their marriage and the use of Annette as a puppet for fame. Adam Driver is very good in this movie, giving way more emotion to his performance than the material deserves, he seems to elevate the film just by being in it. Cotillard on the other hand seems miscast and out of place through out most of the movie hurting her character in the process. My favorite aspect of the movie is actor Simon Helberg's character, who is not in the movie nearly enough, but shows up as an accompanist and admirer of Cotillard's character. His dialogue is spoofing of both Hollywood and musicals and is hilariously fourth wall breaking. This aspect of the film, the self aware and mocking tone, is by far its strongest suit, something the ""Sparks"" excel at in their simplistic lyrics. But the movie is so filled with multiple tones, styles and chances that it can go over long and tiresome at times. It's a shame to because there are some great aspects that will stick with you, especially its ending. The last moments are gut wrenching and little actress Devyn McDowell is scene stealing along side Driver in one of my favorite movie endings in recent memory. Sadly it isn't enough to make the whole movie an enjoyable enough experience to rate higher. 6/10.",Annette
46,catebaum,Misses its mark despite great performances,5,23 August 2021,"What do you get when two white guys in California in their seventies write a musical they were originally doing as an album? Unfortunately this. Sparks, while undeniably brilliant in their youth can't write for toffee now and like Bowie's rotten musical at the end of his life, they shouldn't have bothered. The music is drab and actually embarrassing at times. The first song is great, and then the whole thing musically falls on its face.The other thing you get when old white guys put together a project with a French director is gross and unnecessary sex scenes. Why Marion Cotillard agreed to let the world see her like that, i.e. More or less in porn, is quite bizarre and rapey. I was very put off by it. The birth scene that follows would be panned in a high school musical the actors are so bad.On the plus side, the performances are fantastic. Adam Driver's washed up comedian who isn't even telling jokes is astounding, but the character has been written with little motivation, so makes no sense. Marion Cotillard does her best but seems put off for most of the film, probably thinking of those sex scenes. She dies far too early in the movie and her affair, a pivot of the movie, is not even hinted at, some cack-handed attempt at covering the reveal we could all see a mile off that really had little to do with anything.The real treasures here are Simon Helberg, the absorbed conductor who gives a brilliant performance in every scene; and Devyn McDowell, a Shirley Temple-esque performer who is mindblowingly good. If only they had used her the whole film instead of the stupid puppet! It would have been so much easier to relate to if we had a real girl, and the puppet isn't even that good.But at the end of the movie you are left wondering why this had to exist. It says nothing, makes no comment, and loses its thread pretty fast. While there are some parts that have been filmed nicely, it's no LaLa Land, and the credit sequence of everyone walking down a hill congratulating themselves is truly cringeworthy. You are left with the idea that the film was great fun to make for everyone involved, but not so much for everyone watching it.",Annette

48,d-alston,"Dark, musical and magical.",10,22 August 2021,"This is a story about passion, greed, exploitation and murder.But It's also an intriguing and sumptuous movie that may fly over the heads of (and consequently irritate) those who only speak the language of the mainstream Hollywood output.There's very little for such viewers to hold on to here.Ron and Russell Mael of Sparks (the tour de force of pop music who have been creating and innovating genres for decades) provide the music and the script for this rock opera (probably slightly more opera than rock most of the time) in which very little spoken dialogue is allowed; replaced instead by melodic riffs, musical vignettes, and several full-on songs, some of which feature snippets from earlier Sparks songs. My only complaint with the music is that some of the catchier pieces don't last nearly long enough.Leos Carax, the director, tells a visually-stylised story about a celebrity couple whose relationship is eroded by simmering envy as one partner sees his career take a nose dive, while the other's soars to greater heights.Adam Driver acts his socks off as an edgy comedian whose artistry emerges from a truculent and self-serving personality, while Marion Cotillard does her best to share the limelight as a much more demure and angelic presence.There's also a great turn by Simon Helberg, notably as he delivers emotional verbal exposition whilst conducting an orchestra.The deliberately and obviously studio-bound sets add a huge amount to the theatrical, fantasy atmosphere:
Most strikingly when the two leads alternately wrestle and dance on the swaying deck of a yacht, in front of the obvious back projection of gigantic waves - and whenever the character of their daughter, Annette, is present, since she is (unapologetically and blatantly) an animatronic puppet.This eponymous child adds a supernatural element to the story - but, since even the more mundane situations to be found here are rendered with a trippy, surreal quality, the child's other-wordly ability is easy to take in stride.The music is alternately epically- symphonic, edgy and rocky, melodic and poppy and new-wave cacophonous.I simply can't understand viewers who claimed they were bored during this movie.Not only was I riveted throughout, I instantly wanted to watch it all again.I really feel like awarding this an ""8/10"", but am giving it a""10"" in order to counteract the inexplicable scores of ""1"" that I've seen.",Annette

Man, we go to the movies too!).Cotillard, practically invisible, tiptoes past, reaches out to pick up the check with her usual elegance and disappears without a trace of her supposed performance.And the pitiful icing on the cake is put by Simon Helberg (the 'Jew' from Big Bang Theory) cloning to the millimeter the role he already played in 'Florence Foster Jenkins'... Jeez, for me that was already too much! As if there were no actors who play the piano and as if there were no movies to play the brilliant shy guy, they choose him to do the same, exactly the same thing, he did five years ago.

60,thebeachlife,Kitschy Rock Opera?,7,25 August 2021,"I didn't even realize that a drama could be shown in SUCH a way that it has been in ANNETTE by Leos Carax.At first glance, it looks as though the film takes pride in being kitschy, gaudy and superficial. But deep down it is far from being pop: it started as a glitzy musical, worked its way into a love story and ended up as a thriller with all the lines and metamorphoses sung rather than said. Was Marion Cotillard really singing or was it just another hallucination of this haunting film? I am not sure I want to know.",Annette
61,trav123,So Beautifully Artistic and yet Boring that it does not work as a Film as No Story or Character Depth!!,4,25 August 2021,I was very excited to see this surreal film wondering what Carax /Sparks would manifest in this supposed masterpiece... and instead it is just an experimental musical/opera with fantastic set pieces but the story has no depth and the characters are so shallow it makes one wonder what was the writer thinking - and unfortunately the wonderful endless musical sets and repetitive dull songs do not entertain enough to merit 2 hours and 40 mins of it.Even with fantastic performances by both Leads it did not keep ones interest to want to continue on this surreal artistic journey. There is an art form to story telling and unfortunately this writer instead focuses only on musical performances that might work as a theatre/opera musical yet fails miserably in this movie format - and almost everyone in the theatre was leaving not out of awe of the performances but out of total boredom and being unable to really connect with the two main characters. It did not work for me at all and i love surreal artistic films.A 10 for artistic expression and musical scenes and singing... but i can only give it a 4 as a Film as it falls flat as a movie and story. Maybe they should have stuck with original idea of making it into a musical opera/theatre tour instead of a film.Looking forward to next film by Carax....,Annette
62,dswhitcomb,Who doesn't love a murderous musical featuring a puppet?,6,30 August 2021,"Formulaic isn't what I would call this movie. It's a musical thriller featuring a singing baby puppet. It took me two sittings to get through this movie. The second and third acts are better than the first so if you can get behind the premise and unique style of this movie then you should be able to watch it without too many pauses to say, ""huh?"".Adam Driver once again shows us why he is most versatile actor of today. He plays a blue comedian whose star falls quickly after a dark and ominous performance. He portrays this all while singing monotone lyrics about love, death, and depression. (What, that old trope?)The songs are repetitive and drag on at times. They repeat their lyrics over and over without moving the story along. The cinematography is the true winner here. I haven't seen anything quite like this on the screen. I would recommend this movie to those who like to watch art house films or who are in need of watching something that would disgust their in-laws.",Annette

That film is also great, clever, funny.Before I saw Annette I watched with great pleasure the Sparks Movie and like all their long standing fans I was excited to learn about Annette, their dream project realized at last and with famous actors and a large budget. The film opens and you feel this is going to be a great nonstop musical/artistic experience. Half way through I had to stop. I had questions, why was this so bad when the parts ought to add up to something, anything? But did not.I took a week off, maybe longer.When I got back to it Annette was still a puppet, Adam Driver was shrinking and the music was more repetitive, the plot obvious. Where this was going was not interesting anymore but I stuck with it because art/Sparks and low and behold in the last 16 minutes this movie found it's heart, Annette.Young actor Devyn McDowell delivers the only convincing original performance in his entire cinematic folly. I still admire the Mael brothers even more so that they pulled this off but the only recommendation I have is to watch Devyn McDowell's career she quite literally delivered the best performance in the entire film.",Annette

The music was kind of hard to get into, reminded me of Sweeny Todd, a lot of conversation that they're singing instead.When Annette, the wooden puppet aka Atheir love child, is born, it weirded me out. I compared it to Renesmee of the Twilight series, however I kept through it and honestly Annette grew on me, especially when she sings. There's something hauntingly beautiful about it.I can't say there are any musical numbers in it that will stick with me or I'll be downloading, however I'm a huge Adam Driver fan and he's very raw and brilliant in it, as well as Marion.Was I fan of his character? Absolutely not.If you're going to watch this film for anything let it be for the ending song / scene between Adam and Annette.With that being said, I think everyone should at least see this movie once though.",Annette

Annette deals with fame and money in show business industry.Music and performances are amazing. Adam Driver proves that he is the leading and the best of his generation. Annette would not have been successful without him. Everything works perfectly in this film.

Their kid is a miracle apparently.I honestly didn't understand the point of this movie. It wasn't entertaining, wasn't uplifting nor inspiring, wasn't thought-provoking.I don't know what it was.

76,g_imdb-43,Wanted to turn it off and rush out to the theater,6,4 September 2021,"Many people have walked out on this movie. I do not understand people who feel they have the right to review a movie that they haven't seen to the end - what if an amazing ending justified the parts they didn't like?I had the opposite reaction. Because I was finding it difficult to watch at home (terrible ""false contouring"" on Amazon video, too much dynamic audio range to watch at night, and too bizarre to keep my attention), about 25 minutes into the film I was Googling around, and noticed it had just started at the Landmark Theater, five minutes away. I seriously considered turning the projector off, jumping in my car and heading to the theater - with 10 minutes of previews I figured I was sure to get there with some overlap. I WANTED to be forced to watch this movie, like a movie was intended to be watched.But because of Covid, I don't do things like that anymore. No way, no how, now even, not now! So instead I spent the next few days slogging through the movie to the end.It was not worth it.To say ""Annette"" starts out slow and then sputters out all together might be stealing a line from Stephen Stills (just as ""Ape"" steals a few lines from Tom Leher), but that's how I felt. I was hoping ""Annette's surprise gift"" was to bring people back from the dead! (Why not?) But that was pretty-far off.By giving up his comedy routine, ""Ape"" lost the contrived tool of character self expression that might have made the second half more interesting.And the final ending, so cold... yes, I understand that was the point, but it really left me, the viewer, wondering what I had learned about humanity or anything else, and the answer seemed to be: nothing.If these auteurs wanted to make an entertaining film, perhaps ""Ape"" could have continued to perform AS his life went down-hill, leading to a final, hopefully hysterical performance in (can't say where he ends up, that's a spoiler) but you get the point.But the point. I didn't get it. Thus the 6-star review.",Annette
77,andyge,Truly original cinematic experience,10,22 August 2021,"Wow!!! This is what great cinema is all about....breaking boundaries,being experimental ... doing something different . Firstly this is not a musical it is a modern film opera.. there's not many of them ...so don't think you are going to come out whistling a happy tune. This is a visually stunning film with some truly epic set pieces.There is a serious message as well for this 'me too ' generation about man's need to act and be like god and control all aspects of life ..including death . There is symbolic imagery all over the film too from the marionette Ann ette to the Eve like apples that Marion Cotillard keeps biting into .. or is that representing Snow White.Carax gives this film everything he's got and I have to admit half way through I was all for giving up but somehow he pulls you round and by the end you can see his intentions and reasoning behind the imagery and performances. This is a film you can wait years for and I can assure you are not going to forget. Driver and Cottilard are on epic form . Stick with this film for a truly great experience.

80,maryannfarley,Enchanting,10,29 August 2021,"I can't recall the last time I felt this way about a film. I watched it for the second time today and, as with all great art, got so much more from it the second time around. The film's repeating melodic theme (from the song ""We Love Each Other So Much"") is deeply moving and soon becomes the connective tissue throughout the movie. And the three leads--Adam Driver, Marion Cottilard and Simon Helberg--could not be more perfect in their roles, which sounds almost trite to say, considering the courage it took for each to commit as deeply as they did.I will say that the film almost lost me about a half hour into it, when at that precise moment something seemed to shift. What on the surface seemed like a glib experiment with a modern musical soon became a deep dive into the heart of ambition, love, jealousy, parenthood and betrayal.The direction, narrative and acting are superb, but it's the music that will set the whole enterprise in concrete in your heart and mind. Give ""Annette"" a chance. Try not to be put off by its strangeness, and instead, put your trust in the capable hands of Leos Carax and the gang. By the end, you may still question whether or not you liked it as much as I did, but you will never forget it.",Annette

But trying to figure out the ""Deep Meaning' Just for the record, never heard of Sparks. Must be a reason they skiddled to Europe. Also, awesome people. Once they became popular over there they got rid of their other members who some wound up committing suicide. And that crap, we are so mysterious we won't reveal anything about ourselves. What are you afraid of? Boring people to death? Or someone will leave burning dog poop on your porch? Like you left us with this crap.Ape of God is symbolic for devil. The wooden puppet is because the parents used the kid. Can't figure out the apples and bananas. Maybe because Anne was like Eve but you got me confused over the bananas.The real child is the only thing worth watching. She is ADORABLE. Which has me further confused why that ugly puppet was used. What was the reason for the huge ears? Another AMAZING symbolic POS? Henry thought the kid was like his stage persona, 'Ape' of God?Which is another thing. His performance was cringe worthy as a comedian. If you are going to make him a funny famous amazing comedian and rich guy, make me laugh. I was embarrassed for him What was up with the bathrobe? Another symbolic thing I can't get?I like Adam Driver. He is NOT THE BEST as I have read in some reviews. This movie could not be saved with George Clooney . Driver always plays a tortured artistic individual. I am sure he is throwing a chair thru a window reading all the bad reviews. Poor torturted soul. I know Marion Cotillard singing was dubbed, why they didn't do the same for Adam Driver is beyond me. If Devyon McDowell sang, she was awesome. So, between the embarrassing singing "" We love you so much, I want to slit my vocal chords"" to the embarrassing cunnilingus ( I was so turned off and humiliated) and LENGTH of the movie. This trash should have been 2 hours shorter. It was awful. Stop with the I don't get it cause I am not artistic enough. I am an artist and so is my daughter. She teaches.

Boy was I wrong. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen to redeem itself but a little over half way in I couldn't take it anymore. I know Adam can sing from A Marriage Story, but when started singing We Love Each Other So Much, I couldn't help but think about how embarrassed I was for Pierce Brosnan when he busted into song in Mamma Mia. I'm an artist and they say art is considered good if it makes the audience feel something. I felt confusion, stupid for watching it, mad at myself for wasting the time I put into it, and sad because it was so not good. So I guess as an art piece it is very successful. But as a movie? Not so much. At one point when Adam is flopping around on stage and screaming, my dog literally jumped off the couch and started staring and barking violently at the TV.

In fact it was sooooo repetitive that I was frequently fast forwarding so as not to die of boredom. Not for one second did I feel a single emotion with the exception of the accompanist/ conductor working & the very very end scene with Annette. Those two fleeting moments were great.

After a long time I saw people leaving the hall midway.If it was half an hour shorter and had more dialogues than singing it would have got a cult following. But the artistic creativity won over an entertaining experience.Acting is amazing and visuals haunt even after the movie. Couple of songs are beautiful but the other 38 seem to be just more of what you have already heard.The wooden baby doll is unexplainable. I pushed my brain to come up with a justification but failed. Probably the writers will share an explanation one day.You will either hate or love the movie. Everyone inbetween is just confused. And I am one of them.When I see such a movie I like to to watch it again. But this is too slow with too much singing.

99,apereztenessa-1,Masterpiece,10,26 August 2021,"I have now watched Annette twice, once in the theatre (as it should be seen) and once at home on Prime Video (a great option to rewatch). The first time, I was impressed and intrigued but confused and left somewhat uneasy. But it stayed with me and I wanted to watch it again. The second time I fell completely in love. Annette is a major work of art, most likely the best film of the year (although we still have 5 months to go, it's hard to imagine what could beat it) and already one of the best of the decade.While the reviews on this site have mentioned the repetitive music and surprising choices (such as Annette being a marionette), few seem to have asked the question: what is Annette about?And that'a not surprising, because It's a difficult question to answer. Like all great works of art, Annette has many layers of interpretation. On the surface, it's about how a couple breaks down and then exploits their child. For those surprised by the choice of a puppet for the Annette character, think how inappropriate it would have been to make a film about child exploitation in show biz... by using a real child actress. A small effort of imagination required of the audience for a truly ethical choice. That question of filmmaking ethics is omnipresent in all of high quality French cinema (US producers seem not to have realized that ""a traveling is a moral choice"", as Godard once said), and it pervades Annette. For example, one of the questions Annette asks is: what does it mean to make a musical in film? Is it about just adding some music to a regular film? Or is it about creating something different, letting the music and images create the story and emotions instead of the script? Accordingly, the lines in the film are reminiscent of production notes (one can imagine the page saying ""Ann and Henry love each other so much""), highlighting the production artifact instead of hiding it. But it is not just about the words. How you choose to film a musical is a deep question. Is the musical fundamentally a theatre form and it's best shot like Hamilton to expose its nature? Or should it try to convey the realism of movies (an attempt that is usually mocked)? Carax chooses none, mixing theatre and reality at different times to create a unique musical style. The juxtaposition of theatre production and realistic production creates discomfort in us as the audience, highlighting our unspoken mental barriers but also our discomfort with the idea that theatre and real life could not be fully separated contexts. As Carax does that, the very question of theatre va reality emerges. When does one start and the other end? In Annette, life bleeds into theatre and theatre into life. But if theatre is life, then is making Annette tour the world an exploitation or is it part of life, and is taking theatre away from her like taking life out of her (as she says in the end when she says she will never sing again and become ""a vampire"")? Who is responsible and on what grounds/ on what moral code? As an extra for readers who made it so far, consider that Leos Carax's wife committed suicide and left him with a single daughter. Life and theatre mixing again, in an even deeper emotional level.Probably enough to leave it there, but I could go on, and I know more layers will emerge as I continue to reflect on this film. Hopefully this brief text shed some light into the depth of Annette and why some people obsess about it. For us, it is ""out of this world"" and of unmatched beauty.",Annette
100,tiancaipipi110,Missed opportunity.,2,28 August 2021,"The film certainly got some gem, a stand-up comedian looked into the abyss to push the boundaries of creativity but got lost in the darkness and absorbed by his jealousy that pushed him to be a murderer. The idea of having baby Annette looking like a puppet as a reflection of his insanity is interesting but hard to swallow till the end.The biggest downfall is its directing. The story develops from romance to jealousy to mental illness, (something is missing here before it heads to) redemption(the realization of love from a man who has never loved Annette but to use her for financial gain). So from the audience point of view, the theme is scattered in different places and lacks consistency and integrity.Poorly executed cinematography and editing and repetitive dull music and dialog are other problems of this film. For example, it'll be better and more consistent if the film removes all those transparent ghost like visuals, including

102,takirah26,Ehhhh,5,28 August 2021,Adam was amazing. He threw himself into the role as he always does and he played it well. That is where it ends. Everything else falls by the wayside. I'm not even going to address the doll that's a cross between chucky and Annabelle. The other characters have zero development. One minute they appear onscreen and the next they are gone and you won't even really notice. I found myself wanting this to end sooner rather than later. Adam did a very good job with what was givo.

After an hour and a ½ , i did, for the first time in my life. The songs were so repetitive, with the same sentences repeated 10 times, in almost each song. The movie was long. The comedy elements were not funny at all, I was sitting and watching, saying to myself, how is this possible, to be so bad, so boring, so long, so detached from any emotion, so ui-involved? Yes, some scenes had visual color and beauty and some imagination built into the decor, but is this enough to keep me on my seat? There was fakeness in the stories, i was just so disappointed. I wasn't the only one leaving the theater too. Other women were, before me. I did not ask for a refund, I tried to be generous to all the people who put that movie together. But they owe me some popcorn..",Annette
110,michael_vachon,Amazingly Bad Movie,1,18 September 2021,"It's hard to objectively describe this ""movie"" without sounding liking a hater. Whatever it is, it's not a movie. On the plus side, Marion Cotillard is radiant and passionate (as she always is), there are a few creative moments, and the introduction is great - it's creative, punchy, and cheeky.After the intro, I thought this was going to be something special, but my impression changed quickly. First, the characters are cardboard cutouts. I watched it for a little over an hour, and by that time we literally knew nothing about them - and I really mean NOTHING. We don't know if they have friends, or if either of them has ever had a single friend. We have no idea whether they had families or were raised on the streets. We don't know if they like anything, or if they dislike anything. All we know is that he is a shock comedian, she is an opera star, and they love each other. And this brings us to three additional problems: first, all the songs are sung in a monotonous staccato; second, the song lyrics are obnoxiously repetitive; and three, Annette commits the cardinal sin in cinematic storytelling - it tries to tell you everything instead of showing you. For example, how do we know the characters are in love? They sing a song in which the ONLY lyrics are ""We're in love,"" repeated more than 20 times - and they don't mix up the tempo, every time it is the same staccato. How do we know Driver is a successful shock comedian? We see one of his live shows, in which his jokes aren't actually funny, but the audience sings staccato lyrics saying that they are laughing.In some ways, my one-star rating isn't fair because I don't think this piece was trying to be a ""movie."" But judged as a movie, it is an utter failure.",Annette
111,terrible_woman,I reckon the first 20 mins is a decent litmus test on if the rest is for you.,7,18 September 2021,"The beginning is self-indulgent and slow, and it takes too long to get to the Annette hook of the movie. Once Annette comes in it stops taking the piss.This movie could do with shaving about 30-40 minutes off- the story isn't totally using every minute with efficient purpose, and it would benefit from being tighter. If you had this on DVD or Streaming you'd know when you were safe to skim to the next scene.I will inform that it's not a Musical movie in the more known sense a la Sound of Music or Hairspray or anything. It's one where it's sung more or less the whole way through and you'll get a lot of operatic vocal runs- I'd compare it to much of Les Mis.While I'm not hooked on the pacing, I REALLY love this film artistically, which is where it scores points for me. Its visual presentation and its fable-type story points are deeply up my alley. Just simple but classic fantasy ideas at work. My overall adjective on the film would be 'interesting'.Watch the first 20 minutes, and if you're into that then you'll be compelled by the rest of it.

116,brankocerny,Exhibitionist emotional manipulation,6,7 July 2021,"This might be an unpopular opinion here as the film was selected to open Cannes, and so clearly the committee of experts saw a lot of artistic merit to it. To me, however, it felt like a student play that tries so so hard to be avant-garde that it forgets to be anything else.I went to a premiere in Prague and halfway in, people were leaving the theater in droves. That's not necessarily the sign of a bad film to me - not everything is for everyone. I still wanted to like it: I like stylized films. I enjoy the surreal. I'm here for the modern musical, genre-melding, society critique. But I had to fight the growing urge to leave myself.The positives first: you can see the budget at work, the set design and photography are fabulous. Even the 4th wall breaking beginning with the director himself kicking off the film was kind of cheekily confident and got me excited. The pacing is intense and there's a lot of energy. The leads are obviously fantastic actors.None of that saves the film, however. For being so tightly paced and filled with intensity and musical numbers - it's actually really boring. All the songs follow the same lazy pattern and so while you enjoy the first couple, eventually you find out it's really just people singing one sentence over and over to a rock/opera backdrop.Adam Driver's performance, especially on stage as a comedian, is powerful - but he kind of stays in just one gloomy tortured emo cry baby position and you don't get to see much of his redeeming qualities (like you did in, say, A Star is Born). Marion Cotillard's characters is essentially just a figure head for kindness and purity who doesn't get much real space to act.The film is long but the story basic and utterly predictable. There is a lot of emotional manipulation. You're shown a lot of ""gasp"" shots like Adam Driver performing oral sex on his pregnant wife, her wiping herself on the toilet, and the story overall develops into more and more troubling areas. This comes with a growing visceral gut punch: the general reception of the film where I saw it was people were feeling kind of anxious and sick to their stomach. That could be a good thing, some of the most powerful cinema is very visceral and art doesn't have to be pretty - if only there were some real substance to justify that. But if you just show the inevitable tragic decline of a family and tightly pack increasingly disquieting sights and atmosphere - but don't really show any real development to your characters or give the audience a proper chance to care about them because everything is delivered just as a singing chapter title - well what you get is 2.5hrs or visually stunning emotional manipulation that is hollow at its core.The whole thing left me feeling like an artist who is so preoccupied with being artsy that he forgot what's beautiful about art in the first place. If anyone finds its heart, please point me to it.",Annette

It would have been better as a concept album.I can admit that I eventually got into it and actually enjoyed it more as the film progressed, even if I didn't understand parts of it at the time or appreciate it as others have in terms of ""art"". I can understand why some people had the urge to leave or actually did leave. Liking the Mael-Music certainly helped but why have the actors sing the lines instead of speaking the lines.If, like me, you like the Mael brother's musical work then why not give it a go.

Repeating a series of lines over and over does not make a song. It's annoying more than anything else.Some of the visuals are clever and compelling, some just feel forced or silly. The story could be told in 15 minutes.Halfway through the film my wife leaned over and said ""It's not just me is it, this is terrible?""

'Annette' doesn't know what it wants to be and what exact story it's gonna tell us. The cut is so amateurish, sometimes scenes switch without any resolution. Moreover, there is no emotional connection between Driver's and Cotillard's characters, which comes right in your face, especially when they sing 'We Love Each Other So Much'.Oh, talking about the songs.Since I'm from Eastern Europe and I am of millennial generation, I have never heard about Sparks before (shame on me). But after this movie I just know I don't like their stuff. I'm a songwriter myself and I also love musicals, but the songs in this film are one of the most sloppy things I've ever seen in mainstream ever. The songs are basically built by the same formula, and, the worst thing, the lyrics of a song usually consist of one single line repeating over and over again (it's not an overstatement).I actually enjoyed sound design and some music (not songs!) here, and there were also some good shots here and there.But in the end, I found this movie a huge senseless mess.It struggles so hard to be artsy and pretentious that in the end it has nothing to offer at all.

This is a painfully boring film. Almost all of the dialogue is sung and much of the time, it's garbled and incomprehensible. And the music is dull, generic, almost all of it in the same tempo and style. The ""love theme"" has the incredibly banal title ""We Love Each Other So Much"", a phrase sung ad nauseam in a scene lasting probably ten minutes but which seemed more like an hour.Poor Adam Driver .... I felt embarrassed for him and what he was forced to do. His stand up ""comedy"" routine is cringingly unfunny. How could this guy ever be a worldwide comic sensation?Marion Cotillard is barely a presence in this movie; she ""disappears"" half way through and then re-appears as a kind of specter from the deep, a way of giving her a little more screen time but without any purpose.In summary: a boring, amateurish mess.

I assume that opera directors don't have to find new stories anymore, as the audience doesn't even want a new story, they are much more interested in an another original look at the existing one.With all this out of the way, I think, that ""Annette"" is not being understood correctly. The story (even if it's slow and dull) isn't the only thing that makes a movie. If you find yourself watching this film again, pay attention to the acting and editing of the movie. If not for editing I would have assumed that I'm watching a recording of a modern opera or a theater piece. That's why I can recommend this film only to the dauntless among you, namely to the opera fans, who want to see something modern without an additional classical orchestra, and also to the ""Sparks"" fans, who no matter what will be really happy to hear ""Spark"" songs in an expensive musical video with a transparent plot.I have 2 grades for this picture.

138,Andrew-Henry-Enriquez,Bold colors and wan vocals,7,22 August 2021,"""Annette"" is not a conventional film musical, instead seeming like something you'd see in a black box theater with a small cast playing multiple roles and some not-quite-avant-garde staging.The visual style crossfades between mundane, (nighttime motorcycle rides, the same winking lights of Los Angeles seen from the foothills of so many films), magical realism (opera stages that become moonlit glades), and abstract. Intentionally absurdist TMZ-style segments introduce new phases of the story.The music is repetitive and wan, with Adam Driver producing many of the same thin, scratchy falsetto sounds as Hugh Jackman in ""Les Mis"" Marion Cotillard alternately signing for herself and obviously dubbed.The vocal lines often remind me of sections of Sondheim, when he uses quasi-tonal, wan phrasing such as in the song ""Barcelona."" He uses it much more sparingly than this score, which seldom builds into much melody. This, of course, could be intentional. The important repeated bit of song ""we love each other so much"" might actually be intended to ironically suggest desperation and insufficiency in the emotion.The story is simple and deals with cardboard cutouts of characters, by design-- which is why Annette herself is so strangely effective.This is her film, after all, though Driver's Henry McHenry-- an edgy, self-loathing standup comedian-- is the central focus, really.Simon Helberg-- somewhat reprising his accompanist role from ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" has some of the more interesting moments of acting, and is the subject of a particularly bravura circular tracking shot that's the real filmmaking highlight of the latter part of the film.All in all, an impressive, if bewildering, fever dream of film that is not the sum of its parts, and doesn't add up to much, but will enchant you with its visuals and haunt you with its oversimplified plainsong.",Annette

I also walked out on Grease on Ice so that's telling you where I truly see this hot mess belongs).

You also don't go into this film because you're a Driver/Cotillard/Helberg/puppet fan. You go into.this film as a fan, knowing, ""getting"", or think you ""get"" Sparks or Carax. It's the Maels vision of their concept album, manifested into a scripted film. Getting, or thinking you get Sparks is a very important part of the mindset you need to appreciate this output. I've been a 45 year Sparks fan. I see them around cafes and various parties in LA. They're incredible siblings. They're anomalies. When you meet them, they are normal, nice, affable people, but their visions of creativity (and nonstop work ethic) have no boundaries. They experiment with and push the the edges of the evolution of their craft. If you've followed their evolution of their music, you can see this film being perfectly what it should be. Maybe not for everyone.I saw the film at the LA preview a couple days ago, where the brothers also played a music set before the film. The film can be slow in parts - but in the end, I left the film the way I believe the Maels/Carax intended - feeling weird, somewhat uncomfy, amazed, and satisfied all in one.That's my feeling - I hope I've experienced what was intended.",Annette

The music is mediocre and their operatic script hanging by a thread. It's a script that has Dancer in The Dark in the back of its mind, but it's only a spark. And it's a script made worse by truly terrible performances.Driver's attempt at Henry McHenry is both emotionless and over the top at the same time. Like Barry Manilow, Driver expresses emotion by raising the volume. His Mount Rushmore expression and one-note acting/singing enervating; and witnessing him running in place for two hours and 20 minutes beyond exhausting. He is definitely game as an actor, but he still only hits one out of 30 shots. As a friend said: Nobody plays Adam Driver like Adam Driver.Simon Helberg fares no better.

Henry is supposed to be a shock comedian, but the writing for his comedy show was awful. Zero character development. Gratuitous nudity that did nothing for the disheveled plot nor characters. Why did Ann and Henry love each other? We have no clue what the likes or saw in each other. And when did Ann fu(k Pinocchio and have his baby? All the characters were as shallow and meaningless as the songs that were just bad repetitive dialogue set to music. If I saw this in the theater I would hate it, on the movie screen, I hate it. I don't understand how anyone can give this more than 1 star, it wasn't even drivel, it was just total bullsh\t.",Annette
152,ocupadoemnascer,A disturbing perspective on domestic violence,5,28 July 2021,"As others have said, the movie is well made, the set design is beautiful, the acting is generally convincing. The music is quite boring which is problematic for a musical.Another of the movie's problems is that it tries to pack so much in two hours and a half. The story simply goes too fast and lacks in sophistication.But my main issue with the movie is the almost romanticization of domestic violence. Emotional abuse and domestic violence are the main themes of the movie. It is clearly anxiety-inducing, especially for victims of such abuses, but it is made worse as the main character gets away with a lot. I suspect this is another bad case of male gaze.Overall, it made the movie a very unpleasant experience.",Annette

If you want to be enthralled by a rock opera that takes you on a journey then this is the movie for you.

You might love it, you might hate it. But from my point of view, Annette is objectively a masterpiece.

If that does not sound appealing, you will probably not like Annette.Even if you are a big musical fan, Annette is not an ordinary musical, it's an opera.Yes, the lyrics are repetitive, but they're supposed to be. Listen to more songs by Sparks, you'll notice that repetitiveness is in many of their songs.Before watching this, look into it on your own. If it doesn't seem like it's for you, then don't watch.

The start with the director was great, the visuals were very nice for the first few minutes. Then it just becomes annoying.For most of the film I though there was a critique there on the use of child-actors. In the end it turns out it was just a visuals choice.

175,emersonsydneye,"Yeah, it's creative, but at what cost?",1,20 August 2021,"I have never written a review for a movie in my life, but this smoking-hot film festival nightmare has compelled me. Some of what everybody is saying is true: there's good cinematography, the opening scene is promising, and the puppetry is technically excellent....And then there's everything else. Adam Driver is a banana-scarfing, cigarette-smoking, bathrobe-wearing edgelord. Supposedly, he's a comedian. (I don't buy it.) Perhaps the deadpan, cranky man baby tantrum is a commentary on something. I don't care to find out-all I know is that it was tediously long and painful to watch. An antihero isn't a bad thing. I love having a main character who does terrible things. But Driver's performance truly does not change at all throughout the entire movie-stony, an arbitrarily violent cliche.Marion Cotilliard, an extremely talented actress, is given a role as essentially a singing cardboard cutout. The character is written flatter than a Wheat Thin. It's not her fault-she did what she could with it. But Ann is nothing more than a plot device. The motorcycle has more character depth and development than Ann. Ann is a sad trope from years gone past-a pure hearted soprano who meets a tragic doom and becomes a creep's obsession. I was hoping that the second half would subvert the tropes I saw it careening toward, but was sadly disappointed when it stuck to the Lost Lenore and Byronic Hero tropes.Overall, the writing is one-note and predictable. There are plot threads that never resolve. And, at the end, I think it failed to make whatever point it was trying to make. Is Henry remorseful? Can't tell, he's been making the same facial expression for two hours. Is Ann culpable? Hell if I know, the last time I saw her, her ghost was cuddling with Adam Driver for some reason. The good cinematography is jarringly interrupted by the loud, shoddily-animated 21st century newsreel segments. In the end, it's your classic Edgy White Man With Big Thoughts Driven To Insanity In Part By His Beautiful Wife, Who Could Just As Easily Be Played By A Mannequin movie.It truly does leave you with a lot of questions. Questions like ""why is he always in a bathrobe?"" and ""who thought it was a good idea to have a moodily-lit shot of Adam Driver clutching a stuffed monkey?"" and ""what if a mildly horrifying puppet baby performed the Super Bowl halftime show?""",Annette

The songs are so on the nose and repetitive that we believed it must be a parody of generic broadway gimmick for the first half. Until you realize that if taken as a parody it's at the expense of abuse victims and the audience itself for spending hours of their life enduring a sad manboys sad manpain over being haunted by a rusalka he created. And if you were to take it at face value it's so devoid of any kind of depth that it must be written by an AI. The script lacks sophistication, songs lack even the most basic rhyme, often bordering on lacklustre spoken word and in case you couldn't follow the moral of the story with your galaxy brain they graciously spell it out every chance they get like it's made for infants.

I'm so sad that people see this as an art film. I never once thought of it that way. I never saw it as a musical. I never even saw it as a play. I only saw an opera. I'm still just digesting and processing it. Reliving moments and revisiting their impact and effect. I thought it was brilliant. I thought it was genius. I loved it. There are moments that gave me Hitchcock, especially in some cinematography devices. As someone who has loved opera since childhood, it gave me everything I wanted,
everything I needed to see was there. There were moments going into a scene that I would verbally ask for something to happen and it would be supplied and I would shout with joy because it was perfect. I didn't feel the time pass. I had no idea how long it was. I didn't care. I was transfixed and captured. No, it wasn't the lyrics that always took me. The lyrics floated on the larger moments, acting as enhancers. The moments in the birthing room or the van on the way to court. It was the capturing of the natural music found in those moments. That the birthing room music came from the sound of the monitors. Music came from the sound of the crowd with the hands pounding on the sides of the van or the protesters yelling. It was the natural music of moments. The music of making love, and music of grappling with a drunk on the top of a ship during a storm. There are so many beautiful tender small moments. There's so many deeply disturbing and powerful moments. And of course, tragedy, death and ghosts. It was absolutely classic, and yet, a more subtle giving of Romanticism. There were so many great devices from puppet to birthmark. Some people remarked that Anne was not present in the story enough. It wasn't her story. It was always Henry story. That became clear as soon as we were brought the accusations that gave us his past. That let us know we were on his journey. Anne gave the hope to tame the beast, to slay it with love and save Henry from himself and the abyss. She was always doomed. Most importantly, she gave Annette. Anne supplied the tragedy and of course, the ghost. Annette was the final pivot point for Henry, being both salvation and damnation. Driver is the L. O. of our generation. Yes, I said it. Bravo and brava to all. Every player nd performance was exactly as needed. I will stop here, but I could go on and on. I loved it. I think it is brilliant.

That would just be rough""...alright, playtime is over, here's my review.I liked this. It's good. I hope I'll see it at the Oscars, I think it deserves to be. But also, I doubt it will get any type of nomination. Sadly.If you're watching Annette, I'd definitely recommend you to know what you're getting yourself into. Watch some movie by Leos Carax just so you can brace yourself for some weirdness and things that may or may not make sense.With that said... this is mostly a straight forward movie that can be easily understood with some quirks thrown here and there.I'm a fan of musicals like this and I really enjoyed the songs. Adam Driver is not a great singer, but Marion Cotillard more than makes up for it. Simon Helberg is also in this and he did his part really well.Other than good songs, this movie has lots of comedic elements, mostly because of Adam Driver's character, who proved that he can do a lot of things (read the title of this review). The ironic elements may turn off some people from this movie, but I personally loved it.This feels more like a... hmm... I wanna say it feels more like a play rather than a movie. But that's the style that Carax wanted to portray I think. And I thought it was the right choice for a weird movie like this. It went from one setting to another, from one song to another, from one scene to another. So I guess the overall opinion of one would come from wether they loved most of the scenes or not.In Holy Motors there's the iconic scene in the middle of the movie. Here, the movie starts with a ""meta"" song about starting the movie. I've seen that many people thought that was the best scene of the movie... but I'm not one of those people. I thought this movie had many, many great scenes. Most of them came in the 2nd part of the movie and they really made my opinion of this movie higher than some parts in the middle. So I guess that the pacing of the movie is maybe the biggest problem.This is a 2h20m movie and... I didn't feel that the movie as a whole was too long... but I felt that some scenes went on for longer than needed.The good things are there. Cinematography, acting, directing and of course - songs. The movie lives and dies by the songs, or at least that's how I try to perceive musicals.Adam Driver was fantastic in this movie. I really hope he ends up getting an Oscar nom for this, his average-at-best singing aside. The guy really loses himself in the role of ""Bo Burnham on acid"", and he steals every scene he's in. He's funny when he needs to, he's scary when he needs to, he's captivating when it needs to, and he's singing averagely when he needs to.It really is a brave movie for Carax to do and he did a great job with it.It's a very normal movie that is strange enough for the normal people to find it... not their cup of coffee.And it's a very strange movei that is normal enough for the strange people to find it... not their cup of acid-laced-coffee.Overall, I liked it, and I really feel that it did everything it wanted to do.

I've never been a fan of Adam Driver, though I keep trying, but he's always contrived when he thinks he's spontaneous, safe when he thinks he's risk-taking, and boringly predictable. I have always felt like the kid yelling that the emperor has no clothes. Well, now I have proof. This smacks of his vanity project but unfortunately for him, it backfires. On music, regardless of how you feel about Sparks, these spark plugs got wet in the storm. It is strictly 1-2-3-4-5-7-1 and again in reverse. Over and over. The whole thing had a musical feel of a Theme and Variations because it all sounded the same...for 141 minutes. And it really does feel that long. In fact, near the end of the last scene, I promised myself that I was going to stop watching it if another scene came on, and I never leave a movie.

203,michaelbakercharmed,"Didn't hate it, but didn't really like it either.",4,7 August 2021,"This film was very weird. I usually like weird. I prefer weird. But this weirdness wasn't backed up by anything other than a solid Adam Driver acting performance (he's not a singer!) and good cinematography. Usually, when you have nothing good to say, you can always say, ""Good production values."" which this film had.First of all, it was supposed to be a musical. Adam Driver is a fabulous actor, but certainly not a singer. He can carry a tune. I don't know if Marion Cotillard sang her own songs, but whosever voice it was, was good.The music by the brother duo Sparks was awful. No, I don't know anything else by Sparks, and based on this soundtrack I think I'm fortunate. The lyrics were banal. The opening song ""So may we start"" had that as most of the lyrics for the choruses. ""So may we start."" Yeah, that's about it. Totally forgettable. The other songs, save one by Marion, were forgettable.The story itself is a common story. Boy from the wrong side of the tracks falls in love with a girl from the right side of the tracks. Will they survive their differences? Spoiler alert: They don't.They have a baby, name her Annette, but....wait for it....she's a wooden puppet. So are we watching Pinocchio now? And the puppet ... wait for it... looks like an Ape. Yes, an ape. Big ears, ape features. Why? Well, the boy does a rude comedy act called ""The Ape of God"". OK. And yes, there are bananas and other ape references throughout this mess of a film.At the end of Act II, something happens, that you kind of expect to happen. I enjoyed the cinematography of that scene, but you knew what was coming.The third Act is all about Annette for a while - yes the puppet can sing. Well, vocalise to be more precise. And float. She becomes a world-wide sensation. Ah, now I understand. The daughter is being used as a puppet by the father. OK.Too many plot holes. Too many good opportunities introduced and never used.Simon Helberg (from Big Bang Theory) does a nice part as the accompanist/conductor. But he doesn't have a name in the film. He's even credited as ""The Accompanist.""I can't understand how this was chosen for Cannes, other than it being very weird and people didn't want to call it out for the lack of anything else.Again, Adam Driver was fabulous, bringing all kinds of depth to his character, but even within that depth and range, it's still one-dimensional.I kept thinking that Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge was weird and was fabulous. Luc Besson's The Fifth Element was weird and was fabulous. Annette was just weird.",Annette
204,dii7-718-374980,"An Artistic,Sarcastic View on Art.",7,15 August 2021,"I rarely write review, maybe i've written once or twice before.I loved this movie, simply because it took to a place where I had to try and decipher every scene, a movie that challenged me in a sense.Adam Driver was exceptional as usual in his portrayal of a stand up comedian who is rude and says the taboo things (like many others in the same field) while Marion is the Opera Singer who's always dying and bowing, which for me was very well in an artistic way, yet sarcastic.The introduction of Annette as a doll makes a huge difference, was she a doll because everyone looked at her as an object and not a person? Adam Driver saw her as a way to prove that he was good? While Marion looked at her as an extension of herself? While Simon only saw her as the fruit of his lover of Anne? A look into what could've been?She's only seen by the end as a human being, when Adam Driver truly asks her forgiveness.The movie tackles child exploitation very well with some YouTube nods, shows women speaking out about abuse.The movie was visually stunning with some Tim Burton elements imo, it's a piece of art, not for everyone though.",Annette
205,rocknroses99,The Great Waste,4,18 August 2021,"Annette has the same runtime as 2001 : A Space Odyssey but has 10x less content : which is how you make a tedious movie.A great waste of creativity ; some good moments, ultimately repetitive and incoherent. Screenplay and particularly dialogue were subpar.Adam Driver's standup is WAY too long - twice.No character arc. I did not feel involved in what was happening.The movie is a technical feat (but today to do that you only need money and liberty from the producers)The songs are generally good but overly repetitiveThe Annette logo is a ripoff of Danone's (french food company) (it must be intentional)For the first time (since Suicide Squad) I thought I could have leaved the theater and not be curious about what i would have missed.",Annette
206,luketuesday,"Annette, most people are missing the point, this is why this movie is special and fantastic",9,15 August 2021,"When people go into an art film, they expect provactive profound statements. When you watch a regular flick, you check boxes for plot points and witty dialog.Annette is not one of those films.Annette exists in a vacuum. Somewhere between theater and film. It's timeless storytelling that if your not paying attention will fly completely over your head.If you do not ""get"" it, it's no fault of your own. We have become so programmed to expect things a certain way, to take things at face value. This movie is different, it's theater in film form.It demands to be seen on a big screen. It demands a benefit of the doubt.I really don't want to spoil it. Just go see it. See it till the very end.--SPOILERS--What many people don't understand is that Annette CLEARLY an opera. It's not about the real world or making real statements.It's a fable. A fairy tale taking place in the here and now. In theory, this story could have taken place 400 years in the Henry McHenry could have been a poet and the plot would have been the same. It almost feels like an adaptation of a classic opera, but it isn't. It's the full on brainchild of brilliant maniacs The Mael Bros and Leos Carax.It's not a movie about making a point, it's a melodrama about the power of storytelling. About seeing archetypes. About staying from the very beginning to the very end.When they announce ""May we start"" it sets up Annette like Pippin. These aren't characters, they're ""Characters"". They exist inOperas aren't supposed to have happy endings. That's why they have the bookending scene in the credits. The point isn't to make you feel sad, but feel everything.The joy at the heart of this, is that everyone involved clearly loves telling stories like this. Just let go and enjoy the rideAlso I recommend seeing Edgar wright's documentary ""The Sparks Bros"" to appreciate this even more.",Annette

211,vkivey,Stupidest movie ever.,1,21 August 2021,This has got to be the dumbest movie ever and I've seen a lot of dumb movies. Of course this would win a best director at Cannes.

213,thesweetirony,If even I didn't like it...,1,5 September 2021,"First of all, let me tell you about myself and how I relate to art: I'm annoyingly deep and tend to love art that makes me cry. I love poetry. I'm easily touched. I like artsy things. I love weirdness. I like Sparks. I don't like musicals. <- that's the one thing that might predict that I wouldn't like this movie. Otherwise, you'd think I would. You certainly wouldn't think I'd loathe it, but I do. I really, really do. In fact, I don't really leave movie reviews, but I just had to because I want to help people save themselves from this movie. The characters are flat. The story is banal. The acting is stagy. The stand-up is NOT funny. They could have at least hired some comedians to make that part believable. Oh, it was painful. And the singing! Adam Driver is not a singer. Not even passable. He shouldn't even sing Happy Birthday to anyone, let alone sing all through an unnecessarily long movie! I can't not recommend this movie enough. It might be the worst movie I've ever seen.",Annette

The rest of it is beautiful, hard, physical, and a feat of pure talent and genius on the part of the entire cast, crew and chorus. The physicality alone is stunning. I haven't dropped my jaw this much watching a movie ever, and only once watching a Cirque du Soleil show. The writing and content is hard, its dark and the music hits me in a way that my 21st century desensitized brain isn't used to, so I felt it. Again, pure art. Worth your time.",Annette

219,ricciolivia,Quite a stunning movie,9,24 August 2021,"It is completely unusual and disturbing, yet I think I found this film incredible and loved it (still not completely sure, you see)
The music is kind of repetitive and the story not so new but I was completely immerse in it. The pace, the colours, the camera moves, the actors, the puppets were all incredible, I had never seen something quite like this and, even if I doubt it sometimes, I really enjoyed this and was never bored.Probably a 1 or 10 stars movie for most of us :)",Annette
220,ngaisbauer,"What if Tragedy and Comedy fell in love, got married and had a baby?",9,28 August 2021,"What if Tragedy and Comedy fell in love, got married and had a baby? On the surface, this film tries this on, although, there is deeper complexity in the characters and story found here. I loved that it wasn't slick and was very beautiful to look at. Everyone played their part well and sang well, too. Professional and non professional singers, alike. Loved the music. This film is made very well. Some scenes are astoundingly written and acted. Yes, there is a feeling that it may be their first time out on a musical, but I surrendered to their timing, that feeling of newness to the format, and enjoyed the beautiful cinematography, sets, locations, and superior audio. Sometimes inexperience finds what experience overlooks. My viewing mindset was to have no expectation, and to see what was there. The scene between the father (Driver) and his daughter (McDowell) will stay with you for a long time.",Annette
221,shaunggallagher,Hh. Problem: Adam Driver isn't funny,3,24 August 2021,"I really wanted to like this as I recently enjoyed Edgar Wright's doco about Sparks (who wrote this). But it's a musical, it really is, the whole way through - so I found it a bit exasperating. Also it commits one of cinema's cardinal sins (in my book); it has a character who is a stand-up comic who everyone endlessly says is brilliant and brilliantly funny all the time yet the director, writers and actor have failed to make the character funny even once for one second - and it's a 140 minutes long so there's plenty of seconds to go round.Directed by Leo Carax - so none more arthouse.",Annette
