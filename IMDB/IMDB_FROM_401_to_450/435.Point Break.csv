0,Leofwine_draca,Swayze's never been better,6,8 February 2011,"The ultimate buddy movie? POINT BREAK comes close. Few films can offer the same kind of male bonding found here, as two men on opposite sides of the law find themselves growing close thanks to a shared world view.On the one side is greenhorn Keanu Reeves, playing FBI agent/slacker Johnny Utah, in possibly his blandest performance ever (it doesn't help that his character is extremely dim-witted to the extent that a bank robbery takes place behind him while he's ordering takeaway). On the other is Patrick Swayze as Bodhi, giving nothing less than an iconic performance as the surfer/extreme sports fan/bank robber extraordinaire. Swayze doesn't say much here, but his performance is all in his eyes, which seem full of an intense sadness at times. It's the kind of turn that makes you sit up and take note.Elsewhere, the film has highs and lows. The story isn't the most gripping and there's a little too much of the surfing for my liking. It does pick up later on, though, and boasts an absolutely amazing foot chase that I later had to watch a second time just to remind myself how great it was. The supporting cast is so-so, but the film wins merit for the casting of Gary Busey as Reeves' partner; it's great to see Busey on the side of good for once, and he gives a typically intense, scene-chewing turn that I loved to bits. The action stuff, when it comes, is well handled too, with director Bigelow injecting some of her trademark tension into the proceedings.",Point Break
1,SnoopyStyle,solid undercover cop drama,8,1 September 2015,"Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) aces his FBI training. In L.A., the rookie is assigned to agent Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey) to investigate a series of bank robberies by the ""Ex-Presidents"". Pappas has a theory that the robbers are surfers. Utah learns to surf and infiltrate the insular community. He gets rescued by Tyler Endicott (Lori Petty) and pays her to teach him. Tyler's ex Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) leads a group of surfers. Bodhi befriends Johnny after recognizing him as the former college football star.It's a solid undercover cop drama. The difference is that he's going undercover into the surfing world. It gets into the territorial nature of surfing and some darker side. There are some good action. The surfing action could be better but I really like foot chase. It has a great frantic energy. The acting is so great. Both Reeves and Swayze fit their roles. This is a good crime action thriller.",Point Break
2,mark.waltz,I nominate this for the award for worst consistent dialog in a film....ever!,2,15 March 2017,"Just because the writing's on the paper doesn't make it true, and in the case of this action thriller with a great premise, it still reeks of the mentality of Sean Penn's character in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"". In fact, I'm convinced that the writers were sober when they wrote the story and high when they wrote the dialog. The premise has the feds on the trail of serial bank robbers who put on presidential masks then from approximately April through October, rob banks all over the country wherever the surf is at its best. I could instantly ridicule the presence of Keanu Reeves as a 25 year old agent who learns to surf so he can prove to veteran agent Gary Busey that he can be a good agent. But he's surrounded by a bunch of idiotic adults, all in expensive suits, so he joins up with aging surfer Patrick Swayze, all to find out everything he can about the bank robbery ring. Perhaps he can investigate the tan line on the buttocks of the robber who mooned the bank staff and customers, immortalized with ""Thank You"" written on his cheeks.From the moment this begins, I count patiently for the agents to start speaking in any sort of manner that doesn't involve stereotypical valley brat chat of the 1980's. The agents literally run around the beach clipping, snipping and grabbing samples of surfer dude hair for DNA, yet don't label them or get identification at all. Certainly, this will appeal to the surfing crowd, but all it reminded me of was the fishy ocean smell that lingered on the surfers I knew back in the '80s long after they tried to shower it away. Swayze, looking ridiculous in a mullet, seems far too old for this part, coming off of ""Ghost"" to go into this surprise box office hit that as a film seems more dead than Sam Wheat. All I can say about Reeves is that along with the surprisingly bad Busey is a perfect example of a ""Dangerous Liaison"". If ocean waters attract characters like ""Point Break"", then I'm staying as far inland as I can.",Point Break
3,classicsoncall,"""If you want the ultimate, you gotta be willing to pay the ultimate price.""",7,6 June 2021,"Surfing fans and adrenaline junkies will get a huge charge out of this film, with Patrick Swayze's character challenging his band of 'Ex-Presidents' and FBI agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) into performing more and more dangerous stunts, for that rush one gets by living in the moment. Highlights of the picture include the memorable foot chase by Johnny attempting to run down Bodhi (Swayze) in the Reagan mask, and that pair of insane free fall jumps, one of them sans parachute by the intrepid agent Utah. Outside of a James Bond film, you probably won't find anything quite that crazy. Gary Busey had the distinct pleasure of appearing not only in this surfer flick, but 1978's ""Big Wednesday"" as well, though he limits his venture in this one to strictly land based activities. My ears perked up when I heard Johnny mention his surveillance of Bodhi by stating that he saw him go into Patrick's Roadhouse, a neat reference to Swayze's 1978 picture of the same name. I thought it noble for Johnny to let Bodhi go out on his own terms at the finale during the much anticipated 'fifty year storm', an ending that would appeal to the most hard core action fans, even if you had to picture it in your own imagination.",Point Break
4,gavin6942,Who Knew Surfing and Law Enforcement Worked So Well?,7,4 September 2005,"Point Break follows the obsession of FBI special agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) in catching four bank robbers who dress up like ex-presidents. This soon becomes overshadowed by his obsession with surfing with Patrick Swayze and the love a woman who looks like a 10-year old boy (played by Lori ""Tank Girl"" Petty). Some intense surfing and skydiving scenes follow, as does a foot chase that rivals the foot chase sequence from ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" Ultimately, will Keanu Reeves choose his love of surfing or love of fighting crime when the two come in conflict? The answer might surprise you! This movie also likely sets the record for most times the word ""s--t"" can be heard in one movie, and definitely within one scene. Also featuring cameos by Tom Sizemore and Anthony Kiedis. This does run a bit on the long side, and some of the surfing could have been trimmed out. It doesn't advance the plot, and I'm pretty sure it is not really Swayze or Reeves we're looking at, so this doesn't add to their resume. That would pick up the pace just slightly, which makes sense for a film that is all about adrenaline.Director Kathryn Bigelow went on to win an Oscar. Her skill is clearly seen here, she just needed the right subject matter.",Point Break
5,lee_eisenberg,robbing safari,8,28 January 2021,"Kathryn Bigelow's ""Point Break"" is, for lack of a better description, all about going to the extreme. The obvious point is the surfing (leading into the era of extreme sports), but Keanu Reeves's FBI agent gets into it while going undercover, much to the chagrin of his superior.Basically, this movie is a true representation of what people aimed for in the '90s: a hardcore carefree lifestyle. Obviously there are some high-action sequences - namely the raid and the chase - but the surfing is the main thing. And boy does the movie make it look fun! I doubt that I'll ever go surfing, but damned if these guys aren't into it. In the meantime, I recommend the movie. I have no interest in the remake.",Point Break
6,jboothmillard,Point Break,7,1 March 2007,"I was keen to see Keanu Reeves in more action films, after the fantastic Speed, and of course before his success in The Matrix, and this was it. Basically a gang of professional bank robbers, calling themselves The Ex-Presidents, wearing masks of Presidents Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon B. Johnson and leader Ronald Reagan are still on the loose. Agent Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey) has found evidence that the men behind the masks are surfers, with sand and oil and stuff found, and it is up to his partner John 'Johnny' Utah (Reeves) to try and find them. The only way he can do this is by becoming a surfer himself, and fit into the crowd, so he gets some training from Tyler Ann Endicott (Lori Petty). She introduces him to Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) ans his group of surfer friends, Roach (James LeGros), Grommet (Bojesse Christopher), and Nathaniel (John Philbin). Obviously because he seems to be spending a little more time surfing and socialising, the FBI, especially boss Ben Harp (Scrubs' John C. McGinley), are concerned he is not trying to find The Ex-Presidents. It was pretty obvious to the viewing audience that Bodhi and his group were the criminals, and when they know Johnny is a cop, they are determined not just to pull a bigger job, but to get him caught in the act. I mainly heard of this film because of the mention and fantastic spoof featured in Hot Fuzz, when Reeves shoots in the air in anger at not catching the criminal leader. Reeves I guess isn't fantastic, and the story is a little silly at times, but when you have a good villain played by Swayze, and some very viewable surfing and sky-diving sequences, you can't go wrong. Very good!",Point Break
7,Tweekums,Best film about surfing bank-robbers ever made,8,1 April 2008,"It is hard to believe that this film is over fifteen years old now. The story is still fairly exciting without ever taking itself too seriously.In most action films the action is mostly the hero chasing and fighting with the bad guys, while there is plenty of that in Point Break there is also plenty of action where characters are just having fun surfing and skydiving which I found more enjoyable than the chasing and fighting. Anybody who has seen ""Hot Fuzz"" will have a laugh at the ""shooting in the air"" scene.The plot concerns two FBI agents played by Keanu Reeves and Gary Busey who are hunting a group of bank robbers who's identity is unknown but who Busey believes are surfers who rob banks to fund their lifestyle. Reeves goes under cover learning how to surf so he can get in with surfers.",Point Break
8,ma-cortes,Solid and incredible thriller with spectacular scenes about surfing and skydiving,7,17 March 2008,"FBI agent going up against a bank robberies executed by a band masked like US President, wearing Johnson, Carter, Nixon and Reagan masks. Although they never shoot anybody and never go into the vaults. The agent is hot on the trail but he's sucked by Patrick Swayze guru, a leader of the beach subculture, a fun-loving with destructive ways who plays cat and mouse game with the Feds. Meanwhile Reeves falls in love with Lori Petti, a beautiful surfing trainer.This is a story of surfers and skydivers in Southern California. Impressive scenario and there are enough dazzling surfing and airborne stunts to keep you amused. Keanu Reeves as astute agent and Patrick Swayze as a thrill-seeker guru, help raise potential action-adventure story to a higher plane. Emotive and moving musical score by means of synthesizer, is splendidly made by Mark Isham with a Vangelis style. The film created the 'Skydiving sub-genre', such as, ¨Drop zone(John Badham), Terminal velocity(Deran Serafian) and Cutaway(Guy Manos)¨ among others. Nostalgic surfers with more than a little patience because the runtime is about two half and some, will enjoy this ode to the beach and mysticism and seeking the perfect wave. It's well directed by Kathryn Bigelow with a perfect and assured direction which keeps this movie on the edge of your seat.",Point Break
9,moonspinner55,Beach Blanket Bank Robbery,6,14 January 2006,"A rash of quick, organized bank jobs in California leads a rookie Fed (named Johnny Utah!) to the beaches as an undercover surfer to ferret out the curl-shooting criminals. W. Peter Iliff's asinine script, adapted from an original treatment by Iliff and Rick King, is at least partnered with an intrinsically exciting direction from Kathryn Bigelow; she gets the action pumping even when the material is bogus. Keanu Reeves is alternately placid and overeager as the agent who befriends surfing guru Patrick Swayze; both actors manage not to embarrass themselves, though they're stuck playing cartoonish cut-outs, products of a screenwriter's workshop clichés. Bigelow must be attracted to movies with blow hard desk sergeants who do nothing but bellow at their underlings (the Feds in this flick are just as ridiculous as the cops in ""Blue Steel""), and she isn't kind to the one central woman in the cast (Lori Petty, whose sass initially substitutes for a character--until she's turned into a victim). Gary Busey does wonders in another clichéd role, that of the crusty veteran saddled with the young upstart, and the surfing footage is very good. Still, ""Point Blank"" is merely watchable, and about as plausible as an episode of ""Scooby Doo"". **1/2 from ****",Point Break
10,blanche-2,Surfer action film,6,11 June 2009,"Released in 1991, ""Point Break"" stars Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze, Gary Busey and Lori Petty. Reeves is FBI agent ""Johnny Utah"" - how's that for a name - who teams up with Busey to find bank robbers who have robbed something like 30 banks. The robbers wear presidential masks - Reagan, Nixon, that crowd. After watching the tapes of the robbery, it's concluded that these guys are surfers. Reeves goes in to learn not only surfing, but the surfing culture, to see if he can figure out who the robbing surfers are.I found this film overly long, and it's really one that needs to be seen on the big screen because of the tremendous scenes of surfing and sky diving, which looked magnificent. There is also a remarkable chase scene where Reeves chases the dude with the President Reagan mask.Patrick Swayze is very good as Bodhi, a surfer who lives for the adrenaline rush, and Gary Busey is believable as Reeves' partner. For the most part, however, the acting is unimpressive. Keanu Reeves is deliciously handsome, but I've never believed a word he says in any film. To me, he's just not a very good actor, nor is Lori Petty, who plays his connection into the surfer world. There's something hollow and external about both performances.If you have a big screen TV, you should enjoy this movie.",Point Break
11,Quinoa1984,better than it has any right to be,7,9 September 2006,"This is a real archetypal dumb 90s action movie, but it happens to be an above average one. I couldn't believe how long I watched this on TV, but it goes to show how so little can make for so much on a Saturday afternoon. The term guilty pleasure first springs to mind, especially the moment when Gary Busey tells his young new partner, Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), that the people they're after- a group of bank robbers taking a signature of wearing President masks- may also be surfers. It's kind of like a movie made specifically for someone who loves the Bruckheimer movies of the late 80s, with the slick, empty-headed, shallow appeal that went with the action, humor, and almost plastic action stars and occasional good actors, only for also for someone into feeling the need for, uh, waves. But somehow, director Kathryn Bigelow pulls it off for more than just its target bubble-headed group. It is as smart as its trying to be, and as fun as a noisy, violent R-rated action picture can get.Reeves, of course, is still in the form of getting his real star presence together, in the kind of role he would make much better with Speed and in of course in the Matrix, as a hot shot with as much ambition as (in Reeves fashion) charisma as he infiltrates the tight ring of surfers, led by Patrick Swayze and the pretty Lori Petty. As he gets better at surfing and gets closer in with this group, with Swayze's ""Bodhissatva"" taking surfing as much of a spiritual experience as with his bank robbing. After a stumble in busting a group of nasties (led hilariously by the Red Hot Chili Peppers in a get-up), Reeves gets closer, too close, and it comes very tense as both sides play each other to the finish- a near show-stopping bank robbing climax. A lot of this- one might say almost all of it- isn't new. John C. McGinley's scenes ring off of every other scene where a lead sergeant or other gets mad as hell at his underlings. The sneak-side of Reeves with Swayze and especially Petty have been seen in more B movies (especially biker ones I've seen) than I care to count. And sometimes the humor is way too 'hip' for its own good.But after a while I didn't care about a lot of that and just enjoyed what cool-side and attitude came with the material. There's even a sense that the filmmakers and actors know what kind of project this is to the fullest and between their serious takes- sometimes a little cringing to see (the 'drama' that unfolds with Utah and his female counterpart is a bit too stale)- there were a lot of grins and laughs all the way. Some of the best (dumb) fun to have from 1991.",Point Break
12,edwagreen,Point Break Reaches the Breaking Point **1/2,6,3 January 2015,"The film comes down to basically Patrick Swayze and his cohorts wearing face masks of former presidents to rob banks and therefore make a statement about the system.Keanu Reeves is the young FBI Agent after them and in fact goes undercover as a surfer to catch the gang. Gary Busey plays his fellow agent and mentor.The chase scenes are exciting; the hand gliding scenes over the ocean are phenomenal. What brings the film down is the way many attempt to break the system down.The ending was ridiculous as far as I'm concerned. We're not just letting criminals virtually commit suicide so as to satisfy their cravings in life. True, that while undercover, Reeves got a taste of Swayze's life, but this is a little too much.",Point Break

14,hitchcockthelegend,It delivers for genre fans without fail.,7,4 March 2008,"It's flipping great because I got what I expected from it, dumb unadulterated fun, jam packed with action and some tremendous thrilling sequences. When you lay out director Kathryn Bigelow's CV it arguably doesn't add up to much, but there are so many great things to be taken from each one of her movies. Her work here is excellent, from the sumptuous surfing sequences to the breath taking aerial shoots, the film is technically sound in that respect. The acting is of course to the standard required for an adrenalin rush actioner such as this, and the plot, tho simple as it is, has enough about it to keep the viewer intrigued as to what the outcome will be. Personally I loved the finale, and find the soundtrack to be quite excellent {I'm always biased if I hear John Lydon in there}. While the locations further emphasise the tone and general feel of the film. So all in all the film delivers for those seeking a thrilling popcorn movie with absolutely no pretensions. 7/10",Point Break
15,jotix100,Surfing during the last storm,8,27 July 2005,"Kathryn Bigelow's ""Point Break"" is a movie that packs a lot of action. In fact, it was a nice surprise to discover. Not ever having seen it when it was released, we took a chance that paid off well. This is the perfect escape movie that is easy on the eye, as it is on the mind. The plot, although not perfect, keeps the viewer glued to the screen, especially during the surfing and skydiving sequences that are amazing.This was a Patrick Swayze vehicle, where a young Keanu Reeves practically steals the picture from him. As the FBI undercover agent Johnny Utah, Mr. Reeves gives an outstanding performance. Mr. Swayze is Bodhi, the evil man looking for the perfect wave. In order to survive, doing nothing, Bohdi and his surfer friends rob banks in California. This only happens during the time they spend time riding the waves near the L.A. beaches. FBI agent, Angelo Pappas, who is Utah's partner has a theory about who are the guys involved in the robberies. All seem to point they are surfers.Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves are good. The supporting cast also, responds well to Ms. Bigelow's direction. Gary Busey, James LeGros, Lori Petri, among the large supporting cast excel.The film will not disappoint the fans of action movies as some incredible things are done with the surfing and skydiving stunts.",Point Break
16,Scarecrow-88,Point Break,8,28 June 2009,"Special agent Johnny Utah(Keanu Reeves)is assigned a case along with partner, Pappas(Gary Busey) to find and arrest bank robbers(..who have successfully heisted over 30 banks)who just so happen to be surfers following their charismatic leader, Bodhi(Patrick Swayze), a philosophical, free-spirited ""guru"" whose mantra of life is tied in with the ocean waves. Utah, undercover, is able to infiltrate Bodhi's gang, falling in love with Tyler(Lori Petty)in the process. When he's cover is blown, Tyler is held up as hostage, used as a bargaining chip so that Bodhi can escape with a load of loot along with his amigos, stringing along Utah so that they can pull off their heist without fail..but when Bodhi makes a questionable decision to raid a bank's vault, and an off-duty cop plays hero, everything spirals out of control.Exhilarating surfing sequences and jaw-droppingly stunning sky-diving scenes propel this action flick..amazing how such a testosterone, macho flick could be directed by a woman, and it's a major credit to Kathryn Bigelow for she orchestrates some startlingly effective shootouts(..quite a violent film, very dependent of blood squibs)and a phenomenal chase(Utah on foot, pursuing Bodhi under a Nixon mask) through a suburban neighborhood. The dialogue is cornball(..and loaded with profanity), with an emphasis on Bodhi's spiritual view of the waves and life in general. Swayze is cool personified, no matter what kind of jargon comes from his character. Reeves had a way of getting parts in great movies, his looks fit the setting of the film, and he is convincing as an agent-turned-surfer(..well, when he talks ""surfer"", it sounds authentic). Petty is perky and peppy, with a lot of spunk..I don't think she's ever been as sexy as she is here. Busey steals every scene he's in..such a delightful presence and when he punches out smart-mouth a$$hole superior Harp(John C McGinley), I expect a round of applause. As I've mentioned before, I'm an adrenaline junkie when it comes to films about characters living life on the edge, with only tragedy awaiting those who break the law, no matter the reason, with car chases(..this one has a doozy, before it descends into the foot race between Reeves and Swayze), shootouts, and other highly stylized action sequences defying logic or good sense(..does anyone truly believe this gang of surfers could pull off so many robberies or that Reeves would just let Swayze get away?). The real mind-boggling highlight has to be when Utah leaps from a plane without a parachute to catch up with Bodhi. The very definition of guilty pleasure and really hard to take too seriously(..even though it seems to be toned quite seriously).",Point Break

Kathryn Bigelow keeps the pace end-to-end, and both Keanu Reeves (""Johnny Utah"") and Patrick Swayze (""Bohdi"") are clearly having fun as the FBI agent pursuing the gang of rubber mask clad ""ex-president"" beach-bum robbers. Reeves is easy on the eye, but pretty wooden and sure, the plot has more holes than a string vest but the story isn't meant to be deep and meaningful. This is just a fun adventure escapade that sees our hero go surfing, sky-diving and the cinematographer is clearly in his element, too. The ending, though cluttered up with some lovey-dovey nonsense, is actually quite exhilarating as the pair seem to develop just a little bit of a bromance...

Part undercover-cop thriller (hardly original) and part water-sport exhibitionism (afforded undue significance and really not my cup of tea!), I naturally found the former elements much more engaging – notably the bank robberies (with the criminals dressed in masks depicting former U.S. Presidents) and a lengthy chase around the halfway point (starting in cars on busy streets and continuing on foot through the rather exposed houses). However, the climax is a drawn-out affair as it goes from a bungled 'bank job' to the airport, the desert and a definitive showdown on an Australian beach! Besides, the cast does not exactly set the screen on fire: the typically wooden Keanu Reeves' exclamations of excitement prove particularly annoying – though, again, Patrick Swayze's role (and some of the existential dialogue here) has obtained additional gravitas with his recent untimely passing. The film is proficient, then, and patchily entertaining – but not exactly essential fare either.",Point Break
20,zardoz-13,White Knuckled Fever!!!,9,31 March 2012,"Before extreme sports movies such as ""xXx,"" ""Extreme Ops,"" and ""Steal"" came out, Academy Award winning ""Hurt Locker"" director Kathryn Bigelow helmed the equivalent years ahead of their time. ""Point Break"" concerns a fearless FBI rookie agent who infiltrates an audacious band of surfers who like to rob banks wearing latex masks of President Nixon, Carter, Johnson, and Reagan. These notorious bank robbers use the loot to finance their 'endless summer.' The rookie learns the basics about bank robbery from his mentor, Angelo Pappas, who has been investigating bank hold-ups for twenty-two years. Former Ohio State Buckeyes college football quarterback Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves of ""The Matrix"") blew out his knee so he got a legal degree and joined the FBI. Pappas admires this gang for several reasons. They don't shoot anybody. They don't take from the vault. They steal from the cash drawers on the counter. And they leave nothing in the way of clues. Nevertheless, he has a hunch that the robbers are surfers. Word is that ""Ferris Bueller"" star Matthew Broderick turned down the role and Reeves landed it. Reeves is physically fit enough to perform the hustling requirements. Basically, ""Point Break"" is a suspenseful, Spartan crime thriller that ripples with adrenaline-fueled action with bullets flying like hail. Reeves and Gary Busey make a good pair of FBI agents. Bigelow alternates between static expository scenes and scenes of white-knuckled action. The foot chase between Utah and the lead bank robber is visceral. Patrick Swayze makes a first-class villain who does his best to lure Utah to the dark side. He delivers the best performance of the film, with Lori Petty coming in close second. John C. McGinley plays their obnoxious FBI superior Ben Harp who loves to scream orders at the top of his lungs. ""Point Blank"" borrows the finale from ""Dirty Harry"" when our hero discards his shield.

The F.B.I. believes that the members of the gang could be surfers and send young agent Johnny Utah undercover at the beach to mix with the surfers and gather information. Utah meets surfer Bodhi and gets drawn into the lifestyle of his new friend......Its a Simone premise, undercover agent gets too involved with person he is tracking and starts to question his priorities. But no one has made the film in the bohemian style like Bigelow has done here.It's effortlessly cool from beginning to end, and the filming styles make this something beyond the thriller it is. When we first meet Utah, the film feels cold and steel like, and then we meet Bodhi, the warmth of the film starts to integrate with the cold feel of Utahs story, hence the two stars names morphing together during the opening.As Utah opens up more, and realises that his life choices were not necessarily the ones he wanted, the film becomes brighter and more warmer, I mean, the films final skydive ends in the desert. And when we get to the year later scene, it's back to the coldness of the original.Other than that, it's an epic piece of cinema, from the opening robbery, to the poetic skydives, right up to the phenomenal foot chase through the houses.Swayze was never better, and he owned this role, Reeves is Reeves, but its one of those movies that never gets boring, and certainly doesn't feel like its 23 years old.Please, do not remake this with Gerard Butler!!",Point Break
24,Aaron1375,Prepare to hit the waves and rob some banks courtesy of Patrick Swayze.,8,19 July 2010,"This is one of my favorite movies featuring Patrick Swayze. Though he is good he is certainly backed up quite nicely by Keanu Reaves and everyone's favorite crazy dude Gary Busey. The story has a bunch of bank robbers hitting banks wearing masks of ex-presidents. They are very successful and are causing the FBI a lot of grief. Well one agent has a theory that the guys robbing banks are a bunch of surfer dudes. This agent (Busey) recruits a new agent (Reaves) to pose as a surfer and see if he can penetrate the surfing culture and perhaps even find the guys responsible for the bank robberies. He has a rough go his first time on the waves and gets chewed out for being stupid by a cute surfer girl, but in the end he ends up becoming friends with this gang of surfers. Well you will probably know where this is going as they end up being the ones hitting the banks and thus there are some rather cool action scenes here and there. Though do not get me wrong, this is not a bang bang wall to wall action kind of movie. A lot of drama in this one too, but it works out nicely.

Swayze does a very good job as the leader of the surfing dudes and proves to be a memorable character to watch. Like I said this is one of my favorite movies of his.",Point Break
25,safenoe,This Calvin and Hobbes is funny!!!,9,21 October 2016,"Pappas's line ""This Calvin and Hobbes is funny"" is hilarious and is one of many impressive lines in an impressive movie. Good to see an iconic comic strip get a mention in a top movie like Point Break. Point Break is what it is, good ol' fashioned action and entertainment, and gripping to the end.Talking about the end, even though the final scene was set in Bell's Beach in Australia, it was actually filmed in Oregon. There was only one Australian actor with a speaking part in the scene, Peter Phelps who had the line ""death on a stick"" in reference to the treacherous surfing conditions. Still, the location looked authentic, although the police officers ""Aussie"" accents could have been a bit better (the actors aren't Australian). You would think that with so many Aussie actors in the USA (keen to get a spot in a pilot), the casting director could find them to fill these roles.",Point Break
26,Mr-Fusion,This shouldn't be nearly as good as it is.,8,12 July 2012,"On the terms of its concept alone, ""Point Break"" sounds farcical. When the bad guys aren't waving around revolvers and yelling at bank tellers, they're riding waves, playing night football on the beach . . . and going skydiving. And during quieter moments, Patrick Swayze waxes philosophically about the energy of the ocean, and the ego-checking Mother Earth likes to dole out when we get too full of ourselves. And Keanu Reeves is the FBI agent out to bust them. And his name is Johnny Utah. You can't make this stuff up, but someone did(!) and that's what makes it so fun. The movie plays this nonsense completely straight and it all comes together surprisingly (criminally?) well. And it's a pretty damn good action movie, which is icing on the cake. 8/10",Point Break

I guess I still remember with much affection Kathryn Bigelow's first film, Loveless, made ten years before this.Patrick Swayze is just about alright, Keanu Reeves is not Lori Petty but maybe it is just the crap script and lazy directing that pulls this down. Bigelow is far too in awe of her actors to bother getting the to act and relies instead of the ridiculous premise upon which this film is set. Avid surfers who put on ex-presidents' masks to rob banks, oh yea! Not long since I watched the amazing Big Wednesday so there was little chance I would be impressed here especially as much of the footage seems slipped in from elsewhere. Now and again the film spluttered to life but then it was back to boys playing ball or fighting before we dragged ourselves back to the ridiculous non story this is.",Point Break
28,=G=,Would you like a little action with your action?,6,21 May 2001,"""Point Break"" is a typical action flick built around an FBI agent (Reeves) who goes undercover with a bunch of surfers (Swayze & Petty) in order to catch a group of bank robbers. Using the Cameron more-is-more theory of film making, Bigelow manages to squeeze romance, shootouts, chases, stunts & pyro, sky diving, surfing, etc. into this 2 hour long mindless action flick and weave them all together with a story which is a cut above the average action drama. Curiously, there's little sex - one of Hollywood's most common gratuitous commodities - and the female lead is not your usual babelicious which may be a deficit which comes with the director's gender. Anyone in need of a testosterone rush who doesn't mind the fact that the film stars three male non-actors should give this one a chance.",Point Break
29,MovieAddict2016,One of the most overrated action films I've ever seen.,7,27 April 2005,"""Point Break"" was named a hugely clever satire of male testosterone in my ""Films of the '90s"" book (edited by Jurgen Muller). They claimed it was one of the finest films of the decade and placed it in their book of must-see '90s films, leaving out classics such as ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"" (yep, I'm joking about that one, but still). I couldn't believe what I was reading, and thought to myself, ""Maybe I should see it again."" I vaguely recalled being disappointed in the film on first viewing years and years ago but nonetheless I decided to give it a second chance, taking into account the fact that it was a supposed tongue-in-cheek satire of male action flicks.Sadly, I only hated it even more. This has to be one of the most pretentious, stupid, poorly acted and written action movies of the 1990s. It would be fairly enjoyable as a no-brainer if not for the fact that it has gained some sort of reputation for being a ""classic."" In my opinion, it is not a classic by any means. First of all, Kathryn Bigelow (James Cameron's ex-wife) falls victim to her excessive styling again (later to be seen to an even greater extent in the bloated ""Strange Days"" in 1995). The movie is too over-the-top. Paul Verhoeven found a good way to balance satire and excess in ""RoboCop""; ""Point Break"" shifts the weight and topples over into the realm of such Verhoeven errors as ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Showgirls."" It's got that same sort of odd, over-done vibe seeing through every frame -- bright, vibrant colors, loud trashy music, and tons of gratuitous action, sex and violence.Keanu Reeves is one of the worst actors of all time. He redeemed himself (somewhat) in Gus Vant Sant's ""My Own Private Idaho"" in 1991 and then released this and totally negated his Shakespeare-adaptation efforts. His performance in ""Point Break,"" as an undercover cop, is laughably poor.Patrick Swayze delivers the most memorable performance, but -- and get this! -- his character's name is a reference to Buddhism, as if the film is trying to somehow subtly imply he is like a Buddhist god. The problem is, it's not subtle at all; especially considering the fact that they explain the meaning of his name in the film.The action is poorly staged (or mediocre, anyway) and Bigelow's trademark hand-held shots grow tiresome (such as the overlong foot chase). The film is alright but then the ending goes on for too long (just like ""Strange Days"") and worsens, leaving a sour aftertaste. It doesn't know when to finish, nor does it realize that satire is savored best when it is less than obvious.A huge disappointment, and one of the most overrated action films (or so-called ""satires"") I've ever seen.",Point Break
30,Red-Barracuda,Great action and annoying haircuts,8,24 November 2010,"Point Break is one of those films that is simultaneously seen as being a bit crap while being pretty good. I suppose the best way to review this title might be to break it down into good and bad. So here goesThe Good: The action set-pieces are this film's crowning jewels. Kathryn Bigelow shows excellent ability as an action director. The extended chase scene was brilliantly paced and orchestrated. It never gets unrealistic and is edited together perfectly. Likewise, the sky-diving scenes are very well filmed. There's not an awful lot to them, they are just very well photographed and add an excellent dimension to proceedings. Patrick Swayze is also very good too. He has a fair bit of charisma here and he is the well-conceived character in the movieThe Bad: Too many annoying haircuts for me. I know it's the early 90's but still I felt that there was an excess of bad hair. And to match that, there was far too much surfer-philosophizing/drivel (delete where appropriate); and all of the chat about the gang of thieves being the people's outlaws was basically atrocious. The police film clichés were a bit full-on too, such as the shouting superiors and the 'throwing away the badge scene'. Keanu Reeves was rubbish. He was even wooden when sky-diving.Overall a good action film though.",Point Break

At times it feels like a parody of a certain kind of moronic American mythology; more often, however, it feels like a celebration of it. Perhaps it's best just to take it without judgement and enjoy the deliberately cartoonish vibe, the plotting is lively and well-paced, and there are odd moments where it is genuinely funny, although rather fewer where it is genuinely thrilling. It's really not my kind of movie; but it works as what is is.",Point Break

The result is a series of successful set-pieces and an overall synopsis much more powerful than the string of story-beats used to connect it all together. There's enough here to raise this above the schlock it could have been, though, including decent direction and above-average performances - a pretty nuanced, and perhaps even career-best, turn from Swayze is the highlight. The break-neck action is confidently crafted and practically punching its way through the screen at all times, and it's really this that keeps you on-board throughout. 7/10",Point Break
33,CuriosityKilledShawn,I...am...reviewing...this...movie!,7,8 April 2014,"Johnny Utah (from Ohio, so there's confusion right there) is a rookie EFF BEE AYE Agent transferred to his first gig in Los Angeles much to the disappointment of his stuck-up boss Ben Harp, who seems to have forgotten how to crack a case despite being about only 31. Even more disappointed is his new partner - jaded burnout Angelo Pappas. No one seems to have any faith in Utah even though he's taking it all seriously.Their first case together is the pursuit of the Ex-Presidents, a gang of ironic bank robbers who pull-off 60-second robberies to fund their hedonistic lifestyle. Pappas just wants to let it go, but Utah's energy reinvigorates him and they go undercover in the LA surf scene where Utah meets boyish, unattractive Tyler who teaches him how to ride a wave and introduces him to Bohdi and his gang of easy-going pals.I'm not going to lie, Point Break has its problems. Keanu's acting is bad, not as bad as he is in Speed, but still bad, and totally one-note. He even somehow manages to gradually turn Johnny Utah into Ted ""Theodore"" Logan by the end. Lori Petty is completely mis-cast as Tyler and far, far too mannish for the role. There's also practically no mystery as to who the Ex-Presidents really are since Swayze's voice is recognizable from the very beginning.The action, surf photography (shot in fake Super-35 widescreen), and occasional atmosphere make up for it. Not to mention anything with Gary Busey is worthwhile and he barely keeps himself in check, playing Pappas with his usual manic energy. The centerpiece of the whole movie is without a doubt the skydiving scene, which is beautifully breathtaking. Mark Isham's score for this scene is simply wonderful, and, as a teenager, I would watch this scene over and over to the point where the VHS tape eventually got worn-out.Point Break has gone on to be a cult classic inspiring rip-offs such as The Fast and the Furious (and a soon-to-be unnecessary remake that no one wants starring box office poison Gerard Butler) and a spoof stage show. Kathryn Bigelow, who was one of James Cameron's many wives at the time, has only made 5 films since 1991 which is strange for a director so solid with a near-perfect track record. Even her worst films have merit, though she did go on to win big with The Hurt Locker in 2009.It may be soaking in early 90s surf culture, but that's the only thing that dates it and any remake, re-imagining, reboots, or re-interpretation is not needed.",Point Break

35,vincentlynch-moonoi,Not as good as I remembered,5,4 May 2013,"Is there more of an enigma in Hollywood than Keanu Reeves? As many of his films as I've seen, I have never quite figured out if he is a fair actor, or a good actor, or even a great actor. I just know that I usually enjoy seeing him on screen, depending on the genre of the film. This may have been the first film I saw him in, and I was at least somewhat impressed.I think the movie -- at 123 minutes -- is overly long...particularly in the early portion when Reeves' character is learning to surf and trying to fit into the hippie-surfing scene. Frankly, this part of the film was slightly boring, although probably necessary to set up the rest of the story...it just could have been a little tighter. As we get more into Reeve's realization of who the bank robbers are, the action picks up and the film becomes more interesting.This film is unique in one way -- probably the only film in which I actually enjoyed the performance of Gary Busey. Just not my kind of actor.Reeves here is pretty good. Yes, he has a strange voice cadence, which I think lends to those who believe he is a very shallow actor. But, whether or not he's a good actor, he has screen presence, and that shows here.I have a difficult time judging Swayze's acting here. It just seems so not like him and he looks so ratty. Let's just say this is not his role that I find most impressive.The only 3 actors that really impress here are Reeves, Swayze, and Busey.I'm giving this film only a ""5"" rating. Despite the different setting, despite some darned good action scenes, the story just seems too preposterous from start to finish (e.g., Reeves' character chooses to jump out of an airplane without a parachute). Well...there is one bit of realism -- at the end of the film Reeves' character drops out of the FBI. Thank god. We don't need screw-ups like that in the FBI!",Point Break

He wants to become a member of this team because he suspects that they are responsible for some bank robberies and he wants to catch them and prove his theory.I had watched the newest version of this movie the ""Point Break"" of 2015 so, I already knew the plot and what it was all about. I had high expectations for this movie and I have to admit that I liked it as much as the new one. It had an interesting plot with some minor changes which were very good as well because it made the movie more interesting. About the direction that was made by Kathryn Bigelow I want to say that it was satisfying due to the fact that it consisted of many action scenes and even more scenes with sports. I liked the interpretations of Keanu Reeves who played as Johnny Utah the F.B.I. agent and Patrick Swayze's who played as Bodhi and he was very good at his role. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Gary Busey's who played as Pappas and he was equally good at it.To sum up, I have to say that ""Point Break"" is a good action, sports movie in which you can find many good action scenes and good interpretations too. If you are a fan of sports movies which are very well combined with the crime then this is the movie you have to watch because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it and you are going to have a very good time.",Point Break
38,Floated2,Great Performances Leads,8,16 February 2018,"Point Break has been widely considered as part of a cult classic and classic film of the 1990's. Starring Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze, this film appears to be a good and enjoyable as it has has been praised by fans. Considering the film was remade in 2015, more praise has been appointed to this original film. As many has considered the remake to be a mistake, and that film was panned by critics and did not make as much at the box office as studios hoped.Point Break does offer somewhat cheesy dialogue and context, though it fits in with the atmosphere of the film. The performances by both leads is what makes the film being better than it should, also with strong directing and overall great set pieces in cinematography. Point Break is a fun ride throughout and it doesn't drag for a film with a running time of 2 hours. Many fans have considered and pondered that the original Fast and Furious (2001) has been inspired by Point Break and there is some truth. Replaced with surfing by car racing and the point stands. Perhaps had Point Break been a bigger hit, this very well could have become franchise as the Fast and the Furious.

Bigelow shows even at this stage of her career that she is an extremely confidence action director, allowing action to flow, using hand-held to follow the action, give it energy and she does not shy away from the violence. She is able to add tension during her shootouts, fight scenes and the robberies. There is some great sequences such as the shoot-out, the third robbery and the skydiving sequences.Point Break is a product of its time and it does have problems, but it is easy to see why people enjoy, particular thanks to Bigelow's action direction which does go over the top at times.",Point Break
45,dee.reid,"A perfect summer action movie; 100% pure adrenalin rush - ""Point Break""",8,13 April 2005,"(I'm a little late reviewing this movie, since the last time I watched it was in August of 2004 and had originally planned this summary after I viewed the film, but somehow never got around to it. So now I'm here with it.)Going into Kathryn Bigelow's 1991 action movie, ""Point Break,"" starring Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves, one might be tempted to consider the question: How's this any different from the hundreds of action movies we've already seen? Well, not much, honestly. But its worthiness lies in the ideas and Buddhist philosophies that dominate the characters and dialogue, not the action and surfing scenes. But of course Buddhism plays a major role in the underlying message of the film, thus providing the audience with the line ""Peace through superior firepower.""Reeves stars as Johnny Utah, a recent Quantico-graduate who's transferred to the bank robbery division of the Los Angeles branch of the F.B.I. For years, the city has been plagued by a string of daring summertime robberies committed by a gang called the Ex-Presidents, who are known for dawning the rubber masks of Reagan, Carter, Nixon, and LBJ during their holdups.No clues, no trace evidence, nothing has been able to ever lead to an arrest much less identify who they are, but a grizzled veteran, Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey), has a theory: The Ex-Presidents are surfers. This claim receives the scorn and strident skepticism of his superiors, but Utah thinks that Pappas may be on to something, since the bureau obviously hasn't exhausted all of its resources yet. Since they only rob banks during the summer, this sparks the priceless line, ""The Ex-Presidents rob banks to fund their endless summer!""Pappas suggests that Utah go undercover into the L.A. surfing subculture, which he comes to understand is a lot more than just ""totally rad"" or ""tubular."" And the idea of becoming one with the waves (those Buddhist teachings come out the woodwork around this time) and Bodhi (Swayze) introduces Utah to the underside of surfing.It shouldn't take Utah long to realize that Bodhi and his surfer buds are actually the Ex-Presidents, but then again, this isn't exactly the brightest action movie we've ever seen. Of course, ""Point Break"" has earned a cult status for its action scenes, philosophy, and its testosterone-driven plot and direction.One might be tempted to immediately think of this as a guy's movie, but when considering that it's directed by Bigelow (of ""Near Dark"" and ""Blue Steel"" fame) and James Cameron was the executive producer, this is one hell of an action flick.Reeves is wooden, as usual, but his blandness actually has some usefulness here, especially as he comes to realize many of Bodhi's teachings about nature and violence, and at the same is wooing Bodhi's girlfriend Tyler (Lori Petty). Swayze is an interesting character himself, being that I've never really seen him in a role where he is this restrained.But like I stated earlier, this is a perfect summer action movie, and it is 100% pure adrenalin.8/10",Point Break
46,Fluke_Skywalker,A classic. Who knew?,7,24 June 2015,"This movie has no business holding up as well as it does, and in the hands of a lesser director than future Oscar winner Kathryn Bigelow it probably wouldn't. There's just a craft and skill on display here that's several notches above most of its genre contemporaries. The action scenes in particular are absolutely first rate; Especially the sky diving stuff and the foot chase between Keanu Reeves' Johnny Utah and Patrick Swayze's Bodhi. In both cases you feel like you're a participant. It's great work.Keanu's Johnny Utah is the main character, and he's likable here (because Keanu is always likable), but the real stars are Swayze as the charismatic surfing guru, Bodhi and Gary Busey as Utah's grizzled partner, Angelo Pappas. Swayze is so good it's scary. It's like, if you ran into this guy in real life you'd be drinking the Kool-Aid and asking for seconds. Special mention also goes to Lori Petty. Not only do I find her insanely attractive here (My God, those eyes!), she and Reeves have great chemistry, and she takes what could've been a thankless love interest role and makes it hers.I've seen the trailer for the upcoming remake, and while I can't say for sure whether it'll be good or bad, I do know that the bar for it is set awfully high.",Point Break

The group wears masks of the elder statesmen while doing their job and are kind of an anti-establishment Bonnie&Clyde type of group. Patrick Swayze plays a surfer who helps Reeve's character become established with the surfers, but later is found out to be part of the group. Swayze's character has kind of a devil-may-care, try-anything-once mentality and gets him involved in other you-only-live-once activities like sky diving as well. His ultimate goal is to get to Australia to ride the biggest wave ever(according to his calculations) and this is the reason for the bank robbing. Reeves, Swayze and Gary Busey as Reeve's partner are good in their roles and the director keeps the pace moving very well. The ending was extended too long(in my opinion) and it would have been a better movie without the last 10 minutes. Overall, though, this was a well executed, uniquely written piece that surprised me right from the beginning. I heard this movie kind of has a cult following and I understand why.

Aided in the screenwriting by former husband James Cameron, this heist movie has some great characterization and subtext to supplement the action. Patrick Swayze put a lot into both the physical aspect of the film and did a great job at making his character a very interesting and intelligent villain.

Any time I run into that though, I have to wonder how much nostalgia is fueling things so I try to go into this with minimal expectations.So it's been nearly 30 years now on this one, I believe and it feels like it. This movie is so early 90s it's insane. That's not where the insanity stops though because on paper, this movie is ridiculous and kinda stupid. FBI agent goes under cover with his real name to investigate a group of potential bank robbing surfer dudes and gets seduced by the lifestyle. The plot and events all pret well for that absurdity and honestly it just didn't really work for me. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot.What saves this is the performances. Ridiculous movie but everyone is all in on it. Reeves and Swayze are really solid, Busey is a controlled crazy that works. That's really the crux of it, ridiculous as it is everyone here really fits just right and brings a charisma to it all.So what we end up with is a dumb movie that is just all sorts of charming.

54,a_chinn,"Corny, but irresistible Keanu/Swayze action flick",8,24 November 2019,"Corny, cliched, and thoroughly enjoyable early 90s action flick. Keanu Reeves plays undercover FBI agent Johnny Utah, who infiltrates a group of bank robbing surfers known as The Ex-Presidents. Cliches abound as veteran FBI agent Gary Busey is pared with young punk Reeves, who learns surfing from cute surfer girl Lori Petty via montage sequence, in order to infiltrate the tight knit surfing community. But wait, Keanu then finds himself connecting to this thrill seeking group of guys traveling the world for their own endless summer, so this conflicted undercover agent make it so ""Point Break"" almost as good as ""Donnie Brasco,"" right? Not even close! Other cliches we're treated to include unexpected bulletproof vests saving the hero, chases through the concrete L.A. river, an FBI superior who is always angry and shouting, obnoxious antagonist FBI agents who keep showing up to make fun of our heroes, and did I mention Utah joined the FBI because of a career ending football injury when he was a college football star? It's an indefensibly bad script, but the film is elevated by some serious talent in front of and behind the camera. There are some strong performances by Patrick Swayze in in an uncharacteristically villainous role, but like the best villains, Swayze's bank robbing surfer leader Bodhi believes he is the hero of his own story, sticking it to the system that he sees as crushing humanity. Lori Petty is another standout as Tyler, an ex-girlfriend of Bodhi's who is at first suspicious of outsider Utah to the surfing community, but who becomes his way into the closed surfer subculture. There are a number of other solid performers who make the most of their cliched supporting characters, including Gary Busey (grizzled veteran agent), John C. McGinley (superior officer always at the top of his lungs), James Le Gros (no-name gang member who ""feels cold"" after being shot), Lee Tergesen (as the psycho gang member), and even Tom Sizemore (in an uncredited role as an undercover DEA agent who has his cover blown). And look fast for Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis as a surfer thug. Behind the camera you have the cinematographer of ""Flashdance"" and ""Men in Black,"" the editor of ""The Abyss"" and ""After Dark, My Sweet,"" Mark Isham, the composer of ""Crash"" and ""A River Runs Through It,"" and most importantly you have director Kathryn Bigelow, the first female director of a big budget Hollywood action film. Bigelow brings a visual flare to the film that overcomes its tidal wave of cliches and poor acting by Reeves. Reeves is weakest element of the film and he's in nearly every scene of the film, which does no help. ""Point Break"" was his first adult film role and he's incredibly stiff as the film's lead. His performance is so bad there's even a stage version of this film called ""Point Break Live!"" where professional actors re-enact the film with the exception of Johnny Utah, who is performed by an unrehearsed audience member. Had the lead gone to say Johnny Depp or a Sean Penn, this film may have gotten more respect. Keanu has become a much better actor since this time (his John Wick films are mind-blowing!), but he gives a bad performance for the ages in this one. Still, Bigelow elevates the material to the point where there are moments, such as when Swayze, following a botched bank robbery, burns their getaway car by lighting a gas pump on fire while wearing a mask of ex-president Ronald Regan, waving the flaming pump in slow motion, where the film almost makes me feel there was some sort of subtext about the wealthy and politically connected being nothing better than surfers seeking the ultimate rush on the backs of the working class, but I think that gives this empty headed script way too much credit. And simply on a visceral level, Bigelow brings a thrilling you-are-there feel to her handheld action scenes, as well as creating some beautiful surfing and skydiving sequences that wonderfully capture both the thills and serenity of both. I remember as being breathtaking on the big screen and wish I could experience the film again that way. Overall, despite a subpar script and subpar acting by Reeves, the assets far outweigh it liabilities, making ""Point Break"" something of a minor classic. FUN FACT! The beach scene for the film's finale was filmed in Cannon Beach, Oregon at Ecola State Park.",Point Break
55,triple8,not my kind of movie.,4,7 March 2004,"I don't think point break is so much a bad movie as a movie that will appeal to certain people and have no cross over appeal.

But I didn't find much of what I like in movies present in this one. Although I will say there are some movies I wont watch a second or third time and this is one I am keeping an open mind about.I guess, as far as action goes point break sure has it.

56,burlesonjesse5,Surf's Up Ace!,7,9 May 2014,"Kathryn Bigelow was a different director back in 1991. Before the success of The Hurt Locker (2009) and Zero Dark Thirty (2012), she was making films that weren't deemed Academy Award worthy. She was cutting her teeth with raw unflinching action flicks like Blue Steel (1989) and this screw loose guilty pleasure known as Point Break. I've seen it many times and honestly it just never gets old. It belongs in a time capsule. Point Break represents a lot of beliefs I have about the possibility of what an action film can be because it goes completely over the top and throws everything in it but the kitchen sink. Yes, it's a movie that is choppy in shape and form. But it has bombastic originality along with a handful of important jaw dropping key scenes that make up for its shortcomings. Initially, when I first set foot in the theater over 20 years ago for my first screening of Point Break, I was dumbfounded. I was completely taken aback by the casting (Keanu Reeves, Gary Busey, Patrick Swayze), the plot, and the fact that the initial viewing left me cold, like I had seen a film that an average audience would stay away from (the theater was small, it was Friday night, and there were 8-10 people in the seats). Over time, I've grown to surrender to Point Break's giddiness as full blown cinema. It stands the test of time and breaks every film making rule in the book. You think the director, the stars, or the production staff cared, well they didn't. I have one word for these people, bravo!The story begins with our hero, Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves in a his first starring action film role) entering his first day as a FBI agent in sunny Los Angeles. Right away, he gets paired with an over the hill aging veteran named Angelo Papas (played with improv overload by the likable Gary Busey). The two of them team up to try and catch a group of bank robbers who may or may not be surfers. Oh and I almost forgot, they also dress up as the ex-presidents with masks and all, only taking money out of the cash registers (apparently the vault takes too much time). Throughout the full running time of two pulse pounding hours, Reeves character befriends a local named Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) and romances a spunky surfer girl Tyler Endicott (Lori Petty) all the while going undercover and bruising his ""whoooaaa"" like ego in the process. I'm not gonna lie, his performance demands attention. As a actor, he tends to be as wooden as aged oak but he's likable in ""Break."" Bigelow saw something in Reeves that I think most directors would have dismissed as a veritable disaster. But she gave him his shot and he went on to shine later in Speed and the Matrix movies. Also, the pairing of Busey and Reeves as law enforcement associates is something I initially thought was some kind of nocturnal joke, but it works. Busey, with his purely white fanged teeth, runs amok with this character and becomes Utah's scary, perverse uncle. As the movie takes a lot of trippy twists and turns, the two of them form a friendship based on polar opposite attraction. It's the key to the film I think because ultimately it's a buddy cop yarn just like Lethal Weapon (1987) and 48 Hours (1982).Buddy cops movies aside, Point Break is pure adrenaline and has a harrowing intensity that shows in three key scenes: the sting operation of a drug house followed by mistaken identity, the skydiving scene with no parachutes, and the apprehension of the villain in Austrailia's nastiest waters. I can say that a cult following this flick garnished, is well deserved. Kathyrn Bigelow, a maverick back then and an Academy darling now, deserves praise for this early 90's endeavor. She directed Point Break with reckless abandon and I'm proud to say it owns a special place in my eccentric collection of well worn DVDs.",Point Break

Every single frame of this film pats you on the back and tells you everything will be alright. Sure, there's a lot of violence and murder throughout, but that all comes of as pretty mild when it's laced with Patrick Swayze spouting utterly meaningless monologues about the spirituality of surfing. His character's name is ""Bodhi"" for God's sake, that has to make you curious. You know your character is bizarre when it makes Gary Busey look semi-balanced. The action scenes stand out as very well-done, particularly the endless foot chase you get somewhere around the middle. Just minutes and minutes of running through back yards, jumping over fences, knocking people over, damn it why don't they make 'em like this anymore? Same with the bank robbery, the filming is so basic and therefor so much fun. And the ending, nothing could prepare you for its cheesiness but it's pretty touching nonetheless.

The main reason why I watched this movie was because there were some known names in it. I know, Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves aren't exactly known as the best actors ever, but I didn't have much else to do so I decided to give this movie a try...The story is about some surfers who rob banks from June until October. They call themselves the ""ex-presidents"" because they wear masks of the ex-presidents Reagan, Carter, Nixon and Johnson. They commit these robberies, so they can keep surfing all year long and don't have to find a job. The FBI has tried to catch them, but the gang always managed to escape. Johnny Utah, a freshman at the FBI's bank-robbery crew, will go undercover to infiltrate the gang of surfers and to stop their criminal activities, but he'll get more action than he bargained for...""Point Break"" isn't the best movie to watch when you want to see some great acting or an intelligent story. This isn't exactly Oscar material, but it wasn't as bad as you might expect either. Why? Well, because it never even pretended to be intelligent or great. All it wanted to do was to give the viewer some original action and it succeeded on that point. And that's all you have to expect from it too, because the acting is far from great. It's hard to believe that Keanu Reeves is an undercover FBI agent and Patrick Swayze as the spiritual guru-like leader of the surfers isn't exactly the best choice either. But if you can see past that and when you want to see some good action scenes, than this movie is certainly worth a watch. You'll see a lot of spectacular surfing and sky diving footage, a spectacular car chase, the bank robberies... and I must admit that these scenes were very well orchestrated.

No faulting Bigelow's direction or Donald Peterman's photography--it's a great-looking picture, from the crashing ocean waves to the muscular action sequences to all the pretty, tan people in various states of undress--but it's dopey as all get out; disbelief doesn't need suspension here, it needs a sabbatical. Worst, though, is how the central relationship between Reeves and surfer dude Swayze is never convincing: why does Reeves fall so forcefully under Swayze's spell and why does Swayze welcome this stranger into his tight-knit community so willingly? Sure, the scenery is lovely, and beach-bumming sounds more fun than desk-jockeying, but the philosophical mumbo-jumbo is unpersuasive, and if Reeves is an adrenaline junkie, he must get more than enough of it ""doing his job"" by chasing baddies on foot through busy neighborhoods and jumping out of a plane without a parachute.

64,Screen_Blitz,Spectacular popcorn flick for action fans everywhere,8,2 April 2016,"The 1990s were the home of some of the most respected action films that went on to become cult classic to this day. When it comes to action movies, the main thing to expect is some big budget action sequences, explosive special effects, and some eye-popping stuntwork. These tropes are thoroughly demonstrated in this exciting early 90s action thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow. Keanu Reeves plays Johnny Utah, a former Ohio State University star quarterback recruited as an undercover cop by the Los Angeles Police Department in the Pacific Coast. He and his partner Pappas (played by Gary Busey) are assigned by their hard-nosed boss Ben Harp (played by John McGinley) a case to capture a gang of long-time bank robbers. Suspecting these bank robbers are local surfers, Johnny gets drawn into the breezy lifestyle of surfing by local surfer Bohdi (played by Patrick Swayze) and his lover Tyler (played by Lori Petty). In attempt to catch these criminals, he uses his surfing expertise to infiltrate the gang and bring them to justice. This movie delivers quite the thrills and excitement at a wide scope action fans should expect from the film boasting such originality. Blossoming from a soulful screenplay and irresistibly hyper kinetic stunt work, this film brings on some amazing action sequences and thrills to grab your attention and never let go. Ranging from bloody gunfights, to the intense bank heists by vicious criminal sporting masks of President Reagan, to some wild skydiving established with nifty cinematography; there is almost too much to name. And there is also Keanu Reeves showing off some amazing surfing skills along the supporting cast in the scenes set on the beach. This movie is just filled with action and thrills many could easily consider groundbreaking, especially for the time of its release. Keanu Reeves is fantastic in the main role, and really puts forth the effort in portraying the main character with such energy and appeal. Patrick Swayze is quite outstanding in his role as well, showing off utter charisma. Supporting these decently developed characters and stunning action sequences is the sharply written plot. With the main theme of the story dealing with choosing between friendship and the power of the law enforcement, what comes from this is a compelling plot, and it works great. It succeeds on its effort of combining surfing with elements of crime and action, and mixing them into a solid, if flawed smorgasbord of excitement.Point Break is a prime example of a 90s action film done right, and a movie that is high recommendation for action fans everywhere. It is certainty the best of Kathryn Bigelow's early works and shows Keanu Reeves in arguably his best role during his pre-Matrix years.

Still not bad.",7,14 November 2010,"Kathryn Bigelow probably needs to direct more, her rap-sheet includes The Hurt Locker, Near Dark and even Blue Steel was pretty good.And Point Break, the ultimate 90s (teen) action film.For some reason I wasn't that blown away by this when it came out despite being the perfect age of 17 or 18. I think it is because the so called x-treme sports have never grabbed me, BMX, skateboarding and in the case of Point Break surfing and sky-diving just never seemed that awesome.But nonetheless Point Break moves quickly has a lot of action crammed in to a ""yeah right!"" plot.Keanu Reeves is rookie detective Johnny Utah (Woah), and Gary Busey is his grizzled and initially unwilling partner Angelo Pappas. They are assigned to track down a bank-robbing gang called the ""Ex-Presidents"", so named for the masks that the 4 guys wear when performing their efficient, successful and largely non-violent heists.Angelo has a theory that he is initially reluctant to share: that the robbers are in fact surfers who pull the jobs to finance their bohemian adrenalin-chasing lifestyle, and who follow the Summer around. Now apparently Summer is almost over, so the window to catch them this year is coming to a close, so the hokily named Utah must go undercover as a surfer to attempt to discover the identity of the robbers.Cue a couple of montages which show his progress from newbie to meh surfer over the course of a few minutes, all while under the tutelage of local experienced surfer-girl Tyler, played by a pint sized Lori Petty.Now Point Break is two hours long, most of that action sequences, so Utah can't waste time in tracking down the Ex-Presidents or we'll have a 4 hour movie on our hands - this necessitates some cinematic coincidences.Tyler is the sometime girlfriend of a renowned local surfer named Bohdi, (Lucky!) upon the first meeting between Bohdi and Utah they get along just fine despite him hanging around his missus, (Lucky!) and he is invited to join in an impromptu game of NFL (Lucky!), where it comes to light that Utah was a star college quarterback who only left the game through a chronic injury. When this is made public all semblance of resentment and mistrust between Utah and the surfers evaporates. Who knew his past identity? Bohdi, that's who! (Lucky!) Bohdi is played by Patrick Swayze.Shortly after this meeting Utah surfs the local beach again after being directed there by some evidence left at a hold up crime-scene. A scuffle between him and the locals breaks out, only to be broken up by do I even need to say it? So Bohdi then invites Utah around to his house for a party that night to drink his beer, enjoy his company and nail his missus, and Johnny Utah does all three! Shortly after a raid-gone-wrong on some surfing suspect's pad, Utah realizes that he was hanging out with the robbers all along. You could call it his ""woah"" moment, but that might have been done before.Again Summer is ending and time is running out, so Pappas and Utah follow the group (basically Swayze and three faceless dudes there to provide enough numbers to call them a ""group"") to a bank that they may be casing.They arrive moments too late after yet another cinematic sandwich-related diversion (when will Hollywood give up on this gimmickry?), and after a long chase scene on foot Utah finds he has no choice but to shoot several rounds pointlessly into the air, rather than shoot the guy he just chased in the leg or something. Such is the bond built by a few random meetings and brief experiences.(Pappas doesn't make it all the way, and it must be said that Gary Busey's death face looks more like a mask than the actual mask the robbers wear, such is the weathered state even 20 years ago!) Now the cat is out of the bag and Utah's true identity is known to the Ex-Prez, so they have taken Tyler hostage and will kill her if Utah gets in the way of their last job of the season and subsequent escape.Of course Utah can't just let them go, and the movie closes with a few more chases, gunfights, a robbery and wait for it, some skydiving.(The finale leads Utah to Australia, which I wouldn't mention if it weren't for the sheer atrociousness of the Oz accents.) Final Rating – 7 / 10.

The macho interplay between Reaves and Swayze is sometimes contrived but usually entertaining. Although she is not a classic Hollywood bombshell I also think Petty is effective as Reaves' surfing instructor and entry to the group (and eventual love interest). There's some unpleasant parts of this movie including a fight that involves a lawn mower (that I usually switch off), and the extent of Reaves' involvement in the group staggers credibility towards the end, but the surfing parts are good.

Patrick Swaayze made a good bad guy and Kathryn Bigelow showed a woman can handle an action flick. But mainly Point Break is a good example of a wholly flawed piece of filmmaking that still manages to entertain. The screenplay sputters, veers and stumbles for almost two hours, Keanu Reeves gives a god-awful performance, and the film's veneer of a spiritual agenda is almost deplorably laughable. However, there are enough interesting quirks and decent action sequences to make it a howl to watch. Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis and the young Tom Sizemore make memorable cameos, and as the lead villain, Patrick Swayze is an over-the-top riot. The film might have worked better had it stayed within the realm of action camp, instead of attempting to be taken seriously: Kathryn Bigelow's screenplay and direction are painfully all over the map. Still, there are some stunning stunts and terrific surfing action, and excellent MTV style camerawork that makes for adrenaline-filled fun - despite the fact that the film is by and large ridiculous and inane.",Point Break
69,Stampsfightclub,Like every other crime thriller,6,13 July 2008,"Keanu Reeves (The Matrix) stars as Johnny Utah, a newly recruited agent who is assigned an undercover task to seek out ""The Presidents"", a group of professional bank robbers, which leads Utah into a trail of high adrenaline stunts, romance and friendship, testing his strength to the maximum.The crime genre has changed over the last couple of decades, with more CGI, gun fights and showdowns encoded for high octane viewing, and this Kathryn Bigelow (Near dark) justifies most conventions in a typical crime thriller.Far from their best performances in the careers, Reeves and Swayze (Dirty dancing) are headlined as the stars of the show and fulfil the male icon, the tough cop and the sophisticated cool dude, and though the relationship between the characters is interesting, it doesn't have enough personality to cope with the dialogue and changes in the plot to make it dramatic enough.However, Swayze's character Bodhi has an interesting perspective on life, on the freedom of society and to live for breathtaking moments, which does make his character intriguing and one of the reasons to carry on watching, even though the plot tails on an off all the way through.With typical manly conventions such as guns, fighting, drinking and swearing all encoded, this film is a real guy film, though a soppy cliché of a romantic story is thrown in, like every other crime film out there and being a fan of the crime thriller genre I was disappointed, given the sceptical of surfing as an interesting sub story. The plot is inconsistent and doesn't do much justice to the genre, with poor direction in fights and chases and such.Despite its faults, it can still be entertaining for guys who like adrenaline and typical male heroes and so forth, but for me it was poorly scripted, pretty predictable, clichéd, like every other crime film, and with very little different from any other new cop, new challenge, conflicted feelings film.",Point Break

71,ajs-10,Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze go all 'surfer' on us in this rather good thriller from Kathryn Bigelow,7,4 January 2012,"Another film I've seen a few times before but one that never really stuck in the memory banks. Time for a refresher? You betcha! Another one shown on TV and so it was a case of set the recorder and await a suitable window for a viewing. As you can probably guess, that window opened up this evening (despite the best efforts of the weather and the gods of sod's law to prevent it!). I must say, for the most part I enjoyed it, although I did find it tended to drag a bit towards the end. More of my thoughts after this brief summary.Rookie FBI agent Johnny Utah gets assigned to investigate bank robberies in California with veteran, Pappas. Their boss, Ben Harp, is less than impressed with the pair but assigns them to the 'Ex-Presidents' case. A series of robberies where the perpetrators all wear rubber masks with the faces of ex-Presidents of the United States. Pappas has a theory that the men behind it are surfers and so Utah goes undercover in an effort to find them. He first meets Tyler, a girl, who teaches him to surf and eventually becomes his girlfriend. She introduces him to the surfing culture and a group of her friends led by the charismatic adrenaline junkie, Bodhi. Utah comes to respect Bodhi while constantly on the look-out for the ex-presidents. When one line of enquiry fails to pay off he begins to come to a realisation I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police (Surfing Division) will confiscate my board (again).The cinematography in this film is great! Not just the surfing scenes; there's skydiving and a great chase sequence around the back yards of some houses that I really enjoyed. The performances were all good, although I did still see Keanu Reeves, who plays Johnny Utah, as his character in the 'Bill and Ted' films from his younger days. If he had been a couple of years older then I think he may have been a little more believable. Patrick Swayze, on the other hand, as Bodhi, was perfect for the part (IMO). Honourable mentions must also go to; Gary Busey, larger than life (as ever) as Pappas, Lori Petty as Tyler and John C. McGinley as Ben Harp.I like the plot of this film, but it does take a little time to get going at the beginning and, as I've already mentioned, it does seem to drag a bit at the end. I do like the way all the main characters are well rounded and we get to know a little about their back stories. This does help when we are supposed to care about them. Over all, I pretty much enjoyed this one and I'm quite happy to deem it recommended.My score: 7.4/10.IMDb Score: 6.9/10 (based on 48,620 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 67/100 (based on 52 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

72,PsychoBeard666,This is a 10/10 movie that is also terrible.,10,24 March 2021,I love this film. Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze are immense. The acting isn't the best but they're still immense. The story is weak but it's still brilliant. The script is pure cheese that is also solid gold.,Point Break
73,jpschapira,Movies we can do without...,6,8 June 2007,"There are movies you can do without, my friend Estelle said. It's true. For example, you don't need to watch ""American Beauty"" if you love cinema; I personally think is overrated and, although very good, only worth it because of some performances. Of course, there are also movies that you must see, nut I'm not getting into that now because these are many.However, I would like to do it rather than writing about ""Point Break""; I'm so bored because it's just a very boring film. It's not bad though, and I need to make that clearBut it's not good either. I tried to think of things that could have made it better but I found it very difficult; there are films that contain so much gibberish that you can't believe your ears.When Johnny (Keanu Reeves) goes undercover to try to find who some guys who robbed a bank disguised as ex-presidents are, a story you know by heart begins its development. The background this time is surfing, and the moral principles of the surfers are the gibberish I mentioned. These are the people that Johnny is investigating, and their leader Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) is one of those charismatic guys who are popular because of how they talk (they are convincing) but don't have a trace of sense in the ideas they profess.Bodhi's philosophy involves a fight against a 'system'. Which system? We try to understand, but we don't really know. This is a big mistake made by W. Peter Iliff; the screenwriter who thought he could put some depth into a movie that didn't show it in its simple and convenient premise. Between all the embarrassing lines of his script, Iliff gets a couple of good moments; particularly an explanation about fear given by Swayze with undeniable conviction.The rest is windWind blowing in the beach where the surfers unleash their adrenaline as they go angrily towards the wave and have a lot fun. Wind in the sky, as they also sky dive. All of this looks nice and tidy because Donald Peterman's cinematography is inventive, but these sequences are overly long, and tiring.Should I blame director Kathryn Bigelow? The female director, who has done a lot of movies involving cops, fails in completing the main point of any cop movie: exciting action scenes. And this is the boredom I was talking about; we see bank robberies, chase scenes, fight sequences and we never feel the hype. I was sitting and my head wasn't moving or expressing a sign of excitement as bullets were going through the air and blood was all around.The edition didn't help either, establishing no connection between some scene changes. The fact that ""Point Break"" is a very popular film, does not assure that it is good, you see? Because Keanu Reeves is a popular actor but, except for the roles where he is completely calm, he is not good. Actually, he's a robot; and this film is good evidence to watch him saying his lines with the least sense of belief. He's very good at screaming and swearing, though, but he should have learned something from Patrick Swayze.I recently watched ""The Negotiator""; it was the typical cop story, but the performances made it completely worth it. When there's two actors, they both have to be connected; and I say this because ""Point Break"" is promising and could have been more. Maybe someone will come and shoot a remake or create a sequel that does justice to the film. In the meantime, there are movies you can do without; ""Point Break"" is one of them.",Point Break
74,K3nzit,Strange mix of 'Miami Vice' and 'Baywatch',2,3 January 2020,Keanu Reeves is terrible in this overrated action movie by Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker). It's a strange mix of 'Miami Vice' and 'Baywatch'. One good chase scene is all that 'Point Break' has to offer.,Point Break

It is in people's nature to put down great things and to nit-pick or sometimes just be plain mean. No matter what anyone says, this is utterly fantastic. The kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. That said, the main plot of the film was constantly being interrupted. The directing, music, editing, etc are not focused on at all. If you can find it on DVD or Bluray for under $13, buy it, but it won't be worth much more than that to you because it's a bit outdated.

While undercover, he befriends Petty and Swayze, both of whom know the local surfing scene and might be able to help network him to the robbers, but this becomes a conflict in and of itself when he falls in love with the former and establishes a fond respect for the latter, neither of which will approve his true identity of being a fed. Reeves and Busey cause so much destruction trying to catch the bad guys, yet we never see them filling out reports or any other paperwork. According to this movie, people can have conversations while skydiving! Hmm. Despite the constant suspension of disbelief required to actually buy into the movie's nonsense, POINT BREAK has an undeniable charm that make you allow (and even embrace) the obvious imperfections. Maybe it's the chemistry of the cast; maybe it's the fact that it's a non-stop roller-coaster ride; maybe it's the sunny-beach action-packed vibe that gives off this unique mixture of relaxation and testosterone.

77,skepticskeptical,Open to interpretation...,6,13 February 2021,"Point Break has a lot going for it. Unfortunately, it also has a lot going against it. The horrible acting of Keanu Reeves is not fully redeemed by his sheer comeliness. Much of the dialogue seems very juvenile, which I suppose one could argue makes sense given that the protagonists are a bunch of surfer dudes, plus one dudette. What is quite interesting is how the bromance between the two main characters can be interpreted. I am glad that I watched this--better late than never--but will not watch it again.",Point Break
78,anselmdaniel,Thrilling dumb action,7,8 December 2018,"This review contains spoilers.Point Break is an action crime thriller film that premiered in 1991. The motion picture is directed by Kathryn Bigelow and is about a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent investigating a gang called the ""Ex-Presidents"". The gang has raided banks and wear face-masks of former United States presidents.Point Break is a tight action movie at a running time of 122 minutes. The movie relies on its two leads of Keanu Reeves playing FBI Agent Johnny Utah and Patrick Swayze as Bodhi. These two characters have great on screen chemistry and are utilized to their potential. The acting might be flat, but the action involving these two actors is not. They are frequently involved in chases, gun fights, and stunts. This works to the movie's benefit as it is engrossing to watch these two do progressively more and more dangerous things. These two characters are also the focus of the movie.Point Break is not a flawless, movie as the focus of Johnny Utah and Bodhi taking a centerpoint causes a detriment to other parts of the movie. The other parts of this movie absolutely suffer to have it focus on Bodhi and Johnny Utah. The other characters simply do not matter as they are utterly thrown to the sidelines. Even logic and progression in this movie are thrown away. There are many events that happen so quickly the audience may not catch what occurred. One of these is Johnny Utah kicking a dog. That was such a quick cut that if the audience was not paying attention may miss a strange and unintentionally funny moment.The directing of the action scenes in the movie are at a good level. The scenes do feel tense at times and the directing does offer a clear view to what happens in the movie. The directing of the quieter moments is bland and not as interesting. This is still a good effort for an action movie.I would recommend Point Break. This is a solid action movie.Grade: C",Point Break
79,moviesleuth2,"Good, but could have been so much better",6,1 July 2010,"Suspenseful and exciting action sequences require three things: an attention-grabbing event, energetic camera-work, and an appropriate amount of character development. ""Point Break"" has the former, but not the latter. As a result, the film's countless action sequences raise the pulse, but only a little.Ex-football star Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) has been transferred to the FBI bank robbery division in Los Angeles. He's coming right in the middle of a string of bank robberies by a group who calls themselves ""The Ex-Presidents,"" after the masks of former presidents that the robbers wear to protect their identities. Utah's partner, Pappas (Gary Busey) thinks that the robbers may be surfers, so he sends Utah to the beaches to learn how to surf and infiltrate their ranks.The problem with the film is that we are not given a single person to care about in this film. There isn't just very little character development, there is NO character development. One could argue that action movies like this don't need it, and to add it would only slow the film down. In many cases this is true, but as Jan de Bont proved three years later, it is indeed possible to create adequately developed characters while still keeping the pace high.It's such a shame that this movie forgot a key element to creating a good action movie. The performances are all solid, even clichéd development probably would have done the trick. And director Kathryn Bigalow knows a thing or two about pacing an action movie.Still, it's worth at least a rental. The action sequences are inventive enough to keep a decent level of interest, and the film is a cult favorite so you may end up appreciating it more than I did.My rating: PG-13 for violence and language.",Point Break
80,Peach-2,Goofy and fun.,8,21 January 1999,"This movie has energy. The story is kinda goofy, but the direction from Kathryn Bigelow has the right amount of pacing and atmosphere.

81,mfellipecampos,Good,7,3 May 2021,"Cartoon characters, predictable police plot, exaggerated action scenes ... That is, everything that makes a popcorn movie from the late 80s / early 90s so fun. Point Break is absurd, over-the-top, and ridiculously satisfying. It mixes quite efficiently all that silly of the police double films with an investigative plot of the 80's with that surrealist cajole of the 90's action films that this one even decisively influenced. Kathryn Bigelow directs action like few of her generation's directors. The chaotic montage with the shaky camera leaves the viewer practically in conflict, technical resources of sound and image that in the wrong hands could leave the film a mess, but which are used wisely by a talented team. The cast is also great, as you would expect from a Bigelow movie. Keanu Reeves and his butt face fit like a glove in the film, his character being almost a satire of the classic film genre types, a sub Clint Eastwood, so to speak. Another highlight of the feature is Patrick Swayze, the iconic actor smoothly incorporates every aspect of his character's over-act and stupid motivations, in a caricatural performance tailored to the needs of the film. Gary Busey practically steals the show for being ... Well, Gary Busey! With that strange face that looks like a melted rubber mask on someone else's face and that huge mouth with more than 70 teeth it is difficult not to attract attention. Anyway, Point Break may not be a cinematic exquisite in terms of narrative and character development, but with its electrifying action sequences, super-comfortable cast, and some slow-motion surfing scenes and insane parachute jumps with a clip track from MTV, guarantees a good action adventure with all the cafes and absurdities that are a trademark of its time.Film seen on May 2, 2021.",Point Break
82,PeterMitchell-506-564364,"Choose this break, cool all the way",8,22 April 2013,"Here's an ultra cool movie, I watched Saturday arvo. I hadn't seen it for a few years. I just can't help lovin' this film, every time I see it. It jumps straight into the story. Four bank robbers, going under alias's, their team name, the ex-presidents, (so you obviously know what names they go by) have successfully robbed these L.A. over summer spells, yet to be caught, until one of them brags too much, mooning a camera. Burned up FBI agent, Busey, has a notion these guys could be surfers. New hot shot, Johnny Utah, (Keanu Reeves) is partnered with him, who at first too, thinks his notions bologne. Reeves goes undercover as a surfer, and it isn't long before he's all buddy buddy with an truly devoted and poetic surfer, Bodhi, the ultimate thrill seeker. He's the head of this group who could be our guys, while getting on the wrong side of another group, an angry and scary looking group of drug frenzied surfers, neo nazi sorts, also suspects. Reeves can be forgiven for his acting here, you just love him as this cool cat character, putting a bit of Bill and Ted into it, especially in the finale scene, cool and classically memorable. Bodhi's ex girlfriend, Tyler (Lori Petty at her sexiest) is the more sensible one, who Reeves strikes up sexual relationship with. The movie never dulls, Reeves and Busey, a great duo, and I loved the ever great, John C (Platoon) McGinley as their captain where an anger management course wouldn't go astray. Too, watch out for Tom Sizemore in a grand moment, who's undercover operation is blown apart, on the account of this wrong and flimsy hunch. Some great and sufficient chase sequences, too, make it an action winner. The movie even makes parachuting look fun, and you gotta admire Keanu's steely determination when jumping out a plane, minus a chute. Check out the start of the last scene at Bells Beach, featuring a four second shot of Aussie, Peter Phelps. Too, check out the screenplay which is an awesome read, by an awesome writer who has some dialogue you'd kill for, one such line spouted by Bodhi, embedded in my mind, forever. Only criticism really, was the bad guys being revealed too early.",Point Break
83,LebowskiT1000,Should set the standard for action films!!!,10,22 January 2003,"""Point Break"" is one of my all-time favorite action films!  This film is definitely one of the best action films around.  I throughly enjoyed it from start to finish.I don't care what anyone says, Keanu Reeves is an awesome actor!  I really like his style quite a bit.  No, he's not perfect, but he is very entertaining in his films.  Patrick Swayze was a perfect choice for the character of Bohdi, although I must admit that he wasn't the obvious choice. Gary Busey was his usual self in this film and very good at what he does. Lori Petty looks better than ever and does a fine acting job as well.  John C. McGinley was excellent as well.  Also, there is an interesting cameo of Anthony Kiedis of Red Hot Chili Peppers.I thought the story was quite original and rather interesting.  The story is very similar to ""Fast And The Furious"", although revolving around a different type of extreme sport.  In any case, if you like ""Fast and the Furious"" you should like this film as well.The direction in this film is just fantastic!  This is most definitely my favorite film directed by Kathryn Bigelow, not to say that her other films are great as well.  She seems to have a very good eye and knows how to get good shots.The action sequences are excellent, there is one scene in particular where my jaw just hit the floor, I couldn't believe what had just happened.  If you've seen the film, I hope you know what scene I'm talking about.Anyhow, if you like action films or you like any of the fore-mentioned actors/director, then you really ought to see this film.  In complete honesty, I think this is one of the best action films EVER!  I truly hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do. Thanks for reading,-Chris",Point Break
84,Beejerman,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),9,15 February 2020,"The stage curtains open ...""Point Break"" is one of the best movies to emerge from the year 1991 and served to be a coming out party for Keanu Reeves in an action role. Until this film, he took mainly supporting roles or comedic leads such a Ted ""Theodore"" Logan from the Bill & Ted movies. Here, he tackles a much more serious role and delivers.Newly assigned FBI Agent, Johnny Utah (Reeves), a former college football star, pairs up with a veteran agent (Gary Busey) to investigate a series of bank robberies who he believes is being enforced by a tight band of surfers. Utah is chomping at the bit for some action, so he buys into this theory, and together they infiltrate a close knit group of friends surrounding a man named Bodhi (Swayze). Before he knows it, Utah is in too deep and he feels torn between the two sides.I absolutely love this movie. In 2015, a remake was released, and quite frankly, it should never have been made. I was sorely disappointed in it. This original film, however, is one of my personal favorites. Keanu Reeves more than proved his acting range here, solidifying him as a viable action star - a feat he would repeat three years later in the movie, ""Speed"", and then of course, later in the Matrix and John Wick movies.This is a very high recommend to not only watch, but to own. The chemistry is spot on here between the movie's hero and villain. Reeves and Swayze play off of each other perfectly. Everything works here on all levels. Lori Petty was also excellent in her role as Utah's love interest and provides that extra spark to make this a movie worth watching. A very strong 9 stars out of 10, this is good movie making.",Point Break
85,saadanathan,Great classic full of adrenaline 7/10,7,24 April 2021,"""Point Break"" is a exceptional movie, many movies with the same plot have been made before but this one in particular is better and cooler, usually in movies of this type of genre there is an undercover cop who investigates a few suspects who might be the robbers he's looking for. On the way he gets emotional with the robbers and befriends with them, falls in love with a girl and eventually must decide what is right. This type of storytelling has been used since then in every possible heist and crime movie. So Point Break will always be a special and exceptional movie for kind of inventing this storytelling. Patrick Swayze was a legend and already a famous actor during the release of this film, he plays the role of Bodhi so well it feels natural for him to be such a man. Keanu Reeves was at the start of his career way before The Matrix happened, and was yet to become one of Cinema's best actors. What I love about the film is how Johnny Utah's character evolves every single time and how he's torn apart between his duty and his love for the group. He adapts to surfing, the surfing scenes are among the best scenes in the movie and give the viewers a good vibe. I really loved this film and recommend it to all those in favor of watching some good action and adrenaline.",Point Break

The rhythm is relatively sustained but there are a few overlong passages that weigh the overall dynamism; in this sense, a 15 minute cut would have been beneficial.The direction is a success, polished, especially the surf scenes that render really well.Nothing to complain about the cast, of course it is not very subtle but the Swayze-Reeves duo works pretty well.",Point Break

90,Cinemaniac1984,A popular 90's cult classic that is still enjoyable today.,8,7 June 2015,"Point Break is one of those action movies that is still popular amongst a lot of audiences yet a lot of people will secretly admit they like the movie. Point Break was a box office hit in 1991 and with Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves in the lead roles, along with cracking action scenes and spectacular adrenaline fueled cinematography, it's not hard to see why this film had the correct formula to still maintain its popularity years later.Keanu Reeves plays a former college football player turned rookie FBI Agent Johnny Utah who has been assigned to the Los Angeles Field Office where he is investigating a string of bank robberies by four men dressed as the Ex-Presidents (Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon Baines Johnson, and Ronald Regan). Utah's partner, Vietnam Veteran and experienced FBI agent Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey) comes up with the radical theory that the Ex-Presidents are actually surfers. Johnny Utah finds himself going deep undercover into the Southern California surf culture despite having zero experience as a surfer, much to the chagrin of Utah and Pappas' boss, the hard nosed and angry Ben Harp (John C. McGinley). Utah manages to enlist the reluctant Tyler (Lori Perry) to teach Utah to surf and Utah finds himself accepted into a group of surfers led by the charismatic and philosophical Bodhi (the late Patrick Swayze). As Utah masters the art of surfing, Utah finds himself increasingly drawn to Bodhi's adrenaline charged lifestyle as well being accepted into the surfing culture, and finds himself attracted to Tyler. The line becomes blurred when Utah's suspicions about Bodhi increase that him and his surfing buddies are actually the Ex-Presidents, the gang responsible for the string of bank robberies across Southern California.Patrick Swayze was a huge box office drawcard from the 80's and early 90's riding high from the success of such movies as Dirty Dancing (1987), Road House (1989) and Ghost (1990). As Bodhi in Point Break, he oozes charisma and charm yet he has a wild streak about him going up against the system.Keanu Reeves as rookie FBI agent Johnny Utah comes across as a grown up jock at first but you can't help but like him in his first action role he later becomes famous for with movies such as Speed (1994) and The Matrix (1999).Gary Busey has a reputation as an eccentric personality on and away from the cameras as well as garnering a well known reputation as the bad guy with movies such as Lethal Weapon (1987) and Under Siege (1992). Here in Point Break as Angelo Pappas, he is actually great as the good guy and strikes a strong friendship with Johnny Utah despite their contrasting personalities.Lori Petty as surfer chick Tyler who falls in love with Utah actually gained notice from a lot of audiences. She continued to gain notice with A League of Their Own (1992) and Free Willy (1993), however her star appeal dwindled with the box office flop Tank Girl (1995). Unfortunately she hasn't really been heard from since.Kathryn Bigalow gained a reputation as the first female director to direct an action blockbuster and further bucked the trend to be the first female director to win an Academy Award for The Hurt Locker (2008), and full credit to her. Kathryn Bigalow has earned her reputation as a quality director.What is there to like about Point Break? To sum it up, you have the star power of likable actors Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves, Gary Busey as a sane good guy, breathtaking cinematography, exciting action, and for lovers of surfing, there is plenty of it. There is also no way I cannot leave out the skydiving scene where Bodhi and his friends surprise Johnny Utah with an early morning skydive. One of the most amazing scenes in the movie along with Mark Isham's score makes it something that will not soon be forgotten.I can't believe that a remake of Point Break is being released at the end of 2015. This time we now have Luke Bracey as Johnny Utah, Edgar Ramirez as Bodhi, Ray Winstone as Angelo Pappas, and Teresa Palmer as the female lead. Also the surfing culture has been substituted for extreme sports. I have seen the trailer to the 2015 remake and already I don't think it will hold a candle to the 1991 classic. Please Hollywood, enough of the remakes and preserve the memory of the original classics.That brief point aside, Point Break lives up to its tagline: 100% pure adrenaline. It is definitely one of those movies that made the 90's so great. There's no denying that Point Break is still a popular cult classic that is still enjoyable today.8/10.",Point Break
91,stevenrotherforth,Like Keanu Reeves this film doesn't look its age.,8,20 May 2019,"Point BreakPoint Break sees a fresh faced Keanu Reeves star as FBI agent Johnny Utah
(yes you read that name correctly). Utah goes under cover tagging along with a gang of surfers who are suspected to be the infamous Ex-Presidents, a gang of bank robbers.
Patrick Swayze plays the Surfer gang leader who befriends Utah.
This film shares a very similar plot to 'The Fast And The Furious' which was released almost a decade later. Many believing the Vin Diesel movie to be a remake.Point Break is a very good film that benefits from some fleshed out characters portrayed by some very fine actors.
Reeves gives a great early performance here. Often he's criticised for being wooden but his turn here is splendid and he owns the show.
Support from Swayze is also good as he plays a kind of villain.
Gary Busey brings the humour and Lori Petty plays the love interest.
Kathryn Bigelow directs and it is clear why she would go on to be an Oscar winner later on in her career.
There's some masterfully helmed set pieces throughout this movie. The foot chase scene being a particular stand out.
Action is presented clearly with expert camera work and editing.
Point Break is a true product of the 90's and whilst sometimes the dialogue comes across as a little cheesy, Bigelow's direction gives the film an air of sophistication.
A movie that is easy to pinpoint which decade it was made in.
Watching a very young John Wick just shows how far Keanu Reeves has come as a movie star.
An actor that isn't given nearly enough credit as he deserves. Reeves is perfect for this kind of movie.
Swayze on the other hand took a chance playing the bad guy but in reality it isn't cut and dry that he truly is the villain.
For a character who doesn't like violence it sure manages to follow him around.
I enjoyed watching Point Break. A film that is now twenty-eight years old.
A compliment can be given that even though this is clearly a 90's movie, like Keanu Reeves it doesn't look its age.",Point Break

93,diac228,He gets beat up again!?!?!?!,7,27 January 2010,"This is the review with hilarious spoilers. This is the movie where Keanu Reeves gets his butt kicked. A lot. As a matter of fact, at least 6 times he fails in a fight, chase, or action scene. This is the movie where the good guys fail at everything and the bad guys succeed in almost every possible way---whether it is by outsmarting the good guys or because the good guys are idiots. This is the action flick that proves you don't need special effects, but you do need someone in the background keeping tally of who is beating who in the film (""Um, Mrs. Bigelow, why is Keanu Reeves getting beat down by a naked woman?"")Point Break is one of the signature action flicks of the 90s. Why you ask? Because a bunch of violent hippie-like surfers (that love extreme sports) are robbing banks around California and an ex-football player-turned cop must stop them by becoming one of them. Yep, this plot sounds like it's going somewhere. The main character's name is Johnny Utah. Come on now, any movie with a main character that cool of a name is bound to be a hell of a good time, right? Then we have Patrick Swayze as one of the ""surfer hippies"" (awesome performance) and the always-reliable Gary Busey as the partner. This has all the makings of an action classic, and the opening credits just started.The script was clever, and was something very different in the realm of action flicks. This movie was W. Peter Iliff''s best script and it's a shame after Patriot Games he didn't dwell more into the genre. There was only one issue with the script. No, it's not the dialogue, no it's not the pacing, but it's the extremely weak and pathetic main character. Our main character loses so many fights, we stop rooting for him halfway because we are sure the end result would be the same----failure. He doesn't listen, he's not very smart, he's obviously not very strong, and he mellows down to a pathetic wanna-be hero that chases the main villain like a lost puppy. There can be cases of good movies where the villains are just so much smarter than the heroes (The Dark Knight anyone?), but there are some extreme cases in which you wonder why the members of the police force still have their job based off their decision-making. Keanu Reeves in the movie almost loses a fight against surfers, and does indeed lose against a naked woman, against bank robbers, against one guy (multiple times), against a man on fire, against gravity, and couldn't even succeed in a single chase. And he was a football player. Did I already say he lost to a female taking a shower? I did? I'll say it again anyway. Gary Busey should have ditched this guy halfway through the production, but then we the audience would definitely have known by then that Mr. Utah just wasn't going to win at anything. Unfortunately, he stuck around, giving Utah hope. Oops. Luckily we have great direction from Kathryn Bigelow and superb stuntwork. Bigelow must have been against special effects, because this entire movie is stuntwork and pyrotechnics-driven, as we see skydiving, surfing, crazy stunts, and one of the best on-foot chases in the history of cinema----despite it ending weakly. Bigelow is one of the more underrated directors out there, as she avoids pulling punches and avoids the clichés throughout the entire production. She also crafts great performances from Busey, Swayze, and also John C. McGinley. As for Keanu Reeves, he does a decent job, but his character prevents him from delivering anything memorable. Mr. Utah is a law enforcement joke. Bottom Line: Point Break is a swell action flick, as long as you can get past Keanu getting smacked around constantly, as he loses fights, loses arguments, constantly loses control of the situation at hand, and constantly fails in achieving his goal. It was laughable the amount of times he screws up, and the amount of times his peers screwed up. No wonder the bank robbers were having no problems taking over the city banks. Despite this fact, the movie is fun, furious, raw, and one of the signature action flicks of the 1990s. P.S. Keanu Reeves gets beat up by a naked woman. Just wanted to say that one more time.",Point Break
94,Bogey Man,Another great action thriller from Bigelow,8,8 September 2002,"Kathryn Bigelow's Point Break (1991) stars Keanu Reeves as a young FBI agent who gets undercover to the world of surfers as he and his partner think they may be responsible for many bank robberies that have taken place in recent times. Patrick Swayze plays one of the surfers whom with Reeves makes friends. This film has surprisingly firm plot and story and thus this becomes more interesting film than others in its genre. But the interesting and never-boring story is only one little positive thing this film has.The cinematography by Donald Peterman is totally stunning and rarely have I seen such a effective usage of slow motion and hyper stylish camera work in Hollywood picture. In fact, Point Break looks occasionally little like the greatest Hong Kong films with their unique use of camera and edits. Point Break has many surf scenes which look fantastic and the water almost seems to come inside your living room. The slow motion creates the feel of huge masses and power that lies in the ocean when nature decides to show its abilities. The other thing which is equally spectacular is the sky diving segment, which is very long and breath taking. It makes the viewer wonder ""Why haven't I tried this fantastic sport yet?"" Sky diving proves that these young guys want to be free and do what they want to, even if it may cost their lives. It required a lot from the cinematographer and director to make these scenes possible, and that shows how talented director Bigelow is and how talented crew she had. Her other films are no less visually stunning as Blue Steel (1990) and Near Dark (1987) show.The action is plentiful and fierce. Guns fire and people try to stay alive while bullets fly everywhere. There is one ultra fast chase involving Reeves and a criminal, and they run through several houses and backyards with such a speed that the ending of Hong Kong classic Long Arm of the Law (Johnny Mak, 1984) in the infamous Walled City with its claustrophobic elements came to my mind. It may well be that Bigelow is the Hollywood's closest equivalent to the Orient action and fantasy directors.
This film, however, doesn't have the themes and philosophical touches which make especially Near Dark so wonderful. I can't say Point Break is empty, but it doesn't have many things to say despite these spectacular action segments which are more than plenty. The music is by Mark Isham (The Hitcher, Romeo Is Bleeding) and Bigelow's Near Dark wouldn't be so great without the music of Tangerine Dream so once again the importance of music and soundtrack has been proved.  Point Break is among the greatest Hollywood produced action thrillers of the nineties and definitely makes it's director on the map in the history of action cinema. She is much more inventive and personal than many male directors, and I just hope she (and Antonia Bird) manage to continue their personal work for many years to come.8/10",Point Break
95,tastyhotdogs,Gnarly,6,2 August 2009,"Decided to buy this when I'd been reminded about it by several of Bill Simmons' podcasts. In the day I thought it was cool- had it held up after 18 years though? Here's my answer.""Point Break"" is based around Johnny Utah (Reeves), a new member of LA's armed robbery division. Johhny is soon put to work on trying to catch the ""Ex-Presidents"", a group of 4 robbers who are hitting some of the biggest banks and doing it in a very quick, precise and efficient manner. Utah follows the hunch of his new partner Angelo (Busey) who believes the ""Ex-Presidents"" are surfers in their non-bank robbing time. Soon Johnny finds himself undercover, learning to surf and quickly hooking up with Tyler (Lori Petty), who shows him the ropes and helps him meet some of the local surfers. He comes across some real characters, some he likes such as Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) and some he dislikes, like Tone (the lead-singer of the Chilli Peppers). Johhny soon faces danger at every turn. WIll he find his men and bring them in or will he throw away the badge and pursue his new love of surfing? Has aged a little, but the stunts are pretty great, especially the skydiving (so well pulled off they had 2 separate scenes which lead to people needing to skydive.) The ex-president idea was genius at the time and still is cool and parts of the story are great, but others are just plain stupid. Plenty of ham (such as the crazy cop with the right hunch and the other two partners always jerking the main cops' chain) and unbelievable scenes, but pretty good for it's day, especially the stunts. Nothing looked fake. Could have used some more scenes robbing banks and a little more on the budding mancrush between Bodhi and Johnny. Enough good scenes to make it memorable.",Point Break
96,bh_tafe3,Never really understood its guilty pleasure status...,8,28 January 2016,"... not because I think it's a bad film, but because I think it's freaking awesome! It came as a genuine surprise to me that the film is viewed by many as a film so bad it's crossed the border into good. I'm not going to waste letters critiquing other people's critiques, but I will give my own two cents.I think whenever you talk about a film that is 25+ years old, it's necessary to talk about your own personal context. I believe I was 11 or 12 years old when I saw this on VHS (some of you young'uns may have to google that one). Keanu Reeves at this stage was best known for playing Theodore Logan in the Bill and Ted series, there was no Speed or Matrix movies to go by. I had seen Ghost and I think Roadhouse, but I didn't have any clear memories of Patrick Swayze, apart from thinking he was ""da man."" Gary Busey was not a part of my life and I honestly had no idea who he was. I had never seen a surfing movie (especially not Big Wednesday, Busey's entry into the genre and well worth a look for being IMO far more deserving of this film's reputation) or a sky diving film, but I found both pastimes quite fascinating (and have indulged in both as I got older).Point Break is the story of FBI Agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) who is trying to track down a group of bank robbers. Believing the theory of an older agent, Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey) that the gang of robbers are surfers, Utah decides to go undercover and infiltrates a tight knit group of surfers, headed by serial risk taker Bodhi (Patrick Swayze, awesome). Utah takes a liking to Bodhi and his life philosophy, but eventually learns that Bodhi's gang are the bank robbers he's looking for, and has to fight his feelings of kinship with Bodhi to try and bring the gang down.As an 11 year old I had never seen anything like this. The great surfing and sky diving action, the brilliantly filmed chase sequences, the bank robbery. Ted Logan in a serious role? Patrick Swayze as a gun toting wise man? This was film making on a different level to any of the movies I'd seen to that point.Coming back as an adult, I choose not to care about inconsistencies and illogical happenings in the story for a very simple reason: I am entertained by what's happening in front of me. The action sequences in this are breathtaking. Patrick Swayze's sheer presence in this is off the charts. And even in 1991, Reeves has the look and presence of a star. I think as time has gone on we've gotten more and more guilty of breaking a film, or anything for that matter, we are critiquing into various parts and trying to come up with a sum total. But something as experiential as watching a film doesn't lend itself to that. Does Keanu Reeves give, in many ways, a wretched performance? Probably, but does it take me out of the film at all? Gotta say no. Is there some really dopey dialogue at times? Yes, but it's not out of place with the message or flow of the film and again doesn't take me out of it. Do things happen in this that would never and could never happen in the real world? Yes, but I can buy that they are happening in the universe the film exists in. I am willing to give this film a lot in the way of suspending disbelief because I am enjoying the ride.I don't come to this as some old fogey who thinks ""they don't make them like they used to."" I love modern cinema. I really enjoyed the Fast and the Furious, which riffs heavily on this film, and its various sequels; I liked the Hunger Games films, hell, I even liked Transformers and do the occasional Harry Potter marathon. But it is baffling to me that this film has become so maligned and the butt of jokes when it is easily the equal of any action film made today.For its well directed action sequences, for Swayze's presence and for the whole message and feel of the film, it deserves to be remembered as one of the 90s best action flicks. They really should have known better than to try and remake it and we really should know better than to dismiss it so easily.",Point Break
97,HelenMary,Swayze and Reeves together again - action with a difference,9,5 December 2012,"Awesome thrill-ride of a film. I don't know whether it's because this is directed by a woman (Bigelow) but it plays out differently to a lot of other action films; it's got more plot, emotion and variety to most, the characters are portrayed as fuller more rounded figures, and certainly in this you aren't sure whether the bad guys are as ""bad"" as all that. The lines are hazy, and this is the crux of the plot, and Bodhi (Swayze) is such a charismatic character, in life as on film, and Swayze was born to play this role - he is perfect, and plays the right mix of sensei idealist and slightly bonkers fanatic beautifully.It is one of my top ten films of all time, it having Patrick Swayze AND Keanu Reeves has something to do with it (a lot) but it's just such a rip-roaring ride, and has some epic scenes - the first sky-dive scene is almost ballet! The surfing is great too, and there are some lovely artist wave riding scenes. It's realistic, not overly stylised, and it isn't all ""Hollywood."" It's original and much copied (Fast and Furious is almost identical) and I don't understand why it didn't do better in terms of awards and recognition.Point Break is a step away character-wise for Reeves, and was apparently a risk for Bigelow casting him as action-man and from the opening scene of ""100% Utah!"" he's action all the way and he does it well with a physicality that impresses. He's a perfect 'partner' for Swayze who was always known for his physical prowess, and the chemistry between them seems really genuine. John C McGinley is awesome as Ben Harp, the Captain, and as in Scrubs does some incredible monologues at speed, vein throbbing in his head. Hilarious. The interaction between him, Utah and Pappas (Busey in a great role) is the comic relief. Lori Petty (Tank Girl) is well cast in this. She works well with Reeves and makes for fluid interlude between the action/cop shots, weaving in and out of the story as part of the central theme but also outside of it.The writing is flawless, and all the primary actors bring it to life cleanly. Some great quotable lines in this, my personal favourite being, ""Utah, you're about to jump out of a perfectly good aeroplane, how d'you feel about that?"" This is a cult classic and rightly so - one of the best movies of the early 90s. The only reason not to like this film is if your film watching sensibilities don't extend to nudity, bad language and violence; the worst of it in the one scene in the middle where the stake-out ""goes down."" You can fast forward that bit but you'll love the rest, I'm sure of it.",Point Break
98,krachtm,Derivative undercover cop movie + totally radical surfers,6,31 August 2012,"I was 18 when this movie came out, and I didn't understand why people my age liked it so much. I still don't. Some people seem to feel that it's a satire of testosterone-fueled action movies, but, if it is, it just doesn't do a very good job. If anything, I think it works better as a derivative, cheesy action movie, rather than any kind of satire.I like Kathryn Bigelow, but I think that Point Break is probably her worst movie. Even her worst movie is better than a lot of the crap that gets released to theaters, however. I liked the scenes with the ex-presidents, during the robberies, and I liked some of the action sequences. The rest of the movie just didn't do anything for me. A young FBI agent who goes undercover, is drawn into the lifestyle, and feels conflicted when it comes time to take down his new friends? Seen it. Seen it a hundred times. I've seen it done better, I've seen it done worse, but I'll admit that this is the first time I've seen it done with surfers. However, I really don't care about surfers, their lifestyle, their quasi-mystical bullshit, or pretty much anything else related to surfers or surfing. However, that seems to be a huge draw to the fans of this movie.Patrick Swayze, as Bodhi, the undisputed King of All Things Radical, seems custom written to appeal directly to rebellious teenage boys, who will revel in his free spirit and mastery of all things radical. The other antagonists, however, are so underdeveloped and interchangeable that you can't really tell which ones are which. James LeGros, whom I always like, stands out the most, but that's still not saying much.Keanu Reeves was coming off of Bill & Ted, and he was looking for something radically different. Once Keanu started to relax a bit and stop trying to overcompensate for his Bill & Ted years, his acting became better, but this was still a bit of an awkward time for him. His acting is wooden at times, though he still comes off as likable.It's not an especially good or bad movie, and it perplexes me why people my age like it so much. I suspect that these are the extreme sports fans, surfing fans, and Keanu fans. I don't really fit into any of those categories.",Point Break
99,jayjaycee,Reeves/Swayze greatness with an unforeseen twist,8,5 June 2020,"""Point Break"" is a 1991 crime thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow starring Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze. I admittedly lost track of how often I mentioned what an immense impact my father had on me in terms of movies and how he is co-responsible for my journey as a cinephile. Without him, I wouldn't be the same movie loving man I grew up to be, as he has shown me the most important and most essential films that have ever been produced and pointed me in the right direction in general. Many films in my feed are either direct recommendations or copies I borrowed from him and hence his influence is still present to this day, but even though my Dad influenced me the most, I also love to check out a few films my beloved mother recommended to me. Even if she isn't as deep in the business as me, she still has a decent taste in films, and it is always a joy to listen to her talking about her favourite films. Her opinion matters a lot to me, even if I don't express it enough. Thanks to her, I was introduced to ""Dirty Dancing"" which I (famously) ended up loving, therefore I tackled another of her favourite films, what was a personal birthday gift from her this year. As I stated before, the lady has a good taste in films and this flick proves it once again. First of all, the cast of this film is without a doubt one of the best the late eighties/early nineties could have offered. In spite of the fact that I don't consider neither Reeves nor Swayze to be extraordinarily skilled in acting, they both count as two of my favourite actors and they have shown their extreme charisma in here once again, and Kathryn Bigelow, nowadays highly acclaimed director of war dramas ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty"", knows to stage the leading heartthrobs masterly. Avowedly, the basic premise of this film sounds extremely interesting, but neutrally viewed, undoubtedly generic. I mean, from what the summary promises it sounds like you are getting a story about an undercover agent who slowly begins to sympathize with the ones he is supposed to arrest and hence is unable to finish his job. This concept has been used a handful of times and hence isn't original in the slightest, but this film uses it and makes something original of it. Instead of showing how Johnny Utah becomes friends with the surfer clique he suspects to be bank robbers called ""The Ex-Presidents"" for almost two hours and a final scene that reveals his real profession, the whole mission surprisingly fails already an hour into the movie and Utah's true identity is already exposed then. Well, this twist was underwhelming and interesting at the same time as it thus detached itself from the formulaic approach of the first hour and surfs in uncharted waters. Bigelow deluded us by letting us think that she would go according to the ordinary schedule, but she went into an unexpected direction instead. From there on the film all suddenly lost any indication of predictability and became unforeseeable. As brilliant as it seems, not every single aspect about this sudden transition was as successful as the twist in the narration. In the first half of the film, the focus lies on the development of some sort of friendship between Utah and Bodhi, but sadly not enough efforts were made to make it credible. I mean, the focus mostly lies on Reeves's character and Swayze is way too far in the background throughout. Of course, they played football together, he was at one of his parties and they surfed twice (on screen), but you want to tell me this enough for Utah, who is introduced as an overachieving and determined rookie who would stop at nothing, to let go of his principles and not shoot the chief suspect of his case after witnessing that he has robbed a bank? Sorry, but this amicable relationship between those two is simply underdeveloped and not convincing, as the film does not enough to create a specific chemistry between them. They just share too little screen time for me to believe it. The exact opposite happens in the second half, though, when the film establishes the rivalry between the two. To be honest, after this the character constellation is a hundred times better than before and both have the depth they sadly lacked before. Turns out they are better off as enemies than as friends and this is what creates this certain tension between them. Even though we have a clear protagonist/antagonist structure, they both are not stereotypically designed, and I felt sympathy for both in some inexplicable way. May it be the way they are both extremely suave and how they still treat each other with some sort of strange respect, there was a special bond between the two that made it fascinating throughout. Aside from this, it is also appreciable how the whole film is shot. You get a lot of long camera sequences that underline the intensity and a lot of slow-motion shots that perfectly capture the contrast of tranquillity and tempestuousness of both the waves the characters surfing on them. Also, what else could you wish for in a cinematic rush of adrenaline? As if surfing wasn't already intense enough, another centre motif of the film is skydiving. Jumping out of a moving plane hundreds of meters above in the sky? Nothing for me, but this film depicts it and that was already enough, and just as I thought it was unsurpassable, Utah jumps out of the plane without a parachute and hunts for Bodhi mid-air while getting closer to an inevitable death. After this, I exclaimed my astonishment and sat up straight. Their cat and mouse game is perfectly paced an becomes increasingly more intense, just as the adrenaline that rushes in their blood. The ending, where Utah finds Bodhi after all this time, at the beach in Australia, is the perfect way for the film to wrap up the relationship between their characters. Utah has achieved his personal goal to track down his biggest enemy and Bodhi gets the chance to ride the waves of the once in a lifetime storm and please his need for the best rush. While the other fulfils his role as the hero, the other highly likely loses his life by doing what he loves most and thus becomes a martyr. All in all, this early nineties classic is deservedly known as one of the most iconic crime thrillers of its decade and knows how to ride the high waves without falling off the board. While it has some minor character development issues in the beginning, that keep it from being outstanding, the second half makes up for it and proves how talented director Bigelow is, as she distances herself from mediocrity and generic filmmaking and creates something original out of its premise instead. Carried by two charismatic performances and the fascinating chemistry of Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze, this film managed to be the adrenaline rush it promised to be and never loses the viewer at once and offers enough ideas to please the audience. It is not your average undercover cop story, it rather throws you out of the moving plane and makes you appreciate it, just as the adrenaline junkies could not have imagined it better. It isn't perfect, but perfectly enjoyable and rewatchable as hell. This film manifest itself in the list of classic heist films with everything it offers. I am pleased.",Point Break
100,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,"Swayze/Reeves best action movie, one of my personal favorite 90's action films of all time",10,8 December 2019,"To me one of the best action movies of the 90's. Point Break is a 1991 action heist 100 percent pure adrenaline rush movie. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow and stars: Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves and Gary Busey. This review is only dediceted to Point Break fans and no one else. If you love the movie come read my review I am also reviewing this movie on YouTube I am going to defend it. I Love this film to death, I have a history with this film. This is going to be one of my hardest reviews I have done before. I would say the movie halped me get trough tough times in the year 2005. I am also going to defend this movie and Keanu Reeves character Johnny Utah.The movie made me in to Keanu Reeves fan I am today. Point Break is my number 1 favorite Keanu Reeves movie. Top five his best movies would be Point Break, John Wick ,The Matrix, Speed and Constantine. The Year 2005 my year become one of my worst years ,I drop out sophmore year in secondary school, quit my job, I had health problems with my weight. My mom was rushed middle of the night in the hospital. I went end of school year with this group on a tour visiting Poland for 10 days, when I come back my father was rushed in to hospital he had a surgery. By the time he was in hospital I found out this movie Point Break (1991) on VHS tape when I taped it long time ago and I kept watching it and I was entertained. And after many times watching it I become a huge fan of Keanu Reeves and Point Break become my favorite action movie of all time. Die Hard (1988), Die Hard: With a Vengeance, The Last Boy Scout, Point Break and Hard Target movies really helped me get trough hard times. Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey sucks! I hate that movie! I try many times to get it, but I couldn't, I hate it. Point Break is MILES way better than Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey that Keanu Reeves did!There was a remake of Point Break in 2015 and it sucks donkey ass! Remake is garbage with CGI and a lot of green color Picture. It can't come near this movie!The story is about a bank robbery crew name as the ""Ex-Presidents"" robbering banks during summer time. They robbed 27 banks so far in three years, they end in up 60 seconds no one gets shoot. So far they were never caught. Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) is a former Ohio State quarterback who just graduate from academy with straight A, top of his class and becomes an F.B.I. Agent who was sent in to Bank roberry devision and his assigment is to catch ""Ex-Presidents"". His new partner experienced agent and Vietnam veteran Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey) has theory that ""Ex-Presidents"" are actually surfers. So Johnny agrees to go surfing and with help from a few DNK hairs. Johnny Utah founds out Quantico Beach is were the crew ""Ex-Presidents"" are surfing. Johnny on the beach meets Tyler (Lori Petty) a tough tomboy chick who can surf like a devil and is a very reluctant mentor as well. Johnny goes undercover as a lawyer and a surfer who meets through her, Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) the charismatic leader of a gang of surfers consisting of Roach, Grommet, and Nathaniel. On the way there is a lot of heat, action, blood, chases, shootings, skydiving, football, throwing a dog and more.I love the ocean, the surfing scens, there is no CGI the ocean, the sea scens are for real. The stunts are practical they are dangerous. The sky diving is for real Swayze I think Reeves they both skydive for real I enjoy those scenes. The football scene is great executed. Utah is Chasing Bodhi and he catches him they both fly in the water great scene. The movie has tons of action. I love the fist cuffs on the end between Bodhi and Utah I love the finale. I love the fight sequence when this group of Nazi surffers attacks Johny and Bodhi comes to his rescue. I love that they both use martial arts. Patrick Swayze is excellent in martial arts. There is this great chase Johnny is chasing Ex President wearing Reagan mask leader of the gang on the gas station. Real practical action stunt effect from Keanu Reeves and his stunt double well done, (I don't see a shaky cam in the chase unlike in Furious 7 fight between Statham and Johnson). The foot chase is my favorite scene in the film. It is well executed, Reegan throws dog on Utah, but he kicks it a side that was a fake dog thank god. I love animals specially dogs so much. The fight between Utah and Reegan were actually stunt doubles fighting in the flame it was practical done you can see the camera because it shows different face of Utah.You have a great raid shootout scene in the house this guy Bunker (Chris Pedersen) pulls a 16 bullpup assault rifle and fiers at Pappas. Utah with his service SIG-Sauer pistol puts Bunker down and kills him, great shoot out scene executed. War Child (Vincent Klyn) leader of the gang uses Sentinel Arms Striker shootgun on Utah, of course Utah fires back. You have a great scene in which Utah gets attacked by a naked girl in the bathroom. Utah jumps on War Child they both fly out of the window you have great choreograph fight scene. War Child try's to stab Utah, but he knocks his knive in the lawn mower. You have a great shootout scene in the bank, an off duty cop pulls his service gun and starts shooting on a bank robbers and Swayze puls his Freedom Arms Model 83 revolver and kills him. Johnny Utah jumps out of an airborne plane with no parachute, catches Bodhi while he's skydiving down to the desert below (similar to the opening of Moonraker), and holds his own revolver on him, that scene was impossible they called have not talked on the air. The show Mythbusters actually tried this scenario out, and it was determined that it Would have been possible for Utah to catch Bodhi from the plane within the time alotted. They actually timed it and tried it, with parachutes. (They also determined that the noise from the rushing air would have made it impossible for Utah and Bodhi to hold any sort of conversation. However, this is a Hollywood action film & the longstanding tradition is to make the impossible possible onscreen.) This is fiction action film, so in movie is anything possible.Keanu Reeves's best performance as Johnny Utah he ever played his best character. Patrick Swayze is awesome as Bodhi the leader of ""Ex-Presidents"" I love that Bodhi is intellegent mastermind and he uses martial arts I love that. This is in my top 5 favorite Patrick Swayze movies I really miss the guy R.I.P. 1: Road House, 2: Steel Dawn, 3: Point Break (1991), 4: Black Dog and 5: Next of Kin. Gary Busey was excellent as Angelo Pappas I love the guy I love him. He shoot and killed 2 memebers of the gang ""Ex-Presidents"" with his revolver Charter Arms Undercover - .38 Special and he killed a gunman who held a young woman as a hostage, he shots him in the head and he save the hostage I love that. Kathryn Bigelow's best movie, she is a hot lady. James Cameron in here is an (executive producer) he is Bigelow's ex husband. Rick King helped to wrote a story with W. Peter Iliff who later wrote an excellent screenplay for the movie. Rick King directed Kickboxer 3: The Art of War (1992). There was this guy surperior by the F.B.I. FBI Director Ben Harp played by John C. McGinley who was mean to Utah and Pappas and Pappas punched him who deserve it. The script is great, I love Angelo's lines before he punches him.Point Break (1991) is one of the best action movies of all time, I am defending this movie. Johnny Utah is not the worst F.BI. agent i want listen to idiots who are mocking Keanu Reeves who played the character great. Thanks to Johnny F.B.I. found the gang cause they couldn't find anything in 3 years, he break the ring and the case, he finished Ex-Presidents forever he saved his girlfrined Lori Petty good performance from the actress. This movie is not better than Heat (1995) but deserves to be right there with Heat (1995) one of the best 90's action heist movies. It is Rated R for violence, language and brief nudity. I love the line ""I am an F.B.I Agent."", ""Respect for my elders."" I love this movie to death, it is in my top 15 favorite action movies of all time.I love Nobody Rides for Free song played by Ratt on the end of the credits. I love the beautiful song Hundreds of Tears by Sheryl Crow. The only problem I have is with Blu-ray disc release this movie needs to be remastered, we need special edition and better HD Picture quality over this years we did not got nothing. So this is my hardest review I have done before, beacuse I don't watch this movie all the time. I really miss action classic movies like Point Break (1991) nowdays they don't make em like this anymore. This movie is better than The Fast and the Furious, Drop Zone, Terminal Velocity, The Hurt Locker and Blue Steal my opinion!",Point Break
101,SafReviews,"Decent movie, ending was weird",7,12 June 2019,"This is a good movie about a group of surfers who are bank robbers, which is definitely a unique story I have to say. The plot was good and kept me intrigued throughout, along with a few action scenes, but I wish there was more in the movie. I felt like the ending could've been better, as I felt it strayed away from the main subject of the movie and It was just about saving the girl. Other than that its a good movie.",Point Break
102,stormhawk2021,Vaya con Dios,10,13 August 2019,"Action cinema designed to entertain, no doubt. But of excellent invoice! A very original script, in a fast-paced movie that departs from the usual canons of the genre.
A film that can be considered a testimony of an era, and a precursor to aesthetics and way of life based on extreme sports and activities. All seasoned with a particular philosophy of the life of some very particular bank robbers that ends up attracting the very cop played by Keanu Reeves.Kathryn Bigelow's directorial debut, James Cameron's hand shows in the action scenes. The film manages to attract the attention of the viewer at all times, and does not abuse special effects and various explosions like so many others to achieve it. It has very good moments of action, without any doubt. But the original and very well developed plot plot has enough appeal to keep our attention. Unstoppable the delirious scenes of the robberies with the band members disguised as presidents.
Good work of the entire repertoire, which would highlight the magnificent interpretation made by veteran Gary Busey of the tanned policeman in a thousand battles, and his peculiar relationship with the brilliant rookie Reeves. Patrick Swayze is perfect in a custom-made surfer guru role. And with the Red Hot Chili Peppers making extras one can imagine where the soundtrack shots go, powerful rock for addicts to strong emotions.Entertainment of the good, a small classic of action cinema. Good waves!",Point Break
103,FallenEye,A Point to Break the System.,7,20 November 2016,"Compared to the 2015 version, this Point Break is far more organic. It's also more coherent. However, in isolation, it's a bit traditional, but for its time, its approach feels a bit more fresh than usual.Keanu Reeves was just a much better looking version of what he is now... Even back then he displays the makings of the best non-actor in Hollywood, but, we still love him. Swayze was charismatic and Lori Petty with her ocean blue eyes was sexy and tough.However, I'm not certain if it was really necessary for Utah to expose himself the way he did, but I guess call of duty trumps being undercover. Also, Bodhi choosing to rob the vault too... Was he seeking a greater thrill than the one he may already be used to, or was he finally being what he's crew was praised for not being all this time, which is greedy?It very difficult not to compare this film to its 2015 remake. The story, coherence, motives (for the most part) and execution was better with this particular version. Free spirits trying to represent something greater than themselves, by opposing a system that honestly, isn't all that legit itself, however they go about it the wrong way, and a product of that system (Utah), tries his best to remedy the situation as legitimately as he can, while love of course, is thrown into the works.Point Break is a fun movie, not a classic, and a superior version to its remake. 7/10.",Point Break

105,shadowman123,When the words COOL meant something...,7,30 April 2007,"Whilst just looking up and down my local department shop DVD section I was lucky enough to stumble upon Point Break. I have never really sat down and watched it with a review eye as I would normally do so yesterday I sat down for the third time and watched it from start to finish! Point Break reminds of a time in my youth when the words cool were applied to someone who was living up to the word , this film reflects a time and place where people were growing up with not a care in the world and back then it was easy to just kick back and relax unlike in the helter-skelter world of today. Back then you were a rebel that everybody else wanted to be like with reason unlike today's gun-totting bad boy image which is not really interesting nor one feels obligated to defend. The story is really simple, a young Keauna Reeves along with the ever so funny Gary Busi to catch a group of bank robbers who dress up like the ex-presidents, however on his investigation he becomes involved with the world of surfing and learns a bit about the 90's culture. The film does a great job of starting of as a buddy-cop movie and then to a romance and then to an exploration into the world of surfing and extreme sports but at the same time not losing track of what it was made for. The stunts and action was great even by today's CGI infested standards , the script and acting was great for me the star of the show was Patrick Sawazye with his philosophical adrenaline junkie ' live life to its fullest' Bodhi. My only complaint was that we did not get to see enough of the ex-presidents in action (a longer haired,younger version of Paul Le Gros as Nixon was brilliant.) To conclude Point Break is a summer film worth checking out if you have nothing better to do , or if you just want to chill-out. You will gain nothing but you will not lose anything either , treat as a piece of nostalgia.POINT BREAK - 7.8 OUT OF 10WHY BE A SERVANT OF THE LAW WHEN YOU CAN BE ITS MASTER!",Point Break
106,monkeysgalore,"Surfing, Action, Bank Robbing, and Patrick Swayze's Mullet",10,11 April 2020,"You know those movies where there's not one realistic thing about them, but it only adds to the charm and fun of it? Where the insanity and occasional inane script choices make it that much more entertaining? Point Break is such a film. It doesn't operate on any levels of reality, unashamedly, and wears its ""movie"" status proudly, deciding instead to tell a intricate tale, which is loads of fun. Kathryn Bigelow should be proud.Point Break is pure fantasy. It jams surfing, action, love, and crime into one awesome-looking package, and presents it excitedly. Everything about it is crazy. It's about an FBI agent named Johnny Utah trying to catch surfer bank robbers. You throw realism out the window upon seeing the plot summary. I mean, Utah uses his real name undercover (because why not?), falls in love with a girl (predictably), barely hides his profession as an FBI agent, and at one point, he and the main villain know the other's true identity but still act like best buds for no reason.Keanu Reeves is at the top of his stoic, emotionless game. The only actor to ever give poor performances well, Reeves has made a living off of his visible lack of enthusiasm in his roles for years, and it's somehow charming and endearing. He's weirdly perfect as Johnny Utah (the coolest character name ever next to John McClane and Axel Foley), and gives his all in the role. Patrick Swayze is excellent as the villain, and it may be his finest performance. He plays a serious turd in this movie. He's cool in the beginning, but you just totally hate him by the end, which is the hallmark of a good villain. Gary Busey is here too, lending some class and craziness as usual.Point Break is also chock-full of great action sequences. The beach fight was cool, with Reeves and Swayze showing off their moves, and the house raid was also well-done. The car and foot chase scene that everyone talks about is stupidly entertaining and well-shot. The bank shootout and runway shootout were cool, and the plane scene was legit. The final fight was intense and brutal, and very memorable. You know those movie moments where it's totally unrealistic, but it's just awesome and you just smile while watching, regardless of how unbelievable it is? I experienced such a moment during the second skydiving scene. Awesome.Definitely watch this 90s action classic. It has all the slow-mo, intense gunpoint scenes, bloody squibs, and fist fights you could ask for.Also, this movie is not gay. I hate it when people always try to over analyze every male relationship looking for gay subtext. Every decision Keanu made with Bodhi's life was out of friendship and respect. It's not gay. Stop it. Go watch Brokeback Mountain (2005) and shut up.",Point Break
107,heisenberg12,One of the Most Underrated Movies of All-Time and An Action-Classic,10,19 December 2019,"I love this movie. Every time I revisit it, it reminds me of why it's one of my top 3-5 favorite movies of all-time. It is nonstop entertainment with an abundance of twists and turns at every corner. But it's not mindless entertainment like most action films are. In Point Break (1991), everything makes sense, and therefore it is realistic. The actors all deliver outstanding performances, especially considering that it technically is an ""action"" movie.What I was always impressed with the most, though, of this story is how it really delves into the structure of society, philosophy, the meaning of life through Bodhi's (Swayze) eyes. Call him what you will- a thief, a bank robber, an adrenaline junky, or a criminal- but the man actually speaks a lot of truth into the world. Of course, this doesn't justify his actions and criminality, but you have to give the man some credit for being able to do the best he can to live spiritually true to himself and bring some others along for the ride into his street-wise reality.Bodhi speaks truth so well, that even Keanu Reeves' Johnny Utah FBI agent can't resist it. You see, Johnny really wanted to be a pro football player, so whatever he is currently doing was not his top choice in life, not by a long shot. So Bodhi's free-spirited and fun-living lifestyle wins him over. This is because Bodhi has a gift for reading people and figuring them out, as well as a way to make friends with them that is realistic and irresistible (I mean who doesn't love a nighttime game of tackle football on the beach beside the ocean with heavy metal blasting from the cars, whose headlights help them see when they are young?) Bodhi is so cultured and diversified in his interests that he is able to identify Reeves' Johnny as a former star Quarterback for (I think) Ohio State, who blew his knee out, which hindered his NFL career. But Bodhi doesn't know what Johnny did next and buys his career change into law school as a lawyer, at least as first.So this dynamic sets the stage of these two becoming friends while each is suspicious of the other, which creates a constant and almost perfect tension throughout the entire runtime. It's constantly entertaining how Bodhi keeps drawing Utah closer to his fun, party, surfing lifestyle, teaching him about the spiritual side of surfing and life, while you can see Utah questioning his real career change, which was law enforcement. This is realistic based on Johnny's personality as a big college athlete who is being seduced by the beauty of the west coast and its' beaches and women. So many scenes consequently develop from this which are a thrill to watch.Perhaps the biggest scene is the climax when Swayze's Bodhi finds out Johnny's true new career, but only because Utah catches them in the midst of a heist and chases them for miles through the streets and backyards of downtown Los Angeles. It's an extended sequence, as Bodhi has just the answer, kidnapping Johnny's love interest (his ex, who introduced them) as ""insurance"" and then coerces Johnny to come on a ride along on their next bank heist, where everyone gets a Presidents' mask except for Utah, leaving him exposed and seemingly a willing participant in the actual robbery as they force him to go in and stand guard. From there, a memorable and awesome action sequence ensues, which ends with an adrenaline-filled skydiving scene.The ending is one of my favorite endings of a movie ever. It is just awesome because it stays true to the original spiritual tone the movie introduces, while being adventurous, unpredictable, and action packed. And the way it closes with Utah literally throwing his badge away now that this case is finally complete (knowing he is going to commit to surfing and living spiritually the rest of his life) is just awesome, in my opinion.Bodhi is a great character. This is my favorite Patrick Swayze role ever. Not only is he a charismatic, intelligent leader, who is cool and real, but he literally lives by a set of rules throughout his criminal enterprise- rules that actually make him honorable and respectable (but when things go south, he has to break one of them only because his friend gets shot during a robbery). When he finally breaks one, only then do you actually see him as a ""bad guy"", which he definitely is.This is just a great movie. 7.3 is way too low of a score for this, especially considering some of the movies rated 8 or above in the top 250. I can see some criticism since there are some corny scenes sprinkled in here and there and nitpickers might criticize something along the lines of how Utah didn't know or what he did when he found out, but anything his possible- he was a rookie agent after all. This is an easy 9/10 for me, an ultimate ""classic"" that you can watch a hundred times and it never gets boring. So many great, memorable lines stand out all the way through from beginning to end. It should be at least a 7.5, probably a 7.7 on here, even with the large, diversified audience rating it.9.5/10",Point Break

109,honorhorror,"Johnny Utah, the most despicable villain of all time.",5,18 January 2010,"For the first 10 minutes I thought it's gonna be like John Woo's The Killer mixed with Lethal Weapon. Later, Keanu Reeves' painful performance really made me wonder what the crap were all the makers thinking when they made this. Half way through the movie I thought maybe this movie's about sociopath robbers going down, and then again Keanu's Johnny Utah made every character in the movie more lovable including all the villains. So maybe somebody can tell me if this movie really is an action flick or a blatant comedy.Simply put, there's not a single scene with Keanu that didn't blow. All the compliments the other characters spewed on him are like praising a squirrel that it's got Kim Basinger's body and Mona Lisa's smile. His expressions and reactions to all the people alike really made me want to punch the hairspray off his head. Do I have to mention what a bad cop Johnny Utah is? So he was undercover, and he got into this magical friendship and romance with the wrong people without any character development. Remember, it's ""magical"" because everyone's naturally charmed by him no matter what, a bit like Beth in the Twillight series... So as the story goes on and on, he further dragged us the audiences into his world of miseries. But, don't worry, all you need to do is to look at his non-chute parachuting and robotic charming face. Maybe it's the problem with writing, or maybe it's Keanu's performance was so bad they had to write the whole story into a farce. Anyway, seeing Johnny Utah swearing profanities and blowing everyone around really made me realized it's not about Cops beating bad guys, neither is it about bad guys triumphing over good cops. It's a legendary portrait of the most memorable villain of all the time--Johnny Utah! Anyone found the joker in the Dark Knight frightening better go and check this fellow out. He promised to blow you away! Enough sarcastic talk. Point Break was mainly marketed as an action flick with extreme sports as a sub-plot. What dragged its legs are Keanu, the lame conflict development and character study. The late Patrick Swayze really showed much potential in the character of Bhodi. He definitely could have been a very complicated character that made audiences' heart bleed for him, except he didn't. The tensions built around several core threads and characters also were found effect-less. For instance, how many of you believed Bodhi would really gut his girl? Good, now hands down and send a thanks letter to the director(who's really famous by now). However, if you aim for muscles, nudists, idiots with muscles etc, Point Break is for you.P.S. The scene in which Keanu shot in the sky while letting Swayze go wasn't so touching as referred in ""Hot Fuzz"". One can definitely attribute that to special agent Johnny Utah's incompetency.5/10. See it for trivial reasons instead for actions.",Point Break
110,arthurclay,A Cool Cops and Robbers Flick,10,20 August 2005,"Even my dad enjoys this film. Keanu Reeves showed American audiences that he could actually act when he starred in Point Break. Patrick Swayze provides a great supporting role and the necessary skills to made it look respectable. Gary Busey steals the show as usual and provides a lot of humor to what would be otherwise a deadly serious dramatic affair. Here's the plot. A gang of bank robbers known as the Ex-Presidents are the best in L.A. They are in and out in 60 seconds and nobody gets killed. They've never been caught in 26 robberies. But they are about to be given a wake up call by rookie FBI Agent Johnny Utah and his partner Angelo Pappas, who have come up with a plan to figure out who they are and infiltrate them. This movie is filled with action and witty banter amongst the actors which can't help but entertain you the entire time. And the ending doesn't let you down.

111,Brucey_D,"""..this (surfing) is for little rubber people that don't shave yet..."" "" ...big wave riding is for macho jerks with a death wish...""",9,26 February 2018,"Bigelow's Point Break is about a young and inexperienced FBI agent's efforts to apprehend a masked gang of L.A. bank robbers known as 'the ex-presidents'. There are clues that the gang are surfers, and Special Agent Utah has to infiltrate the subculture to break the case. En route he finds surfing, finds love, finds himself, and then loses almost everything.On the face of it, it is just another action movie, to be compared in the same breath as Speed or the Fast and Furious movies (one of which recycles much of the plot of Point Break). However it is a far better movie than those.One of the main things that sets this movie apart is that it is better written, better directed, better photographed, and just better made than most action movies are. The soundtrack is cracking too, well paced and sparingly used, adding the right mood to the textures of the film.However one of the things that differentiates this film from most other action movies is that it attempts to explain that some folk who indulge in certain sports are not just mindless escapist adrenaline junkies, but that such visceral pleasures may underpin their whole way of life, and (rightly or wrongly) there may be a whole philosophy that goes along with it. The momentary absolution of that perfect turn, that perfect wave, it can change your life for ever.I don't think that Reeves is an especially brilliant actor, but here he is well-suited to the role; whilst Utah appears to set out with purpose, he is but clay that is moulded by circumstance and those around him, from the jaded Pappas on the one hand to the charismatic Bohdi on the other, who is excellently portrayed here by Swayze, with real fire in his eyes.When I first sat down to watch this film it was with low-ish expectations; I was more than pleasantly surprised to find a much better film than I had expected, and it is one that I have watched several times since.",Point Break

The casting is good too. Problems are the plot and story. I just do not understand it at all. Also suspecting the crooks were surfers because of wax? Okay, whatever. One other good thing here is an intense foot chase. The foot chase was very well done and contains high amounts of energy. The acting was okay, nothing special.

115,Benjamin_Cox,Still watchable but not exactly a classic - 67%,6,22 November 2006,"Before he made trench coats cool again in ""The Matrix"", Keanu Reeves had made the early Nineties surfer dude something of a trademark of his. Given that he was primarily known as being the tall one from ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"", it must have been a tough decision to graduate from teen comedy to adult action thriller. However, instead of proving to be his finest hour, Reeves buries the memory of the time-travelling twosome by introducing the world to what he is now primarily known as - Robot Reeves. Having said that, this wasn't quite as dated as I'd expected.Reeves plays the unlikely-named Johnny Utah, a clean-cut FBI agent assigned to southern California to investigate a bunch of professional bank robbers called the Ex-Presidents. Teaming up with FBI veteran Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey), they believe the robbers are actually surfers and Johnny goes undercover in order to infiltrate the community. Before long, he meets Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) who seems prepared to go to any lengths in order to secure the ultimate high. Is Bodhi really all that he seems and can Utah and Pappas crack the case without breaking Utah's cover? With one fell swoop, Keanu goes from goofy teen to stoic adult and destroys any hint of emotion on his face. He is astonishingly wooden, especially next to Swayze who seems to be having the time of his life. Reeves also maintains his track record of saying ""Whoa"" in every movie he's ever been in. To be frank, if Reeves were a better actor then ""Point Break"" might have actually been a much better movie instead of just a good one. It certainly looks fantastic. The surfing and sky-diving scenes are something special, even if there are times when credibility is stretched to the limit. The supporting cast are also admirable with able turns from Lori Petty as the love interest and John C McGinley as their irritable boss. But Swayze runs off with the picture, although his hippy-surfer character feels as solid a cliché as you can imagine. Come to think of it, there is nothing about this movie which strikes me as being original or wildly imaginative. If ever a film was a product of its time then surely this is it.Like I said at the start, I was expecting this movie to be horribly dated and full of sub-""Wayne's World"" dialogue but in actual fact, this remains a pretty watchable film. The emotionless slab that is Reeves is forgotten as you're lost in a literal sea of adventure, adrenaline (the sky-diving scenes are vertigo-inducing, at times) and action. It's not the best film but it's fun to watch in a switch-your-brain-off-dude way. It's also good to see perma-baddie Busey play a good guy for once. So in short, it's nowt special but a pleasant enough way to waste some time.",Point Break

117,Mikew3001,"Great ""new age"" action thriller",9,7 January 2003,"Katheryn Bigelow's 1991 action thriller ""Point Break"" is still a ground-breaking film of the early nineties. It tells the story of the cop John Utah (Keanu Reaves) hunting a bunch of bank robbers camouflaged with masks of the former U.S. presidents. His investigations leads to a group of surfers and extreme sports worshippers, and the cop becomes fascinated by the free-style philosophies and adrenaline rushes of the gang around the charismatic leader Bodhi (Patrick Swayze). Their close friendship changes to a hard-fought rivalry at the end when cop and gangsters face point blank.Bigelow uses typically American surf beach settings for this unusual and very stylish action thriller with great stunts like parachuting scenes, bank robberies, a car chase, police raids, martial arts, breath-taking chases and brilliantly photographed surf sequences. Watch out for the Red Hot Chillie Peppers as a gang of brutal surf nazis beating up Keanu Reeves and being captured by him during a hard-fought police raid.But ""Point Break"" is even more than that - it also shows the lifestyle of the nineties in many ways. Bodie and his gang are a group of New Age-like grunge guys reaching out for the most extreme adrenaline experiences. They stand for the new style of extreme/fun sport worshippers, ravers and new spiritualists of the post-yuppie era in the nineties who don't care about wealth and status symbols but for fun, action, breaking the limits and finding the sum of all senses.

They come out after July 4 in the heat of late July and early August allowing movie audiences to retreat from the scorching heat for some cool entertainment in the movie auditoriumKeanu Reeves is Special Agent Johnny Utah who just graduated from Quantico and finds his first assignment in the FBI Los Angeles Office, Bank Robbery Division. His partner is Angelo Pappas, played by Gary Busey.Their first assignment is to find the ex-Presidents. They wear masks of Ronald Reagan, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, and Jimmy Carter and only go for the cash in the drawers instead of going for the vault.Pappas has the idea that the ex-Presidents are surfers, based on a scrap of forensic evidence once left at a scene. Since Utah is the young one, he poses as a surfer in order to go undercover and hopefully infiltrate the group.Utah makes a few friends during his undercover operation. One of which being Bohdi, played by Patrick Swayze. He and his group of new-age surfers take Johnny to the edge. This goes even farther when they go skydiving for an afternoon. Once Johnny's one lead finds a dead end, he realizes Bohdi is the mastermind of the ex-Presidents. Enter the dilemma. They have formed a friendship. Utah develops a conflict: go after Bohdi, or let him go.At the outset, action films are rarely cinematic masterpieces. They rely much more on stunts, crashes, explosions, and sex. But what more do you want in an action movie?Goldfinger, Die Hard, Lethal Weapon were anomalies, because they give an audience character depth, interesting villains, and good plots. However, Point Break gives us Reeves, Swayze, and Busey who are decent and charismatic action stars, but have no real acting ability.Also, action movies love the break laws. The most glaring one are two very long falling sequences in skydiving scenes. If they really fell that long, they would have needed oxygen tanks. Moreover, in both scenes, the characters talk to each other which is almost impossible.Even more troubling is the lapse of logic towards the end. Utah does participate in a bank robbery while undercover, and an off-duty police officer and security guard are killed. Somehow, he still has his job in the end.Still, these characters, mixed with well-paced action sequences, cool stunts, slick photography, sex, and a decent story, Point Break works.

126,Kashmirgrey,Another Guilty Pleasure!,8,22 September 2007,"I know that I should not enjoy ""Point Break"" as much as I do. I know that the plot is ridiculous, the characters are hollow and that no one can surf a Tsunami, but I just can't help it. I love this film.Maybe it is because the film appeals to me on a basic masculine level. I've never considered myself much of a macho man, but something about ""Pure adrenalin, right?! The ultimate rush. Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump,"" as described to Keanu Reeves by Patrick Swayze just prior to a ""most awesome"" skydiving scene.Johnny Utah (Reeves) is a rookie FBI agent straight out of the academy who has been assigned to the Los Angeles Bank Robbery Unit, partnered up with seasoned and feisty Special Agent Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey). Together, the two investigate a series of bank robberies which leads them on the trail of a group of surfers led by a spiritual guru named Bohdi (Swayze). Before long, Utah becomes entranced by Bohdi's carefree philosophies and begins to question what team he is actually playing for. He also falls for the hardened beach babe, Tyler (Lori Petty) who becomes Utah's surfing instructor.From amazing surfing and skydiving visuals to outrageous foot chases, this film is all action. It might lack 100% realism, but it packs a very exciting, stiff punch!",Point Break
127,darin-wissbaum,2 bad actors make a bad movie...,3,20 October 2009,This was not a bad idea for a film and could have been really interesting. The problem was the actors that were used. Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze have been in some really bad films with the acting as sub-par. Put them both in the same film together and you get a film that is twice as bad as the ones they did by themselves. So anyway what do we have here? A bunch of surfers who rob banks during the day and hang out at the beach and surf on their free time. Keanu Reeves plays some cop that goes undercover to catch these guys and becomes a surfer himself. Pretty much a predictable film with the kind of action you would expect. Do the surfers get caught? Does Reeves and Swayze become friends? Does Reeves doubt he can still be a cop at the end? Does Swayze die at the end trying to surf a huge wave? Are there stars in the sky? You get my point here. But I will say it was fun to see how two bad actors worked together.,Point Break
128,AbhiMathews,The Tides Have Turned,5,7 December 2014,"You don't ever know what you truly have until it's taken away from you. It hits hard, especially when it occurs rather abruptly. Point Break certainly revolves around this central theme and how life is the totality of the individual moments that compose it. This film is certainly enjoyable. Whether it's Keanu Reeves with his moving dialogue or simply the iconic bank heist scenes; there's rarely a dull moment. From the chases to thrill-seeking adventures, this movie is high tempo and cycles through a myriad of emotions (although not very deeply). Beyond the pure entertainment value, there isn't much going on. The acting is subpar at best and the plot is fairly weak. Nonetheless, if you're looking to enjoy yourself, Point Break is a solid option.",Point Break
129,shawnmikedryer,Grade A 90's,10,12 July 2021,"💢My Thoughts💢Thirty years later and this film still holds up and the excitement it brought back then has not faded. The standard FBI banter leads to a new agent going undercover to infiltrate a gang of bank robbers wearing the iconic dead presidents masks, my favorite is obviously Nixon, "" I am not a crook! "" Keanu Reeves is serviceable as Johnny Utah but had not yet reached prime Keanu. Patrick Swayze is nothing short of magnificent, juggles two persona's, one being the carefree sort of philosophical surfer and the other being the ruthless leader of the group of deranged bank robbers. The moments where this philosophy is further explained gives the criminals authenticity, they are not your average bad guys. Swayze comes with that fiery intensity the whole way just further proves his greatness. Lori Petty is fantastic in her supporting role but wished she was utilized a little more. The beauty of this film is the unique twist forcing Utah's character back "" Undercover "" once his cover is blown, the added equivocation makes this much more interesting than your average action flick where the lines between good and bad are much clearly from the onset. This makes for an exciting ride and truly one of the greatest movies that came from the 90's.",Point Break
130,lakishaferguson21,Exciting watch,7,22 August 2019,"As a 90s kid I've always been aware of this flick but never watched, until it showed up on Hulu. Glad I finally watched because it was definitely entertaining. Loved seeing Patrick amd Keanu in one of their most famous roles. I enjoyed the play on undercover agent infiltrating a subculture not to often heard from. It's not Broadway nor is it MARVEL superheroes, but it's quality entertainment worth watching more than once.
On another note, it was AWESOME seeing the lead singer of one of my all time favorite bands in this; even though he does something quite hilarious!",Point Break
131,hhfarm-1,"Weak story, plot; Lori Petty even worse than usual",4,24 May 2007,"This is one of those movies that would have you believe that surfing is a mystical endeavor, allowing one to heighten awareness and become closer to if not one with the godhead nature. Instead of the leisure sport of ski bums w/ surfboards don't work and hang at the beach. Which is cool, but that doesn't make it some ethereal vision-quest.Lori Petty can always be counted on to irritate without doing any acting and this is no exception. I think she wants to be feisty, scrappy, empowering - those things. She's done much TV and it shows: she releases her emotions by staring at the camera. She has 3 modes: self-righteous indignation when she's wronged; self-righteous indignation when someone else is wronged; self-righteous indignation with a little girl voice when she's willing to have sex. All by herself she managed to ruin ""League of their own"". Here, could there have been worse choice for a love interest?The real shame is the plot & script. Kathryn Bigelow is way better than this: K19, Near Dark, Strange Days - all brilliant. But she was involved w/ schlock-/ fluff-meister Cameron then and he wrote the script.Overall this was intended to be a heart-pounding, blood-rushing, edge-o-ur-seat action fest. This is accomplished by having Reeves jump out of a plane without a parachute and catch up to the bad guy. Where they macho-talk about who will pull the ripcord until they're just a few-hundred feet over the ground. They survive of course.It's about surfer bank robbers. FBI agent Busey has figured this out and says ""They're surfers. Look at the evidence: they rob in summer only.""The robbers are meticulous and perfect in execution, except for the last job where the leader changes the plan without telling the rest of the gang and of course this allows them to be shot/ caught.But it doesn't even end there: There's the no-parachute scene about; then Reeves tracks his man all over; then there's a confrontation where he lets him go to die in some big weather.",Point Break

Sign me up. While it might sound like a macho man type of movie it comes from a very gifted female director who would go on to win a well deserved Academy award (""The Hurt Locker"") later in her career.

133,tanelteder,for adrenaline lovers,10,3 January 2011,"The reason why I like this movie that much and I rate it so high is more personal than I believe most viewers see this. The movie itself is a great 90's action film. It has cops, bank robbers, sunny California, great chase scenes by car and on foot, a police operation, a love story, intense relationships, some truly inspiring scenes etc. It's awesome stuff.Keanu Reeves (Johnny Utah) was young and fearless. A great performance by him. Patrick Swayze (Bodhi) rocked the beginning of 90's. This is by far his greatest performance. What an attitude to show the soul of the real searcher.Watching this movie makes me relieved. Surfing is one the most greatest activities there is. I wish I could live near the Pacific in California and surf like the dudes in Point Break. This is a totally free spirit movie. And it's for adrenaline lovers. Take a look at the sky diving scene. Incredible.",Point Break

After they find out their infiltrator is an FBI agent, the crew takes him on a sky diving trip for absolutely no reason. Then, said FBI agent follows them on a robbery and takes part in it after being asked nicely with a few motivational lines. Need I say more? This movie should have been a cartoon.

I am so glad I did because it was a fun ride. I thought the cinematography was awesome and while the storyline was a bit silly, it was still really real in certain ways. Anyone who has met a person like Bodhi in their lives knows that you can find yourself following them into the depths of hell despite your better thoughts. Watching this made me realize the loss of Patrick Swayze is still very painful because he really was a special actor. He could play characters that can be completely cheesy and pull it off to where you are rooting for him. I found myself getting choked up several times just because he was so healthy in this movie and in less than 20 years would be gone. Keeanu was likeable and believable playing an agent who gets torn between doing his job and falling into a life where the excitement takes over.Overall a really good action film that I would definitely watch again. Once again, the cinematography was excellent.",Point Break

He sells it well. He looks smart yet capable and handy. ""Young, dumb and full of cum"" would be another way to put it LOL! Great dialogue in this movie. Almost every line delivered by Swayze is quotable. You know the movie's good when that's the case;) On a more serious note, this is a tale of risks and the duality of man, executed in a pretty original way.",Point Break
139,cwbellor,Point Break is the source! It'll change your life ...swear to God!,10,16 July 2012,"Do you want the ultimate? Prove it! Jump out of a plane without a parachute! Pick a fight with a guy named War Child! Punch an angry dog in the face! Talk back to Gary Busey! What's that? Don't feel like it? Then you can't hang with Keanu, much less hang loose with Bodhi Swayze. It's true that Johnny ""Keanu"" Utah may be ""young, dumb and full o' cum,"" but ask the other characters in the film and they will tell you that he's much more complex than that. He's got the ""kamikaze look"" and if you mess with him while he's taking a post-surf shower, he won't back down an inch ...and that is very rare in this world! And if you're a lawn mower, don't even bother trying to stare him down! You'll lose! But Johnny Utah is nothing compared to Patrick Swayze's Bodhi. Bodhi is a man of mystery. His past is as bleached as his hair, which means you don't know much about his past, except that he used to ride a Chevy that looked like a surf board. Point Break is NOT a movie! Point Break is a state of mind. It's where you lose yourself and you find yourself. RIP Patrick Swayze!

140,ty-jensen,Action classic!,8,16 June 2021,"Point Break is a cult film which appealed to extreme sports users, spawned a live theater show and a remake which was released on Christmas Day 2015. I'm not sure how I first heard of Point Break, it doesn't matter. I blind bought the DVD back in 2010, Point Break is a fun action movie.The acting is mostly good. I'm sure lots of people bashed Keanu Reeves, I thought he was fine. Reeves naturally got better with age and his voice deepened over time. He and Patrick Swayze had good chemistry which was crucial since their characters are fast friends. Bodhi is complex, he isn't a generic villain. I'm sure some fans feel Johnny is a generic hero.Point Break is cheesy, you're not supposed to take it seriously. The humor is subtle like in real life, Johnny's partner Pappas is the comic relief. I was only a toddler in the early 90s but I think the film reflects the time.The action scenes are fun, they're grounded which may sound weird. The foot chase was unique since it made the audience feel part of it. The film has two skydiving sequences helping it stand out.Overall, Point Break is a fun, cheesy action movie. It's story driven so you have to be patient. Point Break is rated R, it's more hardcore than Speed. Reeves and Swayze had good chemistry like how Paul Walker and Vin Diesel had good chemistry. If you like the leads, you should see Point Break at least once.",Point Break

Busey and Reeves are both a bit goofy, but the lovable actors play their roles well. Reeves is the perfect actor to play undercover FBI agent Johnny Utah and channels his Bill and Ted 'dude' energy into the part. The ex-presidents are also an iconic group of bank robbers that make the villains instant classics and easily recognizable.

Keanu Reeves' acting is a bit uneven, often good, but other times cheesy and laughable. Patrick Swayze in particular was perfectly cast, he really inhabits the role of the legendary Bodhi, god rest his soul.But the movie does have a touch of depth to it: There are themes of brotherhood, bonds between men, the romance of masculinity, a bit like Fight Club. It's kind of homo-erotic to be honest, with all the lingering shots of tight, toned, tanned male bodies frolicking in the ocean, but there ain't nothing' wrong with that.The movie also touches on the symbolism of the ocean, the unfathomable mysteries of the spirit, the conflict between mind and body, between order and chaos, parallels the conflict between the police and the surfers.So, if you are thinking of watching this movie, it's good enough, give it a shot.",Point Break

Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves are in one of the best, explosive action-packed thrill ride movies of all time. The relationship between a hot-headed FBI agent and a cool-calculated part-time bank robber full-time surfer is just dope! This is fun for all the fans of the action genre. It's got to be in one of the 1000 movies ""before you die book"", it really is that much of a dope movie.This movie is rememberable at it's finest. It gives Heat (1995) a run for it's money. Johnny Utah and Bodhi are friends like no other even the best of buds Charles Xavier/Professor X and Erik Lensherr/Magneto are compelled, and these two hotheads don't even have powers. Director Kathryn Bigelow creates not only fun and enjoyment in a violent movie, but she isn't afraid to dive deep into human relationship between good and evil, and people's perspectives on life itself; what is right and what is wrong! And how to just ride it out in amongst everything, living life to it's fullest.Point Break (1991) might be old-school, but it stays as an all-round classic in this generation of movies.10/10.Totally stupidliciously awesome dude!",Point Break

Sure, watching Keanu Reeves try to act is about as painful as sticking your hand into a blender, but there's plenty of action and surfing to keep you entertained. Of course, you'll need quite a bit of suspension-of-disbelief when it comes to the end of the movie, which has one of the most ridiculous stunts I've ever seen (made Charlie's Angels and XXX look realistic, for Christ's sakes). But ah, waddaya gonna do? As long as there's bullets, bloodspray, and awesome robber masks, who cares, right? I was entertained.

147,Vishal_s_kumar,You are now in the bank robbery capital of the world.,8,16 August 2009,"This is a film I've seen many times and I don't remember ever seeing it quite like I did today. For the most part, my memory of the film, prior to today's screening, recalled the film's basic plot outline but failed to recall the nitty gritty details that make Point Break a superb action flick. I don't ask much more of my action movies other than they be thrilling, engaging, and entertaining, and Point Break offers all three of these attributes in heavy doses. Upon first glance and on the surface, this is a conventional action movie that manages to raise itself above the norm thanks to fantastic direction from Kathryn Bigelow, incredible stunts, solid performances from a set of A-list actors (both then and now), and several plot twists, all of which add up to make Point Break one of the better action movies of the 1990s.Keanu Reeves portrays Johnny Utah, a rookie FBI agent fresh out of Quantico who is eager to please and get his feet wet. He is paired with a veteran agent with an attitude, Pappas (Gary Busey), and is immediately put on the case of a string of high-profile bank robberies committed by a quartet of men dubbed ""The Ex-Presidents,"" so named for the masks they wear as they commit their crimes (we see Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon Johnson). Pappas suspects the criminals are surfers based not only on tan lines seen in surveillance camera footage but also on the fact that the robberies only occur in the summer months, leading him to believe that the robberies are connected to the procurement of monies to fund winter surfing expeditions elsewhere in the world. With only one month left before they suspect the string of robberies will conclude until the following summer, Utah goes undercover into the world of surfing and meets Tyler (Lori Petty), a girl whom Utah convinces to help him learn to surf after she saves him from a near-death experience on the waves. Once deeper into this world, Utah, through Tyler, meets Bodhi, a world-class adrenaline junkie who accepts Utah into his gang. Utah's loyalties, ambitions, and emotions will be tested as he finds himself deeper and more involved in this seemingly innocent corner of the world where not everything, or everyone, is as it appears.There's quite a bit to like about Point Break for action/adrenaline film enthusiasts. Keanu Reeves, before he was Jack or Neo, was Johnny Utah in Point Break, a role which put him on the map of action stars and paved the way for him to star in the biggest hits of his career. For as much flack as he gets, he's simply perfect in this role; his persona and demeanor are without equal for the Utah character, and he brings to the role a fantastic screen presence and chemistry with his co-stars, notably Patrick Swayze, also in one of his better roles, but this is not necessarily one of his better performances. Both actors are a natural fit for the film; everything from their appearances to their mannerisms and to their grasp of the underlying tones and conflicts of the story, not to mention their fantastic ability to put on a great show during the various action sequences, help set Point Break apart from other, lesser, dime-a-dozen action vehicles. Also appearing are several actors of note, including John C. McGinley and Tom Sizemore in a cameo appearance.Of course, director Kathryn Bigelow's fantastic direction, eye for action, and keen sense of how to effectively weave a first-rate story is the foundation upon which Point Break is built. Bigelow does a fantastic job in creating a tense, exciting action movie. She knows how to handle the various surprises the movie throws at the audience with unflinching authority, conveying every emotion and twist with almost unparalleled ease and grace, all the while maintaining the tense, blood-and-guts, gritty feel of the movie. Point Break reveals its secrets far earlier than most action movies do, both to the audience and to the characters, and this is perhaps the best aspect of the film. It dares to be different in many regards, this being the most engaging example. It breaks formulas and conventions without isolating itself or pretending to be anything but a slick, well-paced, exciting action flick. All of this combined with its first-rate stunts and sequences (including two fantastic skydiving sequences, the first of which is easily the best sequence in the film thanks not only to its fantastic visuals but also due to the perfect placement of the exciting yet laid back music that accompanies it), Point Break is an action movie lover's delight.",Point Break
148,TheLegendOfThe42,What a stylish and dynamic ride!,8,14 June 2019,"I really like Keanu Reeves. But boy, does Patrick Swayze steal the show. In what is maybe the most charismatic role of his career, he makes Keanu develop a serious man-crush on him, and we can all understand why Keanu couldn't do what he was about to do in one of the most iconic scenes of the film.If only we had more directors like Kathryn Bigelow. This woman showed more balls in this one movie than most male directors will ever have in a lifetime. The shots are bold, dynamic; the directing is intense and energetic - I fell in love with this film and Kathryn Bigelow the moment I saw the first shots.If you haven't already - please go watch this movie. It has aged very well - in fact, I feel like it hasn't lost any of its power, which in my book is a sign for an outstanding achievement.

149,The Gryphon,Great action scenes and mind games to boot,8,14 August 2010,"Kinda slow and stodgy at the start-up, where character development is needed, and there is some action involving a bank robbery by 4 people wearing ex-presidents mask, but overall, despite the surfing theme, it's a pretty good movie...even if you don't surf. Keanu Reeves is the young hotshot FBI agent fresh from Quantico, resented by most old timers who have long since given up on actually solving a crime - realizing the paperwork is the scariest thing about their jobs, not the criminals. Gary Busey plays a character saddled with the young FBI agent, and who is really aggravated by the pup's aggressive idealism...at first, but then, like all good buddy movies, they form a bond. Keanu goes undercover by getting a lead that the string of bank robberies has something to do with surfing, so he learns to surf in a really short montage. From there, there's one fantastic foot chase when the FBI agent sees one of the ""ex-presidents"" still wearing his mask, fresh from a bank robbery nearby. The foot chase is worth the price of admission by itself. It's really that good. Good Steadicam work, too. Next comes a strange bond the FBI agent forms with the leader of a surfing tribe of 4, with everyone in on every little secret the other person has and yet no one can reveal their hand next. Then comes the parachute scenes. One of them tops the foot chase scene as the FBI agent jumps out of a perfectly good plane with nothing but a hope and a prayer (and a handgun) continuing his chase of the head of the ex-presidents. Reeves, Busey and Patrick Swayze are excellent in their roles. Oscar Winner Kathryn Bigelow directed this winner and her then husband, James Cameron produced it. Watch it just for the scene where the dog is thrown on someone if for nothing else.",Point Break

Everything just works in this movie as a whole.Swayze and Reeves performances were a lot better than usual in this movie as neither actor in my opinion has much acting ability. I would say Swayze accomplished this mission better than Reeves. Gary Busey was good as always. Lori Petty was excellent as always.Loved the foot chase scene, skydiving scene, the failed bust scene, Nixon impersonations, and the basic plot. Hendrix song ""If 6 was 9"" was a nice feature.

152,phantopp,Could've been better,4,8 August 2009,"Rookie FBI agent, ""Johnny Utah"" (Keanu Reeves) has been assigned to the Los Angeles in to the Bank Robbery Division fresh out of training. He is a bit gung-ho, and is partnered up with a veteran (Gary Busey) who is fairly similar to him.""Agent Angelo Pappas"" (Busey) has been hunting a gang of professional bank robbers, each wearing a mask in the resemblance of former US Presidents which caused the authorities to nickname them ""The Ex-Presidents."" ""Pappas"" has a theory that the bank robbers are, in fact, surfers financing their travels in search of the best wave. However, not even the head of the division believes his theory, which is based on evidence.The two, with ""Utah"" going undercover, go to the local beaches to find possible suspects, as the robberies continue.Now, the two go in search of the bank robbers to bring them to justice.Let me say first, this is not the best movie I've seen as of late. There are more problems with this movie than entertainment.First of all, the acting is uneven. Although certain people have chemistry when together, their performances as a whole lack. I did not like the chemistry between Reeves and Lori Petty, who portrayed ""Utah's"" love interest while undercover. The biggest problem with their on-screen relationship is that Petty is not on screen enough. You feel nothing when something happens to her which gives a predictable twist in the plot. You couldn't even feel the emotion from Reeves.Reeves is easily one of the worst performances. His delivery of his lines was very uneven, especially near the start of the film. If you listen carefully, he brings back his ""Bill and Ted"" voice in a brief moment in one scene which, if you notice it, gives the audience a chuckle. On the other hand, Swayze, who plays the lead robber, had a better performance. However, if you ask me, Swayze was not really into the script, and his performance showed that.As for the script itself. It's not very good at all. I was not impressed with the dialogue, nor a good chunk of the scenes. There were some good action scenes, with one fantastic foot chase through the streets, and at least one private residence, that had some real good editing, which was also uneven.Then there are the surf scenes. These were horribly produced. None of them were exciting or edited in a way that made you want to watch the scenes. I wasn't even impressed with the music laid over these shots.The soundtrack was completely forgettable. I can't even name one song that was in this movie. In fact, if I happen to hear the soundtrack in passing, I wouldn't recognize it as this movie's soundtrack.The director did a horrible job putting this movie together. Poor script, uneven performances, big plot holes. I can only recommend that, if there is nothing better to do, check this movie out on HBO.",Point Break

154,j_graves68,Nobody puts Bodhi in a corner !,6,16 January 2006,"Ever watch a movie that you know is just so campy and dated- where the dialogue makes you scratch your head a few times every couple of lines-where the premise is so ridiculous that you look at it anyway to see how dumb it'll get? Well, that's what ""Point Break"" is. And it takes itself quite seriously at that. A 1991 summer lackluster from versatile director Kathryn Bigelow (""Strange Days"", ""K-19"") that could of fared better in the theatres if it were only released in March of that year instead. Come on- did they really think that they had a chance against Ahhh-nuld that summer with ""T-2""? Every time I watch this movie, I smirk and shake my head (and it just isn't because of Keanu Reeves' acting talent- although he's not as bad in this flick as he is in every other one). It's mainly the dialogue- words and phrases like: ""meat waffles""; ""100% pure adrenaline""; ""what's their program?""; ""like stink on sh*t""; ""I love this speed-star sh*t!""; ""I know you want me like acid in your mouth, Johnny!""; they all crack me up. This is merely a live-action cartoon with some alright surf footage (though I'd rather watch ""Riding Giants"" or ""Step Into Liquid""). The skydiving scenes were tight (remember that this was on the eve of CGI, so the stunts were real). I even dug the footchase through the alleys by the beach and through the houses. Even the Mexican stand-off at the airport was good and bloody. The climax had zero credibility and Keanu's ""Via con Dios"" line was just as fitting to the disappointing ending.Still, this movie could have been so much worse, but I don't think it could of been a whole lot better. They could of used a much prettier actress of the time like Elisabeth Shue to play Tyler, though. Keanu just looks like the prettier one between the two. Lori Petty just isn't leading woman material. She's better off as the sidekick (""A League of Their Own"")and I know that she's kicking herself for turning down Sandra Bullock's part in ""Speed"" to this day. Gary Busey provided some comic relief and made Keanu's usual stoic acting not as much, along with Patrick Swayze. Swayze pulled off a better performance than Keanu (doesn't everyone?), and it was kind of hard to fully dislike the dude. John C. McGinley, James LeGros, and Tom Sizemore (you'll never see him THAT thin again) all provide decent supporting roles.

155,Illini_Wrestling_Fan,Realistic Lighter Fluid Documentary,9,13 September 2020,"There is a lot of flash (and splash) in Kathryn Bigelow's historical study of a new way to open lighter fluid bottles for beach bonfires. The main character of the film, Rosie (played to perfection by newcomer Lee Tergeson), takes the viewer on a 100% adrenaline-fueled thrill ride of ups and downs as the advent of his lighter fluid bottle opening method starts a perilous journey of betrayal, death, and even a vhs camcorder.Rosie wanted nothing more than to impress his friends, a close-knit group of surfers-slash-bank robbers who for some reason considered him, a man who neither surfed nor robbed banks, part of their crew. One fateful night, tasked with lighting a fire for the gang on the beach, he quickly tired of the usual ""open the top"" method of opening a bottle of lighter fluid. Spying his giant knife, Rosie thought of an ingenious way to quickly get the igniting fluid onto the waiting kindling.Unfortunately Bigelow deleted a key scene where the group marveled at Rosie's method and even carried him off the beach on their adoring shoulders, yet she left in various boring subplots about the FBI and an agent's unhealthy obsession with a local meatball-sandwich establishment.When the accolades stop pouring in Rosie resorts to kidnapping and non-consensual nightgown videos, the latter a 1990s precursor to revenge porn. Knowing that an on-screen death would crush her audience, Bigelow wisely ends Rosie in FBI agent Johnny Utah's rambling triptych of how he came to find Rosie-sidekick Bodhi at Bell's Beach. In a fitting tribute to his fallen mentor Bodhi kills himself on a giant wave after learning of Rosie's death.",Point Break

The story is a bit everywhere, from robbery to young love to adrenaline-inducing scenes of police chases and extreme sports.Keanu Reeves definitely shined bright in this film, although it's a bit difficult to forget his Bill and Ted demeanor when he starts talking in his ""yeah dude"" speak. The shots of surfing waves and beauty of the earth from 10000 feet up is amazing to watch and you can't help but feel the rush that the characters also do in the film. However, I feel that Keanu's motivation is a bit blurry (maybe it was intentional) as he sways between being a good cop and being an adrenaline junkie that Patrick Swayze was about. I didn't get it. I didn't get what he wanted to do. I didn't even get why he kept on following Patrick Swayze's whims even though he finds out that they were the robbers (this part is pretty expected).But from a Keanu fan, my oh my was he beautiful (still is).",Point Break

As he does in _Speed_, Keanu struggles to project virile masculinity (perhaps in an effort to shed Bill & Ted?), managing to come off about as studly as an eight year old pretending to be the man of the house. Swayze isn't much more believable as the zenmaster/bankrobber/surfin'-guru. Add an over-wrought soundtrack, over-the-top action sequences (I fear this movie may be singlehandedly responsible for the sport of sky-surfing), and dialog straigt out of ""Nietzsche for Dummies"", and you have the makings of an evening with Joe Bob Briggs.

159,Weredegu,Californication with RHCP guest appearance,7,31 January 2007,"Keanu Reeves investigates a series of bank robberies believed to have been committed by some surfer gang. I don't want to reveal the way the plot unfolds, but I have to note the similarity with a whole series of films such as I won't say, that could constitute a spoiler itself, with the ending being perfectly the same. Of course, chronology is important, and so this movie here, I think, is the origin of the scheme. If I'm not aware of some other movie, stemming from the same concept, that preceded this one, forgive me for my lack of knowledge and feel obliged to point it out in a comment. But if this indeed is the original, it has to be seen not only because of that, but because of the better acting, the better action sequences and the smarter plot  smarter at least by the standards that have secondary importance here compared to what the story wants to deliver to its target audiences. Which is: providing some adrenaline-surfing to those living on it as well as to those starving for it. With regards to the latter, meanly put, this is real surfers out there for net-surfers, for people who will try to visually import adventure to make up for a lack of manliness in the 'mainstream' male life-form of nowadays. For them this film might be medicine.You don't have to switch off your brain as much as in the case of the successor clones (again, not to be named), but the point is definitely not to stimulate thoughts surpassing a rather simple state of mind in critical evaluation of our basic instincts.So, join the fight club and identi-fly!

It actually appears to take itself seriously, even with the absolutely cornball plot devices and horribly miscast actors. Keanu Reeves in particular looks to be all of about 17 in the show, but is playing the part of a seasoned, streetwise FBI agent.

162,xenazues,Your typical 90's xtreme version of sports,8,3 February 2017,"Surfing has been around for a long time. I remember growing up the girl gidget always had a surf board and that was like 60's or something. I grew up in late 80's but back then they showed all the reruns from gidget, batman and giligans island. But when this movie hit the movies waves, not everybody was familiar with the west coast and surfing. Especially where I grew up at, the midwest. Movies like this Point of no Return and Airbourne made the west coast seem like it was the place to be. Waves hitting, ocean. Parties all the time, no sleep just pure fun like 20 years olds where suppose to have.This is no exception. In this movie you get Anthony keidis (sp) the leader singer of the red hot chilli peppers. You also have a lot of actors in this. The person who is actually the fbi lead so speak is a very good actor himself. Which is why he can say corny lines and it sounds OK. I must admit, I am a fan of Patrick Swayze. A lot of people now remember him from dirty dancing. Cause that seems to be popular in this generation with females. But honestly I liked him more in this movie. He was hard core, in shape, long hair and unpredictable. Which I liked. Now off to keanu reevers. Who I must say besides john wick i really hate this mans acting. I showed this to my roommate and she loved it. She likes reeves. I can't stand him. He just comes off as an actor who doesn't try to say his lines right and just sounds awful. No passion behind his lines. Almost like anyone can play his part.This movie I remember was good but I forgot how funny it was. Even the people who left bad reviews admit, it is funny. The part where the guy is talking about surviving the last wave and saying ""you can't just paddle back to sure if you decide you want to back out"" is funny. Many things are funny. Right down to the mask they wear.The female they had was attractive but she wasn't out of place attractive. Too many of these women they put in these surfer skydiving movies simply look like they don't belong. She looked like someone you would see on the beach.But I will say they lost 2 points for the plot. Gary Busey helped sell them the plot. He even does good. He is just a good actor, very motivated. Season veteran. But the girl falling in love with him and him coming to save her. Plus the whole knee thing is pretty old. I must admit the plot was nothing that original. A bunch of people are doing some bad things and they love their extreme sport. One of the first to have this plot but seriously not the last. Great actors made this movie great, not the plot. If the plot was great you would have wanted to hop on a surfboard yourself. I didn't get that feeling from this movie.If you want to watch a funny, great flick with some action in it. Foot chases, and one liners look no further. If you are looking for drama great acting and actors really leading on to each other like in classics, keep looking. I gave this an 8 because I'm rating it compared to other action movies. I actually should have gave it a 7 but seriously it has a woman fighting naked in the shower. That deserves a point by itself!!!",Point Break

I tell ya', Kathryn Bigelow definitely knows how to direct an entertaining movie. I have seen all her work and her visual presence never ceases to be impressive.Have you ever had the experience of watching a movie so much that you want to watch it again right away, I mean where you go right back out to the box office and buy another ticket and watch it again. This is exactly what I did with this film. This is the only movie that I have ever watched or had the desire to watch twice back to back. It just had me. I think I love it so much because it contains all of the thrills that I have dreamed of pursuing. At that time I wanted to skydive in the worst way, and I also wanted to try surfing, but had never had the opportunity for either. This film was so thrilling that I felt like I had taken a two week vacation and done it all. The skydiving scenes were just stellar, as were the surfing scenes, especially the one that took place at night.The movie is all about thrills, so Bigelow succeeding in ever way in making a thrilling film. From the exciting score to the excellent foot chase through the back alleys and a few houses of a suburb, every moment of ""Point Break"" is a thrill. In the film, Patrick Swayze's character has a spiritual connection with thrill seeking adventures (surfing, robbing banks, sky diving, etc). He's trying to find the ""ultimate ride"". Let me tell you, this movie is the ultimate ride.Many people that I talk to criticize it for not having a story. Granted, it doesn't really have a conceivable story, but who cares! If the screenwriter has tried to build a plausible story with this material, the level of thrill achieved would not have exceeded that from which you receive from drinking a cup of coffee or smoking a cigarette. In this kind of a movie, you just want to be entertained, and I for one just sat back and enjoyed the ride without even thinking about the plausibility of the plot.",Point Break

Everyone obviously did their job including writers, actors, cinematographers and director. Keanu Reeves was well cast in this movie with his rather exotic looks and youthful energy. While probably not a good enough to be a leading man in some film genres, his acting and physical skills were good enough to allow seasoned A list actors Gary Busey and Patrick Swazey to carry the rest of the movie. Both were older actors even in 1991, so Reeves youth also help give the movie a youthful feel. Really, the movie was just a breath of fresh air from beginning to end.

Patrick Swayze just went downhill after this movie, maybe it took it out of him to play Bohdi, or however you spell it, basically the same character he played from Road House, only a bad guy. Reeves was in his 'no wayyyy: Bill and Ted' version here. it still makes me laugh as he tries to act! Gary Busey was great as usual. The action was top notch and surprising well done. The house shoot out, the last bank robbery, and the car chase which ended with a mad foot race pursuit which ended with ""Johnny Utah"" shooting into the air wildly...screaming, are still some of the best action scenes put to film.

Director Kathryn Bigelow does have her moments during this film, using a visual style that comes close to that of her sadly under-appreciated earlier vampire flick ""Near Dark"" (1987). Unfortunately, the acting load is carried (or not) by three hams and a twinkie: Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Gary Busey, and Lori Petty. It's notable that the performance of the usually comically bad Swayze actually looks good in this film when compared to the others. The screenplay of W. Peter Iliff is horrendous. I notice that several commenters thought the film to be at least in part a satire, but I didn't get that impression. I think the script is just so awful it becomes unintentionally laughable. I must confess that I am at a loss to understand the rave reviews many have given this film, but it would be a very boring world if everyone had the same taste. Rating: 5/10.",Point Break

For absolutely no reason, the surfers skydive. The philosophical soliloquies by their leader Bodhi are hysterical and would make Rodin cringe. it's a shame this movie is so bad because Kathryn Bigelow does a good job directing it. Keanu Reeves isn't a believable hero, and his ignorance makes the POLICE ACADEMY crew look professional. Swayze and his surfers aren't credible villains, because let's face it, you watch their activities and you see a bunch of alienated kids looking for a good time rather some truly cold blooded criminals. The skydiving scenes seem thrown in because the producers couldn't find a rational place for them in any other film. They must have said ""this film is bad enough on paper, we might as well throw this into the mix.""

The airplane scenes are great too (did they do their own stunts? It sure seemed like it!). Even the usual tomboy Lori Petty is pretty and engaging here. Gary Busey is a hoot, too.

It was visually OK, what with the surfing scenes and skydiving scenes, but the premise was a bit of a stretch.I'm not sure I quite caught on as to why the character played by Gary Busey suspected that the perpetrators were surfers. Because of a bit of wax left by a footprint? Surfers don't usually wear their shoes when they stand on their boards. There could have been any number of reasons for the mixture of this wax and sand on the shoes.It was amazing how the character played by Keanu Reeves was able to sky-dive like a pro, free-falling and all, without any training in the art. I've been given to understand that one has to make several jumps before free-falling.As far as someone jumping out of an airplane without a chute? Yeah, right. And with the delay between the time that Patrick Swayze departs the aircraft and Keannu Reeves follows, he would have needed a serious case of gas to catch up to him.I can't even buy a King Air being used as a jump plane.The ending was not plausible either, and the final scene is stolen right out of 'Dirty Harry'.A pleasant watch, if you can manage the suspension of disbelief.I couldn't.",Point Break

You bet.But Point Break really sets expectation on its ear when it comes to love. Of course, Keanu (whose name is Johnny Utah, btw) and Gary Busey have a great bond as FBI agent-partners who go through such harrowing events as accidentally murdering an entire room of low-level meth peddlers in a botched and misguided raid. And there is a great, sexy romance plot between Keanu and Lori Petty. In fact, if you don't watch closely enough, you may believe that most of Keanu's actions in the latter 1/3 of the movie are driven by his love for Lori.They're not. That's because Johnny Utah is joined, spirit and soul, with the morally bankrupt Bodhi (played by Patrick Damned Swayze). They have the type of love that only comes around once in a century, the kind we can all hope for. To Bodhi, Johnny Utah is the student, he is merciful, he sweetly gazes. They commune over eating foam and know, deeply, that not a lifetime will pass without their ultimate union.Dynamite script. There were actually so many good lines I can't single one out.

Reeves is made for Utah but it could have easily been played by someone else. Swayze as a villain - a rare treat and strange sight but he pulls it off fantastically.Special mention to the Scene stealer and always fab Gary Busey. He is great in every scene - especially outside the bank when reading comics and eating the meatball sandwiches. He plays a good guy for a change and is excellent.

Johnny Utah might very well have been the seminel role in Reeves' well established career. Like most other Reeves films, this one was a box office success. Unlike other Reeves vehicles, however, this one does have some good qualities. The flow of the film is good and especially so during the bank robbery scenes as well as the classic chase scene. With Keanu chasing after the Ronald Reagan mask-wearing Swayze the scene cleverly takes us through a stunning car chase followed by an on-foot chase through residential L.A. I was of course being sarcastic regarding the master thespian issue, but this film really does deliver far better than ""Speed,"" ""Johnny Mnuemonic,"" and other campy Keanu flicks. The film actually depicts the surfing community closer than any other mainstream movie, save maybe Fast Times At Ridgemont High.

187,nicktusk-95591,One of my favorite movies,10,15 June 2018,Point break is the quintessential bank robbery movie. Before this movie there were zero to none with films that had a xtreme sports angle to criminal activity. This film has paved the way for a lot of modern day movies and also crime sagas typically with four friends who are close and are also criminals. I first saw it on VHS like when I was 10 years old. This film is 27 years old but it's way ahead of its time. The story especially. It has every angle that now a days shows and movies have these days. Definitely a cult classic .,Point Break
188,namideo,Loved it!,7,31 August 2008,"Just watched this movie again, and while on the surface it looks like a stereotypical action flick, and in some ways maybe it is, I was actually surprised how much I enjoyed it.There were a few things that were a little contrived, at least for a ""cop movie."" I don't understand why the chief of police always has to be written as a jerk or why there is always those two arrogant cops that crack jokes all the time, etc. A minor gripe, however.I originally saw this movie in the 90s when it was newer. Now that it's had time to age, it feels like a classic, and kept me yearning for those good old days when action films weren't all about superheroes, redundant CGI usage and mindlessly drawn-out action scenes. They really don't make 'em like they used to. Everything is proportionate, the special effects are as real as they can be, and the characters grab hold of you. Why is character development seemingly so hard to find these days? Granted, I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan, but it's not necessarily the actors that make this movie. It's everything about it. The story in this film is rock solid. It's a thriller wrapped in a collage of fantastic cinematography and spectacle. The ocean and surfing scenes are beautifully shot, even artsy in a way. All in all, the story and the action are successfully interwoven to deliver a ""pure adrenaline"" caper. It's an interesting combination of human drama and extreme edginess, and yet it works.",Point Break
189,BigTimeMovieFan,World's longest 2-hour movie,7,19 June 2001,"Some people would say that there's something wonderfully Zen about ""Point Break"".  But the truth is that there's something far more Einstein-esque in this movie.  From the start of the ""Fox Fanfare"" to the end credits' roll, it's just a hair over two hours in real time, but in observed time, it feels more like five hours.The funny thing is that it doesn't drag.  Unlike other James Cameron projects like ""Titanic"" (where you were practically begging the iceberg to make its cameo) or ""Terminator 2"" (Please get out of your dream, Sarah, and go waste the evil computer programmer) the lulls rarely last more than a few minutes, and faster than you can say ""hands up!"" we're back to some action. (This pretty much confirms the theory that executive producers just sit back, take the credit, and don't do a whole helluva lot. But I digress.)Certainly the casting was inspired.  Getting Keanu Reeves to play a dopey/stoned surf dude gave new meaning to the phrase ""a role he was born to play"".  Sort of like Madonna playing a foul-mouthed floozy in ""League of Their Own.""With bank robbing, surfing, midnight beach football and guns lots of guns, grab some junk food and enjoy some junk entertainment.  But be prepared to spend more time than you think you need. (7 out of 10)",Point Break
190,andertonmark,A perfect movie,10,8 October 2001,"Not much else to say really, but here are the high points....
Possibly the best foot chase sequence ever filmed, with Keanu (Johnny Utah) chasing down Patrick Swayze, down alleyways through gardens, a french window, having a dog thrown at him... Ms Bigelow's direction of this sequence is stunning.John C McGinley throwing his toys out of the pram over Pappas and Utah's lack of progress, asking what they have acheived, and Utah explaining that he cut his first tube...Surfing and skydiving sequences, that are just beautifully choreographed, colour and texture par excellence.Nixon (the rubber faced bank robbing surfer) explaining to the bank as he leaves ""I'm not a crook""...The kid who tells Keanu that its never to late to start surfing... ""But I'm 25"".. ""Like I said, its never too late!""If the film has a fault, it is the end sequence, that sees Patrick Swayze's character who abhors violence and lives life to surf, actually breaking his own rules, resulting in his entire group of surf buddies being wiped out in shootouts at the bank and the airport...The film did not need to kill them all off, but undoubtedly Hollywood pressure for the crescendo guns blazing type ending swayed the decision... Even so, this is done in a not entirely unbelievable manner, and beats hands down the action movies of its genre.Without Tarantino, Ms Bigelow might have had the best action flick of the 90's with Point Break. It is worth bearing in mind that before this film, Keanu Reeves was only really a Ted ""Theodore"" Logan as one half of Bill and Ted. This film undoubtedly was a major factor in turning him into an action hero, and opening doors to even more diverse roles. Its a source!",Point Break
191,sincitybrant,I always have to watch it,9,10 September 2002,"Action movies can get little better than Point Break and whenever it is on I am drawn into it and HAVE to watch it. Reeves didn't need much acting skill to play Johnny Utah and Swazey's roll was spot on. It had just the right amount of depth without any fears of melodrama or cheesiness. The whole premise of the movie: bank robbery, FBI, and surfers is interesting and is covered believably. No real memorable lines, but so many of the scenes are unforgettable and well-etched into my memory.",Point Break
192,Troopie,Even Stallone might be ashamed of this one!,1,30 November 2003,"Forgetting for the moment Keanu Reeves lack of ability, there are too many errors or incredible (literally) scenes to make this film believable to anyone who likes their adventure films to be even slightly realistic. As a former skydiver, I found the airborne scenes too bad to even be funny. God help any viewer who tries to copy such fantasy stunts in real life! Also, as an ex-cop, I do NOT feel sympathy for a cop who finds it hard to stop a friend from violently robbing a bank. Feel guilty about people being in danger because you didn't do your job, yes! To summarise: if watching Keanu Reeves read a phone book turns you on, this might be a good film. If you thought Superman was too realistic, maybe this is viewable.

Critically speaking, a few scenes are pretty bad (to me they are bad, like 'F___, why can't I say what I really mean!, or 'Man, this is harder then I thought',etc, etc). Pretty corny stuff. But, that's just a very small portion of the movie. Mostly, he (K.R.)does just fine. Patrick Swayze is great!

Or maybe it's the 'Johnny Utah' name - Ebert's rule, that any film that resorts to using silly names is in serious trouble at the screenplay level - comes into play.But the final straw was when Utah went to try to teach himself to surf, nearly drowns, but luckily gets rescued - by the girlfriend of Bodhi, who introduces him to the gang. Sorry, but that was just too far-fetched.I can't really explain it, since similarly improbable events in other films are accepted quite happily. Or maybe it's that I'm not exactly a Keanu Reeves fan.

198,confrank,There's Simply Nothing Like it,10,6 April 2020,"Point Break is lightning in a bottle. It came at a time when the 80's cheese, rock and roll and corniness had evolved and remastered itself into an ultimate force for entertainment, and escapist entertainment is the code Point Break lives and dies by. There's unshakable drive to pull audiences out of their everyday routines and thrust them in the front row seat of an endlessly quotable wild ride that owns its clichés and refines them into pure gold. This film knows how to latch on and engage all of your most potent primordial senses.With that, there's far more depth and purely refined philosophy than people give it credit for. Patrick Swayze as Bodhi is unstoppably enigmatic, and while you're not asked to sympathize with him and the difficult choices he makes, it nonetheless thrusts his thrill-seeking lifestyle on a pedastal to show the true depth of the human spirit. His ""us against the system"" speech is brimming with passion, and is so effective for how easily it can light a fire in your belly. He makes a perfect foil for Johnny Utah in an emotionally charged story of forbidden love. Never has Keanu Reeves gelled with anyone onscreen like this since.(I so often roll my eyes at all of those one sentence letterboxd reviews that insist on secret gay romances between lead characters, but yes this movie is pretty gay)You'd think the way it was directed that Point Break was helmed by some hotshot guy who was young, dumb and full of cum. Who'd have thought Kathryn Bigelow could capture the wild adrenaline and testosterone fueled bromance this movie needed better than any man ever could. The chases, surfing and skydiving are magnificent, keeping all of the action feeling fresh while capturing the sequences well enough to compel you to stop and stare in awe.Tried as they have to replicate the magic of Point Break in spinoffs (The Fast & The Furious) and remakes (a certain soulsucking 2015 feature), no attempt has matched the symphony of people and elements that came together to produce a true 1990's action masterpiece.",Point Break

She's really hands on and the work done is very enjoyable and camera work seems like you are following the actors and part of the story. Patrick Swayze is awesome as Bodhi(yeah Gautam Buddha was bank robbing surfer living on the edge). He's free spirited nature and joy is genuine. This was the first big action for Keanu Reeves and he worked hard from surfing, to fight training, to studying quarterbacks and the effort shows. His chemistry with Patrick Swayze is what draws you in. Young Reeves is very sexy in this film and the 3 funny lines delivered by him in this movie simply adds to his quirkiness. The dialogue has also become legendary. This movie is about thrill seekers, chasers and takes you on a ride. Very entertaining.

201,mperry35,Point Break is legendary,10,12 January 2016,"I have loved this film since the first time I saw it in '91. The action is terrific, the actors are great together, the soundtrack is excellent & the storyline ties it all together beautifully. All together, it makes for a fantastic movie experience. For me, there's an indescribable ambiance that the movie creates, when i watch it. I become invested in each one of the characters. I appreciate how Johnny & Papas develop a close ""father & son-ish"" relationship. Both are a little ornery w sarcastic personalities. Bodhi & his crew are a very close-nit group, too. They aren't really violent individuals, at heart (minus Rosie), but they will project violence in order to make money so they can continue living the adventurous, care-free lifestyles that they love & have grown accustomed to, via surfing, skydiving, etc. It's without question, one of my Top 10 fav flicks of all-time. The creators of the 2015 Point Breakshould be ashamed of themselves. They didn't come anywhere close to the quality of the ""real"" Point Break. I actually find it offensive that they thought they could create a present-day Point Break that would even be in the same galaxy as the original.

Alot of movies has tried to copy it through the years, like The fast and furious. Still story wise and acting wise they never actually reach the level like this one did. This one has alot more to offer with raw action and gorgeous scenes that is breathtakingly even today.
Patrick Swayze did one of his best acting performances in this movie as adrenalin junky guru Bodhi that should have given him alot more credit then it did. Same goes for Gary Busey and his character that is both fun and believable.

204,haela,"It's hard to say exactly WHY I liked this, but I really did.",7,12 September 2012,"First off, let me say that this movie was made before I was born, I had never even heard of it until recently, and only saw it because I've been going through and watching a lot of Keanu Reeves' movies. So my take on it is fresh: there's no nostalgia or memories associated with this movie for me, unlike many of the reviews I've seen.When Special Agent Johnny Utah goes undercover trying to root out a group of bank robbers who are also surfers in California, he has no idea how deep he will get sucked in, nor how fast. The surfers are adrenaline junkies who just look for the next thrill in life, but they don't see themselves as criminals, or as slackers, but instead as a dying breed, free spirits, the only human beings that are truly living. First confused, then fascinated by their thinking, Johnny walks a fine and treacherous line. Will he stand firm and take down these men whose philosophy is misguided, criminal, yet strangely seductive? The premise does sound almost laughable. I mean, the FBI inserts a special agent (named JOHNNY UTAH)to work undercover by hanging out with a gang of surfers. Who they suspect are really a gang of bank robbers that wear masks with the faces of US Presidents on them. Yet somehow, it worked. Much of the credit for this goes to Keanu Reeves (love him or hate him, he was perfect here). Gary Busey and Patrick Swayze were also phenomenal. Kudos as well to Katherine Bigelow, and everybody else who helped direct/produce this movie: they took a campy, impossible premise, and turned it into a movie I won't be forgetting anytime soon.Sure, there are a few clunkers. Several lines fall flat, a few scenes are difficult to swallow even for an action movie fan. There are a few plot holes, and one or two baffling decisions made by the characters. But with big waves, good performances, and a driven pace, this movie sucks you in anyway. I would recommend it to any lover of the genre. It's something fresh, not CG dominated, explosions and superheroes. Take it for what it's worth, and enjoy it.I dislike the fact that 'free-spirited' Bodhi is glorified...his 'freedom' was just living for the thrill, not caring who and what he destroyed along the way. He was incredibly selfish, but such a charismatic person that others followed him anyway. Maybe that's why I like Johnny Utah so much. He was a hotshot who wanted the same things as Bodhi did: excitement, lust for life, beauty. But when he could so easily have been seduced down the road that destroyed Bodhi, instead he stood up for what he knew was right.In summary: Point Break just rocks as an action thriller with a bizarre plot that works against all odds, and in spite of frequent campiness. Take it for surface value, a you get a splashy, fun, thrilling movie. Look a little deeper, and you see a powerful movie, and one character who stays true to himself without sacrificing his honor, integrity, and what he knows is right.",Point Break
205,nat-dalby,Still one of the '90s' most substantial action films,9,23 April 2018,"Point Break is one of those films that's massively entertaining no matter how many times you watch it. Whilst this is common in the action genre, Point Break stands out in its era by being more of a morally complex story.The villain here is not your usual action villain. Keanu Reeves' character forms a complex bond with him and surfing culture to the point where it breaks his heart to have to bring him down. Swayze plays him like a charismatic cult leader and its believable that he'd sway enough people to get them onside for bank heists, all in the name of adrenaline. This makes Point Break not a film of ""bad guys vs good guys"" but a real exploration of a subculture and how it gets inside people's heads.It help that this is also a kick ass, brilliantly shot action film, with incredible sequences like the foot chase through LA and the skydiving making it as exciting as it is thoughtful.

Well scripted by W Peter Iliff and remarkably well photographed, this like one of Cameron's movies is technically brilliant, featuring an enjoyably implausible plot and perfect pacing. Bigelow certainly knows how to make an movie. The story is fairly simple, FBI agent Johnny Utah ( Keanu Reeves )goes undercover to try and catch an gang of bank robbers led by Patrick Swayze who are also surfers and during raids wear masks of former presidents which adds an brilliantly satirical edge to otherwise just superior action movie. Lori petty ( pre Tank Girl )is the love interest and Gary Busey is the veteran cop who assists him and all give excellent performances including Reeves who's never been better since. SPOILERALERT.

But for those of us who can identify with the feeling of wanting more from life than their cars on the freeway going to and from work, this movie is a must.The story is about a young FBI agent and his transfer to the LA FBI bank robbery division.  Jonny Utah (K. Reeves) meets up with an Oscar-worthy Gary Busey as his older and wiser partner.  They seek the unbustable Dead Presidents, an bank robbery gang that leaves no clues, no trace...""-and like that (SNAP) they disappear, like a virgin on prom night."" -Gary Busey's character Angleo PapisThats all I will tell you about, with the execption that this is a great movie that you should see 1,000 times.",Point Break

224,JohnnyUtah,"""100 percent pure adrenaline""",9,23 June 2001,"Die Hard might be the greatest action movie of all time, but ""Point Break"" is not too far behind. Keanu Reeves plays federal agent Johnny Utah(a role he was born to play) who is teamed up with a veteran federal agent Angelo played by Gary Busey to crack the case of the ex president bank robbers. Angelo has a theory that the bank robbers are surfers, and Johnny goes undercover as a surfer to bust the bank robbers. Along the way he meets adrenaline junkie Bohdi played by Patrick Swayze. Well I am not going to give anymore away. This movie has some of the most amazing action scenes ever! It is highly entertaining and very quotable. Reeves is playing a role he was born to play(next to Ted in Bill and Ted) and Swayze has a lot of fun in his role. The movie is also very quotable and has a great soundtrack.

225,edwinbodegraaf,Moral ambivalence and great action,7,8 July 2021,"Long-haired surfer dudes robbing banks for kicks versus a cocky new FBI recruit who goes undercover to solve the case of a series of bank robberies.Patrick Swayze is magnificent in all his intensity and madness as the leader of the bank robbing surfers. Keanu Reeves as the FBI agent is passable as always, but hasn't got the gravity or cool that possibly a Tom Cruise could've brought to the role. After a promising start, Lori Petty is relegated to a supporting role. A shame, but it's a film about guys after all, or as the Lori Petty character says at some point: 'There's a bit too much testosterone around here.' (Surprisingly it's directed by a woman, the Oscar winning Kathryn Bigelow.)The first twenty minutes are pretty standard FBI fair, with a lot of shouty men in suits, masculine bullying and the pulling of rank, but as soon as the film gets going, the excitement and tension build up beautifully. When Keanu Reeves's cover is blown by chasing the masked bank robbers, he surprisingly goes back to continue his job as an undercover... It's a strange twist, but after this, the film speeds up further and there is no way of telling how it will all end. It certainly had me at the edge of my seat.After all these years (thirty!) the film, which depicts a life style that in my mind is very much associated with the period, is still very watchable. The tuxedo dressed and masked bank robbers (the masks depict as ex-presidents) show a another side of the the thrill seeking surfers and add a nightmarish feel to the otherwise freewheeling and drugs taking young men.The action is balanced with some low-key druggy philosophy about living for the moment, that feels heartfelt and authentic. The film doesn't glamorize and none of the characters are all that likable - should we be rooting for Schwayze the bank robber of Reeves the sneaky FBI undercover agent? The ambivalence makes this film much better than the average action film where the line between good and bad often is drawn with much more clarity.A ninety classic that has lost nothing of its original excitement and reminds us of what a great actor Patrick Swayze was.",Point Break

227,rnakamur,100% Pure Adrenaline,9,20 December 2008,"15-foot Hawaiian waves are unabashedly intercut with California beaches. A footchase through Venice Beach neighborhoods defies endurance and fatigue, while a leap from a plane sans a parachute defies logic.But logic doesn't matter when adrenaline is pumping through your system. And that's precisely the point of Kathryn Bigelow's ""Point Break,"" a movie that's just as exciting the 20th time you see it as the first.Some people might ridicule the fact that this film is so high on my list. Conceptually a ""B"" movie (FBI rookie infiltrates gang of surfer bank robbers), the film did moderately well at the box office and could easily have been dismissed as an action-thriller among the likes of ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Die Hard."" But I have a hard time finding a movie that matches this film's serenity and luster, which ultimately defines the spell under which special agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) falls after meeting surfer Bodhi (Patrick Swayze).They say there's something about surfing unlike anything in the world. And there's a reason why people get up at 5am each day to hit the waves before the tourists show up. There's something magical about the ocean's power, something transcendent about reaching a harmony with its rhythms, which Bodhi describes as a ""spiritual side"" of it (that nazi surf punks like Anthony Kiedis fail to understand). Go watch ""Endless Summer"" and see men in their 50s abandoning careers and material possessions traveling the world in search of the perfect wave. This is what Utah is seduced by, a blend of adrenaline and total clarity that Bodhi embodies and by which he leads his minions into the ""rush"" of armed robbery. At several moments in the film, we too can imagine ourselves picking up a surfboard or jumping out of a plane, even if normally we'd consider ourselves too cowardly to do so.""Point Break"" features relentless stunt sequences arguably unmatched since its 1991 release-- and best of all, it mounts them one after another until its jaw-dropping climax. The raid on the meth house with a sequence involving a knife and lawnmower, the (already-mentioned) chase through Venice Beach including narrow alleyways and literally breaking through private residences, and a leap with no parachute out of a cessna over the Ensenada desert-- they're just highlights. Those don't even include the surf sequences, beginning at Leo Carrillo with Utah first learning how to pop up, on to the haunting final scene with Bodhi vanishing into a 70-footer on Bells Beach, Australia. Director Bigelow, who began her career as a painter, clearly places a high emphasis on visual appeal, rarely leaving a shot without some majesty to it. Meanwhile, in the context of California beach culture, Reeves and Swayze (and even Lori Petty) are perfectly cast, while Gary Busey has some of the best moments of his career as Utah's older, energetic partner Angelo Pappas.Universal Pictures essentially remade this movie for the post-millennium audience as ""The Fast and the Furious,"" with Paul Walker in the Utah role and Vin Diesel in the Bodhi role. And that film was precisely what I mentioned earlier ""Point Break"" could've been-- an adequately entertaining action thriller among the likes of ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Die Hard."" But street racing, while exciting, lacks the spellbinding serenity of surfing. Driving at speeds of 120mph can get you a rush, but there's no feeling of the earth, no spiritual harmony, no lucidity in one's existence.I was thirteen when this film was first released, in a summer when ""Terminator 2"" was all the rage among teenage boys. It wasn't until the next spring that I rented the movie on video, at which time my older cousin told me ""I can't believe you didn't see this in the theater!"" With the help of a big screen TV and surround sound, I began to understand what he meant. In many ways, this is a movie to be experienced like the very first action-thrillers, where audiences leapt into aisles to avoid being hit by trains charging at the screen. ""Point Break"" doesn't try to be profound or dramatic or anything else it's not. But it's far better than ""Terminator 2"" ""Die Hard"" or ""Lethal Weapon"" or any other cops-robbers movie that has been released in the last twenty years. Not until Zack Snyder's ""300"" (2006) was a non-Oscar-aspiring action film able to jolt adrenaline in viewers at a purely visceral level from its frenetic sensory experience.""Point Break"" is just that good.",Point Break

The acting is generally good, particularly Busey as a veteran FBI agent, but Keanu's usual expressionless vocals and face disappoint. The script is sharp and witty.

Instead of multiple cuts simulating action, the camera seems to chase the characters and really captures the energy.I guess Bigelow got the directing job since she was married to the ego-maniacal James Cameron, who produced this film.

Keanu Reeves, though I enjoyed his performance in Braham Stoker's Dracula, is at his all-time monotonic worst here, with lines like ""No!  It's time for you to go down!"" or something silly like that.  I guess you have to be one of those people who considers surfing a ""way of life"" to appreciate this movie.  But then again, even surfers had to laugh at Patrick Swayze's assertion that he had ""lived his whole life"" for the chance to catch that absurdly gigantic tidal wave at the end.

I have not seen another action movie to take its place, in fact none have even come close.

Well, ""Point Break"" is far from lame, it is actually one of the best action films ever made.Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, ""Point Break"" is highly underrated. I think because of when it came out, and the fact that alot of people just can't take Keanu Reeves seriously, its too bad because this is a very exciting film, a film that has a feel to it, a very resonate and distinguishable vibe. ""Point Break"" is one of a handful of films that I can watch over and over again, and one of maybe 2 or 3 that I can actually fall asleep to, in a good way of course. From Keanu to John C. Mcginley, everyone is perfectly cast. The action sequences are taunt and original, especially the foot chase through houses and backyards, with Keanu hoofing a pitbull. The relationships seem real and believable, especially Keanu and Swayze, in the hands of lesser directors it all could of seemed silly and homoerotic, like ""Top Gun"", but although this is very much a macho film (as Lori Petty's character states ""there is too much testosterone here"") it has an understanding to it, all these guys, from the FBI to the bank robbers are all in it for the adreneline rush, the thing that makes them feel like men, that makes them feel alive.You know a film is great when it is often copied but never duplicated, like ""Die Hard"" or ""Pulp Fiction"". ""Point Break"" has been copied many times, most recently in the form of ""The Fast and the Furious"" but nothing has compared to it, it stands alone, like the mystique placed on surfing in the film, ""Point Break"" has a mystique, its spiritual, Its a way of life, ""dude"".",Point Break

While the acting falls short of bearable, the performances mark the ""breaking point"" between cheesy eighties films and the early nineties, bringing Keanu into a new decade to make fabulous films like ""A Walk in the Clouds"" and ""Johnny Mnemonic."" However, how could you not LOVE a movie that has COPS, ROBBERS, SURFING, SEX, DRUGS, ROCK AND ROLL, SKYDIVING, PARTIES, CHASE SCENES, AND BUSEY all rolled into one, not to mention ""Johnny F--in Utah, number nine, oh, Jesus Christ, Johnny F--in Utah, I'm sorry man.""

Yet the most remarkable appearance is Gary Busey who can´t really conceal his belly under that surfers´ t-shirt. See him offer cold Pizza to his stakeout-colleagues and laugh your guts out.

Each character is developed so well and it feels like you can place yourself in their shoes at all times. The plot is excellent and completely original, and it is also very realistic (I do not see how other's claim its very unrealistic?) Even if viewers do not like Surfing or cops/robbers movies, they can still LOVE this movie because it has 5 different genres inside the ""action/adventure"" genre. Point Break has multiple gun fighting , surfing,and sky-diving scenes that can please anyone. I suggest that anybody reading this, who has not seen it yet, takes a look at the film and hopefully will get the same impression that I did.

Also, a pretty good story - with meaning, even.Also, there happens to be some great lines tucked away amidst the hokey stuff, and lots of clever little details(mannerisms, utterances) that add to the movie.I voted 10 to raise the score, but I give this movie 8 stars.",Point Break

This is one of those films that just has this certain feel to it, the world created, despite the preposterous premise feels real, and genuine, that these hedonistic adrenalin junkies rob banks to send a message rather then for the sheer money of it. The characters, despite being mostly one dimensional, are also engaging and you can't help but like them and their life style. Swayze is great as the Zen like Bhodi, and Reeves nails being Reeves, which is all the man needs to do playing a surfing FBI agent. Great turns from Busey and Mcginley as well, though Lori Petty ends up getting a bit of a bum deal.

Sometimes you go back and watch an old 90s movie that you used to love and think ""what the heck was I thinking? This is terrible!"" Point Break is not that movie. I've seen it over 100 times and enjoy it every single time. As Keanu Reeves' breakthrough action movie, it definitely paved the way for the other legendary action movies of the 90s that were game changers for the action genre at the time (Speed, The Matrix). Was it his BEST acted movie ever? Probably not. There were some moments. But overall, he played a believable young adrenaline junkie FBI agent.There was one thing that bothered me about the plot. During the ending scene, almost a year later, there was zero mention of Tyler and his relationship with her. You would like to assume that Bohdi would ask about her considering they had history, but he didn't. One would hope that after Johnny went through all that trouble to get her back and declare his love that they'd still be together that year later, with no mention of her at all it just left me feeling a little jaded, lol.",Point Break

I mean really, if you cannot get your head around the basic plot and FUN, yes fun, that is Point Break; then i suggest you wrap your head around a washing pole or something.Yes, the storyline is a tad unbelievable and yes Keanu Reeves sounds dumb. That has more to do with where he comes from as funnily enough people pick up accents and dialects from where they come from. Yes?OK, so the film? It has surfing and the Swayze in it, i mean what more do you need? This is definitely in a list of my favourite films and i don't care what anyone says. Plenty of action, big surf scenes, an amazing parachute jump/fight and it has the Swayze and Lori Petty in it.No it's not a life changing experience but it does do what films are supposed to do, that being it makes you forget where you are for a couple of hours.

I recall watching it when it first came out and it kind of passed me by at that point. Re-watching it recently awakened all the nostalgia of the 1990's and reminded me how great that time was. The story is excellently laid out with Patrick cast to a tee as the surfer. Lori Petty is also fab as the lead female she is perfect for the part. I was surprised to learn apart from tank girl she has done little of note since this film - maybe a bit too quirky for Hollywood? Keanu actually looks at times like he is reading an autocue (which i think is why i missed the point on 1st watch) but i think this actually adds to his character in the film - don't ask me how! One of my favourite parts is surprisingly not the action parts but the part where Keanu is getting disciplined by his boss for having a surf board in the office, it actually reminds me of some of the national lampoons parodies of ""bad cop"" bosses. It is so off the wall. Excellent film",Point Break

But Swayze does a solid job here and though Reeves doesn't go much beyond his usual two dimensional charisma, he's tailor made for the part so it doesn't really matter. It's well written, nicely shot, and achieves what it sets out to do efficiently yet with enough subtlety to keep the more discerning moviegoer interested. A tale of freedom vs authority, men flying through the air after each other, and some mildly homo-erotic surfing. What more could you want?

I just do not think the new one is as creative as this one used to be, and I have noticed that this movie is suffering consequences from the remake. This movie had a rating from 7.9 before the remake, and now it has drained.Now ,to get back to our movie here... It is a shame there was no sequel, because there was planning for one, but they just didn't, because they had to pick between this or the fast and the furious.... At least, that was what they told me...This movie gives of a Vibe, a thrill, and is really worth watching, even doh the first minutes are boring, there are a lot of really Nice scènes with beautiful backgrounds.It also is a pity they kill a lot of great characters.

Katheryn Bigelow brought both a slightly mocking, but also a great sensitivity to the relationships in this movie, that the turd of a remake completely missed.Lori Petty also was brilliant as the no BS surf girl. who Keanu falls for (literally!). But of course, it was Patrick Swazye, who stole this movie with his brilliant portrayal of the surf guru Bodhi - He was the spiritual center of the gang, and even though he lost his way at the end - He still had some honour.

290,rhino-25,The film for an adrenaline generation,8,14 October 2004,"Thirteen years on it sounds a little trite - an FBI agent examines his inner self whilst trying to bring down a gang of surfer bank robbers by infiltrating their scene. But dude, how Point Break pulled this off!In what can now safely be regarded as one of the more generation-defining cinematic moments of the nineties, Point Break serves as not just a credible well-paced action thriller spectacle, but also as a voice for advocates of the adrenalin rush. The movie's sleeper popularity at the time would no doubt have helped issue in a new generation of 'X' sports for a new generation, as hungry sponsors leapt at a new market.Kathryn Bigelow takes some key pointers from then hubby James Cameron and paces the movie brilliantly. There are many key moments of unique action - that chute-less jump from 4,000 feet being the highlight - that filled the trailer, but it is the cumulative effect of bringing these moments together that adds to the picture. For so many films the denouement is a gross failure but Bigelow controls the films peaks and troughs expertly and the ending is genuinely well handled, something that appears to be a real struggle for Hollywood today.In what will go down as Patrick Swayze's finest moment on film, he plays the adrenalin guru Bodhi with glaze-eyed and silver tongued expertise, and manages to pull off the very difficult assignment of being both sane and insane simultaneously with accomplishment.You can almost feel pulled by Bodhi's enthusiasm for a sensation 'as close as you get to God', and as a result can excuse the decade for being labeled that of the 'slacker' generation. The nineties weren't about slacking, just looking for a different kind of high.",Point Break

Practically every scene plays with displaying of the elements, like heavy rain in the shooting-scene right at the beginning, the waves and surfing shots in the middle, or the skydiving-scene close to the end.Being an outstanding piece of photography and directing as well as an overall good acting, this movie is close to having a short holiday (and I always like to see it when it's time for one).",Point Break

Not overly complex, and maintains an edge well for an action movie without overly resorting to big special effects. Also a good rep for Gen Xer's, the first movie to take it to the extreme? Gary Busey did a great job with his role, the supporting cast is solid - Anthony Keidis from the RHCP's with a spot role as a surf punk. Nice comeback for Swayze for me, liked the early stuff - Red Dawn, Outsiders, Youngblood, but Dirty Dancing and Roadhouse were terrible. He needed this film as much as it needed him. Keanu didn't fare too badly after this either. After hiccuping with Bill and Ted, he followed up with My Own Private Idaho before raising the stakes with Speed and a few Wachowski brothers projects.

An FBI agent going undercover, under his real name, AND doing raids on more or less the same group he is trying to infiltrate? Insane. A group of 13 year-olds would take more precautions than these FBI agents are shown doing. There MIGHT have been a movie here. The agent, Keanu Reeves, is shown getting close to a surfer gal in order to get 'in' with the surfers; he tells her his parents died (which is a lie--they are still alive, we later find out, in Ohio) to gain sympathy from her, because he has found out thru records that her parents died in an accident when she was a child. This kind of thing brings out a type of remorse in the 'best' of circumstances. It is HARD to go undercover. That's why J.Edgar Hoover didn't even LET his agents go undercover: no way, back then.

Being only 20, it's sometimes really enjoyable to find an ""older"" film i enjoy, and i'm sure in 10 or so years time this film will still be able to hold its ground, as the plot although being rather impossible, is rather believable. I didn't expect myself to enjoy the movie, as the story line didn't really appeal to me at first, especially not the surfing parts, but as soon as i started watching the mix of keanu reeves, comedy and fast-paced action, i didn't even want to leave the sofa. The film has a really nice plot which is very different to the typical FBI/detective films of today. I would definitely re-watch this film again if given the chance.",Point Break

He was born to play Bodhi and ultimately inspire a generation of bro's longing to attain the Zen and coolness that he oozes through the screen. Point Break is an amazing strory guided by an underrated Kathryn Bigalow in her infancy.

311,socrates009,Zen and the art of surfing,7,9 October 2015,"A little late to the party, but after many attempts, saw it for the first time. It's not easy to get hold of a copy of it, these days. Terrific first half with a great build-up. Makes surfing look almost as cool as it is, Zen-like. But let down by the second half. The shootings, body count, completely unnecessary. Wasn't clear whether the Director was trying to glorify Bodhi's life (as it appeared at the end) or send some other message, like crime doesn't pay, or some such.Was left with a couple of unanswered questions: 1. What kinda name is Johnny Utah? 2. The scenes where Bodhi valiantly fights Johnny on Torquay Beach, and all the times that he pulls a gun on Johnny and comes out on top made me wonder, how come he doesn't know that Johnny is The One?",Point Break
312,nicholasmoth,Rather pointless to review such a film...,10,1 January 2012,"This film is pop music. No one can explain why ""I am the Walrus"" is greater than the ""Missa Solemnis""... if it is for them.Anyway, along with Rashomon, Black Narcissus, Great Expectations, Terminator and other totally absurd confections this happens to hit the spot - mainly because of the aerial sequence, which is a perceptual/experiential blast, and thus provides a mind-altering objective correlative for the Californian-mumbo-jumbo take on life which serves to drive the morality of the film. But many people, Bro, won't get it. Just as Patricia Highsmith's books are 'better than literature' in PJ O'Rourke's neat formulation, so Point Break transcends criticism... like... TOTALLY... and HYPER-REALLY.However I haven't seen it for a while so I may disagree with myself when I do.

313,jreckitt,Roller-coaster of a film,10,4 January 2012,"Like many other people, I first heard of Point Break in ""Hot Fuzz"" - an all-time favourite of mine - but never got round to watching it for numerous reasons. I saw it was available on BBC iPlayer as it had been aired recently, so I thought - why the hell not?I'm so pleased I did.If you're fond of action films like Die Hard, you're going to love this. Abandoning the stereotypical urban setting for such films, and moving out to the coast, it provides a unique mashup combining my stereotypical view of adrenaline-fixed surfers with a killer plot.Although I saw the events that happen after the tables turn about an hour in coming a mile off (after seeing enough detective dramas on ITV3, you get to know how a writer's mind works) the emotional attachment you have with the characters provides you with a huge moral dilemma. You can see the 'bad' guys are actually alright people when they're off-duty - yet you know what they do on-duty is morally wrong on every level. The ending plays on this massively, and is the only way to satisfy both sides of the moral argument, for better or for worse.Sure, a few sequences aren't in any way realistic (like the jump about 10 mins from the end) but if you suspend belief for a moment, and accept this film for what it is rather than a serious crime drama, you'll agree that this is one hell of a film.10/10 - ordering it on blu-ray after I've typed this!",Point Break

This movie is quite entertaining for the simple fact that everything is so ridiculous that it becomes comical. That, and it does contain what I and several of my friends consider to be the best line in the history of cinema (after learning he has to go under cover to become a surfer, a bewildered Keanu asks, ""But how am I gonna convince them I'm a surfer?""). XXX has nothing on Point Break. There is a theater group in Minneapolis that performs this film by having Keanu's role of Jonny Utah played by an audience member, the idea being that the untrained audience member can do just as good or better than Keanu. That fact alone I feel sums up why this movie is worth watching (once). There's not much else worth sayingno real plot to analyze, no impressive acting, just a really funny movie that almost all of those involved in the making of it would most likely want to forget (Mr. Busey being the lone exception; the man turns in another brilliant performance).",Point Break
315,Toni-Capin,soul surfing on film,10,27 April 2005,"I think this movie is a work of art,through Swayze s character, bod hi it speaks about the soul surfing and spiritual bonds between soul surfers and ocean. I live in Croatia where waves are basically too small for surfing so surfing has not developed into a popular sport here,there are no surf shops and besides myself I have never met anyone who's into soul surfing and everything about it.Not being able to surf here I have spent last 5 years learning about surf culture and history reading magazine articles searching the net about surfing, trying to find movies about surfing...For me, and for any other surfer there is no such a thing as a bad movie about surfing.If it speaks about it, if there are scenes of surfing ...its good enough for me, but Point Break was really great. Compliments for the director,I thing that timing was great,every death on this movie was timed perfectly,roach, Nathaniel and grommet were great and the lines are amazing.I especially liked that silent spiritual music while Bodhi surfed and Tyler talked about him. Anyway what I wanted to say is that I watched this movie for more than 500 times now and for me, the only Croatian surf stoked loner its kind of comforting to hope that somewhere on the beaches of L.A. there are groups of surfers just like Bodhi and guys(except for robbing banks part),soul surfers who live for riding waves and dream of next awakening of senses they'll experience in ocean.It also makes me sad that this movie isn't reality cause I really think they made Bodhi great,I really have found myself in him and it would be great to be in his crew.My question is , if anyone who's reading this is from California, is how are surfers there, are soul surfers majority, and are there any gays like Bodhi?I'm coming to Cali next school year to be a senior on a high school exchange program(Face the world foundation)but I'm not sure exactly where in Cali cause they haven't found host family yet but I'm hoping for Huntington Beach,I don't know why but that town is my very favorite place in the world.

It is about trying to find your own personal freedom whilst battling against a system that, despite the many freedoms it provides, still tries to keep you on a tight leash. It is about the never ending struggle of good vs. evil. The end scenes being a total moral dilemma for Johnny. What would you do if you were him? Also it is about one mans love for another woman. He goes against everything he believes to be right in order to stay with her. I mean, he jumps out of a plane without a parachute in order to save her!!!. Now that is true love!!

317,pedrohenrryki,The most exciting action film of the 90s,8,25 July 2020,"Energetic and insatiable are the two characteristics that define this totally off-axis action film. The constant search of the characters of Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze (both are sensational here) for emotion and sensations that transform the world into something else is what guides the film. And that is what Kathryn Bigelow's outstanding direction accomplishes with great awareness and mastery. With the camera in constant motion and a plot that may not even be very original, but that manages to create dynamism to the film, Bigelow films everything always seeking to take the most epic and exciting that can be taken from that reality, it is a stylization that creates a kind of transcendentality that comes through the senses and that affects the characters without the need to deform the real. The enchantment is so great that the plot itself, the notion of right and wrong that is the starting point of the film, ends up functioning only as a pretext for everything to happen.

319,bmpm1,Mind game -- and action!,9,5 August 2012,"There's bad-ass bank robbery and cool surfing. But what makes this movie great is the mind game between the characters. Kudos to W. Peter Iliff for writing the movie and to Kathryn Bigelow for the direction. If you haven't seen the movie yet, stop here, as the rest of this review is a spoiler.If you've seen the movie, take a moment to think about what's going on in the minds of the characters.Think about the scene that takes place in Johnny Utah's apartment after he failed to chase down the gang of masked bank robbers. Utah records a message to his girlfriend, time passes, he hears the bell, comes to the door, says her name, opens the door and we see... the surfers themselves.That is such a great moment. First, it's totally unexpected. Second, we get a deja-vu -- it's a familiar sight -- we've seen a previous scene when surfers come to Utah's apartment uninvited. Third, and most importantly, we immediately sense that something's wrong. After Utah witnessed them doing the last robbery, why do they now show up in his apartment acting like nothing's happened? That's the awesome part. Think about what's going on in the minds of the characters: * Utah knows that the surfers are the gang of bank robbers * the surfers know that Utah is an undercover FBI agent * Utah knows that the surfers know that Utah is an undercover FBI agent* the surfers know that Utah knows that they are the gang of bank robbers * but Utah doesn't have a proof that the surfers are the robbers * the surfers know that Utah doesn't have a proof that they are the robbers * Utah knows that the surfers know that Utah doesn't have a proof that they are the robbersBut they engage in a mind game, because they both have something to achieve:* Utah wants to keep hanging on with the surfers, because that provides him with an opportunity to gather information where they would go in case they ""disappear"" and also gather proof that they are the bank robbers * Bodhi (the leader of the surfers) wants to keep hanging on with Utah, because he wants to ""handle"" the situation of the undercover agent. At this point, it is not revealed to the audience what Bodhi is planning to do. Bodhi is leading the game at this point and we are all pondering at how the story will unfold.And there are other important rule of the game: Utah shouldn't confront the surfers with the fact that he knows that they are the bank robbers and the surfers shouldn't confront Utah with the fact that they know that he is an FBI agent. That's because the interaction may get too confrontational and unpredictable then and either party may walk away.A crucial component that makes that mind game possible is that by now a bond of mutual understanding has formed between the two main characters. So at this point: IT IS RATIONAL TO BOTH UTAH AND THE SURFERS TO KEEP PLAYING THEIR ROLES AND UPHOLD THE MASQUERADE EVEN THOUGH THEY BOTH KNOW THAT BOTH SIDES ARE FAKING.THAT'S AWESOME.And the mind game gets truly spectacular when they are on the plane and about to jump out and Utah asks ""who packed my chute?"". He knows that the surfers would benefit from him dying in an mock ""accident"". And Bodhi understands that Utah has a rational reservation here, so he offers him his chute -- and even offers him to pick anybody else's chute. By doing that he's saying ""no, killing you in a mock accident is not why I've brought you here, I have something else in mind"". But he doesn't have to say that. Utah understands. That's awesome.And there's the awesome moment when Utah tries to ""undo the spell"" by shouting ""I AM AN F-B-I AGENT!"" to the surfers. But it doesn't work -- the masquerade and reality have blended by now.Everything in the movie prepares us for this. The characters are revealed step by step, as we are shown that they are capable of understanding the game and willing to take the risk of participating in it: * Pappas (Utah's FBI partner) calls the gang ""the most professional he has ever seen"". * Bondhi is called an ""adrenaline junkie"" by his former girlfriend. * Utah's boss mentions that Utah graduated from the cadet school within the top 2% -- which demonstrates his ambition and intelligence * Utah tries to surf without any training -- and almost drowns -- which demonstrates his dedicationNone of that is accidental in a movie, it's the hard work of the writer, the director and everyone else involved in the film.

At least that could in some way justify Johnny failing to stop and arrest Bohdi at the end of the foot chase, or getting in the way of Pappas taking Bohdi down at the airport (which resulted in Pappas being killed).Why, after letting Bohdi go, did Johnny spend so much time and effort tracking him down in Australia?

325,alejandrobovino,Neat movie,10,4 January 2020,"It is a mythical film for all those who, being young, had the opportunity to see it, I remember legions of unconditional and although I was not among them I remember that I liked it too. It is normal that if you are 17 years old and you see it you like it, the real problem is that if you are already thirty-many and still have it as a fetish movie then you have not evolved intellectually the least. There has been no real growth inside.That does not take away, of course, to say that within the action cinema of the last fifteen years and from which at the beginning of the 1990s it began to emerge, it is one of the best by far.The action scenes are very successful and we have several among the best I remember.
The merit belongs to the director who has more than indisputable expertise. Miss Kathryn Bigelow who had an affair with Keanu Reeves while filming the movie has a different sensibility in action movies that I don't find among male colleagues who practice that genre.From his filmography I prefer ""K-19"" which is a much more mature and round work, however normal people prefer the more youthful and less political since they understand it better.Of the actors I stay with Patrick Swayze, although the girls like Keanu Reeves more. And special attention to some secondary more than correct.The script is much more careful than is usual in this type of tape and it shows for good in the plot that is plausible (as far as it can be) and in the action scenes that are almost always appropriate.Of course, all this does not mean that you have to prepare the traca and launch rockets as some do for ""They call him Bodhi"" (title certainly more fortunate than the original version).
We are facing a prototype MTV movie. Surf, cute boys and girls, beach and cops running and hitting shots. The film is purely genre and therefore not extrapolated to the real cinema there six and not a nine that if we were voting action cinema would only give.Of course, if you are young and have not seen it, I envy you and if you are older, take a look because it will entertain you for sure and even if it was simply because people are encouraged to play sports -",Point Break

334,gohysong,Point Break review,9,12 October 2016,"Point Break is a great movie because its plot, characters, and action scenes. Point Break was made in 1991, and is considered to be a 90s action classic. Kathryn Bigelow, the director, did an amazing job directing this film and making it such a memorable movie. The movie stars well known A-list actors Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze, and Gary Busey. All three stars give great performances, which helps this film reach its status as a classic. Point Break follows FBI agent Johnny Utah, as he is assigned to investigate a group of bank robbers called the Ex-Presidents. His partner, agent Pappas, tells Utah that he believes the bank robbers are a group of surfers who rob banks to support their surfing. As Johnny Utah goes undercover he meets named Bodhi. Bodhi is an adrenaline junkie who believes it's not tragic to die doing something you love. As agent Utah becomes closer to the group of surfers he is investigating, he realizes that they are the group of bank robbers that the FBI is looking for. When trying to arrest them during a robbery, the group of surfers realize that Johnny Utah is a FBI agent and have to take a different approach to the situation.The film is very fast paced and keeps the audience fully engaged throughout the movie. For the group of bank robbers, life is about catching the next wave. The audience experiences this statement with multiple surfing and skydiving scenes. The action sequences are perfectly executed to make audience member feel like they are their experiencing the stunt with the characters. The story flows naturally with these scenes to create an exciting movie experience. The plot takes the audience on a ride that has multiple twists and turns that keeps them guessing and wondering what is going to happen next. There are plenty of movies that are about a group of bank robbers, yet Point Break gives a story about bank robbers that feels authentic and fresh. There are multiple external and internal conflicts that have different consequences that affect the plot. The characters that are introduced are a reason this plot works so well in this movie.The characters are one of the best parts of Point Break. The main character, Johnny Utah, has many characteristics that make him a compelling character. The audience watches him go through conflicts that change him and the opinion that the audience has of him. Bodhi, the antagonist, is a very persuasive character. He persuades other characters to do things they don't want to do, or do things that seem absolutely insane. Even the audience can get behind his reasoning for living the lifestyle that he chooses to live. Patrick Swayze does a phenomenal job conveying this character. The way the characters interact with each other is also done great by the actors. Even the minor characters are well written and entertain the audience.Point Break's director executes the cinematography almost flawlessly. The film has great camera angles in all of its scenes, even the complex fast paced action sequences. There is a chase scene between two characters that presented and shot perfectly. There are no mistakes with lighting or sound that distract the viewers.Point Break is a great film that I definitely recommend people to watch if you like action, surfing, or crime/thriller movies. This film fits into multiple genres, and can appeal to lots of people. I would rate this movie nine out of ten stars because it is not a perfect movie, but it was one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. It's a movie that will have you thinking after the about the character's motives and the decisions they make. That is a characteristic that great movies achieve. Point Break was made in the 1990s, but it is one of those rare films that can still entertain audiences years from when it was originally made.",Point Break

In my mind, the only reason this gets 1 star is that Patrick Swayze fits the ""surfer dude"" mentality very well (and that it ended).Unfortunately, there are no other positives.This is probably one of the worst, if not THE worst, acted film of all time (it doesn't try to be, either, thus making it worse)- and the actors just don't get any help from the screenplay. There is a young Keanu Reeves, a Special Agent, who goes undercover with surfing bank robbers, and delivers such crucial lines to the villain as ""You crossed the line. People trusted you and they died. You gotta' go down."" There is Patrick Swayze, the villain surfer dude who dresses up like a president to rob banks for the fun of it, who finds out there's a cop in his crew. What does he do? He takes him skydiving! Let's not kill him, hold him hostage, or even run to another city, guys, let's take him on a grand adventure he'll never forget! Maybe he'll forget to turn us in! There is Gary Busey (but don't get your hopes up) as an angry old cop, especially when he punches a fellow cop in the head because he ""didn't respect his elders"" in any of his three lines the whole movie.And best of all, there is a passionate ending scene in the pouring rain, as Special Agent Johnny Utah approaches Bodhi, the person he once, kind of considered a friend, and Bodhi announces ""Special Agent Utah, I knew I could count on you!"" Touching, considering the relationship between them in the entire movie consisted of either Bodhi crashing Utah's sleep to take him somewhere, or the two of them pointing a gun at each other. Yes, Patrick Swayze, you really did count on him.Other than the major actors, there's a guy who proudly announces that he hopes to ""not live past 30"" yet seems to forget this when he actually begins to die. And Tyler Endicott, who falls for Johnny Utah, apparently just disregards that he lied (pretty much from the moment they first meet) in order to solely use her to get to her ex-boyfriend.The bottom line is- there are plenty of movies that focus on undercover cops, action, love, and even surfing out there. Please get one of them, because should you choose ""Point Break"", the rest of your day will be in deep anger over why you saw this movie. Please, heed my warning, and watch something- anything else.",Point Break
337,carashley8,great movie!!,7,20 October 2005,"I actually watched point break for the first time just a few weeks ago. I thought it was going to be a boring old movie and it turned out to be great. Keanu Reeves was awesome and so was Patrick Swayze. They played their roles with such passion as if the viewer was almost there in each and every scene. Watching them surf was fun, especially when Reeves was learning. I am not a surfer so I could relate every time he fell off the board attempting to catch a wave. The first time the viewers saw Lori who played Tyler you would have no idea about the connection she plays in the movie. One of the main parts I loved was when the First Ladies robbed the banks. It was suspenseful trying to figure out who it was. I caught on, but I'm not going to tell you. The whole correspondence between the friends and the criminal/cop was interesting. It was the classic question of "" Do you chose a friend over the law and your job?"" Hope you watch the movie and enjoy as much as I did. I'd love to tell more but I may give it away.",Point Break
338,Kao_Sato_Ijyu-in,Very impressive Movie,9,12 June 2017,"This movie was describes about relationship as unusual and delicate friendship between 2 men. The sky diving scene was so beautiful. Music was effective. Keanu Reeves was very shiny. (I have a talk with Keanu about the film at Suzuka, after 8 hours endurance race-Suzuka. He said, ""That was very long time ago..."" He was so nature and kind person.) ... I miss about Mr.Patrick Swayze.. Rest in Peace...",Point Break
339,imit-05833,Good scene in this movie,7,26 June 2017,"I think the best part of this movie is after Utah(Keanu Reaves) discovered who the bank robbers were. During his undercover mission in which he tried to get closer to some surfers in order to get some information, he learned how the leader of the bank robbers(Patrick Swayze) thought. Actually, he could have killed him because he had a lot of chances to do it. However, he didn't dare do it because he spent time with the bank robbers and felt sympathy towards the leader. For example(spoiler) in the final scene where he succeeds in putting handcuffs on him but then unlocks it and lets him go into the sea to surf one last wave and kill himself in nature instead of letting him get arrested. I like this story, however, what I don't like was his position. As far as he is a police officer, he has to save people but in one scene they robbed a bank with him, he was just standing and doing nothing. He could have done something. When some people were injured by them, he should have taken action. Therefore, I think it's good that in the last scene of this movie, he throws his police ID toward the shore.",Point Break
340,elmejorlira,It deals with an FBI agent temptation of freedom provided by a mysterious figure,8,26 June 2017,"This movie is an action heist film directed by Kathryn Bigelow. It stars Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze in the roles of Johnny Utah and Bodhi respectively. The film's story is about a series of bank robberies committed by Bodhi's crew around the country, and Utah is tasked with bringing him in.Keanu Reeves is great for the character he was given, clearly elevating the material and making Utah more than your typical boy scout. But it is Swayze's Bodhi who steals the show as he has a more shady and ambiguous character to play with, and he clearly knows this because he chews the scenery in every scene that he is in. The set pieces in the film are astounding and awe-inducing. The action in the film is very well shot and the R rating is used well, so the screen doesn't fill up with gratuitous splatters of blood.The 2015 remake compared to this seems rushed,because in that movie they just want to get the next action scene as quickly as possible, and they don't let the film take a break from all the action.With a solid plot and likable characters I give this film 8 out of 10 stars stars.",Point Break
341,ludoaleeli,Adrenaline and romance,9,26 June 2017,"Point Break is an action crime movie directed by Kathryn Bigelow. The title refers to the point in the sea where the waves break allowing people to surf them. That is one of the cornerstones to the movie, surf, but there is much more: romance, crime and sacrifice, which made this film worth screening.A young FBI agent infiltrates a group of surfers he suspects of bank robbing but finds himself more involved than he would like, developing a complex friendship with Bodhi, the leader of the gang and falling in love with Tyler, the girl who taught him to surf. Agent Utah is finally divided between his duty and his emotions when he has to make impossible choices.The action sequences have been handled in a visually arresting manner, still impressive 26 years later, while the romantic scenes, with the dark lighting of the night, are incredibly sweet.This story is perfect for those in need of a dose of action and adrenaline. Johnny Utah, with his ethical questions, never gives up and keeps us in suspense until the real end.",Point Break
342,alrmad-20517,friendship with the waves,7,26 June 2017,"Point Break, the movie is a good watch. I didn't really like the plot but it's considered better than most modern plots. I liked how the story didn't concentrate on one part but gave every part the time it deserved.On the contrary, modern movies always concentrate on only one part though they have more variety of scenes and sometimes they are spectacular but most of them lose the point of the movie and the plot, so it's like they have no plot at all.What I liked most about the plot is: the relationship between the protagonist and the villains especially their leader, but I didn't really like the leader character that much. It really got to me what he did at the end of the movie it was kind of a stupid ending, and I hated the way he tried to silence the hero and how the hero acted, but overall it was a good movie that deserves to be watched.",Point Break
343,rvtwax,bank robbers and policeman,7,26 June 2017,"Point break is a lot of fun. It is really enjoyable. you can see it with your family, partner, even with your dog. I would say it is a nice movie and it makes you want to go to the beach and surf. There are a bunch of scenes in which the leading character and sub are surfing. Basically, this is a romance story and bank robber story combined. A policeman who is working the case about really ridiculous bank robbers figures out that they are surfers from a secret camera in a bank. To get info about the bank robbers, he pretends to be a surfer and int he meantime runs into one attractive girl who will cause a lot of......that is scene you will enjoy. What makes the film special is the leading actor who was fabulous. You will definitely have fun and with it.",Point Break
344,stalhoun420,Watch it (bkbkbk420),9,18 August 2019,Ive seen literally tons of movies. This is in my top 5 of all time. That is all.,Point Break
345,Buster_Lu_Productions,100% Utah...,10,12 March 2006,"The best movie EVER!!!!!! Everything I have ever wanted in a film, Keanu, Lori, Patrick and surf, who could ask for more. I would say this film has current meaning in todays society, it will last forever in the hearts and minds of all it has touched. Normally, I would illustrate my argument with something negative, to show that I have a well rounded opinion, so here it is...Keanu can't act very well, but you what??? Who cares!?!?!Who needs to act when you are looking like that? Sometimes I even watch it with the sound down!I have seen it 1000 times in the past decade and it never gets old NEVER! First line of the movie: ""100% Utah"" Last line of the movie: ""He's not coming back...""",Point Break
