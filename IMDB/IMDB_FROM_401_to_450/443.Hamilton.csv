0,MartinHafer,How much you enjoy this is highly dependent on your age.,8,4 July 2020,"Yesterday, a bazillion folks tuned in to Disney+ to see the debut of ""Hamilton""...a recording of the Broadway show back in 2016. Because it's not a traditional movie-style musical, it's pretty difficult to compare it to a typical film in the genre. It's also a film whose enjoyment definitely depends on your age. I am in my mid-50s....hardly the age to like hip-hop style music in a musical. But, despite this, I did respect what the show was trying to accomplish--to bring America history to the masses AND to make it more accessible to minorities as most of the parts were played by Black and Hispanic actors and actresses. So, while having the likes of George Washington and Aaron Burr played by black actors isn't historically accurate, it does help make history more inclusive....as did the very modern music. And, as an ex-history teacher, I am thrilled about these things even if I wasn't all that fond of the singing. Well worth seeing....and a nice chance to publicize a few nearly forgotten great Americans.",Hamilton
1,TheLittleSongbird,Musical history,10,13 July 2020,"'Hamilton' was a major surprise for me when seeing and hearing it. Music is such a big part of my life, being now a semi-professional singer and raised into a musical family, and am a fan of musicals, especially the golden age ones. History was also one of my favourite and best subjects in most of my up and down school life, until it didn't work out in sixth form when my confidence went and my comprehension and drive worsened. So having a musical to combine the two immediately intrigued me, despite not being the biggest fan of the dominant styles here (was raised on classical music and opera personally).That is what was meant when saying that 'Hamilton' was a major surprise. Hearing that a filmed version of a production was coming to Disney+, which has been a much needed distraction, there was no doubt in my mind about seeing it. So that the mix of history and music, the meaningful and relevant lyrics, the brilliant performances and the energy and heart it has can be revisited again. It does play fast and loose with history, blame that on the musical and not the production, sure and the style(s) of music that dominates the score here are not my first choices usually, but actually for its entertainment value, emotional impact and how well crafted it is as an overall whole, 'Hamilton' was a real winner. As was this production. Which was very much needed after suffering through 'Artemis Fowl', a musical surprise adapted masterfully and so accessibly and through a particularly unsettling time in a terrible few years.It, the production that is, looks great. The sumptuous and true to the respective periods costumes especially and the setting is not too elaborate or overblown while still never looking cheap. Personally thought that the production was very well filmed, certainly compared to other filmed productions of musical theatre, opera and ballet seen and have seen many of each (being a major fan of all three). It made me feel like a member of an audience seeing it live, expect seeing it far more accessibly in terms of money and locations. Which is what is so great about these live/streamed performances and they have proven to be invaluable. Of which 'Hamilton' has been a big highlight.Musically, 'Hamilton' is on point. Those that don't like the styles are best staying away unless wanting to see what the hoopla is all about, but as someone that saw it with an open mind and wanting to stretch even more my musical horizons 'Hamilton' made me appreciate hip hop and rap much more because they were so well done in their own way. When they are well done and not too repetitive or preachy, yes it is dependent on how they're executed in my view rather than any bias towards the styles, that is when it is easy to appreciate them and that is what 'Hamilton' excels so well in. Also found it very well accompanied.What also comes over brilliantly is how 'Hamilton' is written. The musical and performance are very song heavy, which some may not like dependent on what your feelings on musicals, hip hop and rap are (some love it, others hate it and it is all down to taste which is fair enough). Found the melodies very clever and easy to remember, amazing considering how many there are and not an easy thing to achieve these days. It was the lyrics though that made a bigger impression on me, these lyrics were vastly entertaining and also at times quite emotional but what is just as admirable are their honesty and how relevant they are. These are lyrics that are likely to connect for many, and from the sounds of it have done. Historically, it is far and loose but that didn't matter for me being somebody that watched not expecting a history lesson. 'Hamilton' does very well at making people more interested in history and the particular time periods depicted, that is from my experience from seeing it with people that felt exactly the same as me. What is great about this production is how it does so well in being true and capturing the spirited energy and heart of the musical itself, which is what filmed adaptations of musicals in my mind should do.Really loved 'Hamilton's' performances. Have seen both love and hate for Lin Manuel Miranda's performance. Personally loved his work here, he was very heavily involved in making 'Hamilton' work, his dilligent efforts very much obvious here, and he gives the equivalent of the performance of his life here. He is charming and has great authority and comic timing and really do disagree that he doesn't have singing ability, he proved in 'Mary Poppins Returns' in my view that he could and he does great in this regard too. Dramatically he is the stuff of legends as is the joy that was Leslie Odom Jr. Daveed Diggs brings tremendous energy in Act 2 especially and Jonathan Groff is absolutely hilarious here. Phillipa Soo and Renee Elise Goldsberry shouldn't be overlooked either, Soo is especially good. Okieriete Onaodowan has great chemistry with Diggs and holds his own against him when they're together, especially as Madison.Concluding, truly brilliant in my view. It won't be for all tastes but even if one is put off by the first twenty minutes if not knowing what to expect my advice really is to stick with it. It is not worth certainly not bragging about turning it off about 15 minutes or something, that is the equivalent of barely seeing it. One of the easiest 10/10's given recently.",Hamilton
2,Hitchcoc,A Great Representation,10,4 July 2020,"Having seen the play and loving it, I was set for a disappointment. No chance. With the one limitation of being confined to a screen, the portraya was extremely well done. With a minimum of close-ups, the filming of the staging worked well. The sound was very good, few words lost. Since this was the original cast, we got to see the thing at its best. I will leave it to others to get into the plot details. I was intrigued from beginning to end.",Hamilton
3,Prismark10,Hamilton,9,18 July 2020,"One critic recently wrote a list of three great musicals that must be seen on stage. Hamilton was one of them.To my surprise, I have seen all three of those listed. Mind you I have only seen three musicals live on stage in my life so far. What a coincidence!I went to see Hamilton in London's West End because my kids were keen to see it. They may not know much about American history but they knew the songs by the time we got to the theatre.I did tell them if they were so keen on Hamilton, I would had pointed out where he was buried the last time we visited New York. As I did study American history, I was aware of Hamilton and especially the circumstances of his death.I did enjoy the West End show although you have to concentrate hard on the songs. Not only some of the rap parts go fast. The lyrics convey a lot of information like setting up a constitution or how to win a revolutionary war.This Disney presentation was actually filmed four years ago with the original Broadway cast. It is essentially a stage presentation in front of an audience. I understand that the British version had some slight differences with a bigger role for George III.Like the stage play Amadeus. The setting is the rivalry between Founding Fathers Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. It spans pre revolutionary America to well after independence was gained. I noticed the rivalry was more profound watching it onscreen. This time noting that one of the signature song's, My Shot has a more layered meaning.The set for Hamilton looks remarkably simple and plain. Yet is it so cleverly constructed, some of it requires split second timing from the performers. It was astonishing watching this on television just how slick it all was.As for the cast, Lin-Manuel Miranda has become world famous as he not only plays Hamilton. He wrote the book, songs and music. The more showy role is Daveed Diggs as Talleyrand/Thomas Jefferson. It is Leslie Odom Jr who steals it as the 'Salieli' like Burr. The man who never gets to be in the room where it happens, where the big decisions are made.I was mildly amused that the American audience appreciated Jonathan Groff's King George each time he appeared with his barbed lyrics.Hamilton is a world away from the traditional musicals. This one has a modernity as seen by the music and its casting. Maybe that is a reason why it has proved to be popular with a younger audience. My daughter went back to London some months later to watch it again with her friends.",Hamilton
4,classicsoncall,"""My name is Alexander Hamilton.""",8,28 December 2020,"Well, I don't really know how to evaluate this picture. It's not really a movie, but a filmed production of stage play before an audience with the original Broadway cast. I'm not really big on musicals to begin with, and when you tamper with historical accuracy it's a bit much to take in. So on one side, there's no denying the amount of work and effort that went into this effort. The energy level, costuming and lively presentation all make for a richly entertaining experience for those who enjoy this type of spectacle. On the other hand, retooling history with an agenda of diversity doesn't sit well with this viewer, so it was difficult to maintain any semblance of an attention span. Based solely on it's value as an entertainment vehicle, the movie deserves a top rating, but given my reservations about it's substance, I'll be fair minded and offer my rating of '8'.",Hamilton
5,blanche-2,what a treat,10,6 July 2020,"How incredible to be able to see this show on TV instead of going to New York and spending $800.After watching it, I wished I had seen it live. A production came to my home town and the last row in the balcony was the aforementioned $800.Anyway, this is a fantastic and memorable show, all the more important for maybe getting a few kids interested in a) historical characters; and b) Broadway/musical theater.The music is not my demographic, but there are many different styles, and I loved some of the songs. The lyrics were clever. I think Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius.What I love is the originality, the expansiveness, the singing, the choreography, but most of all the incredible energy of the cast and story.For people who have no interest in seeing our forefathers dancing and singing, I say, watch it anyway. I wasn't interested either. It is fabulous.",Hamilton
6,grantss,"Brilliant: highly entertaining, edifying and creative",9,7 February 2021,"The Broadway play of the life and times of Alexander Hamilton, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and first US Secretary of the Treasury.A brilliant combination of history, music, song and dance, telling the story of one of the most influential, yet lesser-known, figures in United States history. Writer-actor Lin-Manuel Miranda wonderfully weaves contemporary music and lyrics into 18th century history and the result is fantastic. Such incredible creativity on Miranda's part, aided by superb casting and performances and spot-on musical accompaniment, making for a highly entertaining production.Quite educational too, as you're learning about history in a very fun, engaging way. The plot explores well the character of Hamilton, his strengths and weaknesses, and also captures some interesting themes. The conflict between the politicians who are only in it for power (represented by Burr) and those that want to do something constructive (Hamilton) is well examined.As mentioned, the casting and performances are superb: nobody puts a foot wrong. Miranda, as Hamilton, is the obvious stand-out but Daveed Diggs as Thomas Jefferson and Marquis de Lafayette almost steals the show. The scenes with King George were also very memorable and for that Jonathan Groff (of Mindhunter fame) deserves a lot of credit.All this describes the play, but what about the movie? I knew before watching this that this wasn't a film version of the play but a live performance of the play, filmed. I had been hoping that it was a film version, so was a bit disappointed when I discovered that it is a filmed play, as most filmed plays I've seen seem distant and don't have the engagement of a feature film.However, I needn't have worried. Through the use of close-up shots, several camera angles and, in general, high quality production techniques, director Thomas Kail (who is director of both the play and the film) manages to turn the play into something approaching the feel of a movie. The sound quality is excellent, down to stereo effects on the musical numbers.Brilliant.",Hamilton
7,ferguson-6,just superb,9,4 July 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. You know what it's like when people start talking about some great new restaurant that just opened (think back to pre-pandemic)? And then you start to hear your friends and co-workers raving about it ... best 'steamed broccoli' (ok, insert your favorite entrée) I've ever tasted! Having been burned many times with high expectations, you remain skeptical, but make the reservation. Well, that's been me with ""Hamilton."" For almost 5 years, the hype was just too much. Surely folks were caught up in the frenzy, and peer pressure was such that no one would admit it wasn't all that. So, now I'm here ... throwing myself at the mercy of the Theater Gods. Thanks to Disney Plus, I only needed to invest a little (ok, a lot) of time, rather than a few hundred dollars for a ticket. This is me humbly admitting I was wrong. The show is fantastic, and I only wish my first viewing had been a live performance.Unfortunately (because of what I mentioned above) this can't be a comparison of a live stage performance and the film version. Instead, this will briefly outline what I noticed in the movie. First, and I believe this is key, the original stage director Thomas Kail is back to direct the film. It should be noted that the film version is a blend of a couple of recorded live shows, plus some recorded songs seamlessly edited in. This is the original cast doing what they do best, and the edits are imperceptible. Second, the main cast is filled with dynamic performers. In many stage shows, one or two actors are head and shoulders above the others. Not so here. At a minimum the top seven actors are as skilled and fun to watch as any you've seen. Third, this is a true musical in that the songs drive the story. Some of the early songs require serious concentration to catch the lines, but even if you miss some lyrics, the gist of what's happening is pretty clear. These aren't so much catchy sing-along types, but you'll easily recall the scenes when you hear the songs again at a later date. We see a perfect melding of music-performance-story.Of course most everyone knows that Lin-Manuel Miranda is the creative force behind the show. He credits writer Ron Chernow's book on Alexander Hamilton as the inspiration for the production, but it's Mr. Miranda that appeared on every talk show for a couple of years, and he also performs as Alexander Hamilton. Daveed Diggs has dual roles as the flamboyant Marquis de Lafayette and the equally flamboyant (at least here) Thomas Jefferson. Renee Elise Goldsberry takes over the stage with her powerful voice as Angelica Schuyler, and Chris Jackson is a dominating physical presence as George Washington. Jonathan Groff (from ""Mindhunter"") is absolutely hysterical and unforgettable as King George III, both through song and strut. Everyone will have their favorite performers, and truly they are all exceptional, and I'd like to point out the two that took my breath away. Phillipa Soo as Eliza Hamilton has a pristine voice that will bring tears to many eyes. She may not be as involved with the political elements of the story, but in the most emotional moments, she is front and center. Lastly, the passion Leslie Odom Jr brings to his role as Adam Burr is beyond description. He may be the ""villain"", but he makes Burr accessible and easy to understand ... plus Odom is a terrific singer and performer, and he lights up the stage.It's easy to overlook the dance and stage choreography since it's never over-the-top, but the dancers are terrific and the performers make great use of the single set - although props are regularly brought in and taken away. Perhaps what really makes this click as movie entertainment is the expert use of cameras and editing. We see the full stage when we should, and we are offered close-ups when it's most effective. I do hope to catch the live show at some point, but if my Hamilton experience is limited to this cinematic version, well ... ""that would be enough.""",Hamilton
8,DKosty123,Classic Diverse Cast Musical Hip Hopping on Stage,9,4 July 2020,"This 2016 movie of the stage show is excellent for a lot of reasons. The cast has a lot to do with that. Every cast member makes their role real and memorable. They do it smoothly. They earn the massive applause they receive for each number. It's easy to see why.This filming of a Broadway Stage show has been done in movie history, but only a few times as effectively. If you go back to silent films, ironically since Disney is producing this, the 1925 silent of Peter Pan (before Disney animated it) was really a film of the broad way stage show of Peter Pan. If you have never seen it, and can tolerate a silent film, you'd be surprised how effective that silent is filming the stage show.The cast pulls out all the stops here and the orchestra is heard but not seen doing excellent score music from the pit. Manuel's story from the real history is well done, and the songs and dancing fits perfectly. As for the politics, yes this show has ""Quid Pro Quo"" in it in 2016, way before it became a famous quote on the news before the Corona Virus. There's another issue mentioned here when on character states that America can't be expected to help every country in conflict in the world. We are really proving that now, so in 2016 while this was addressing Obama's foreign policy, regime change, now it is current because our US media is actively trying to change regimes in the world. The internet has made US media drunk with power, and it's not always for the good.I will say one thing is incomplete here. They mention some of the amazing stuff Hamilton's wife did after he died, but her story needs to be done someplace. She lived 50 years after her husband and did things many women should be proud of.Now as far as Slavery not getting a lot of attention, no story of history can be perfect. In fact, the longest serving slaves in US History are Women. Women could not vote until the 20th Century and it was the 1960's before they were no longer expected to stay home, not work, and be at the mercy of their husbands. Women are smarter though because instead of asking for pity and reparations, they have worked inside the system to improve it and we might be on the verge of a Black Woman Vice-President. (Possibly President as well) It's way over due.History has already been written and no amount of revision or destruction can change history. The fact is we need to look back at history and realize that ""The Future Matters."" If we fail to do this, we owe women more than we owe anyone else because of the past. I hope someone does a sequel to this and tells the whole story of Mrs. Hamilton. We owe her that.",Hamilton
9,cherold,"Conceptually impressive, but while I liked it, I didn't love it",7,10 July 2020,"I never had much interest in seeing a hip-hop Alexander Hamilton. I'm not big on rap (I'm old, after all). But since it came to TV I figured I'd take a look.It's a bold, brave, revolutionary work that I really admire, but it's also a bunch of people rapping, which meant I found it musically less engaging than something like Cabaret and also that I often had difficulty following the story, since it's actually a rap *opera* in which all the dialogue is rapped (or sung).The cast is very good, particularly Renée Elise Goldsberry and Leslie Odom Jr., who are electric. The weakest cast member, unfortunately, is the star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, who I don't believe could have landed the part of Hamilton if he wasn't the playwright. He's not awful, but he never catches fire the way others do.It's a very smart musical. It's beautifully staged (love that eye-of-the-tornado scene). If you like rap it's probably the best musical ever made. I probably would have liked it better with subtitles.",Hamilton
10,Cineanalyst,Theatrically Revolutionary; Cinematically Backwards,6,3 July 2020,"The play is great and even a filmed version removing much of the allure of a live performance to be offered for streaming has the benefit of reaching the masses, especially during the pandemic when theatrical venues are largely closed. But, Disney's boast that the filmed version ""combines the best elements of live theatre, film and streaming"" is wrong. This isn't film; it's a recorded stage production.Granted, such filmed plays, or live captures, have gotten better over the years, but besides some occasional virtuosity in an overhead view or a re-staged set-up absent an audience edited in, the multi-camera setup is basically a modest improvement on the three-camera system invented for TV sitcoms in the middle of the last century. The stage lighting isn't flat, but it's inconsistent as a result. There isn't the benefit of the single-camera style and individual lighting setups of cinema. Plus, most of the cameras are from a stationary position, and they're always of the same stage with barely altered furnishings between scenes. Even some of the actors play multiple roles. There's always the missing fourth wall; even when the camera pulls back to reveal the live audience, it's merely pushing that wall back. In short, this isn't a movie adaptation. For that, one needs to reconceive the play in cinematic terms--not just where to fit the cameras inside a theatre.Without going through a major studio process, the gold standard for such an adaptation to my mind is Guy Maddin's ""Dracula: Pages from a Virgin's Diary"" (2002), which took a ballet performance intended for TV and altered the production for cameras that rather danced in collaboration with the performers in a film that also stylistically matched the mute art form of ballet with that of silent film. Moreover, Maddin's film was actually shot on real film. The difference between these two recordings couldn't be more stark. It's like calling an episode of ""I Love Lucy"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) both motion pictures; it may be technically true, but they're not really the same thing.That said, the recording is sufficient enough for one to appreciate the brilliance of the theatrical musical, which does more than make founding father Alexander Hamilton cool enough to remain on the ten dollar bill. Adapting 18th and early-19th century history, as based on the book by one of the best popular biographers in the business, Ron Chernow, into a display of modern popular music and starring a largely non-white cast is aptly revolutionary and a reminder of America's multicultural history as a country of immigrants, enslaved and otherwise. That's history that continues to be lived and told. Kudos for that to Lin-Manuel Miranda, who also stars in the titular part. It also helps, of course, that the acting and songs are uniformly excellent (although, with the slight caveat that rhyming ""new,"" as in ""New York,"" with ""new,"" as in ""new man"" wasn't particularly creative), and that it's quite funny, to boot, especially if one is familiar with the early history of the United States. Among the supporting cast, I'm especially fond of Daveed Diggs's portrayal of Thomas Jefferson, including the cabinet meetings turned rap battles between him and Hamilton.The narrative, too, does well to establish Hamilton's relationship with Aaron Burr, foreshadowing the fatal duel. It also does its best to feature women, who, if they're not Betsy Ross or Abigail Adams, tend to hardly be mentioned in depictions of the American Revolutionary period. The play also does some interesting stagings equivalent to cinematic techniques in camera movement, tempo and montage. Actors move as if in slow motion sometimes. The floor moves characters around in lieu of crosscutting. So, indeed, enjoy streaming ""Hamilton,"" but let's not pretend that this is photographically brilliant as well. Hopefully, the musical will be truly transmuted cinematically someday.",Hamilton
11,cricketbat,"Complex, emotional, and lives up to the hype",9,13 July 2020,"There was so much hype surrounding Hamilton that I thought there was no way it could live up to expectations-and yet it does. The songs in this musical production are complex and emotional, and the story explains the history of our founding fathers in an engaging way. Yes, it would probably be better to see it on stage and no, it's not perfect, but I'm glad I was finally able to see Hamilton performed instead of just listening to the soundtrack.",Hamilton
12,ironhorse_iv,I was mostly satisfied with this musical that turn the world upside down. It was a good watch.,9,16 June 2021,"From its 2015 opening at off Broadway. The interesting new take musical by Lin Manuel Miranda about American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton received grand acclaim from both critics and audiences. The historical hip hop sung and rapped through show became so popular that for its several month-engagement, the event was always sold out. Because of that, those like myself whom were unlucky to find tickets had to wait years to witness that story. In 2020 that day finally arrived as Disney gain a live stage recording of the show. Rather than put that copy in theaters during the pandemic, they wisely put the viewing through their video on demand streaming service. It was an instant success as it became one of the most watched straight to streaming title of that year. While I was somewhat disappointing that it was just a three normal stage recording that happens to be stitch up together by editor Jonah Moran and director Thomas Kail rather than a sweeping new epic film full of extravagant real-life locations, expansive special effects and a large ensemble cast. The piece is certainly no cheaply done camcorder recording of a bare stage community theatre production. In the course of over three days of shooting, the movie captured the visual lighting and choreography very well. To add onto that, it was very well edited. The only clue that the movie was filmed from multiple shows was how Eliza Hamilton (Phillipa Soo) hair look between certain scenes. Yet it's really not that noticeable. I also dig that the movie more perspective. The overhead bird eye shot is one of them. It really works to show the out of body's experience of key moments in the play. 'Hamilton' as well feature some impressive turntables that rotate the stage floor that cleverly function to give a deeper meaning to the historical musical. It allows two scenes to play out at the same time symbolize the literally and mentally duel oppositive nature of the characters on stage; while the camera and the performers mostly remain stationary. If there was movement, the turntables gave a very surrealism visual moment of fate. One such example is the eye of the hurricane and the rewind sequence of the wedding told in the point of view of supporting character Angelica Schuyler (Renee Elise Goldsberry). Choreographer Andy Blankenbueller deserves a lot of credit for these amazing footwork movement on these turntables. Another cool thing that I notice after rewatching was how the stage's scaffolding represented the building of America. The brick work gets taller and larger as the play goes on. The background ensembles were also clever easter eggs. I like how one of them Ariana DeBose plays a key symbolism figure that always foreshadow death without once having an official title. Nonetheless, perhaps the greatest thing about this show is the theme of dual acting! The fact that nearly all of 'Hamilton' supporting performers plays multiply roles is awesome. It adds so much depth to the production. Especially full of energy and natural charismatic Daveed Diggs taking the role of friend and foe Thomas Jefferson and Marquis de La Fayette. Although some of the dual acting can be a bit awkward such in the case as actor Anthony Ramos performing as a small child after a good showing as John Laurens. The way he acts as Phillip, kinda makes it look the son was mentally challenged. To add onto that, the actual homosexuality rumors about Hamilton and Laurens being lovers also kinda hurts Ramos performance as Phillip, as viewers might forget that he's playing a new character. The relationship could come across as incest. As for the performers playing one title character. I have to say Leslie Odom Jr (Aaron Burr), Christopher Jackson as George Washington, Lin Manuel Miranda (Alexander Hamilton) and a cameo of Jonathan Groff returning as King George III really made this show worth a watch. As for the fact that a multiracial cast are playing the mostly white forefathers. I found the few mocking moments of outdated white stereotypical mostly harmless. It's certainly not as bad as the majority of whitewashing practices happening throughout the history of Hollywood. Yet I do get why some people think of the choice as racebending. It does seem like a gimmick. Still in the end although the play was based on historical events and people, using some dramatic license to rewrite history like that to hook modern audiences in was truly unique. Miranda did a good job making it entertaining. He adapted out certain key characters that would overtake the spotlight or hurt the pacing. Another thing Miranda did is make those who surround Hamilton's ideas a lot clearer; which in real life are a lot more questionable such in the case toward slavery and war, but perhaps the biggest historical inaccurate has to be the events that leading up to the famous duels. In real life, there was a lot more hesitation. Regardless I did like the uses of foreshadowing as counting to ten is the same melody used in previous songs. Talking about music. I love the different styles from 1960s British Invasion pop, standard epic rap battles of history to slam poetry. Too bad George Clinton's like funk wouldn't be incorporate into the play without disrupting the narrative. The break the fourth wall moments were also clever like Jefferson handing out a pamphlet even if it was future president James Monroe that led the investigation that almost cause a duel with Hamilton. A duel that was only prevented by of all people, a little more ambitious and less villainous Burr. Indeed ""Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story"". It really shows in the portrayals of characters regardless of history. Nevertheless, this play is lot better than '1776' and 'Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson' big time. Overall: Don't throw away your shot! Go see this musical. It's really good. If you had. You'll be back for sure! It's worth a rewatch.",Hamilton
13,briancham1994,I fell asleep,6,19 September 2021,"This is Epic Rap Battles of History writ large, which might work for a short video but wears off after a while. So the writing, singing and dancing is very talented, I won't deny that. However, the ""plot"" is chopped up into so many disparate episodes and tracking so many characters that it becomes a mess to keep track of.

14,Thanos_Alfie,Watch it...,8,15 July 2020,"""Hamilton"" is a Biography - Drama musical in which we watch the life story of one of the founding fathers and the first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. We learn more about him, his work and his life.I enjoyed this musical very much because of the songs, the plot which I found very interesting and of course the direction which was made by Thomas Kail. This Broadway musical is simply one of the best musicals I have ever seen and I am sure that everybody has to watch it.The interpretations of the cast were simply outstanding, especially Lin-Manuel Miranda's who played as Alexander Hamilton and he was simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Daveed Diggs' who played as Marquis de Lafayette / Thomas Jefferson, Leslie Odom Junior's who played as Aaron Burr, Chris Jackson who played as George Washington, Phillipa Soo's who played as Eliza Hamilton, Renée Elise Goldsberry's who played as Angelica Schuyler and Jonathan Groff's who played as King George.Finally, I have to say that ""Hamilton"" is an outstanding musical which can be considered as a masterpiece. I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that it will leave you speechless.",Hamilton
15,cruise01,Best seat in the house bringing a play onto the big screen.,7,5 July 2020,"Hamilton (3.5 out of 5 stars).Hamilton is a pretty fair musical film that brings a musical theatre play onto the big screen. Basically, catching the play on stage, the audience that is cheering and clapping, and the set design and lighting. The musical sequences are pretty fairly entertaining with flashy set pieces. And the dance choreographer is well done. I did find the movie to be overly long with its running time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. Showing every detail of the musical. While some of the repetitive musical sequences could have been trimmed and not affect anything with the story it is trying to tell.The cast is great. Lin Manuel Miranda did a great job. It does have a few good musical sequences. A good story. It may have overused a few musical sequences which added to its over long run time. Watching this did make it feel like you got the vip seat in theatre. Which they should try to bring other plays onto the big screen.",Hamilton
16,eddie_baggins,An original musical delight,9,17 July 2020,"Setting the stage world ablaze when it premiered and continuing to do so in years since its initial release, Lin-Manuel Miranda's passion project Hamilton has finally been made accessible to all thanks to Disney+, who have released a filmed version of the musical production onto their streaming service in light of their planned cinematic runs being cancelled due to the ongoing Covid-19 epidemic.Filmed by Thomas Kail and his capable crew at New Yorks Richard Rogers Theatre, this cinematic capturing of Hamilton reunites the original Broadway cast in stunning fashion as the life of one of America's founding fathers Alexander Hamilton comes to life in vivid form.When one thinks of stories just waiting to be adapted for the broadway treatment, that of Hamilton's and his work in the freedom of slaves, his battles in America's independence from Britain and his colorful love life doesn't seem like the most sure-fire of tales to be given a musical once-over but Miranda and his fellow-cast members, along with some mind-blowing stage play make this experience one you won't soon forget.While there's no doubt a slight decrease in the magic one would feel sitting in a live audience of this play, Hamilton as we get to witness in the comfort of our own homes still possesses great charm and character, with Miranda as Hamilton and the likes of Daveed Diggs, Jonathan Groff, Chris Jackson, Renée Elise Goldsberry and Phillipa Soo bringing their A-games to the play with countless set-pieces and showstopping tunes that will have you glued to the screen.At well over 2 hours, Hamilton is a long experience and one that wanes at brief moments but with its eclectic mix of hip hop styled music that molds with more typical classical tunes, its a unique offering that covers off numerous years in Hamilton's life as well as American history, all with a verve and energy not often found with such historically minded offerings.It's hard to fathom just how the various cast members and all the other added elements thrown in together managed to gel so well together or even how the cast could hit so many beats and dialogue cues, Hamilton the play and the film which we now get are both clearly examples moving forward of what the stage musical and the captured version of that can be.Final Say -A phenomenon for a reason, Hamilton as a play is unlike anything we've seen before and now this Disney+ movie manages to transport us to that world without us needing to remortgage the house to do so. Filled with a stunning array of incredible performers and career defining work from its leading man, Hamilton is an unforgettable experience for a variety of reasons.4 1/2 duels out of 5",Hamilton
17,SAMTHEBESTEST,A Broadway Musical Phenomena in Astonishing and Mind-Boggling Cinematic Experience.,9,25 July 2020,"Hamilton (2020) :A Broadway Musical Phenomena in Astonishing and Mind-Boggling Cinematic Experience. So, this is how it's done when you want to transform a live recording into Cinematic Experience. Hamilton is a lyrical and musical juggernaut which is more than enough to blow your mind even if you are not able to watch it in theatre. I have just finished watching this amazing show and i didn't even realise when those 160 minutes passed by. I have seen many musical classics from old Hollywood such as 'Star Is Born', 'Wizard Of OZ', 'Singin In The Rain', 'West Side Story', 'My Fair Lady', 'Sound Of Music' and 'Oliver' but all those were feature films and Hamilton is a live recording that's what makes it an astonishing achievement in musical genre. Another achievement for Hamilton is, it is musical from the first minute till the last and that makes it longest musical flick. I never thought any modern musical will grab me so tight and leave me speechless but Hamilton did this unimaginable thing. It's a biographical musical drama based on the life Alexander Hamilton, one of America's foremost founding fathers and first Secretary of the Treasury. Like i said many times the real life events make better and more dramatic conflicts than fictional writting and Hamilton is another proof of it. The first 40 seconds in the beginning scene and i was into it completely, i felt like i was sitting there and watching them Live and i didn't lose that feel for next 159 minutes. It kept coming and coming and i was keep blowing myself and i was like, i shouldn't blink or i will something and thanks to the subtitles which helped a lot to understand the accent. The kind of experience and atmosphere Hamilton created is hard to forget as even right now while writing this i just can't get over it. Each and every artist in this amazing show is more than amazing. I mean how did they do everything so accurately without compromising anything, without losing a single cent of essense. Hamilton is a Musical juggernaut i said but technically it is even more brilliant and how? When an electrical device like lights generate moods and fluctuates it then you know there is something special in it. The choreography derives moods and synchronises all the situations happening at different places and different times so nicely that it almost looks an impossible thing. And the cinematic impact it leaves is staggering. Thomas Kail's direction is absolutely Marvellous. I don't know how he crafted and set it up but i am totally blown away by his efforts. The choice of story is excellent too because it has everything what any freaking fantastic narrative needs. First we realise that Hamilton is an emerging Legend then we come to know about his extramarital affair and we start despising him and then we again start loving him when he confesses his sins openly. If it was a fictional writing then i would have never wanted his faithful and Lovely wife to forgive him for cheating on her but that's what actually happened in reality so i can ignore it. Among all the films have seen in 2020 Hamilton is the Best Movie so far and if it's eligible then i expect at least couple of Oscar dolls in worst case. Whether you are a music lover or not just don't miss this Musical Masterpiece !RATING - 9/10*",Hamilton

20,southdavid,All Rise.,8,7 July 2020,"Like the rest of the world, I watched ""Hamilton"" on Disney Plus this weekend. Though I have seen a number of stage musicals, I haven't seen ""Hamilton"" yet, so this was my first opportunity to see the highly regarded show and I have to say that it didn't disappoint.Alexander Hamilton (Lin-Manuel Miranda) rises up from extremely humble beginnings to play a key role in the American War of Independence. His life sees him befriend, and then rival, Aaron Burr (Lesile Odom Jr) as both a military leader and then a statesman in the burgeoning country. He marries Eliza Schuyler (Phillipa Soo) but his infidelity proves to be the undoing of his reputation and the end of his progress.So I want to consider the show and the production separately, to give a fair appraisal.First the show. I really enjoyed it. I've always harboured concerns that the style of music might be too much of a deviation from established musicals, but really it isn't. I initially didn't think that any of the songs were as instantly memorable as some other musicals, but in fairness I've been humming bits from several of them since. The first half of the show focuses on his military career and the second as he serves under George Washington establishing financial systems and his family life. My only issue with the show was that several actors play two roles on either side of the interval and I wasn't totally clear that they had changed. There's no one actor that I could single out for special praise, because frankly, everyone is fantastic and it's gratifying to see so many of these particular cast taking Broadway and Hollywood roles.The production is great though. Single stage setting, with two turntables in the middle helping to keep things dynamic. There's a wide establishing shot, from a production with an audience present, that the reactions are taken from. This is cut with a series of closer shots from an onstage camera that must come from a series of audience free runs, which provide another level of depth and intimacy that is otherwise impossible. It's honestly the way that all stage performances need to be shot from now on.No recording is ever going to capture what it's like to see a show live, with a reacting audience but this is as close as we're likely to get and it's wonderful that this particular version has been memorialised forever.",Hamilton
21,Vartiainen,History coming to life,8,19 October 2020,"It's one thing to read about these events in a history book. It's something else altogether to see it come to life in front of your eyes. Especially when combined with superb musical composition, clever lyrics and some of the best actors currently working on Broadway.Hamilton is the story of Alexander Hamilton, one of the founding fathers of the United States of America. He's not the first name that comes to mind when founding fathers are talked about, but he did serve as aides-de-camp to George Washington, became the first secretary of the treasury and was a key figure in the writing of the Constitution.He was also a poor orphan from the Caribbean who fought for every single success he had, a ladies man, a rascal and a renowned hotheaded duelist. And this is his story, warts and all.What I like about this film the most is the overall picture it paints. You get to know Hamilton a lot more personally than you would if you read about him in history class. This film gives context and substance to his decisions and his foibles. For example, it prominently features the Schuyler sisters, the daughters of a Revolutionary War general and senator Philip Schuyler, who were quite influential figures in their day, but who are not mentioned quite so often in history books.Not to mention that the film is a just a superb musical. I've rarely seen films that are just straight stage recordings, but this just might be the way to make them in the future. Because it works really really well.Very good as a musical, as a history lesson and as an overall story. Heartily recommended.",Hamilton

Not being a fan of hip-hop/rap music (or aesthetics), I was unsure whether I would willingly sit through two and a half hours of rhyming American history, but I enjoyed the movie. While there were some contemporary nods to contemporaneous injustices such as slavery, the film was more of a lively history lesson than the politically-correct revisionist iconoclasty that I half-expected. The music is fast-paced, driving, wittily rhymed, and memorable (although no instant earwigs like 'A Spoon Full of Sugar' - hear once, whistle for the rest of your life). The cast is excellent and the story of Hamilton's rise to prominence under George Washington and of the allies and enemies his political trajectory created is a fascinating story.",Hamilton

25,alindsay-al,A Fantastic Musical Production,9,8 July 2020,"So I originally wasn't going to watch or review Hamilton, but this broadway production has taken over the world so I sat down with my mum and watched the 2 hour 40 film of the production and here is my review for it. The premise of the film shows the story of Alexander Hamilton the forgotten Founding Father starting from his humble beginnings all the way to his death.
Main Character
Lin-Manuel Miranda plays Hamilton here and he is superb. This man is really talented, not only did he star here but he wrote all the songs, his singing voice is really unique and really works here. He brings plenty of emotion to his role, I really cared about him and thought he gave a truly brilliant dramatic performance. But he also was pretty funny here with some good comedic lines, what was also great is that Hamilton is a really interesting character, he isn't this generic good guy, he has plenty of flaws and he is portrayed as a normal guy which helps the show.
Supporting Cast
I must stress everybody here is truly fantastic, even the background performers are great but here are the ones that stood out to me. Leslie Odom Jnr plays Aaron Burr the seemingly antagonist here and I thought this guy really shined, the fact his character is called Aaron like me has nothing to do with it. He has a great singing voice and again like Hamilton the character is really multi layered and a fascinating part of this production. Phillipa Soo plays Eliza Hamilton and I really saw her as the heart of this production, her relationship with Hamilton is well done and you come out of this film wanting to learn more about her and see the things that she achieved in her own right. Chris Jackson playing George Washington for me was a huge presence on the stage he was a larger then life character and he did a great job in the role. A special shoutout to Jonathan Grogg who plays King George, he isn't in the production much but he was a showstealer for me making me laugh the hardest here.
Story
The story is really interesting, we have all heard of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson but I am not sure too many have heard of Alexander Hamilton so it was great learning about this historical figure. I mean I am not sure exactly how much was accurate but it was a really interesting story, and with this being a musical using song to tell this story really worked. It made it more fun and enjoyable to study but also managed to make the dramatic scenes feel really impactful.
Script
Yes, pretty much all of the dialogue here is sung, which is impressive in its own right. But for me this was a really well written film. As mentioned above the drama really worked for me and the sprinkling of humour in there just made the story and characters even more interesting.
Style
The style of the way they filmed this production is fantastic, it feels truly epic in its production and the way it is presented. All the songs are fantastically performed and I loved the different styles of music that was here, there is a mix of rap, RNB and dramatic musical and the blend suprisingly works really well. But with this production this film is a bit long, and I get that it is a muscial so it should be long but I felt like I was pretty tired by the end of the film.
Overall
Overall, this is a truly fantastic production that all musical fans will love. But honestly, I think people who aren't a Musical fan can love it too, as I am not a Musical fan and I truly loved this film and would reccommend it to everybody.",Hamilton

28,yusufpiskin,Absolutely brilliant,7,14 July 2020,"I don't think I have anything original to say about HAMILTON as musical theater. It's a real achievement! Fun, exciting, innovative and, at points, genuinely moving.I do have a few thoughts on HAMILTON as a historical narrative and as an ideological project, and I'll use my review to think out loud on both subjects.The HAMILTON narrative depends on stripping the American founding of much of its context. The only way to present the titular hero as a striving immigrant, for example, is to erase the fact that, at the time of Hamilton's arrival in New York from the West Indies, both were British colonies. This wasn't an immigrant moving to a new land, it was a British subject moving from one part of the Crown's domain to another. The only way to present Hamilton as straightforwardly anti-slavery is to ignore the fact that he married into a prominent slave-trading family and endorsed the constitutional compromises that insulated slavery from the national government. Hamilton's policy program - assuming continental debt, establishing a national bank - is divorced from his desire to tie the nation's financial elite to its political elite, which itself reflects his personal elitism, pessimism about the stability of republican government, and deep distrust of democracy.The Hamilton of the play is practically a contemporary, versus the real-life Alexander Hamilton, a complicated and challenging figure whose aims and views resist easy cooptation into one ideological perspective or another.Beyond the problems in the depiction of Hamilton, there is the reverent, uncomplicated view of the American Revolution. The decision to race-bend the Framers and their associates - which lends an air of radicalism to the proceedings - obscures the extent to which this is a wholly traditional vision of the Founding, focused on entirely on an elite cadre of wealthy owners of land and people. Black and Native people were pivotal to the Revolution, how it began, how it was fought, how it was resolved, but there are no black or Native characters in the play. It's a narrative where the revolution was fought for freedom from an unjust government, where the character of that injustice is left on the sidelines. In particular, we don't even get a hint of the influence of fear on creating the conditions for the break between London and its North American colonies: fear of native incursion; fear of slave insurrection; fear of the foreign powers who surrounded the colonies on all sides.Which gets to my thoughts on HAMILTON as an ideological project. Whether intended or not, it provides a pleasing, grade-school story of the American Revolution, a celebratory narrative in which the Framers are men to admire without reservation. Through its casting, it invites audiences of color to take ownership of that narrative, as if they should want to take ownership of a narrative that white-washes the history of the revolution under the guise of inclusion. HAMILTON is a daring an innovative musical, but as a cultural product about the Founding Fathers, it is conventional, even conservative.",Hamilton
29,Kdosda_Hegen,Just another musical broadway.,3,25 September 2020,"Not sure if I should have expected the same as from musical movies, since it's broadway in theatre and it has tons of limitations, but I've seen much better musicals so I guess I'm allowed to dislike this.
There are no non-musical moments here, all the scenes are songs. I believe it was extremely difficult to write the screenplay and even harder to perform to such perfection, but wouldn't it been more interesting if it was a historical film instead?
I'll admit that there's tons of risky stunts here, which I wonder how many times they had to practice before doing them live. The songs are pretty fun and cachy, there's also decent humor added in.
Still it's just another musical. Other musicals like Baby Driver, The Sound of Music and Dancer in the Dark are superior on almost everything, they manage to tell amazing story and use music and songs as plot element, not just singing and dancing at random moments, that's why ""generic"" musicals like Hamilton will never be as fun and interesting for me.Still, if you love musicals and go see them for the music and dances only, I can definitely recommend this to you.",Hamilton

31,questl-18592,Alexander Hamil-WIN!,9,8 July 2020,"This was an exciting thing for me. I, like most people, had heard of Hamilton. It was/is a HUGE phenomenon on Broadway and launched the careers of some incredible people. Miranda is always the fun, quirky, goofy musical wizard that pops up in shows now and then. Leslie Odom Jr. has always had this impishly wicked energy to him. Oh, and lets not forget Daveed Diggs, the up and comer who, after Blindspotting and a couple other things, I would watch in just about anything. Unfortunately, I live light years away from any decent stage so the odds of me seeing this in real life seemed like something that may just never happen. Enter the magical world of Disney and I am given the opportunity to finally experience the phenomenon myself, albeit not in the original form. Of course, with all the build up and all the hype, I was worried it couldn't possibly measure up.Now, to be perfectly honest, I knew next to nothing about this before watching it. I knew that Miranda created it, I knew Diggs was in it and I had some vague notion that it was about Alexander Hamilton, the founding father, and that it was a musical. I know that might seem like a lot and yet when this kicked off I felt completely blindsided by what I got. The music was catchy in a way I hadn't anticipated, to the point that I'm listening to the soundtrack right now as I write this out. The performances were full of life and energy and charisma, every character so wonderfully brought to life with Miranda and the performer's visions. Though, I have to say that Jonathan Groff as King George was an absolute scene stealer every second he was on stage.There are two magic tricks I think Hamilton not only pulls off, but pulls off effortlessly. First, the cast is remarkably diverse. This is never made into a ""thing"" or used as some tool to drive home some clumsy point in the way a lot of movies do, instead they're just people, people who do an exceptional job and I love that. I never once felt like a single person was miscast or not befitting their role and honestly, the fact that they never draw overt attention to it allows each actor to simply play their part exceptionally. Secondly, this draws attention to an imperfect man of great significance in American history that... Yeah, I'm sure I learned about him in school but honestly didn't know all that much about him. The fact that they essentially make something that's one part highly entertaining musical and another part educational and historical piece is wonderful.Negatives? I only really have one and it's sort've minor. There are a LOT of characters portrayed here and a lot of the actors play more than one role and it can be difficult at times to keep things straight. This is a fleeting issue, a few minutes after an actor steps into a new character and it's clear who they are, but there's that initial moment of 'Huh?' that can be briefly distracting. I get the feeling this is just a part of stage shows and I'm just the uncivilized dullard that doesn't know better but it is what it is.Now, as of me writing this, Hamilton is under fire and on the ever-growing cancel list. I don't agree with that. No, it doesn't focus on all of his faults, but Hamilton definitely doesn't portray Alexander as a saint by any means, not in my eyes. I think this absolutely worth watching and forming your own opinion on. Do the actions of the real man that died in 1804 mean that a 2020 musical can't be enjoyed? Can we judge the past with modern sensibilities? These are the deep, philosophical issues that this can bring out and I think these are discussions worth having. Personally, I separate the art from the inspiration and found this to be wildly entertaining. If you don't believe you are able or willing to do that, then your experience may vary wildly and that is perfectly alright by me.",Hamilton

Jaime and I watched this on honeymoon when we purchased Disney+ to watch another movie. We got our money's worth.I had issues getting into this at first. It jumped right in and we had minorities playing the founding fathers. I don't have issues there aside from certain things said. It could be something I missed heard, as this is a musical with a lot of the dialogue being sung. Once I got past that, it's interesting.There's a lot of historical facts here that I loved. It is interesting learning of Alexander Hamilton, what he did for our young nation and what he was willing to sacrifice, even if it hurt his family.This movie stuck with me longer than I expected.

Though Not Perfect For Me",8,4 July 2020,"The world of the playwright is a fascinating one, where the dark aspects of the classical theater are still able to take stage without so much as batting an eye. It's created stories that have been unique, often making staple works of art that not only show for months to years, but often remain in the memories of many. So given the state of COVID, as well as the limited runs with original cast and locations you can view it, I'll admit I've not been much into this venue. Disney + is trying to fix this by putting out the legendary Hamilton this weekend to let me check out.

Does it Capture the Spirit Of The Theater?SUMMARY:As I said above, the theater world allows so many stories to be told and in Hamilton, the lesser known founding father gets a nice entertaining twist and is certainly the fun experience you would think. Miranda's play has poise, charm, edge, and so many other factors that make the history of the revolution fun to watch/live in once again. Much of it has to do with clever writing, jabbing at the faults of the traditional life of history, but managing to not rub its name in the mud. The asides and breaking the fourth wall made me laugh the most, especially at how well most of it flows into the lyrics of the strong music that is heavy in this film. Miranda shows how you can be political without getting too far away from the point, writing power messages into the dialogue naturally and having the performance speak as opposed to making everything about the message (see modern Hollywood/life today). Hamilton takes all this cleverness and works it into its own style of poetry using the music style to emphasize so much I think he wanted and keeping the story moving through the decade or so of major historical moments and trying to develop the title character considerably. And all of this power is brought about talented production values that help pull you back in time to the founding of our country. A talented cast with names too extensive to include, brings up the various historical legends to new heights, attitudes and the spirit of revolution oozing out of their deliveries in the first act to inspire your own movement for change. While a second act opens up more of the devious side in a spoof/magnification of the temptation political power brings. All the costumes that reflect historical Colonial upbringing are there ready to help your eyes further accept the spectacle on stage so that you again put interest into the film.
Let's face it though it's going to be the numbers that will show up on the walls of social media soon enough. Hamilton's numbers are all about that attitude and inspiration that the modern times love, and it's those empowering performances that make up the meat of this play. The emotional fervor of both acts is in almost every word of the dialogue and it does not hesitate to show the attitude that the cast wanted to bring in this time period. Using the stage's confinement to the advantage, alongside the costumes, the dance numbers have a choreographed splendor that feels organic as movements turn back into characters just going back to normal movements. It works so well in seeing the fluid transitions from duels to dance and back again, and seeing a unique approach to the performance execution. The first act in particular does this well for me, and was the better act because of the energy, fervor, and coordination the revolutionary war got in the confined 1-hour time limit. Though the second act does accomplish a similar feel and certainly has less dancing, more coordination and the likes, I particularly think the first act is Miranda's shining achievement. However, that ending monologue is powerful, with words that struck home and broke the mold of the rest of the play's fervor, a nice sendoff that leave one thinking.Now here is the tricky part of talking about the dislikes, partly because I don't see many plays, part because of the hybrid movie/play, and partly due to the limitations of stage shows being streamed. Doing my best to be fair though, I can say that one of the big disappointments were some of the underutilized characters for me. Hamilton does a nice job working so many pieces through the set up, but there are several characters that held potential and showed promise that got dropped into the winds of a few songs before being lost to book footnotes. I had hoped for a little more integration and references, but understanding time constraints it's only a marginal dislike for me. What hit harder for me was more so dropping some of the plots they were working on, or perhaps rushing through them and keeping them merely one to two lines in the story. The development of Hamilton's child, the third sister, heck even some of the soldiers are all lost in quick tidbits through this rush through history. While it works in the rhyme scheme, I'm about stating if you are going to build up deliver on the end and I felt some of this was lost to the political prowess of the play. I guess if you know history well enough, you know the ending, and Miranda might have taken that into consideration when he wrote the book, focusing again on a Spark Notes version of Hamilton's life and accomplishments. This is why Hamilton has the focus, so you can try to get into his mind, while also driving the audience to do the changes that our forefathers did long ago before technology took over.
In regards to execution of the numbers well you've read I enjoyed much of the numbers. However, something this play failed to do for me was take breaks from the music and go back into dialogue to sort of give the actors time to flesh out the characters more. While good, I got tired of everything in a musical/poetry lyric, again missing key moments of tension and character building so that we can get more emotional music instead. Again, I'm unsure how other musicals work, something I have to study, but the plays I have seen have far more breaks between their performances instead of nearly just one giant musical delivery. Throw that in with if you are watching it on Disney+, the sound quality is kind of lacking thanks to the compressed file format the server uses. I found myself having to turn my speakers up more for the quiet phrases than I wanted to, only for having to turn it down again when the more energetic numbers came. Convenient as it is, I have to say that other streaming sites have got it down a little better, so I'll mention in hopes that Disney will improve upon their sound quality. Something else I as well would have liked, as I see in many musical numbers, is a more diverse soundtrack. Wicked, Avenue Q, Book Of Mormons are great examples where a genre can be seen in the musical styles, but there are slight changes and performance tweaks to make the numbers stand out. Not the case for on Hamilton. Outside of when Eliza's numbers came on, and a few moments where Hamilton's darker thoughts hit the scene, much of the numbers is the same sort of rap beat with a slight change in tempo to boot. Again, I get this was the focus of the play to have a rap play presentation, but doing it that way takes away from the originality of each track. Fortunately, King George's interventions stood out to me as comedic, a change in style to the show tune that stands aside from the rap. If your style of music choice is the rap, then this will not be an issue, because it's the perfect genre to get the emotions out and thanks to its ability to take poetry and spin it in new pieces. For me though, many of the numbers feel every much the same, and without bigger dance numbers or the usual grandiose manner I've seen in the few shows I've watched. In addition not changing up the backdrops, and relying on the one stage prop alone was again a dynamic I did not intend to watch. Lighting guys get the props for making the stage versatile, but again, Hamilton's journey through colonial times should have had more settings, but the reliance on a tiered stage means you use your imagination more than I had hoped. Finally, the ending number may have an amazing message to convey and does so well for mopping up the remains of the story, but it pales in comparison to the final numbers you usually see. Blasphemy I know, but after all the poetic majesty, after all the dynamic interactions, the last number I felt should have had pulled all the stops out to finish it strong.The VERDICT:I've rambled long enough so let's wrap this up for those looking for a quick summary. Hamilton is certainly an impressive display of creativity, wit, and entertainment that proves that you can find some great balance if you do your research and work. All the numbers hold such heart and fire, that the rap genre is perfect for helping maximize the wonderful messages I think Hamilton's life makes for. Amazing displays of acting, dancing, and singing blend beautifully to make engaging characters, that though are not fully developed have the engaging qualities you will certainly enjoy.

35,nancyldraper,Perfectly crafted but warped by its bias,8,5 April 2021,"{This is not a majority opinion} A musical play so barrier breaking it was sold out for most of its run. An historical biography told by thoroughly modern rhythms and rhymes. For the audacity, poetry, artistry and performances it deserves a 10 and it probably will always be rated as such by Americans. But, I'm not American, and my enthusiasm was dampened by the blind patriotism of its narrative. What was clear to me, however, is that the partisan divide that is so raw today had its seed in its very founding. This in a nation born to destroy itself. I'm glad I saw this production once, but it's not something I'd watch again. I give this play a 7.9 (perfectly crafted but warped by its bias) out of 10. {Musical Biography}",Hamilton
36,blott2319-1,"It's actually not bad, no matter what you expect",8,9 July 2020,"Let's start by prefacing this review with how I was approaching this ""film,"" because I think that context is important in this case. For starters, I'm not a big fan of rap or hip-hop, and I'm pretty sure at some point in my life I made some old man statement about that stuff ""not being real music."" Since I heard that most of the music in Hamilton was inspired by those genres, I was fairly confident this wouldn't be for me, despite the fact that I typically love musicals. Then there's the over-abundance of gushing that people have done about the show and its music for 5 years, including a huge uptick in conversation months before this release. I heard stories of people willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars for tickets, and still struggling to get a seat. With that kind of hype it's inevitable that the actual production can't possibly live up to expectations. Friends of mine had even found their way to a touring version of the show, and told me they felt ripped off for having paid that kind of money for the show they got. At this point, I had pre-determined in my head that this movie would be overrated, and I was loading up both barrels to unleash a storm of hate on it. Admittedly, I was paying nothing to watch it (thanks to Disney+,) but I still expected disappointment.When I began watching this filmed version of the Broadway musical, I was fairly confident all my trepidation was warranted. The opening number was spitting rhymes at me with such speed and in a rhythm that I could not comprehend more than a handful of words. I was struggling not only to understand the specific lyrics they were rapping, but also to get the overall point of them. (I know, my old age is really showing now.) As a result, less than 5 minutes into the show, I rewound to the beginning and turned on the closed-captions. This definitely helped me to follow the story, even though I still wasn't particularly fond of that opening number. But this is where I admit...from there on, the musical won me over. I found myself smiling and enjoying parts of the show, and I even hummed along with some of the tunes when they hit a familiar refrain. I was having a good time, and said out loud ""Uh oh, this is actually good."" It does help that the entire film is not rap or hip-hop. In fact, the bulk of it plays more like a traditional Broadway musical, and I'm a sucker for big numbers like these. They even include some of those brilliant layered songs where they merge a few of the different character songs into one big bombastic number.There are still elements that I don't love about Hamilton. I don't particularly enjoy when a story tells you how it will end at the beginning. Even if these things are common knowledge because it's a historical film, I don't love when someone just spells out the conclusion in the first minutes of the movie. I'm also not a fan of biopics that detail such massive periods of time. I've always preferred when a movie focuses on a more specific event and creates an entire arc that way, rather than showing the full life of the protagonist. Because of this, I often felt like Hamilton was rushing, and the plot wasn't given enough time to breathe in any one moment in history. I sometimes struggled to see the importance of certain events and wondered why some subplots were included at all. It's also interesting that I didn't particularly love Alexander Hamilton as a character. He was somewhat unpleasant and abrasive, and frankly Lin-Manuel Miranda was far from the best actor/singer on stage. Despite the difficulties I had with the show, I still have some of the melodies stuck in my head days after watching it. My expectations were that I would hate this specially-filmed version of the stage musical, and I was pleasantly surprised. In fact, I'll probably watch Hamilton again.",Hamilton
37,sharky_55,What is a legacy? It's planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.,9,8 November 2020,"Hamilton fever swept America, and now the world. To say its wide release is timely would be an understatement. Hamilton plays a deliberately political hand, if not provocative, by casting non-white actors to re-create an era where minorities were kept in chains. Its music, whilst brimming with tributes to classics of musical theatre, riffs mostly on hip-hop, a genre that whose origins lie in the fusion of African-Americans and Caribbean immigrants (with a dash of soulful R&B). And in releasing the recording on Disney+, the story is no longer an exclusively upper-class experience for the highly cultured, finally readily available for the masses to consume and experience. Viva la revolución!Most have accepted Hamilton's premise, but some have realised that its show of representation may be skin-deep rather than truly progressive. We watch a Puerto Rican actor spitting rhymes about the formation of a nation founded by white men; does this constitute a valid thesis? Is colour-blind casting enough to justify turning a blind eye on how black citizens were actually treated during these historical rap battles? I'm not sure it's an easy, straightforward answer. Consider two of the most prominent, show-stopping lines: Hamilton and Lafayette's dual cry of ""Immigrants, we get the job done!"", and Anjelica Schuyler's proclamation ""I'mma compel him to include women in the sequel!"" Both are manufactured as obvious crowd-pleasers, practically ripping apart the fourth wall. Werk it! It doesn't help that the definition of an immigrant in Alexander Hamilton's case is so far removed from what a 21st century audience cheers for (Miranda specifically wrote in two bars after the line to account for their rapturous applause).Listening to Lin-Manuel Miranda rap to himself in 'Cabinet Battle #3' (which was eventually cut from the show) is to witness a creator's internal conflict as he treads a tenuous line: how beholden does art need to be towards historical fidelity? If it's a story of America then told by America now, why leave out such a messy and unmistakably large piece of the puzzle? Perhaps for narrative purposes, then. Miranda knows that this moral quandary clashes with his overall arc of the scrappy underdog. While the musical lionizes its titular hero from the very beginning (Burr is the ""damn fool who shot him"", and trembles with jealousy at his every achievement, in a magnetic performance from Leslie Odom Jr.), it isn't exactly afraid to spotlight his failings, either. More musically-inclined critics have noted that of the original cast, Miranda is the least vocally proficient. But far from this detracting from his performance, it adds a tender fold. He's as close to an everyman in this narrative as we can get, the little guy standing amongst historical giants. Watch as Christopher Jackson's Washington is introduced as if he's the final act at Wrestlemania, a larger-than-life showstopper with unmatchable stage presence. Every other actor treats him with such reverence that it's nigh impossible to engage with him as a person rather than a founding father. Listen to him croon about the nation he's forged, and about noble aspirations like hope and justice and liberty via lines we have read in history textbooks. And then listen to Miranda strain as he sits in the eye of a hurricane, fifteen years old again. Listen to him plead and wrest with his conscience in his final frozen moments as the hip-hop beat drops out and he stares down the gaze of a bullet, alone.I returned to Hamilton a second time after the initial hype had died down to see if it held its own as a pure narrative, and discovered more and more to appreciate. Knowing the tragic close makes each hint and set-up hit harder, as we chart the dual arcs of Hamilton and Burr creating their own history. Listening to 'Non-Stop' as just another track on the original recording, I found it catchy enough, but seeing it in the context of the rises and falls of his early life and as the climax of Act 1, Hamilton's frenzied re-commitment to his life's work as foolish crushes and trivial rivalries are brushed aside, it becomes the show's musical centre. I can track and hear the leitmotifs that criss-cross and converge in its core and as the characters do themselves throughout the story; Aaron and Alexander, after jostling for their spotlight on the centre stage, sit side by side as they serenade their newborns. Their words shape an idea of a country not yet in existence, and they pledge a common goal for it to come to life. Yet while Hamilton seizes every opportunity that arises, Burr laments his own reputation as a footnote in the founding father's story, watching his fortunes stumble at every step. We've all wanted to be in that room at one point or another, and we've all felt what Burr feels. If 'Dear Theodosia' humanises the former vice president through the common goal of raising a daughter and a nation, 'Wait For It' establishes him as the perfect foil for Hamilton, piano arpeggios that begin with a secret affair and explode into a fatalistic confessional about how his own restraint will ultimately reward him with what he deserves. The final confrontation turns the pair's lifelong mantras onto themselves: Hamilton throws away his shot, while Burr finally seizes his, and in a twist of cruel irony, neither end up with what they desired.Thomas Kail, the show's director, declares that hip-hop has always been the ""soundtrack of defiance"" and the ""music of ambition"", and thus that Hamilton's reclamation of the Founding Father's mythos transforms these figures and stories from tools of oppression to liberation. Again I wrest with the idea of the play as pure rebellion, and wonder how truly transformative its narrative appropriation is, and if releasing it on a day of celebrating independence while Americans march in the streets protesting for that same notion constitutes real change. You can see these tangled knots and contradictions throughout: Daveed Diggs makes his flamboyant (re)entry as Jefferson waxing lyrical about liberty, while members of the chorus scrub the floors and fetch his luggage. Hip-hop might be the medium for rebellion, but theatre's class exclusion works in direct opposition to this. I see how predominantly white its admirers are, and wonder about Hamilton's long-term cultural legacy, whether it will endure as a piece of art or simply as a feel-good narrative designed to assuage guilt from an audience viewing comfortably from a position of privilege. The show is used as a punchline designed to expose this phony righteousness in Knives Out, and in a way it reflects a similar comment from Jordan Peele's Get Out; it is the manifestation of 'I would have watched Hamilton for a third time if I could'.And yet, I also ponder if this story needs to be the one to single-handedly shoulder this radical burden. While it's true that Miranda sidesteps several contentious issues rather than acknowledging them (""We know who's really doing the planting"" is a mic-drop moment that is then quickly waved aside), re-writing the history of America to conform to our modern sensibilities isn't a solution either. The story takes some liberties with historical accuracy that results in some dramatisation, but that hasn't stopped us from excusing this in the past for storytelling's sake. The one-two punch of 'Helpless' and 'Satisfied', aside from being an intricately orchestrated set piece, lays bare the angst of an intellectual woman trapped in a time where she does not have the agency to express this, and while this love triangle never really existed, the song can easily be interpreted as a universal struggle. I don't see anyone lining up to poke holes in the fidelity of the award-winning Amadeus, with a premise rooted in exaggeration that heaps praise on far more prominent historical giant. These misgivings seem to continue a recent trend of holding representation of minorities to an unreasonably high standard simply because it is scarce; we saw this with Black Panther, and Crazy Rich Asians, and more immediately when a black man needs to be a saint for us to rule his death an injustice. We can celebrate Hamilton for spotlighting performers of colour whilst also being conscious of our historical faults.Miranda's most significant oversight, then, isn't failing to address the story's lurking racial politics, but rather succumbing to the hype of his own historical appraisals. He pens the musical as a tribute to the first Treasury Secretary, foregrounding legacy as the primary motif, but neglects to live up to its most important adage: death doesn't discriminate. It isn't Burr or Hamilton who receive the final word, but Eliza, who, having erased herself from his life in fury at his affair in 'Burn', inserts herself back into the narrative for the sole, selfless act of preserving her husband's legacy, ensuring that his story can be told today. If Miranda wanted to be a true advocate for the forgotten and downtrodden, what greater story is there than that of Elizabeth Schuyler's? Contrary to the bravado of the men around her, she is never one to ""try and grab the spotlight"". For all the talk of legacy and greatness and leaving your mark on the story of America's founding, Eliza is content to stand to the side, raise a family, and work towards bettering the future. As Emily VanDerWerff puts it, there is immense value in greatness, but even more in goodness. There won't be a hit musical written about her life; she's just a supporting character. But like so many Elizas of the world, she knows what she has left behind is more than enough.",Hamilton

39,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A dense musical that deserves its place in the pop culture zeitgeist.,8,22 June 2021,"I'll admit I'm late to the game on this musical. Luckily, Disney+ helped give me the option of seeing this modern masterpiece. Granted, I know it's not the same experience as seeing it in the theatre (aside from the modifications to allow it on Disney+), but I'm glad I had the opportunity to see it nonetheless. While Hamilton (2020) is not the first musical about the early United States I've heard, it certainly taught me way more about this time period than I had previously thought possible.A word to the wise: be prepared for almost three hours of fast-talking politicians. Subtitles might help, but it's awe-inspiring to hear these rhymes fly through the air at a frenetic pace. I was a little exhausted after I finished watching this since I felt it crammed a six-hour history lecture into less than half the time. It helped that the artistic license Lin-Manuel Miranda had with the material made for some catchy songs and entertaining characters (my personal favorites were King George (Jonathan Groff) and Thomas Jefferson (Daveed Diggs)). Not every song was memorable-which is to be expected-but maybe it might have solved this issue if it was structured closer to a traditional musical instead of an opera.While most people find the acting and songs to be the best part of this musical, I was more impressed by the set design and lighting. For a minimalist production, the crew maximized the use of the rotating stage to create a space that felt larger than it was. Having performed in amateur theater before, I can attest to the immense challenges of such an endeavor-despite how simple they might seem at first glance. Overall, though, Hamilton is the whole musical package conveniently available through modern streaming.A dense musical that deserves its place in the pop culture zeitgeist, I give Hamilton 4.0 stars out of 5.",Hamilton
40,The_Movie_Cat,"""Forever... and ever... and ever and ever and ever....""",6,18 October 2020,"That is how long Hamilton can seem at points... there's a theory that Jean-Paul Sartre said that ""Hell is other people"" only because he'd never seen musical theatre. But any take on the material is, by definition, subjective - the performers are all strong and professional, even if giving one with a prominent lisp lines like ""I came to say congratulations"" borders on cruelty.Personal choices don't come into this, though a lot of the material does sound quite ""samey"". It's notable that the bits that really break away from the somewhat repetitive songs are with Thomas Jefferson and, particularly, King George. King George's songs are a welcome break from the same general rhythms, and the crowd respond very well to his campy character, though others may find it all a bit too twee and prefer the regular songs.Very much a film for 2020, the interesting thing about Hamilton is what it says for the IMDb Top 250, given that it looks almost certain to remain in the chart by the year's end. The IMDb Top 250 isn't that bad for a mainstream site with a disproportionate male/US/youthful membership. A place where Citizen Kane isn't as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and Rashomon has yet to reach the artistic heights of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, sure, but there's some decent stuff in there. There's also a lot worse films in the chart than Hamilton, with efforts like American History X, Klaus, Rang De Basanti, and, yes, Avengers: Endgame that are throwaway mediocrities at best, risible junk at worst.But as a work of CINEMA, then this is the filming of a stage show. A very well shot and choreographed stage show, for sure, but a stage show nonetheless. Should the filming of stage shows enter the same ""inapplicable"" ruling that now governs shorts and documentaries? As this ruling also extends to TV movies, it means we're living in an age where a stage play can get in the IMDb chart, but efforts like Threads (1984) and Cathy Come Home (1966) aren't allowed.Quite informative, historically, this is a film you'll either like or won't, down to personal taste - are you the sort of person who likes to watch two-and-a-half hours of musical theatre, or not? But whether this musical theatre should be awarded when transferred to a different medium is another matter entirely.",Hamilton
41,bankofmarquis,"Captures the power of being in ""the room where it happens""",10,5 July 2020,"I'll just cut to the chase, the filmed version of the mega-hit stage musical HAMILTON (now streaming on Disney+) is terrific. If you are one of the few that have not seen this, check it out - you'll be glad you did.I could go on and on about the Pulitzer-Prize winning show, the script, the music, the performances and/or the cross-cultural casting - all of which works to perfection, but what separates this film from the other hit Broadway shows that are converted to film is how well that the filmmakers were able to translate the power of being inside the theater during a live performance of this show.Credit, of course, needs to go to the visionaries responsible for this show, creator/writer/star Lin-Manuel Miranda and Director Thomas Kail. They realized pretty early on (when the show was becoming the phenomenon that it has become) that they wanted to preserve this event for future generations, so started making plans to film the show - in High Def - with an audience and without an audience (for close-ups). In June 2016, about a month before the original cast started leaving the show (and right after the show won 11 Tony Awards), they spent $10 million to capture the show - with live audiences on Sunday and Tuesday and then spent the rest of Sunday night and all day Monday doing close-ups and crane shots to augment the action.The results are outstanding. The wide-shots show the breadth of the production - showing the strong, Tony Award winning choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler, the unique, minimal and highly versatile set, the Tony Award winning costumes by Paul Tazewell and the Lighting Design that earned Howell Blinkley a Tony. All of these are showcased in this film - special note should be made about the Lighting that needed to be tweaked on the spot for the filming.As for the close-ups, they showcase the wry smile and comedic delight that Tony winner Daveed Diggs shows in his roles as Lafayette/Jefferson, the power and sorrow of Tony Award winner Renee Elise Goldsberry - her spotlight number SATISFIED is as ""perfect"" a musical number as you will ever see. The powerful acting of Leslie Odom, Jr. as Aaron Burr (who won the Tony as Best Actor over Lin-Manuel's performance as Hamilton) as well as terrific supporting turns by the likes of Anthony Ramos (Lawrence/Phillip), Chris Jackson (showing real leadership as George Washington) and Okieriete Onaodwoan as Hercules Mulligan (one of my absolute favorite characters in this show)./James Madison.Special note should be made to Jonathan Groff's portrayal of King George III - it is, basically, a cameo role, but he is filmed with such tight close-ups (showing spittle rolling down has chin as he sings) that marvelously juxtaposes King George's real emotions with that of the words he is speaking.But, of course, the real star is Lin-Manuel Miranda - the genius creative force behind Hamilton. Interestingly enough, I thought his performance was the weakest of the lead cast (don't get me wrong, he was still excellent - just not ""as excellent"" as some of the others). His true vision, of course, was to tell the story of ""the people of that era"" as told by ""the people of our era"".That is the true genius of Hamilton.Letter Grade: A+10 stars out of 10 (can I turn this up to 11)?",Hamilton

43,tm-sheehan,A magnificent production the hypes justified,10,4 July 2020,"I thought after all I've heard and read about this musical phenomenon that July 4th would be an appropriate evening to judge for myself and I'm so pleased to say all the hype about Hamilton is true it is truly a fabulous stage show.I could have seen Hamilton on our last trip to New York but two things put me off it's very expensive ticket cost and the gamble that I may not like it . Also I thought it would be an all wrap music show which is not my favourite musical genre but pleased to report the wrap lyrics are very clever and there are many other musical styles in this 2 hour 40 biographical musical.Since then I've become a huge fan and admirer of Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda the new wunderkind of Broadway and Cinema .Miranda has said that Hamilton reminded him of rapper Tupac Shakur, which is how he came up with the idea for a diverse hip hop musical about Hamilton's life. Miranda worked on ""Hamilton""- a project that people, including his mentor Stephen Sondheim, told him would never work.Lin -Manuel Miranda based Hamilton the musical on an unlikely source: a dense, 818-page biography of Alexander Hamilton by the historian Ron Chernow many of his lyrics to the show are actually based directly on speeches from the book.His first musical ""In the Heights "" had an Australian Premier and I saw it at the Sydney Opera House in 2019 and loved it as it reminded me of West Side Story. It also has a wrap hip hop score butlike Hamilton features other forms of theatre music like reggae traditional ballads and great orchestrations . Lin -Manuel has recently filmed ""In the Heights "" as a full feature movie to be released in 2021 and word on the street is it's a winner.This version of Hamilton is a filmed version of the original multi eleven Tony Award winning musical directed by Thomas Kail the staging looks simple but it's a very complex and effective series of moveable multi tiered timber scaffolds that frame the stage for the large cast allowing plenty of space for the action and choreography to take place.Whenever I see credits mentioning the same person has composed , written and is starring as well as an executive producer in their own show which is very rare I think they're either a genius, or just a complete egomaniac. In the case of Hamilton Lin- Manuel Miranda is a genius in every category and his masterwork Hamilton truly deserved the 11Tony Awards it won in 2016 just one short of the record breaking 12 Tonys for Mel Brooke's musical The Producers.Hamilton was filmed across three days in 2016, a few weeks before the original cast finished their contracts.The musical's original director, Thomas Kail, assembled a crack team of filmmakers, put them in front of the stage and lovingly captured the story the way it was intended to be: as a piece of theatre.Nine cameras recorded two full performances before live audiences. Between shows, the makers refilmed the production to allow for angles that would be impossible for audiences to see within the theatre including close-ups of intimate and dramatic moments and sweeping overhead shots that capture the entire stage.Hamilton the musical is set in the not so United States of America of 1776 to 1800 and there are definite comparisons to the Political situation in that country today.The musical has been receiving rave critical reviews and sold out tickets to all productions in and outside the United States it broke box office records in London and Broadway is set to do the same in Sydney next year.""Hamilton"" is the story of America then, told by America now. It features a score that blends hip-hop, jazz, R&B and Broadway, ""Hamilton"" has taken the story of American founding father Alexander Hamilton and created a revolutionary moment in theatre-a musical that has had a profound impact on culture, politics, and education.It's no wonder John Bolton titled his recent book on President Donald Trump ""The Room Where it Happened "" the great song from Act 2 of "" Hamilton "" is titled The Room Where it Happens and takes place when Alexander Hamilton Americas first Secretary to the Treasury is ushered to a Secret Meeting where President Thomas Jefferson and his friend and future President James Maddison agree on an unprecedented compromise to move the Capital city of the new nation to their Southern electorate without consulting the American People or Aaron Burr who was the 3rd Vice President of the U. S. A.The opening number ""Alexander Hamilton ""sets the show off beautifully sung by Lin-Manuel Miranda and the cast then leads to another great action song ""My Shot."" and a good example of the clever lyrics ""I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
The whole cast in this original Broadway Production are superb of course Lin -Manuel is wonderful as Alexander Hamilton but this is an ensemble piece .The two Schuyler sisters Angelica Renee Louise Goldsberry and Eliza Phillipa Soo who becomes Eliza Hamilton Alexander's wife sing beautifully and look beautiful in their roles and costumes as does the whole cast by costume designer Paul Tazewell .Some of the most sublime and more emotional moments of Hamilton feature these two talented women especially their first song in Act 1 titled The Schuyler Sisters.The other major male roles Leslie Odam Jnr as Aaron Burr and Daveed Diggs as Marquis de Lafayette add to the drama and comedy of Hamilton and it's hard to imagine a better cast. Other great supporting roles that add so much to Hamilton are Chris Jackson as George Washington and a star turn by Jonathan Groff as King George 111 who has a great song and dance number "" You'll Be Back ""referring to America's separation from England.I've often read that the American musical theatre has over the last one hundred years had 3 pivotal evolutions that have forever influenced the genre forever Jerome Kern's 1927 Showboat which for the first time progressed a dramatic story with a musical score that changed the art of musicals from comedy reviews or light weight romantic librettos .Then the next great change came in 1943 with Rodgers and Hammerstein's groundbreaking musical ""Oklahoma "" which was the first musical that raised the curtain on the solo character Curly singing ""Oh What a Beautiful Morning "" and developing from the earlier Show Boat, epitomising the development of the ""book musical"", a musical play where the songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that are able to evoke genuine emotions.Then in 1957 ""West Side Story"" with the music of Leonard Bernstein and the spectacular Broadway debut Of Stephen Sondheim as lyricist bought gang warfare and a revolutionary contemporary song and instrumentally inventive orchestrations that have become classical milestones of many orchestra and Opera Houses the world . We will see a new film version next year directed by Stephen Spielberg.Hamilton I predict will join these 3 famous musicals in history as a revolutionary and innovative game changer that will help keep the Broadway musical alive and thriving.Is it worth $8.99 a month or $89.99 a year a Disney channel subscription? You'll have to judge that but it's the best seat in the house for a fraction of the cost of a ticket for Hamilton the musical. . I've noticed some great High School professional productions of various musicals and other movies and animated features on Disney so it's a yes for me and I'm not on commission .I've added to my Christmas wish list a ticket to the Australian production of this great musical in Sydney next year at the Lyric Theatre.Composers that have the talent to star in their own musicals are less than a dozen and Lin - Manuel has written and starred in two Washington Heights and Hamilton.Disney Plus Channel paid $75 million for the screening rights for Hamilton and the franchise rights which will create huge dividends for Disney now and into the future.Lin -Manuel reportedly made $ 6.4 million off Hamilton in 2017 alone before this Disney deal. He is a modest multi millionaires owning two luxury pre-war apartments in Upper Manhattan, but otherwise lives a relatively modest lifestyle and still rides the subway. The latest estimate of his net wealth after the Disney deal is $80 million .Broadway made Lin-Manuel Miranda a star, but philanthropy-from disaster relief in Puerto Rico to arts education at home in New York-is truly the family business.This filmed production of a stage musical is definitely the best I've ever seen and I really can't wait to see what our Australian production is like next year.",Hamilton

47,garethcrook,Blimey!!,10,19 July 2020,"I know a little bit about America's founding fathers. Not a lot, it's not really taught in the UK. That's not important though. Knowing any history to enjoy this I mean, not America's independence. Musicals aren't my thing either and certainly not musical theatre, which this is with several exclamation points. What we have here is the theatre production, filmed, fairly simply. A few camera angles covering the stage, mostly wide to show off a lovely set, occasional close up to, well to provide some variation in the edit, nothing more. This is the thing, it's a show designed to be enjoyed in the room. There's no set camera positions. The camera is normally your eye from your seat. That's not possible right now though, which is why this exists. So it's not a film. It works though and it's undeniably a spectacle. If you don't like singing and dancing, you might think you're buggered. Honestly though, this is pretty top quality singing and dancing, you're in safe hands. It's fast and fun, the energy dialled all the way up. The mix of humour, hip hop and show tunes will make even the most hardened cynic smile. Alright it's gimmicky, actors spitting bars wearing frock-coats, declaring war, but I guess the rules are different in theatre and it's very effective. In film it's often said that if the actors look like they're having too much fun, the audience aren't. I don't think that applies here either, everybody looks to be having the time of their lives and the live audience, that we hear but don't see, seem to be too. It's pretty lengthy, but there's a lot in there, not least a pretty eventful life story. Alexander Hamilton. Rags to revolutionary. A social climbing agitator, with a love of writing and setting up financial institutions. Weddings, duals, adultery, bribery, a bloody big war and a lot of political manoeuvring. The historical content is top line stuff, covering the basics. They're touch points really, never allowing the story to get too dry, but it manages this without dumbing it down too much and the razor sharp humour helps, ""Immigrants we get the job done"". The cast are wonderful. Daveed Diggs as both Lafayette and Jefferson is the standout for me. There are quieter moments, but there's sequences where it's one bombastic banger after another. Canon fire and scratching, the score gets pretty raucous. I went it with a little trepidation, but Lin-Manuel Miranda has indeed created something marvellous. It. Is. Spine-tinglingly brilliant. I might have to stop saying I don't like musicals.",Hamilton
48,Azanspy,I can't believe I actually enjoyed this.,8,20 July 2020,"I thought I wouldn't enjoy this because of the 160 minute run-time and my first time viewing of a Broadway play. It was really good for many reasons. The cast is outstanding. They gave their all and while watching, I understood how hard it will be. The choreography, art direction, direction all was really good. And man,the songs and the lyrics were just mind-blowing. Now I'm even more excited for Lin Manuel Miranda's In The Heights.",Hamilton

At first, I was a little detached, not liking the songs too much, and thinking I would probably just skip through to end in a minute. I couldn't stop watching and it really sucked me in. I have to say, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it at all, live in the theater. I benefited greatly from the captions and the ability to put it on pause to consult Wikipedia from time to time. The lyrics were so clever and really told the story. I ended up very moved and almost cheering at the end. Of course, now that I am familiar with the story, I would love to see it live and would enjoy it immensely. But I would strongly recommend this for a first time viewing. I will definitely re-watch. And probably again and again.",Hamilton
50,baileycrawly,"The ""Fans"" Ruined This One",1,6 July 2020,"Hamilton isn't a horrible production. In fact, it's not even a particularly bad production. Cringey lyrics, a leading man who doesn't appear to be particularly strong vocally (Lin-Manuel Miranda, the writer of this production). It entertained me when it was trying to, made me laugh a time or two (although most of the ""jokes"" were forced and unfunny) and even made me invest myself in the characters for a while.But that's where the sentimentalities end and, while I understand the Hamilton cult will attack this review on a massive scale because it doesn't agree with the narrative they've all been brainwashed to accept almost exclusively, we live in a country with freedom of speech, and I'm going to make sure that I have mine.This is a fairly decent play that has been completely ruined by the fanbase that surrounds it. It's quite remarkable how devoted human beings can become to something, especially something like this play, which is nothing more than a passing phase and will be gone before you know it. The devotion is so much so that, to say anything even remotely critical (even constructively) is to commit a blasphemy of the highest order. These people descend upon you like ravenous dogs to a piece of meat. They try to tear you apart, to devalue your opinion, to make you appear as less than a human being, and all because someone has a different opinion than you.The late, great Harlan Ellison once said (paraphrased, of course): ""You are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your INFORMED opinion. No one is entitled to be ignorant."" Well, I have the firsthand experience of sitting through every minute of this ass-numbingly long piece of work, and I know the real story behind the thing, so that's what I call an informed opinion, and I'm gonna tell it like it is: this isn't anything special.Now, it would've been shelved as an average, run-of-the-mill production that, while beautifully shot and staged, fails to offer much else. Instead, after voicing my opinion and dealing with the cult like devotees of this thing, I've decided that this play is deserving of a 1/10.If the kind of behavior I'm seeing toward this production is the way Hamilton fans view it acceptable to treat those with a differing opinion, I don't want anything further to do with Hamilton or Lin-Manuel Miranda, because the response to this is that of a cult, not that of a musical production.And that doesn't sit well with me. And it won't sit well with me if every Hamilton fan marks this review ""not helpful"" (you will, because y'all are salty) . You won't bully me into accepting this musical after your behavior did the exact opposite. From a 7/10 to a 1/10. Congrats.

This musical very rightfully captures critical moments of his life. Good select and concentration strategy, and Lin-Manuel Miranda exactly knowing where to put more weight on.* Lyrics having difficult contents but very well coordinated - It is hard to write pieces containing history, governments, and public affairs. However, the words are carefully AND smartly chosen. Miranda manages lyrics to rhyme and flow easily.Bads:* Good lyrics but delivered unclearly - I still cannot understand why Miranda chooses to use rapping as a key music genre. Strictly aimed for American market. Even I had to turn on subtitles to understand some sentences. Guess how much more efforts will be need for English speakers from different parts of the world* Lin-Manuel Miranda's voice - He is a talented producer, writer, actor. However, his croaky, uncharismatic voice does not match Alexander Hamilton even till the ending.

54,SnobReviews,A groundbreaking phenomenon.,10,6 July 2020,"""Hamilton"" takes a giant leap from stage to screen and couldn't be more sensational, outstanding and groundbreaking.
.
In this broadway musical, it tells the life story of one of America's founding fathers and first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. Captured live on Broadway from the Richard Rodgers Theater with the original Broadway cast.
.
Having never seen the broadway production, this screen adaptation made me feel like I was right there. Lin-Manuel Miranda is the definition of creative genius. The book, the music, the rhymes and a great story; how does he do it all? Everyone in the supporting cast is exceptional as well and the screen direction from Thomas Kail is jaw dropping. When speaking about how ""Hamilton"" is a pop-culture phenomenon; how can it not be? The hype is real, people. Here are actors of colour playing the white-ass founding fathers. Right there, ballsy. The music is whole other thing that I'll be listening to for the next six months. The entire ""Hamilton"" experience is a must-see - it left me floored and I would love to see it live eventually.

55,TheHoodOfSwords,Don't get the hype,6,14 July 2020,"Reviewing a movie like this is incredibly difficult for me because part of what makes musical theatre plays so special is the environment you're in when you see them. With that said, I'm very conflicted about this. Maybe it was because I don't know a lot about American History but none of it really stuck with me. The problem with non-stop music is you never have a chance to sit for 10 seconds and think about what the entire last song was talking about because you're already onto the next song. I can see how people love this and I can see how it has created such a fanbase around it. Partially because the music is good and partially because it is almost a satirical take on America's Founding fathers. Casting them all as non-white people while keeping much of their ideologies. Still... it just didn't stick with me in the way I was hoping it would. I absolutely adored the music but 160 minutes of non-stop singing... for me it just eventually became all the same. The dance choreography was done very well and it's acted pretty well. Although the lead actor does drop the ball at times, and some of the rapping fell flat. I like how they broke the 180-degree line of film a couple of of times and I loved all the technical aspects of it but that was about it. I didn't get what was happening most of the time and I was bored by about an hour in and only got back into it in the last 30 minutes. Do I feel like I wasted my time? No. Would I watch it again? Also probably not. If nothing else though I hope this spawns more theatre productions being filmed and put on the big screen. I'm leaving this at a 6 right now.Jonathon Groff is the best actor btw",Hamilton

James Madison was our shortest president at 5'4''. The actor they chose to play him is easily 6 ft. That took me out of it a bit. But this is a very emotionally powerful film that makes you appreciate this country and how much the Founding Fathers sacrificed to give us our freedom

58,madhukar30,Surreally impressive !!,9,29 September 2020,"Theatre and musicals aren't my cup of tea, but Hamilton simply blew my mind with its impressive presentation. A surreal musical screenplay on one of America's founding fathers, filled with amazing and spectacular songs that ensures Hamilton to be among the topmost musicals of all time.Full credit to director Thomas Kail and his whole production crew for churning out this beauty. Performance of all the stage actors were outstanding & extraordinary, that's when I try to put it in a modest way. Thanks to Disney+ for getting this masterpiece to our TV screens. The updations of all the classic songs to today's time and age makes it a very attractive offering even to the tech savvy younger generation.Overall a must watch for everyone of all ages and colours. Hamilton is like a once in a lifetime opportunity to witness the best in theatre. The only beef is that the show's length at 170 mins but if one splits into 2 parts it's very doable. Please don't miss this at any cost, As Hamilton is one that will be remembered for ages in this era.",Hamilton

It's 2hrs40mins long with intermission but, I gave up after 40 minutes! The staging and choreography resemble a high school production; it's relentlessly busy and completely empty. It's a filmed record of an over-hyped, over-priced Broadway musical featuring an undistinguished score in which all the songs sound alike and are equally trite. Hamilton played to sold out audiences and garnered a lot of a media attention yet it didn't produce a single notable song. The costumes are authentic enough and some of the voices are good but, posturing replaces acting and the result is instantly forgettable. As Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda is just adequate; he is weak in both voice and stage presence. Hamilton is not worth your time. Time will be kinder to our founding fathers than to Hamilton, which will not be revived decade after decade like West Side Story, Chicago, Cabaret, The Sound of Music and Gypsy. The streamed version which has sparked outrage is a recording of 3 stage performances edited together and is only nominally a movie.",Hamilton
61,kingofdanerds,I was skeptical at first but ultimately amazed,10,29 September 2020,"Well, it is about time that I have watched Hamilton and review it. Hamilton was a musical that started in 2015 and was a huge critical and financial success and in 2020 was given a film release (basically a live performance) on Disney+. I have never been to a viewing of Hamilton or really even expressed any real desire to watch Hamilton until I watched it in a History class. Hamilton is based off of a 2004 biography titled Alexander Hamilton. Of course, I have not read the biography. The musical most notably stars Lin Manuel Miranda as Alexander Hamilton (I personally don't think it would be fair to refer to him as the title character) and also wrote the music, wrote the play, and produced the play.The musical itself follows (mostly) the life of one of America's least talked about founding father, Alexander Hamilton. It goes through his life as a young man at the start of the Revolution, to the signing of the Constitution, to him being the secretary of treasury, and to his untimely death.Ever since Hamilton came out in 2015 as just a musical, I saw it as over hyped. Why? Because I don't particularly watch musicals at all. They just have never been my thing and most likely never will be. But there are a few exceptions out there and Hamilton is one of those exceptions. (Oddly enough, I was talking to a person who is a musical freak and they thought Hamilton to be overrated). Not only was I proven wrong, I was amazed at how amazing this musical actually is. Oh, and I was also amazed at how wrong I was as well. I am so glad that I watched this musical because if it was not for History class, I probably would never have watched it. Earlier, I made the statement that it was not fair to say Alexander Hamilton was the title character. Yes, his last name is Hamilton and yes, he has a story being told in this musical but there is Eliza (Alexander's wife) who has a story being told and even if you watch the last song, there is strong evidence that supports my point. The cast is just amazing. What is notable, is that there is a diverse cast playing people who were white. Which leads me to think that Lin Manuel Miranda did that to have a story of early United States, told by the America of today. It is quite amazing. The cast does an amazing job in their roles and they really do shine when they are needed to shine. Before my viewing of Hamilton, I only heard of a couple of songs and the only one I really knew was the very first song from the musical and now, I pretty much know all of the songs. The songs are in the style of rap, which my appear to be odd but once again, it is a story of early United States, told by the America of today and it really works. Now rap is not my favorite of genres (it might actually be my least favorite) but in Hamilton, it works well. The songs are powerful and impactful. The only other thing that I should really note is the whole story that this musical tells. As I said, I do not believe Hamilton is the title character but rather shares that with Eliza. But can anyone who is not a historian say that before this play, did you know anything about Alexander Hamilton? Alexander Hamilton was often forgotten and thanks to this musical, is now talked about even more and he now gets the recognition that he deserves.Yes, I was proven wrong about Hamilton. Does this musical manage to make me like musicals? No, but there is no denying that Hamilton is a very unique musical and possibly one of the best ones to ever be released. It is very impactful and memorable. And that is coming from someone who largely despises musicals. Hamilton is a treat to watch. Might as well go buy the soundtrack.............",Hamilton
62,RhapsodyReviews,Brilliant Broadway Show.,10,7 July 2020,"Review:
'Hamilton' is a Broadway musical filmed for TV with music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda. It tells the story of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton. The show's music draws heavily from hip hop, as well as R&B, pop, soul, and traditional-style show tunes.
I've heard about the Broadway musical for years now but being located in a small town there was no way I would be able to see the show. When I heard it was coming to Disney+ I was both excited and nervous due to the fact I wasn't sure if it would be a victim of overhype. I'm am happy to be able to say this is a true masterpiece of a show that will make you want to revisit it again and again,
The show casts non-white actors as the Founding Fathers and other historical figures and it is truly brilliant. It showcases the actor's talents and makes a stand against racial stereotypes and Xenophobia. It is both amazing and heartbreaking watching these actors on the big stage. They are brilliant in the way the move and remember their lines during this three-hour long event. Stage shows and their actors are an underappreciated form of art and storytelling. Everybody in this show did a perfect job, but there was one actor who seemed to be having a blast in his role and played two completely different character perfectly, Daveed Diggs.
Aside from having an incredible story of the 'lost' Founding Father, Alexander Hamilton, the show has a brilliant soundtrack that has seamless transitions between scenes. It keeps your eyes glued to the screen and you don't want the show the end. With having super limited space and production design, they were able to showcase different parts of the world and the United States just by having different dress codes and props, and it is done with ease.
Overall, I am urging everybody to watch this amazing piece of art. If you are a fan of musicals you will love this, and if you aren't the biggest fan of musicals I truly believe that the music in this show alone will keep you engage and intrigued to what the story is telling.

65,plasticanimalz,Eh,4,6 July 2020,"Admittedly, my feeling on broadway musicals is I either love them or I'm totally bored in them. I can't say I've ever felt lukewarm about one. People have repeatedly assured me I would love this, just as I was assured I would love Phantom of the Opera...and, I didn't. I appreciate all the creativity, time, and effort, and maybe if I had seen this in NYC instead of on Disney+ mayyyybe I would feel differently? And maybe if I'd seen it with the cast that replaces Lin Manuel and his trio who clearly are not stage actors, maybe I would like this. I do typically like the dude who plays Yohan in Black-ish, I just felt him, Lin, the guy who played Burr, and their fourth guy, were not captivating, and I couldn't understand half of what they were saying.On the plus, the women were great. They had spectacular voices, colorful outfits that popped on stage, and they had dynamic presence. The King and Washington were also great, and it was apparent by their performances they were stage pros with dynamic voices and stage presence. The title song is catchy and I liked that performance. I liked their Zoom performance of the title song on Some Great News. I thought that was great.But, I also have never enjoyed a broadway play put on the big screen like a play...with the exception of Chorus Line. I walked out of Les Miserables movie, hated Chicago movie. I like when they turn it into a story with the music, like, Rent, Mama Mia (which I thought I would hate), Little Shop of Horrors, Grease, Annie (both versions), etc.If someone paid for my ticket and the trip to NYC, I would consider seeing Hamilton live and giving it an honest shot, but I would much rather see the Tina Turner story or Sponge Bob, to be quite honest. I think a hip hop biopic, I would see that. Hip hop revolutionary history...eh. I would rather watch a History Channel in-depth of Hamilton or deep dive historical podcast. There just seems so many fun avenues to present hip hop into Broadway. I did like the diverse cast. Broadway, Hollywood and publishing should work on being more accepting and doing more of that. And when I say more accepting I mean showing POC and LGBTQ in a positive light and not in a way to highlight how benevolent straight white people are or just how bad they feel about oppressing us. I think I've had about enough of that.",Hamilton

Unfortunately I never got to see it on Broadway and by the time it came to Philadelphia the original cast was long gone. Instead of making big elaborate movie versions of musicals that usually suck they should take a page from Hamilton.

70,Shostakovich343,Hamilton,4,26 January 2021,"I have no doubt ""Hamilton"" was a very successful theatre production. You might even like this recording if you're into that sort of thing. But film is a medium on its own, and has standards this release doesn't come close to meeting.The praise ""Hamilton"" has received for its technical execution is nothing short of absurd. Taped during a live performance, it feels very 'live' indeed (because it is). In practice, this means the viewer is stuck with the technical limitations of theatre and blessed with the added immersion of hearing some hooligan shout 'Ooooooh' during key moments as if attending a football match. And you get close-ups, which indeed capture a moderate amount of facial expression, whilst ensuring the other 95% of the stage is obscured.The easy way to resolve these imbalances would be to do a studio production and rework blocking and choreography in a more cinematic style. You know, make a musical motion picture, as Hollywood has been doing since 1929. This ""Hamilton"" is plainly uncinematic, a petty compromise of a film.The production standards of the show itself are generally good, as you would expect coming from a multi-billion dollar conglomerate. But giving ""Hamilton"" a five-star review for its art direction in spite of the obvious incongruity of its elements is deceit. ""Batman & Robin"" had pretty impressive set design too, and that did nothing to mitigate the critical bashing it received.Also, you better like rap music if you're going to sit through the whole ordeal. The first half in particular is an almost uninterrupted string of songs in varying shades of unpleasantness, which the occasional witticism does little to enliven. How sad to see this revolutionary history chopped up and sold as an efficiently packaged, easily digestible product by the very people whose founding fathers it features. And how thoroughly American.As the sum of its strongly heterogeneous elements, ""Hamilton"" is a pretty deadening experience. If you can stand 160 minutes of unimaginatively filmed droning beat music, knock yourself out. A classic this will never be, and Disney doesn't care. They're too busy counting their Benjamins.",Hamilton

72,Golden_Hope,A Great Experience that Would be Fantastic Live,6,3 July 2020,"First off i am really glad that they deiced to make this available as a movie. It can be frustrating when there is a show/musical that you want to see and you just can't get to it and this gives a ticket to everyone and i think this is great.I have wanted to see this musical for a while as i knew some of the songs and i wasn't disappointed for the most part.Some of the songs are really great and i can understand how they had made their way to me even though i hadn't watched the show.I will unfortunately say that the mix is god awful. Some of the singing is just noise and this is not the fault of the singers it is the fault of the mixers. I was really trying to understand what was going on at the start and the only words i could make out where 'Alexander Hamilton' it is a real shame as this happens again. It does seem to get slightly better as the movie progresses but at the start it was inaudible in parts and i was so disappointed because the singers were great.Speaking of the Sisters were the best part for me. They were all fantastic singers and i loved all their songs. I would have appreciated even more of them, they did a great job.Another issue i had was the storytelling, like i said i have never seen the show so i didn't know what to expect. In England this story is not told at all. I know vaguely of these people due to watching American Media but it just isn't told in schools. So i had no idea what was going on at the start so i was trying to find my bearings but then i realised it was ""And then this happened"" storytelling, there wasn't a head to follow it was almost like vignettes of Hamiltons life, not that this is a bad thing i just found it harder to follow at first and knowing nothing about this it kinda confused me, this probably wouldn't be an issue if you already have an idea what is going on.The choreography is great and so are the costumes.I would give it a watch if you have Disney+, keep in mind it is very long as well but i would say for the most part it is work it.",Hamilton

There is always so much criticism when other stories are made about history as to why this was added and this was taken out and this never actually happened and yet here we have HAMILTON.Jefferson is made to look like such an idiot, Washington a big strong physic when actually he was a much smaller man.
The best role in it was King George played by Jonathan Groff who actually played the mad King with excellence. His diction was perfect. I even heard recently they wanted James Bond to be played by a female. This was absolutely shot down.The story spans around 30 plus years and it felt like that sitting watching it. I apologise for being the only person to give this such a low rating but I guess REAL HISTORY is lost to all the younger generation.I have read so many reviews posted by other people on other movies etc on here and their objections are to so many stupid things and yet nobody looks at the reality of what HAMILTON is actually about. Characters have been transformed, distorted and disgraced in this story. As for the music it was just a noisy din.

What I didn't know, well most likely forgot, is that it's in two acts, and that's important. Not being a Musical Theatre aficionado the run time was daunting, but once I started I was kind of feeling it.I was totally engaged - I had to be - because this is a little dense. They sing the whole time, I mean the whole time. It feels like one long as song, with tons of information in lyrics that you don't always understand. So I had to be ""on"" if I didn't want to miss something. At some points of the first act it felt like they were lip-syncing, or as if they put the audio of one performance on the images of another, the sound mixing looked off.By the time the intermission came, it was like a slapped to my face, because like I mentioned I forgot about it so I thought that it was the end of the musical. I was mildly entertain by what I saw and was ready to move on. It legit made me sweat when I realize I had over an hour to go.The second act was truly a breath of fresh air. I felt like I learned more in that part then the first. There was a lot of variety in the songs, which were amazing, but I was captivated by what was going on, not because I could miss something important, I was just entertained.I also appreciated that they didn't sanitize the more questionable aspects of the story. It got me to like the cast even more. I was looking at the performances and soaking in the history.Hamilton is worth the watch it's crescendo with the first act feels like a intro that's running a little long but once you're in the thick of it, it's fun, and clever.",Hamilton
76,jordyntsmith,Love It! Don't Spoil It!,8,7 July 2020,"I really do enjoy the Hamilton soundtrack and was so excited to actually view the performance! However, in a sense, I do think I listened to the soundtrack too much to the point where I 'know' what happens too well. For watching the musical, I recommend not over-saturating oneself with other Hamilton media.All in all, it is an excellent musical with brilliant writing, excellent performances, and a memorable, multi-layered, story.",Hamilton
77,jacksisjax,Forgive Me...,5,5 July 2020,"Ah I'm sorry... I don't think this project deserves a 5. It is clearly a brilliant work of broadway... the amount of work and dedication that goes into a project like this blows my mind. Like seriously, the writing is brilliant, all the performers KILL it, and it's all great American History.
My problem is that I just don't love the music... it's a a musical, and for me to rate it high I would have to love the music. It isn't music that I could listen to. I liked probably a fourth of the music. Also, when your medium for telling a story is SOLELY music, it is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING to be able to understand the words, but many of the raps are nearly impossible to follow along with because they talk to so fast. This being said, some parts (mostly the beginning) were very hard to follow along with.
Great rapping though.
This just wasn't really my thing, if I saw it on stage I may feel differently towards it but... just not feeling it. Sorry.
But this is my dads second time seeing it... and he felt this way the first time and loved it the second time. So i may revisit in a few years.",Hamilton

Through a lot of it, my family and I questioned how you could create something so beautiful, something so unimaginably amazing that made an impact on people, we questioned how you could take a founding father's life and make it into this. Our answer? A Latino that sure knows how to represent us. His name is Lin-Manuel Miranda. I couldn't be more proud of my heritage, even though I've always been proud of it.

Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius, the music is phenomenal and the whole cast is sensational. I couldn't even list the cast members that stood out because literally every single person is outstanding in this.My only bit of criticism would be the spitting. I know this might be minor to some, but it really grosses me out. Jonathan Groff (King George) has a fantastic voice, but I'm sorry the constant spitting was hard to watch. It would've been nice if they did less close ups of him while he was singing. But other than that, everything was perfect. I would recommend watching this.",Hamilton

88,IamROCKAS,"America then, as told by America now, is a memorable performance that left me in awe",9,13 July 2020,"Hamilton is a musical that never left me bored throughout it's almost three hour runtime. For years I thought this musical was kind of on a meme level because it's a musical mixing hip hop music, as well as R&B, pop, soul, and traditional-style show tunes, with history of the birth of United States of American and it's been parodied mercilessly, mostly by Jack Douglass, better known as jacksfilms, who created multiple videos of that sort and probably is one of the reasons why it's a common belief now that Alexander Hamilton was a president of the United States of America. In reality, the musical was really good and I enjoyed it. It's really memorable and I felt happy, motivated, proud, anxious, and sad - that's a lot of different emotion that I've felt for a representation of one the american founding fathers.The lyrics are surprisingly good, even memorable, some of the choruses are still at the back of my mind, and I liked the performance by the cast. By the end, where everyone took a bow for the audience, I was even surprised because I thought there were more actors on the stage than there actually were.I also really liked the comedy aspect of the musical. Some rhymed dialogues really made me laugh, chuckle at least and I really appreciated the humor.",Hamilton
89,felipepm17,Hamilton Review,7,11 July 2020,"I move the musical, the cast and the songs. But I feel like the way this was recorded took out some of the magic of the stage version.

The excessive closeup of actor singing and changes of camera took me out of the moment, specially the back of the stage camera angle.",Hamilton

I felt 'Hamilton' had a great balancePerformances by everyone was fantastic... words don't do it justiceLafayette - HilariousConsNot many... But I did become a little confused with some plot points, that may have just been me thoughOverall, I thought 'Hamilton' was an absolute blast. The songs, performances were truly amazing and I will be listening to the soundtrack for a while now! Hats off to Lin-Manuel Miranda because he has crafted this from the ground and wrote the lyrics to the songs and the script. Honestly it is a fantastic achievement for him. I've never been a massive fan of musical theatre but 'Hamilton' has proved to me that there are some gems out there. I hope Disney or other companies release future productions on streaming sites because I can guarantee 'Hamilton' will be a wide success.Quote - ""I'm not throwing away my shot"" - Alexander HamiltonRating - 9/10",Hamilton

93,madanmarwah,"A boring, monotonous photographed stage play",4,4 June 2021,"Film directors have the responsibility of making their film interesting and watchable enough for all types of audiences. I do not like directors who make films for a small segment. This film is made for those who like stage musicals on the subject of American history.It is a dry photographed stage play. It is also unimaginatively photographed . When the camera becomes the eyes of the audience watching the stage play it becomes hugely monotonous and stifling. There appears to be no effort to innovate, improvise and adapt to meet the requirements of the cinema medium.The film deals with chapters of American history with characters like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson discussing the politics of that time. The average person cannot relate to the musical and dance interpretation of these historic events.Without mincing words I feel that the film is boring, monotonous and long drawn. ( 2 hours 40 minutes to be precise). Since it is a stage play there is a lot of overacting bordering on hamming which was a jarring experience. It is clearly not meant for the average audience. I can grudgingly give it 4 stars mainly for the costumes and the hard work put in by all actors. (I can imagine the huge amount of rehearsals involved.)",Hamilton
94,hooma814,This may be the best show ever made!,10,3 August 2020,"How does a genius, rapper, songwriter, inspirational creator, come up with all this himself? Lin-Manuel Miranda is absolutely insane. Hamilton is so unique and creative in almost every part that it is hard to comprehend how even a little bit of it hasn't been attempted before. The closest I can think of is maybe Stomp? In its unique expression of music and theatre. But it doesn't even come close. I love so much that all the characters are played by people of colour, when you see a black George Washington come out, you know things are going to be different. The music and rap itself combined with something so distant and different from that style in the founding history of America just mind boggles me. It reminds me of other creative combinations people try with food, in your head you think, naaaah that will never work, then you try it and you know what.... that is actually really good. Not only has the Hamilton team pulled off something completely unprecedented, but they've put near on ten or so songs into my wife's and I's head for the last few days. These songs are literally so catchy, how does Lin-Manuel come up with such catchy tunes? It's amazing when you realise the other work he has also done across movies like Moana. This man is so talented and he picked a very talented team. All the main cast are such great singers and dancers, there is no weak point. Almost all the cast are extremely funny and able to draw you in with such great emotion. I never thought I would get so much enjoyment out of learning about the early beginnings of America and how they came to form their government. I would recommend watching this with subtitles as its very hard to follow all the words without it. Its hard to know if going to the theatre to see this would be any better - I really appreciated being able to watch it up close, great sound, with the original cast, with subtitles, that compared to watching it in London or New York with a different cast, no subtitles, potentially making it harder to hear would've actually been any better. Regardless the Disney+ version blew me away and I'm sure it would in the theatre too.",Hamilton

I guess my first gripe is the soundtrack. It's just non-stop thumping. It gets monotonous. The 'I'm not satisfied' number is well performed but goes on too long. The sets are unambitious. Costumes look nice but why not add some color to the view? The lead actor doesn't fill the shoes of the character he's trying to portray.

It's just a shame it isn't a very good musical, this might be a biased thing as i'm not American but the actual premise is just so boring and so tedious. I actually really enjoyed the first act and thought this was going to go on to be amazing but the second act just became the same thing over and over again with the songs slowly getting repetitive. I think Lin Manuel Miranda is fantastic in this and easily makes the musical what it is and I'm glad he took the lead role for his own project.

If I didn't know any better, I'd say Alexander Hamilton wrote this himself because he comes out smelling like a rose and is painted as the main man of the revolution.

100,sampsonart,Meh.. not my thing at all,3,6 December 2020,I get that this is well written and original etc etc but omg is it boring. Just not my thing. I realize others might like this type of play but I find watching even a cheap horror flick more entertaining.,Hamilton
101,blackoutH,"Amazing performances, execution and musical experience, but...",6,3 December 2020,"This will be a tough review, since technique and execution are brilliant but my problem is, the actual story...
Let's start with the good - Hamilton tells the story of one of the America's founding fathers, but it tells it in a very peculiar way; in a musical format where the songs are basically R&B or Hip-Hop and the cast is composed mostly by non-white actors, as Lin-Manuel Miranda puts it ""America then, as told by America now"".
The movie captures perfectly the musical experience, and the performances are incredible for the most part, specially with the dancing, singing and memorizing of the lengthy hip-hop songs. As a musical and I guess as a theater experience and as for the originality on how this story his told considering the period where the events take place, is really good and enjoyable.Now where I draw the criticism is the story - I do recognize that some of this is a personal opinion, since I am not an American national my knowledge of the country's history is a bit limited and I do admit that this might be a bit biased for a review, however I struggle to understand why Hamilton and these particular events were the chosen to make such a musical, because it seems that it was made in a way to be a statement of immigrants getting things done in America and one of them (Hamilton himself) being one of the actual founders of the country. This statement is empowered by the non-white cast and the modern take on the music place in it, which does seem like a cool idea, yet according to some readings I made afterwards, this period has way more tons of gray.
For starters, Hamilton supposedly was against slavery, yet in several occasions he was complicit with it (this is according to historical facts) - one might argue that there was no other way given the time he lived in, but then again, if this is indeed a bit of a controversial topic, alongside the simplification of politics in the US (which is always usually not a good idea) why make a statement play around this topic, and not around any other thousand of achievements made by immigrants in America? If people still didn't convince themselves, America is a country of immigrants, the founding fathers themselves were immigrants or sons, or grandsons of immigrants, people from all over the other continents built the country, but maybe people need to be reminded, I guess?
Maybe I missed the point, maybe this is was the theme because Miranda wanted it to be told this way but regardless, for me it didn't work, I wasn't drawn to the story, didn't care much for the characters, and although the actors overall did an amazing job and Miranda has done an amazing work producing the show and composing the music and lyrics for it, I don't think he was the right choice to portray the main character as it shows lack of charisma specially in the more dark events of his life.Maybe I'm being harsh and if I were to see this as someone who actually lived in the US my opinion would differ - but since this is a movie, an art form distributed across the globe, people from around the world might perceive it differently, that's just how it is. As a musical is really good, but the story doesn't work for me, unfortunately historical events are not as bright as we usually see them depicted.",Hamilton

103,darrenbjones,"Powerful, brilliant, inspiring, essential viewing.",10,5 July 2020,"It's been said that nothing kills the experience of live theatre like filming it; indeed many of Andrew Lloyd Webber's filmed stage productions can be held up as testament to this. Lin Manuel Miranda's Hamilton however bucks that trend. Filmed over three nights with additional close ups filmed without an audience, this feels like perfect blend of movie and stage performance.
Based on Ron Chernow's biography of Alexander Hamilton, you don't have to be a history buff to enjoy the story. Hamilton is an idealist who was also his own worst enemy, yet despite this, his ideals helped shape the United States of America. The music tells his story and the performances sparkle.
When you look at the cost of great seats to see this live, coupled with the knowledge that you're unlikely to ever see the original cast again, this alone is worth an annual subscription to Disney +.

The acting was superb and I prefer watching plays that have been recorded as a stage production and not as a movie. But, the biggest drawback for me that even though it did present some of Hamilton's drawbacks it failed to cover the fact that he purchased slaves (even though many of the characters in the play are black) and as a Federalist he wanted a government that included a President and members of Congress to be elected for life terms. He thought that the English form of government was the best even though they had fought a war to rid themselves from that kind of rule. The end of the play suggested he was a hero and I suppose as one who fought against English rule he was but as a man he was something of a failure.",Hamilton
106,edblackham,Not so subtle,5,4 July 2020,"First off, I love going to musicals. I have seen over 50 of them live in the theater. Quite a few others from the movies that were made it from them. The first surprise from this showing, Lin-Manuel Miranda was the worst one on the stage. The cast was awesome, except for him. He was the creator but should've put somebody else in the lead. The other thing that turned me off was the not so subtle jabs at the political party that Lin-Manuel Miranda doesn't like. There were plenty. The final thing that turned me off was the revisionist history in this show. I don't want to say none of it was true, but it was definitely someone's version of what they thought. Kind of like Jerry Krause taking credit for the Bulls winning 6 titles. Sorry Michael Jordan in hoops, and George Washington(and even Aaron Burr) in history would disagree. The US history classes I took barely mentioned Hamilton. He was definitely there. As were countless others than formed our country. When this came out I wondered why they chose a semi-obscure person as their hero. Final summation, I enjoyed the music and almost all of the actors. But I doubt I'll watch it again. I'm really glad I didn't spend 300 bucks on tickets.",Hamilton
107,YRLY59E,"Didn't care for it, really just OK",5,4 July 2020,"What I liked out of this was Lin-Manuel Miranda and the costumes, both were great.What I didn't like:-music, now I am a broadway fan and like this type of stuff but there are only a few memorable numbers out of like 30 (I didn't keep track) just wasn't enough to sustain the length of this play. Plus the better ones seemed to be towards the second half after you've sustained for over an hour.-and speaking of plays it's a filmed play, it either works or it doesn't and here I think the camera cuts detracted from it they could be odd and distracting. I'm not sure it could be done as a straight film like Evita, in which case you want better camera cuts. It was inconsistent too so sometimes it was OK then other times it would jar you out of the element.This is something I'd prefer to see as the actual play in person. I think it would deliver better. I hate to give it 5 stars because I wanted to like It.Plays to film vary a lot on how they come across. Cats was inexplicably bad. Rent was decent but better in Theater. Phantom of the Opera is also better in Theater. Evita is almost better as a film.Hamilton comes off somewhere dead in the middle. Whether you like this is probably strictly going to depend on your preferred viewing.My personal advice? Wait and see this as a play in person unless you are bored like I was.",Hamilton
108,mageh,It is different and novel but not masterpiece,6,6 July 2020,"It is not terrible like other reviewers said. I give 4 for being unique and novel as a concept for Broadway show. Another 2 stars for actors and singers.Also, i am ok with it not being historically accurate. After all, it is entertainment, not course in American history.

111,xiaoli7377,Hip-Hop and Dead Presidents,9,4 September 2020,"Who would have thought that a hip-hop musical about a nearly forgotten founding father would grow to become such a pop culture phenomenon? ""Hamilton"" is the story of Alexander Hamilton (Lin-Manuel Miranda), most famous for being the first United States Secretary of the Treasury and for currently being the face of the $10 bill. We are lead through his life through the exposition of different famous historical figures and through different genres of song and dance. It's very unique and it's quite a spectacle to behold.With 46 songs, there are inevitably going to be a few clunkers. The character of Hamilton himself is also a bit of a problem: I just don't find Lin-Manuel Miranda to be that good of a singer. The rest of the cast is excellent, and Miranda is fine enough when accompanied by the rest of the cast, but I personally think that his solo songs are considerably worse than the rest of the musical. His voice is just incredibly grating, like he's trying to whine and sing and act all at the same time.It's definitely a great musical that comes highly recommended, but be warned that your enjoyment of it is dependent on whether you like hip-hop music and whether you think that you would find a two and a half hour long musical (with no spoken dialogue at all) about the founding of the United States entertaining. See it to understand its effects on popular culture. See it to admire the amazing lyrics, vocals, and choreography. I'm personally not the biggest fan of musicals, but this is a great one.",Hamilton
112,Thekeybaldemasterrises,"""The Story of America Then, Told by America Now""",10,3 July 2020,"The time has come. The lights go down. King George III welcomes us to the show. Hamilton has finally arrived in a beautiful HD presentation! You've heard of it, you've listened to it more times than you can count, you've bopped to it and belted the words on your friend's aux to their absolute shock/confusion. Now we can FINALLY enjoy it on loop over and over again on a non bootleg copy, that's right NO MORE SLIME
TUTORIALS! Considering it's called a ""Hamilton film I would say it's right in my ballpark don't you?? First of all, the show is amazing. It's among the best the stage has to offer in the modern age. The music, the performances, the writing, the production, it's all BEAUTIFUL, if you haven't seen it yet WATCH IT NOW, but what truly makes it SO good? In the words of Lin Manuel Miranda, ""It's a story about America then, as told by America now."" The Founding Fathers are played by actors of color, among other characters featured in the story. The show is having us leave whatever cultural baggage we have about these historical figures at the door, and embracing this story through the eyes of America NOW. Yes it does leave some factors out, yes it's not all historically accurate, but people need to realize the point isn't to tell an IN DEPTH biographical story of Hamilton, but rather show us how his life and the events that he took part in helped form the foundations and ideals of what this country was built upon. This show is very Patriotic but it reminds me of what America is SUPPOSE TO BE. WHAT IT COULD BE. Much like the young people of my generation going out and marching for the racial injustices in this country, Hamilton was a 20 year old immigrant that fought for the freedom of this land and helped shaped the principles in which we aspire to uphold. This show isn't going to acknowledge our systemic racism roots with people like Washington and Jefferson who factually owned slaves, but it challenges us to contemplate our OWN feelings about this country and where we came from. How far have we come? What has changed and what could WE do better? Could our founding fathers have done more to abolish slavery? Absolutely, but think about what they did try to create and lay the foundations for. Who knows what they could've done if they had more time? It's not meant to idolize these people, it's a piece about the birth of America, and what people like Hamilton did to help a struggling new country find its own identity. When I watch/listen to this show, I believe in that. I believe that America WAS already great, we just lost sight of it and let the wrong people get in charge. If you want to know why, watch Hamilton. The story of an immigrant that fought in a war, and made a name for himself in a ludicrous political game, is a story that will be remembered for generations. Miranda and his team found an incredible medium to tell these people's stories, and that's what it's all about, who tells our story? How will we be remembered? Hamilton's now available on Disney+, I highly suggest you watch it for your 4th of July this weekend and many days after... But as a final reminder don't forget, this is at its heart, live theatre. Hopefully when Covid ends we can actually experience it all together the way we're suppose to, in front of the stage, LIVE. But for now, this will of course do! 10/10.",Hamilton

A true masterpiece.,10,13 July 2020,"Man I hated rap music but I fell in love with this Plays Soundtrack,'My Name Is Alexander Hamilton' & 'King George' were my favourites but countless others were pretty close.This is a great example of how to beautifully adapt something for current culture. Their debate being a rap-diss-track battle was so smart. I can't go into length of the greatness of the poetry-rhyming of the lyrics.Many people will learn more about history with this than their school. It has entertainment, drama, flawed characters and numerous artistic merit with themes layered all over it.Making White characters diversify to be self aware about slavery & women rights was a great decision.",Hamilton

118,dannyrovira-38154,TREMENDOUSLY ENTERTAINING!,10,9 January 2021,"Thomas Kall's exceptional filmed adaptation of the blockbuster mega-hit Broadway musical ""Hamilton,"" which features an inventive score that blends hip-hop, jazz, R&B and show tunes, it won 11 Tony Awards including Best Musical, the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, the Obie Award for Best New American Theater Work, the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album, and the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical and for Outstanding Achievement in Music. This extraordinary cinematic work is now steaming on the Disney Plus channel, and is without a doubt the greatest preservation of a Broadway show ever made, filmed at the Richard Rogers Theater in New York City in 2016 with the entire 26 member original cast. Creator, writer, and star Lin-Manuel Miranda delivers an absolutely brilliant and charismatic performance as Alexander Hamilton one of America's foremost founding fathers and it's first Secretary of the Treasury. This energetic musical details Hamilton's life and how various historical characters influenced his life such as president George Washington, sensationally played by Chris Jackson, Thomas Jefferson, astonishingly played by Daveed Diggs who also plays Marquis de Lafayette, and holds the record for the fastest rap on Broadway, for rapping 19 words in three seconds, and of course Hamilton's arch-rival Aaron Burr, magnificently played by Leslie Odom, Jr. who won the Tony Award for Leading Actor in Musical for his show-stopping performance. Other noteworthy turns includes the lovely Phillipa Soo who delivers a heartfelt performance as Hamilton's beloved wife Eliza, Renee Elise Goldsberry as her sister Angelica Schuyler in an impressive performance that won her the Tony Award for Featured Actress in a Musical, and in an terrific performance the vastly talented Anthony Ramos in the dual role of John Laurens and Hamilton's son Philip Hamilton. Special kudos to Jonathan Groff for his hilarious scene-stealing performance as King George which is a laugh riot. Exquisite direction by Kali, with striking cinematography by Declan Quinn that captures the close-up intimate faces of the actors during key moments in a way that would not be possible in a Broadway theater, it intensify the intimacy of this amazing filmed musical masterpiece. Tremendously entertaining and absolutely unforgettable.",Hamilton

120,downthehobbitholeblog,Amazing- Parents Should Know...,10,3 July 2020,"The most in demand musical is now streaming on demand. Hamilton follows the founding of the United States through the War of Independence and foundational historical events up to 1804 through the perspective of Alexander Hamilton. The musical really packs a musical punch, there's really no dialogue outside of the songs and they combine your typical broadway music with rap, hip-hop, and jazz. Although the musical is about events that are centuries old, it's incredibly relevant to today. Lin-Manuel Miranda says ""This is a story about America then, told by America now."" An engaging powerhouse of a musical that really dives in to the human experience in an incredible and educational way.
Like many other broadway musicals, it deals with hard life issues and is not appropriate for younger viewers. Parents should be aware that the film earns the PG-13 rating mostly through cursing and sexual innuendo. We've got a full review, discussion guide, and more up on our blog now at Down the Hobbit Hole Blog dot com.

122,Jonas1969,Flawed rap Les Miserables,6,7 July 2020,"There is an amazing amount to talent on the stage, but musically it still doesn't often impress.
Lin-Manuel Miranda seems to have used Les Miserables as a template. Changing the music to rap works and allows for much more exposition but the melodies are pretty weak, so the use of musical themes to bring the audience quickly into a scene don't work as well as it does in Les Mis.
The story is the tale of an ambitious, vain, loudmouthed and unpleasant man. Hamilton does not seem likeable, so I don't care about him at all.
The single worst part is Lin-Manuel Miranda himself. He is OK as an actor but not a singer on par with the other voices on stage.It's not all bad:
Hamiltons version of the innkeeper from Les Mis is King George played by Jonathan Groff (Kristoff from Frozen) and this is the only part where it truly matches Les Mis. It's both funny, has a good tune and is well executed.
Renée Elise Goldsberry deserves a mention. None of her numbers would be anything special without her. She has a presence and voice that is remarkable.
Phillipa Soo who plays the wife of Hamilotn gets to end the musical with the only number that had me actually involved - and that's all about Eliza Hamilton's achievements after her husbands demise.",Hamilton

129,joelmulder96,"The ""awe"" in ""awesome""",9,21 April 2021,"The sense of wonder. That is what I felt when watching this capture of the smash hit musical Hamilton. It reminded me that musicals have the possibility and opportunity to be thoroughly epic. To me, this was evident in the variety of songs, the costumes, the choreography, and the manner in which everything works so smoothly. And that is also one of the main reasons why this is such an entertaining musical to watch: everything is balanced. As a language enthousiast and English major, I also admired the mastery of the English language that is carried out here, and especially the playfulness with which this is done. On top of that: the acting is marvelous, the actors all have an amazing voice, and they do some interesting things with the lights. It just works. For me. I can understand it is not everyone's cup of tea. Musicals might not be everyone's thing, and the almost non-stop singing/rapping might not resonate with everyone's interests. All that aside, Hamilton is a high-quality musical production that is worth giving a shot.",Hamilton

136,tashlast,I'm FINALLY Satisfied!,10,3 July 2020,"As a hardcore musical theater buff and by extension a HUGE Hamilton nerd, I cannot begin to express how much of a literal dream come true this pro-shot was! I got to see the touring cast in Oregon a couple of years back and even though it was amazing to see it in theater, even that has it's disadvantages as I was sitting in $300 ""cheap seats"" in the back because you really can't experience everything going on on-stage. But being able to see it with a crowd of other spectators was an enthralling experience and I'll always be grateful for the oppurtunity to see it live. That being said, I've always wanted to see the original Broadway Cast live but couldn't afford it/travel to see it since it was sold out and the cast members started retiring their roles. So when it was announced we were getting this pro-shot, I PARTIED!The cast members gave wonderful performances as expected and I was super excited to see them all shine. Maybe it's just me, but those shaky bootlegs of the OBC have been so engraved in my head so much that it's almost jarring seeing everything and everyone close up in HD. I think the best thing this pro-shot did was highlight the STAGE PRESENCE! I knew it was amazing from seeing the pre-released show clips back in 2015, but in here you can really take the time to appreciate it more.The cast... Holy crap! The insane amount of TALENT in this is just crazy. The cast was phenomenal and everyone brought something to their role. Whether it was wit, charm, charisma, comedy, or drama, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE including ensemble singers/dancers brought their A-game. I need to take the time to especially commend the performances made by Leslie Odom Jr (Aaron Burr), Daveed Diggs (Lafayette/ Thomas Jefferson), Phillipa Soo (Eliza Schuyler), Renee Elise-Goldsberry (Angelica Schuyler), Christopher Jackson (George Washington), and Jonathan Groff (King George). All of those aforementioned traits I adored I stated I heavily enjoyed here, they all represented that to the T and I now have a better understanding of why they all received the awards they did. They deserved it!What makes this whole musical ironic and appealing is how the fictitious portrayal actually made these real life people seem LIKABLE and how it endeared people to actually study up on these people. Our Founding Fathers were horrible people personality and morality wise, but I still have to respect them because they laid down the foundation for a running government to build this country. So for people saying 'it's not historically accurate,' I mean, it's not supposed to be 100% historically accurate, but at least they tapped into people's general curiosity by making a cleverly witty and entertaining play that encourages you to learn. And as someone who has done the research, upon re-listening, this musical for the most part is pretty historically accurate excluding it's over-exaggeration of some of the character interactions and timeline of events which makes Lin-Manuel Miranda a genius deserving of all the awards he got.The stage design, the choreography, and cinematography were PHENOMENAL! You really do feel that experience! Small details I wouldn't have noticed in the audience, I totally picked up here. The angles to some shots feel wonky and sound editing could use some work, but it works and Thomas Kail directed this great! Leaving the live audience in there was the best thing ever because you don't feel awkward watching alone. It's like watching with the crowd and I'm just vibing to it. I also got to say, the costumes were fabulous. And I really mean FABULOUS! For some reason now, I REALLY want Jefferson's coat, and all of the Schuyler sister's dresses. Because they looked aesthetically great on the actors.All of the songs are bangers, and you'll probably find yourself humming to the tune of one of the songs later because there all so catchy. I laughed, cried, sung, and applauded! This is the one time something lives up to it's hype.Maybe this is just my theater nerd bias speaking, and maybe this might change the more I sit on it, but overall, this pro-shot gets a solid 9.7/10 for me!",Hamilton

This experience has zooms, and when you use film techniques on a theater show it loses a lot of its charm..But the show itself, ooh boy. It definitely is an experience.

THIS IS NOT A MOVIE!!!!!!!!!
The amount of negative reviews i have seen moaning that its a rubbish movie. You have to be blind not to see its a theatre performance. And, a very good one.
This is when R&B/Hip-Hop meets history. Not sure how accurate it is as I'm not American, but it was very good.
The stage performance, Lighting, acting, vocals were amazing. I recommend watching this with the subtitles ON, as when you read the lyrics (which are AMAZING) of each performance, it makes it SOOOOO much easier to understand.

There are so many reviews commenting on prominent characters being used twice who are missing the fact that acts I and II feature a bunch of different, new characters. It's common in musicals for actors/actresses to be used in multiple roles -otherwise the cast for each show would be massive. For the people commenting about hip hop and such diversity being incorrect for the timeframe, it's also helpful to Google why Lin Manuel Miranda set this to the tune of hip hop with a diverse cast -it's done with intent.",Hamilton

I would have missed MOST of the plot and exposition simply because it all goes by so fast!. By reading it I could at least keep up.Personally, I did miss having songs with melodies that stick with me after the show. There were just s few phrases that stuck.I did enjoy it, though, and it did get me ""googling"" my early American history and people.

Some of the songs sound exactly the same as others in the show and the main character, Hamilton, does not have a great voice. I've heard worse voices, but his voice is not one I would pay $200 to see. I found all the females in the show to be great singers and have very distinct personalities, while the show made the male characters all seem evil and bad. All the male characters had very similar personalities and they writing for them seemed lazy. Most of the males seem like they were written to be as bad as possible and they were all shallow and cruel.

It took a while to get to the silver screen, but here we are.Firstly, if you do not like musicals you will completely hate this film. There are about 4 lines of dialogue in the entire duration. Furthermore, it has this very comical ""quirkiness"" to it that brightens up the atmosphere but simultaneously takes away from the whole narrative of it. I really don't have too much to say about this. The music was good, the acting good as well. The performances were nice and the stage setups were well done. The fourth wall breaks felt a bit tired at a point but perhaps that is a matter of my own taste.A worthwhile watch but a piece that I do not believe to be lifechanging.",Hamilton

It sounds better than the soundtrack, which is saying something.This is a must watch movie/show. It speaks to history as both a learning experience and something we shouldn't forget. The music is amazing and the lyrics and wordplay are second to none. Obviously I'm not breaking news here, Hamilton has been a sensation since it came out in 2015. Lin Manuel Miranda is a true genius and the world is a better place with him in it.Still, this movie exceeded my very high expectations.

153,hughjman,"Sooooo Good - and if you don't like Act 1, stay for Act 2!!!",10,12 July 2020,"I've loved ""Hamilton"" since the music first became available on iTunes. I must have listened to almost every song a thousand times. Getting to watch the impeccable, exquisite awesome original cast for $6??? Wow! To the people who gave it low ratings because they only made it through part of the first act and didn't like it, I suggest: Stay for Act 2. (Wait for it.) The first act is all youthful, explosive, revolutionary energy. The second act has a lot more variety to the songs - and some of them may make you cry. Plus, if you don't see Act 2, you totally miss Daveed Diggs' hilarious, winning performance as Jefferson. (I love him. Daveed Diggs, that is.) And I look at the historical inaccuracies this way: Yes, the F Fathers had terrible s--t about them ), but the musical is perhaps largely about ideals - and also maybe how those get turned into back-room deals (The Room Where It Happens). I don't mistake the characters as written as exacting portrayals of the actual men, who were by and large awful men - but I wish the cast WERE the F Fathers. :)
So I let the musical be what it is, and what it is musically, lyrically, and acting-wise, is breathtaking. And it's just one (wonderful) show. I enjoy it by not asking it to be more than that. And I can see it as many times as I want for just $6!!!!",Hamilton

Brilliant writer...but he hurt the overall performance for me. I have friends who saw this after he left the troupe and they said it was MUCH better without him. There are a few lines during the rap portions that are laughably bad and take you out of the piece. Oh, and there is one cringe-worthy scene of a mom beat-boxing while her son raps. That was dreadful. The story was a bit rushed at times and there are a few historical inaccuracies.But the rest of the show is pretty top notch. I have heard people say this is the greatest musical ever...it is not. It isn't on a level with West Side Story, My Fair Lady, or Grease where every song is excellent. Or as powerful as a Les Miserables. The songs won't resonate through society the way some musicals have done, As with anything...the hype was more than it deserved. Very good, worth watching, and I would recommend this to everyone, but it isn't quite as good as I expected.

156,joshtill-98100,The Rest Of The World Can Be In The Room Where It Happens,10,16 July 2020,"Hamilton took the world by storm when it opened its doors at the Richard Rogers Theatre in 2015. It was nominated for a record breaking 16 Tony Nominations, Winning 11, making it the 2nd highest number of tony wins under The Producers. I had seen Hamilton in the theatre twice previous to watching the professional shot, and let me tell you, it is truly the next best thing. Although the energy from a live audience is missing, the actors' energy and performances are out of this world. Lin-Manuel Miranda is truly a genius in scripture and a lyrical genius, and we cannot wait to see what he'll do next.The show opens to Alexander Hamilton (Lin-Manuel Miranda), disembarking a ship coming from the Caribbean Islands to New York City in 1776 (""Alexander Hamilton""). Roaming the streets, Alexander introduces himself to Aaron Burr (Leslie Odom, Jr), to whom he was referred to by a faculty member of Princeton University. Burr introduces Alexander to his colleagues, Hercules Mulligan (Okieriete Onaodowan), John Laurens (Anthony Ramos), and Marquis De Lafayette (Daveed Diggs) (""Aaron Burr, Sir""). Mulligan, Laurens, and Lafayette notice that Alexander has a lot of opinions and they put him in front of several crowds (""My Shot""/""The Story of Tonight""). Meanwhile, Burr, alone, tries to flirt with Angelica Schuyler (Renee Elise Goldsberry), who is on an outing with her two younger sisters Eliza (Phillipa Soo) and Peggy (Jasmine Cephas Jones) (""The Schuyler Sisters"").In the town square, Hamilton berates Samuel Seabury, a man who is giving free readings of congress (""Farmer Refuted""). Meanwhile, in Britain, King George III (Jonathan Groff) shows his devotion to his country by building an army to fight the Americans (""You'll Be Back""). Over in Valley Forge, George Washington (Christopher Jackson) desperately begs for a second-in-command; both Burr and Hamilton apply and Hamilton receives the title (""Right Hand Man""). At a ball hosted by Phillip Schuyler, Laurens, Burr and Hamilton helplessly flirt to get a wife (""A Winters Ball""). Eliza Schuyler notices Hamilton and falls deeply in love, and the two are wed (""Helpless""). At the recession, Angelica gives her maid-of-honour speech, wishing the couple to always be satisfied with one another. What she does not say aloud is that she secretly loves Hamilton as well, but claims her sisters happiness is more important than her own (""Satisfied""). The five men go out for a drink and they tease Burr about having a secret lover, but since she is married to a British Officer, he cannot announce it (""The Story of Tonight (Reprise)""). Burr claims that Hamilton is rising too fast meanwhile Burr is more than willing to wait for his opportunity to come (""Wait For It"").On the battlefield, Hamilton waits to be promoted to leader of a command, but instead Washington promotes Charles Lee, who turns out to be a coward, and when being fired, falsely accuses Washington of poor leadership (""Stay Alive""). Laurens offers to duel Lee, to which he wins and Lee is sent to the hospital (""Ten Duel Commandments""). Washington is not too pleased and blames Hamilton for the cause of the duel and orders Hamilton to go home, and much to his surprise, he finds a pregnant Eliza (""Meet Me Inside/That Would Be Enough""). Lafayette is promoted and begs Washington to bring Hamilton back, claiming that they could win the war with him (""Guns And Ships/History Has Its Eyes On You""). At the battle of Yorktown, the Americans win the war, which King George is not too keen on (""Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)/What Comes Next""). Both Hamilton's and Burr's children are born and the two have big hopes for their children (""Dear Theodosia""). Hamilton moves back to New York with Burr and both become lawyers. Burr grows even more jealous of Hamilton's fame, as Hamilton proposes a new form of government to Washington. Eliza and Angelica beg Hamilton to take a step back, but Hamilton ceases to stop (""Non-Stop"").In 1789, Thomas Jefferson (Daveed Diggs) returns home from a trip to France, but is immediately sent to New York with James Madison (Okieriete Onaodowan) to become a member of the cabinet (""What'd I Miss?""). Hamilton, Washington, Jefferson, and Madison have a cabinet meeting and Jefferson threatens Hamilton (""Cabinet Battle #1""). Back at home, Eliza urges Hamilton to take time off work to go with her, angelica, and their son Phillip (Anthony Ramos), but Hamilton claims he is to busy to travel (""Take A Break""). Alone, Hamilton is visited by Maria Reynolds (Jasmine Cephas Jones), who seduces him. Hamilton is given the choice to either break the news to Eliza or to continue with the affair by paying her husband, to which Hamilton chooses to pay the husband (""Say No To This""). In New York, Burr grows extremely envious of Hamilton. Jefferson lets Hamilton discuss with him and Washington to decide where the state capital would be (""The Room Where It Happens"").Phillip Schuyler loses his seat in the senate and Burr takes his seat (""Schuyler Defeated""). At another cabinet meeting, Hamilton wins but Jefferson threatens Hamilton one more time, stating that he is nothing without Washington (""Cabinet Battle #2). Outside, Jefferson and Madison meet Burr who states that he has noticed that Hamilton has been sending money to an unknown entity. Jefferson realizes he has to resign in order to run for president (""Washington On Your Side""). In Washington's Office, Washington informs Hamilton of Jeffersons candidacy, and also states that he will be stepping down from his presidential title, after serving 45 years. Washington moves back to Virginia to retire and eventually die (""One Last Time""). Upon hearing the news, King George awaits to see America go into war with John Adams becoming president and Jefferson becoming Vice President (""I Know Him""/""The Adams Administration""). Hamilton is not too pleased with Adams being promoted and not himself. Jefferson, Burr, and Madison interrogate Hamilton into telling the truth about his affair with Maria Reynolds (""We Know""). Hamilton is faced with a dilemma and forces himself to write The Reynolds Pamphlet, a small essay which explains the whole affair and money issue (""Hurricane""/""The Reynolds Pamphlet""). Alone at home, Eliza decides to shut Hamilton out of her life and burns all of her letters that she had received from him (""Burn"").Now 19, Phillip Hamilton roams the streets of New York, claiming he cannot let his fathers legacy die, and chooses to duel George Eacker, a man who talked down upon Alexander Hamilton. At home, Hamilton tells Phillip to raise his gun in the air other than shoot, and if Eacker was truly a man of honour, he wouldn't shoot. On the duelling ground however, Eacker fatally shoots Phillip (""Blow Us All Away""/""Stay Alive (Reprise)""). Heartbroken, the Hamiltons move uptown and Eliza forgives Hamilton for his actions (""It's Quiet Uptown""). Back in politics, John Adams is hated amongst the population, so the election becomes a battle between Jefferson and Burr. Hamilton votes for Jefferson, stating that ""Jefferson has beliefs and Burr has none"". Jefferson becomes president and Burr becomes Vice President (""The Election of 1800""). Alone, Burr sends a letter to Hamilton offering to duel, to which Hamilton accepts (""Your Obedient Servant""). The morning of the duel, Hamilton lies to Eliza and states that he is going to work (""Best of Wives, Best of Women""). At the same duelling ground where Phillip was fatally shot, Hamilton follows the same motifs, and is fatally shot by Burr. Burr, finally free of Hamilton, feels guilty and goes into hiding (""The World Was Wide Enough""). Eliza devotes the rest of her life to make sure Hamilton's name is not forgotten. She builds the first private orphanage, raises funds for the Washington monument, and establishes Hamiltons legacy, before she dies at 97 and is welcomed by Hamilton into the afterlife (""Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story"").Hamilton is one of those shows that really surprises you. It could be so boring since the story is mostly political, however the tempo of the music, and the choreography really save this show. This is a flawless show, everything is so beautiful and every time you listen to the soundtrack or watch it, you learn something new within the lyrics. Although all of the actors are phenomenal, the two performances that really stand out for me are Phillipa Soo and Leslie Odom, Jr. Leslie won a tony for his portrayal of Burr and you can see why. His portrayal of Burr's descent into madness is truly beautiful and so realistic and Phillipa Soo's Eliza is so innocent and yet so strong at a time when women truly had very little power. Everything and everyone involved in this show, I applaud you because you have created a masterpiece.Hamilton gets a 10/10",Hamilton

But no, it really is so well done, that it draws a viewer in an makes you love it.It's truly hard to understand how a show that centers a whole song and scene on a government cabinet meeting could honestly make anyone want to see it, but this pulls it off! It's funny, it's educational, it's songs are catchy (it's been a few days since I saw it and I'm still thinking of those songs!), it's high energy (those dancers are impressive!), and its exciting (even when you know how it ends you still want to watch how it gets there!).My father was visiting for a few hours and I dragged him over to the computer to watch a few of the musical numbers just to persuade him that he needed to get a Disney+ subscription so he could watch the whole show at home!

It assumes you know a bit about early 1780's history but not too much. The set is too narrow, never opens up. Thinking of it as a movie it was always going to be tricky to transform. not a word of dialogue makes it difficult to absorb one song before the next hits you you.
No I'll be passing on this one, its not that I'm stuck and think Pal Joey was the highest the format could go. This just didn't do it for me.

Those performers on stage would not be singing and dancing in 1776.Sorry. Let's just ignore the genocide, the ethnic cleansing, the chattel slavery of people of color in the time period being celebrated.

The music and the story were intoxicating. Now I really love the story of the American Revolution, though I still don't like rap much. However, the opening to Hamilton was really impressive with lyrics and rhythm. Even so, the only song that I will remember is King George's You'll Be Back. I thought that the actors did a great job, though I was bothered by black actors portraying historical figures that were Caucasian. Now don't go judging me to be prejudicial, I would be just as bothered by white actors playing black historical figures. I am anti-racial actually. I simply appreciate authenticity. Overall, I don't understand why this show is so widely loved. Yeah, it was good, but not compared to the monumental shows that came out in my youth.

In this they were just mumbled and rushed. The actors singing voices were very sub par.This isn't a musical - it lacked everything a decent musical is !

190,olihist,History is Cool,10,14 July 2020,"Anyone who has ever taught History or even studied it will tell you that the most common complaint that they get from people is that ""History is Boring.""But after you finish watching this beautifully filmed version of the acclaimed musical ""Hamilton,"" you will no longer be thinking that.History can be ""cool"" and educational at the same time.There are powerful lessons from the story of Alexander Hamilton that are more than relevant to today's world. But like so many other historical subjects, Hamilton feels disconnected from our world of today. He's another one of these ""old white guys"" that we have to read in a textbook, another one of those ""old white guys"" frozen onto a painting, a statue, or a dollar bill.But what ""Hamilton"" does so well is to take the essential elements of Alexander Hamilton and retell his story - including a number of lesser known characters - for a contemporary audience in ways that they can more easily connect to.There is of course also a political undercurrent, but instead of overshadowing the story, it helps underline its most timeless elements, whether it's race, gender, or wealth.Like many who have already posted reviews, I am not a huge fan of musicals, especially film adaptations of musicals, and especially historical musicals. Most of these tend to be soapy and shallow, full of stereotypes and inaccuracies that only hinder rather than aid the histories taught in books and/or the classroomBut not only does ""Hamilton"" avoid these traps, it manages to tell a beautiful and moving story that audiences from all backgrounds can connect to while remaining true to the essential history.And - most importantly - it's entertaining!History is Cool.Aloha😎🤙🏼",Hamilton

The history is amazing and the music numbers are amazing and the songs are very catchy. The musical is 2h35 long and it seems that it only took 1h. The story is very dense, it gets through a lot of periods of the Hamilton's life and the American history going since the moments before the revolution until the last moments of the Hamilton's life.

And its true, the story telling, the acting, the singing, all of it was amazing. However many parts of the story are left out, making you do some outside research. Now some may argue it would be too long if they were to include all that. I'll leave that up for you to decide. I still, however recommend you watch this",Hamilton

I can see some white racists giving this bad reviews because of the people of color playing most of the roles. But kids need to see people that look like them doing great things.",Hamilton
219,gdog5566,Cringe,2,14 July 2020,"I watched this last night, and all I could feel was embarrassment for anyone associated with this production. The acting is mediocre at best, the music is devoid of any talent, and there is such a distortion of history, that when you throw it in a blender, you get a Walmart brand live action sequel to Frozen.",Hamilton

The score is amazing. I cannot think of a song that I didn't like. Every single character is likable. I think the hip-hop route was definitely a smart move!!!! This is one of the absolute best musicals of ALL time. It can appeal to anyone. I highly recommend this movie musical to anyone. In my opinion, it is the best broadway show.",Hamilton

If I were an American, I would be deeply embarrassed by this... embarrassment in every possible sense. On the other hand, I absolutely understand those who praise this (it doesn't deserve other term): this is just the consequence for the already brain-washed majority.And I am absolutely aware that there are no chances to discuss it, to argue, to reach that majority's mind at all, while at the same time they scream they are ""open-minded"".Close it please, while it didn't leak what's left of that ""open-ness"".P.

226,thompson12001,Painful,6,17 July 2020,"This play was way too long and I have no idea what was even going on. Theater buffs may enjoy this but the only thing impressive about this was Miranda remembering all the lines. Other than that I thought the rap was lame, the female songs sounded like ""Frozen"" soundtrack ripoffs and I didn't find any characters all that interesting.Was Hamilton an unsung founding father? The play didn't demonstrate to me that he deserved any more recognition than he has received. He's already on the $10 bill. What else is needed? He was never a US President. Save your time and rewatch the Mandalorian instead.",Hamilton
227,ashish-cooltech,Meant for local audience,5,16 May 2021,"I love Hollywood movies and their story telling, but this one is for people who are familiar with the story and in love with the characters already.

228,Dannov747,"Watching Hamilton, I felt like a millionaire",5,18 September 2020,"... But I'm not. So maybe thats why I didn't get what was so special about this. I mean, unlike a lot of people who didn't like Hamilton, I was not turned off by the diversity or rap music in this musical. This is obviously a modern take on Hamilton, and for the most part that works quite well. However, I'm not going to declare Hamilton as perfection purely due to the diversity of its cast and music. It seems like coastal elitists have promoted this movie so much in part because of that - due to their virtue signalling and white guilt. Well, I've never used any of that as a basis to evaluate the quality of a musical. Rather, I consider the acting, the writing, the music, the production values, and the message.And for the most part, Hamilton is pretty solid all around. The acting and production values deserve special mention. The choreography and music, are solid but somewhat inferior to some other broadway musicals.The writing, though, is a bit of a problem. As far as an adoption of Hamilton's life, the musical is neither accurate nor a very entertaining dramatization of his life. Furthermore, its upsetting that Hamilton doesn't even bother touching on some of the more interesting ideas Hamilton had, and how those could apply to the modern situation in the country. Obviously, such ideas would be uncomfortable to the millionaire coastal elites watching this musical, so they've been left out. But as a result of that, I at least don't view this as being very culturally significant. If anything, it is extremely inoffensive.",Hamilton
229,P_ter61,Even a European non musical fan loved this!,10,5 July 2020,"Watched this because it was constantly in the news. I generally don't like musicals, to much yelling and shrieking voice.

233,chocoer,"Hamilton is 10/10, this production though....",7,8 July 2020,"Hamilton itself is amazing as a musical, 10/10.This is not well produced. The sound mix is fairly awful, levels are all wrong. Color balancing not well done, really bleached the stage. Weird cuts done with cameras, very awkward angles for some shots, poorly timed changes.They have had four years to clean this up into a spotless copy and this is what we get? Great that it's getting to the masses but would have liked better copy.",Hamilton
234,christinafisher-18669,Not what I expected,3,4 July 2020,"Let me just say screw all these reviewers who are complaining about people of color playing white people and as much attention as this play got why are you just now realizing this?I love musicals. I've seen Wizard of Oz, Little Shop of Horrors, Fiddler on the Roof and The Sound of Music in theatres so I was excited to see this especially since it was insanely popular but EVERYTHING is song, even dialogue, I can't follow it. I feel like my brain doesn't process the words in songs as quickly or something but I just could not keep up so I gave up after 15 minutes. I can't imagine listening to 2 hours and 40 minutes of straight singing. Some may love it and that's cool, I like that they are doing something historical because really how many Americans know the story of Hamilton.",Hamilton
235,amelie_jones,Great viewing,10,1 November 2020,"I'm lucky enough to have seen this in person in London shortly after it opened. I've seen it live twice actually. Unlike many people I didn't know much about it in 2017 and hadn't listened to the soundtrack so I was somewhat aware of the hype but without knowing much about it at all so I went in with moderate expectations. So the first time I went in blind and during the first couple of songs I was a bit confused and amused. But then I was completely drawn in by the great story, characters, songs and incredible choreography. It has emotion, references, fight, tenderness, unfairness, politics, madness, death and revenge. I went in again, started listening to the soundtrack and then watched this version of Disney plus several times over. It's that catchy.To those who find it long, please think of it as a musical that's meant to play in theaters with an intermission of about 20 mins. Like any play or musical, it's longer than most movies. On this note I will say I am not a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber- type cheesiness and I do understand some people are into his work and it makes sense that if you are one of them, you may not enjoy Hamilton as much because it goes over as a lot more raw and serious by comparison.Renee Elise Goldsberry is stunning as Angelica especially in Satisfied. Philipa Soo makes a sweet Eliza and gets a stunning moment in Burn. Daveed Diggs is brilliant as Lafayette/Jefferson. Jonathan Groff is so good as King George that it made me google him and turned me from someone who had no idea who he was into a fan (only partially thanks to this role but mostly because he seems to be an incredible person).I know this show/movie has had incredible promotion and hype which were inescapable on Broadway in 2015-2016 and now accessible to a much much broader audience. Really happy it's reaching people and that it's being well received.",Hamilton
236,r_me_wife73,Cause I'm helpless,10,7 July 2020,"I really did feel like I was in The Room Where It Happened. Even though the only flaw if I can call it that is some continuity errors like the ever changing flower. I've seen Hamilton in the U.S. tour and it was amazing but I missed a few minutes because I ran to the bathroom when it wasn't packed. I'm also poor so my daughter and I were in the mezzanine which binoculars came in handy 🤣
So, it's so amazing to feel up close and personal with the original cast. Jonathan Groff might want to work on that shower he spews or Broadway won't invite him back in the time of COVID",Hamilton

Lin Manuel Miranda being the biggest offender. Ugh, his voice and presence on stage just isn't commanding.The minimal set and costumes are refreshing but I didn't see the need for dancers. Another con is the storyline. Instead of taking a snapshot of Hamilton's life and amplifying it, which would've made it more interesting, we skim through his ENTIRE life at a rapid fire place. As a consequence, I didn't feel for any character least of all Hamilton and his expected fate.",Hamilton

If they had taken some of the song and toned them down a bit and left some of the songs from composer like the original song it might have been good but the way they didn't is as bad as Smelly Cat.",Hamilton

The Wizard of Oz, The Lion King, An American in Paris, Aladdin, The Sound of Music, Frozen, the list goes on and on but never have I been moved so much than with this powerful expression of art that NEEDS to be seen by all who can potentially see it.I am not often moved to genuine, personal tears after watching a movie or musical but this one got me. I cried while watching the musical but that was toward the story elements which managed to break me..and then I cried afterward with disbelief that I had seen a musical of this incredible scale starring men and women of color in a light that felt natural rather than forced or politically motivated.I've been waiting to see this musical for years and now, having got an up-close and personal 160 minute look at it, it deserves every award that it can get and if it can get more awards then darn it, give it to these wonderful people who brought this thing to life. The music, the choreography, the production, the sheer scope of brilliance poured into this musical is FANTASTIC and honestly one of the greatest things I have ever seen.I must also thank Disney and Disney+ for bringing this masterpiece into my life.

242,maztergamer,Broadway Show works surprisingly well as movie.,9,13 February 2021,"So this weekend the Hamilton movie came out on Disney Plus. This started as a Broadway show and premiered on Jan 20 2015. The movie is just the broadway shown as a movie. Which is why it is kind of interesting.As a broadway show you would think that it wouldn't work. I myself didn't buy the hype for it and even after people said that it is really good I was still not sure whether it was good. It is pretty hard to believe a broadway show about history with rapping in it works but it does. This is a good movie.It is hard to call this a movie, not because it isn't good (it is good) because they just filmed the broadway show (literally) and showed it on disney plus. The movie is very entertaining. It isn't that faithful to history but it is a broadway show. It can't exactly be very historically accurate and be entertaining at the same time if you want to have a good show. The music is also very good. I mean the rapping isn't top notch or even great. But it is good rapping and that is all they really needed for a good show. The movie/musical is a movie you wouldn't want to stop watching. It is very entertaining.All in all I suggest that you watch this movie if you have disney plus. It is a great movie.",Hamilton
243,Rcketscientist,They should have cast Hamilton,4,7 July 2020,"I'm not a fan of rap, but the few times Hamilton needs to actually sing were excruciating, Manuel's arrogance clearly cost the silver version.

Seems like it goes on and on and on without end. I kept clicking the remote to see how much was left. The first half was better than the second half. Maybe the whole thing is better in person rather than streaming on tv. On a positive note, I thought the King George role was the best of them all. I admire the performers who can pull this off. Some of the music was rather clever, and I did let the credits role as I googled some of the characters portrayed and the actors who played them.Anyway, not horrible. On the other hand, if I was stuck on a desert island and could only watch one musical for the rest of eternity, this would not be it.",Hamilton

247,DrPhoton,Unlistenable,1,20 November 2020,"I am a musician (40+ years in the trade), and yet I will never get the appeal of rap/hip hop. As far as I can tell, it's just high-rate lyrics recited in a monotone voice, with no attention given to melody, chord progression, structure, thematic development, etc. Musically, nothing could be more boring for me.I refuse to hang on every word uttered in rapid (often gutteral) succession, trying to glean some sort of meaning out of hours of monotone chanting.I tried twice to watch this drivel, but couldn't make it past ten minutes without getting so bored that I found something else to do.",Hamilton
248,Bebeyoda,Honestly Amazing,10,5 July 2020,You don't need to be a history buff (or even be all that familiar with American history) to appreciate and love this musical because it is about so much more than U.S. history and politics.

I would review the plot, but it was impossible to follow it up, and it was confusing at best. I have nothing against musicals, but I hate rock musicals were there is little to no dialogue that isn't being sung out. My expectations were so high and I was actually excited to see it, as I heard it was a masterpiece, but the only good part was during intermission, when I could take a break from this. What baffles me most is HOW people think this is decent, let alone a masterpiece. Save yourself the time, and don't watch.",Hamilton

254,vicrknudsen,I'm never satisfied,9,6 September 2020,"I'm a little divided when it comes to if this should be considered a feature film. It is filmed throughout three nights and it is edited so that it looks like one single performance. On the other hand, it is just a stage show filmed and put together with closeups to gain a little more out of the performances and add something extra. No matter what you'd like to call it, you cannot disagree that the show is one heck of a ride.
""Hamilton"" is a musical about Alexander Hamilton, one of the United States founding fathers, but also one who's legacy was once forgotten. Lin-Manuel Miranda turned the true story into a stage musical, where he is playing the title character. I heard about the show when I was studying drama at a school back in 2016, which was there I truly fell in love with the music. I didn't know so much about the story nor any of the characters, but I found myself listening happily to the songs and tried to figure out how it looked with people. Yesterday, my friend and I decided to see the ""film"" and I was blown away. I finally had images to the endearing songs. I was sucked into it, and before I knew it was over. Three hours had past and I was emotionally touched and excited about it.
First of all, the performances are just truly amazing. Miranda is far from the strongest, however, he still embodies the character with a lot of souls. Though he mostly shines through in the second act, whereas in the first he felt a little stiff. Leslie Odom Jr. plays the other lead, Aaron Burr, and he's fairly better and gives such a heartbreaking performance. Jonathan Groff is probably the best it can get. His performance as King George is somewhat outstanding. Those moments he's on stage he just owns the whole god-damn show. His mimic and body movements are perfect and match his character greatly. Also, everybody's singing is right on key. No one in the entire show does a bad job at singing.
Phillipa Soo is incredible. I will not spoil anything, but if you haven't heard nor seen this thing already you should. It's the obvious one of the greatest theatrical performances by anyone I've ever seen (and I am a theatre kid, I've done acting for more than a decade). It is so heartbroken, words can't describe the talent she has.
I think it's really hard to talk about ""Hamilton"" as a film because it isn't. The stage production is great, it has very excellent choreography and performances as I mentioned. The whole show flows with a nice pace and creative and cool transitions. I wish I someday can see a production of ""Hamilton"" with this amount of talent.",Hamilton

This hit at my heartstrings. Many people will resonate with Hamilton's story as an immigrant and orphan who worked twice as hard to make it and be accepted in society and new country. His insecurity was always there as many other Americans who are questioned and judged. The actors were so talented. I had chills while watching this and cried. I loved that most of the actors were black, Asian, Latino and White. and the fact that this was written, produced by a Latino man makes me even more emotional. The finest piece of art I've ever seen.

So I wanted to experience it for myself - thank you Disney+ !!! All I can say is believe the hype, it's true! This is a magical, fresh take on the musical. A breath of fresh air. About a quarter into watching my husband came home and I looked at him and said this is special you gotta see this, he said he wasn't interested but sat down to play on his phone, read emails, etc but when I looked up at him several minutes later he was transfixed watching it, so even the most cynical musical hating dude couldn't keep from watching and enjoying it. I feel like this isn't a good review but it's hard to put into worlds the joyful feeling we got while watching. And Groff as King George - loved it!!!",Hamilton
263,OzTraveller2012,Totally disappointed after a long wait,1,28 December 2020,"I know I am in a minority here. All the posts seem to love it. A group of 7 friends and I watched this. We were so looking forward to it. We were just before the lockdown and in the peak of winter so were in a cabin excited to watch something decent. Well not one single person in the group enjoyed the show. We had to watch it in 4 parts as we couldn't watch it in one sitting.
The story was fun but the lead, and writer, and musical guy was the worst of them all. All of us had seen a lot of musicals over the years and this was going to be fun, but we were disappointed.Pros
The set was spectacular.
The support cast, as always, were amazing. The chorus always holds shows like this together.
We were so disinterested in the show, that we were googling the characters and historical events and timelines during the show. So we did learn a few thingsCons
We were expecting hip hop and rap music, but none of it seemed to be that hip hoppy or rappy. More gimmicky.
Not a single song felt memorable. Many musicals have that song (or sometimes many) that end up on the charts or remembered for many years. I don't think any of the songs in Hamilton had that kind of appeal. Some songs just went on too long. Also some songs felt like they were ""talking with added music"", not songs.
The story of Mrs Hamilton was far more interesting but was a voice over in the last minute of the show. I guess that is what happens when you write a show, cast yourself as the lead, and make it all about you.Overall, we were all disappointed.",Hamilton

273,keithbolton,Falls between film and theatre.,7,26 July 2020,"Regardless of the quality or nature of the play itself, as a movie this sucks.
One of the joys of live performance is seeing the wide view as well as focussing in on an individual. Attending Opera and musical theatre is all about feeling the energy of the live performance. Its not about perfect notes and multiple takes to splice together to get the definitive take. Movies allow a director to do just that - take multiple views/play/mix/merge and create something that you cant do in a single take on a single set.
This release manages to take miss the important parts of both genres and create a simplistic reproduction of live event. A bit like that poster of a famous painting you had in your student dorm.
When the director moves in for a close up, you find you lose view of what's happening in the background. The crowd obviously enjoy it, but as a viewer a further step removed, that live electricity is lost. If you cant see it live, then this is as decent substitute. If youve seen it and want to relive it - fine.It does the job well.However, as a piece of cinema it fails. It adds nothing. Keep it on IMMD, but is somewhere outside of the Movie section. Because it just plain isnt one.",Hamilton

DISNEY DID IT AGAIN!,2,14 August 2020,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen since ""The rise of Skywalker"" first, I'm don't paying to see a play, I'm paying to watch a MOVIE and this isn't a movie; second, it was super boring, I was sleeping.

Christopher Jackson's voice is just pure velvet; Philips Soo just wow; and Renee seems to also steal the scene in particular when she's there. Not only an awesome voice but amazing acting - as is everyone.This is a rollercoaster ride of emotions anyway - even more poignant when theatres are closed (although sorry Groff - you can see why with all that spit- I realise he's mad King George though!)THANK YOU Lin Manuel Miranda for your absolute literary/musical genius; and thank you Disney for releasing it early to the world and bringing some light back into the world at a dark time.",Hamilton

But even then during the interval and then after in the pub. Lots of people were raving about this. Maybe it's because celebrities were talking loudly, tweeting, FB and insta about how good it was. The voices of the ones who though ""what a pile of crap that was. Thank god it was a free ticket"" were drowned out. But it's just awful, I mean really bad, terrible.

I thought it would be great considering everybody I know that watched it thought it was awesome. I was surely mistaken. I wasn't planning on watching it, but I decided to anyways. It was the most boring film I have ever seen. Half of the people had annoying voices and they never stop singing!
Here is a summary of 3 reasons why Hamilton was a bad musical:
1. The Plot: there is no plot
2. The raps/songs: the raps & songs are the entire script! It works if there are a couple songs here and there in a musical such as in Jersey Boys. What does not work is when there is dialogue here and there and the entire script is rapping and singing.
3. The timeline in this musical does not exist: I spent the entire movie trying to figure out what the heck I was watching, and what was happening!In conclusion: The people who gave this musical a 10/10 have obviously never seen a perfect movie such as The Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption",Hamilton
290,ndsd-35887,Weird film... interesting though.,10,28 November 2020,"Okay, so I watched this film recently. Now I'm not a crazy broadway weirdo but this was very good. I found it confusing because I'm British and don't have the greatest knowledge of American history but I managed to connect to the story. It's pretty great and I'd watch it again in a year or so. Nice.",Hamilton
291,ubershmekel,"Killer music, punchy story",10,7 December 2020,"The first half is definitely the epic part. The last half is the heart string puller, the music is not as memorable, but it worked. I cried at two separate parts in the 2nd half, but I kept relistening only to the song Satisfied, Guns&Ships and the opener which are all in the first half.The musical and comedic talent on display is staggering. I loved the vocal harmonies.",Hamilton
292,soulgood,I'M SO HAPPY,10,3 July 2020,"I have listened to the soundtrack for the past couple of Years and LOVED IT!
I've seen it at the 3 times Pantages in LA ( season tickets) Won tickets to San Diego thru Hamilton App Lottery. Saw it in Chicago And San Francisco for Anniversaries! Each Production Wonderful!

Being on the other side of the world it never cross my mind i will be watching it. And this things barely make it out to where i am, specially not unless is dubbed... which probably will be a Catastrophe.
So when i heard Lin-Manuel Miranda saying it will be released on Disney+ I couldn't believe it. Thank you for that.About the show: it delivers and more. I had a blast watching it, time went by so fast. You won't regret it. It was done beautifully. It was enjoyed deeply.",Hamilton

This was not musical, not even rapping. This was almost 3 hours Drill to the Head of monotonous monologues masquerading as rap. Not to mantion hard to follow story or even differentiate acts, cause its so monotone and stage props don't change at all. Supremely overrated crap.",Hamilton
295,nrlstats,Unwatchable and Embarrassing,1,29 August 2021,Terrible musical about the founding fathers. Rewrites history. Poorly acted. Ear bleeding rap music. Centrist corporate liberal propaganda.,Hamilton
296,hayleedarling,No wonder I've never heard of this musical before,1,12 July 2020,"As an Australian I found the story line really confusing and uninteresting. I mean, it would be like making a musical about one of our old Prime Ministers and expecting other nations to get it. The diction within the rap was hard to follow and monotonous which didn't help with trying to follow the story line and made it unsatisfactory to the ear and I say this as regular rap listener and lover. I'm sure it will be beloved by some Americans but If they are planning to tour this musical in Australia I wouldn't bother as I certainly wouldn't waste my money going to the theatre to see it.

300,olsenry-04499,Worth watching but way overinflated hype,3,4 July 2020,"Lin-Manuel is a great rapper, he is not a Broadway singer. His voice was one of the worst voices I have heard from a musical. However, Leslie Odom, Burr, has one of the best voices I have heard from a musical. My second problem with the production is how historically liberal they were with the story of Hamilton's life. It really made me mad how John Adams was barely mentioned and only mentioned negatively. Adams and Hamilton were 2 of the leaders of the Federalist Party. It wasn't until Adams became President that the 2 separated and tore the party in 2 factions.
King George was the best part of the play. In a play portraying so many founding fathers, it is sad that a British monarch was the best part.",Hamilton

302,censorshipbites,"For all the hype and fanfare, you'd think this musical was actually good",3,23 July 2020,"First off, I can go either way on musicals. I love Les Miz and Sound of Music but have absolutely no interest in seeing LaLa Land. With that in mind, Hamilton was mediocre at best. The best songs were those by King George, decent work was done by George Washington; many lines by Hercules Mulligan were entirely unintelligible. Audience clapping between each musical number was also unsettling.
As for historical accuracy, let's take one scene:
Lafayette and Hamilton: ""Immigrants, we get the job done!"" [Crowd: woohoo!]
The annoying crowd cheer might be attributed to political sentiments (the musical was filmed in 2016). Regardless, the line is historically ignorant since neither was an immigrant. Even though several US states granted Lafayette honorary citizenship, he returned home to France after the Revolutionary War and remained an officer in the French military (when captured fleeing the French Revolution by Austria, he tried using his US ""citizenship"" but given his French rank no one bought it). Hamilton was a British subject who simply moved from one British colony to another (just as someone moving from NY to NJ isn't an immigrant).
King George's songs and the love songs were traditional musical fare; many of the rap/spoken word numbers were undecipherable. You can learn as much about the American revolution while watching this musical as you can WWII while watching Inglorious Bastards.",Hamilton
303,mervenurkaraagac,The Best Musical Ever,10,16 August 2020,"It's a biografical rap musical about a Founding Father of the United States Alexander Hamilton and it's unbelievably perfect. I fell in love with Lin-Manuel and the other cast members performances. He wrote it in 6 years and the result is the best. I have never thought that i may like something more than the Phantom of the Opera but this, this is really superb. I have watched it 2 times in 2 days and i can't get over.

I loved how many of the extras did the parts of stage crew within the dancing they had in specific songs.The entire play was authentic and original. The singing was not auto-tuned as so much of the music is today.Throughout this play/movie a wide range of emotions were conveyed as well. There was humor (especially with the King George songs), sadness (largely at the end of the showing) and triumph (winning the battle of Yorktown).The writing was genius in which the introductory melody was used with different words throughout the play, as well. The finale had a similar thing where many of the songs played a part and many different words were reused in a genius way. I loved this and would watch it again.

The fact that Disney did this to get a TV-14 rating is inexcusable. This show is NOT family-friendly, and for someone under that age to see it you'd need to take out the references to sex, prostitution, and even more censoring of curse words.I will change the rating when Disney comes to their senses and releases the piece the way it was meant to be seen.",Hamilton
310,willgteets,My Review,10,19 June 2021,"I'm so happy Disney Plus was able to produce Hamilton the musical on the big screens for people like me who haven't seen it before to watch. It was such a entertaining and enjoyable musical to watch and a lot of the show really resonated with me. Also, the other reason why I liked it is because I love things about history and this musical really captured the history of Alexander Hamilton's life and what he did as a founding father of the US.",Hamilton
311,hvnlydevil,"If history class was taught like this, I may have learned more",10,9 July 2020,"Never would I have ever thought that I would be watching a play about one of the founding fathers on repeat. I am so grateful this made it to the small screen for those of us who weren't able to catch the live show. Not only is just about every word sung, and beautifully at that, but the songs are done in styles to have you hanging on every word. It's the perfect amount of heavy and emotional with comedic lines and acts (thank you King George III). And while I am aware that the play does take some factual liberties, it had me googling to find out more about these people.",Hamilton
312,swampfox87,Pro slavery and poorly accurate,1,11 July 2020,"How dare they make a movie based on these horrible people. All of them had slaves, and kept us down. And this is not accurate as a POC plays many white roles.",Hamilton
313,chrisgordon,"Electric, entertaining, witty and clever",8,4 July 2020,"I really enjoyed this.Lyn-Manuel Miranda is widely and deservedly regarded as a genius and this musical/film adds more evidence to support that.Clever, funny, rapid-fire lyrics blend with an (until this musical was created) under regarded figure of US history. But his genius is even more evident in his decision to pitch a musical where most of the white historical cast are portrayed by Black American performers... with hip hop music at its spine. Originality is king if you want to make memorable art.The cast in this production are luminescent. They may not all be names theatre goers will readily recognise but you've seen many of them on TV and film. There's even a key figure played by a semi-regular from Glee (singing a song that sounded very Tim Minchin to me).As a huge fan of musicals I was always going to like this. The flip-side of this is that I judged it against the others I've seen and loved.So yes, its hands don at least 8 stars (and most people say more than that, and that's fine) but some of the things I regarded as flaws held me back.Relationships - no real kick-arse relationships of emotional depth except for the one who dies midway through the second act. And while it was portrayed and told well, I felt it failed to resonate as much as it could have by the lack of foreshadowing the bond. The relationship with his wife seemed tacked on and the hinted relationship with another woman (won't add a spoiler here) never delivered. The fact it was never established as fact in the real life story of Hamilton was no doubt part of the reason, but including the hint that goes nowhere served little purpose.The story - Some stories are light by nature (Grease, Little Shop of Horrors) but they at least have a powerful relationship at their base. Some are significant because of the story they cover (Les Mis, Rent)... and they also mostly have a powerful relationship or two in the midst. I know the purpose of telling Hamilton's story was to share details of an almost forgotten figure, but I kinda feel like he deserved to be forgotten. Definitely an intellect, but his role in the War of Independence was bureaucratic, his additions to legislature were significant, but again bureaucratic. If they had hung some of the story on a significant moment rather than to provide a greatest hits package of his life, maybe there was more power to be had? Having seen it and enjoyed it, I still wonder ""why Hamilton?""Anyway, those are just some of my personal misgivings and I DID love the film/musical. Miranda is the genius in this case and while it's very easy for people on the sideline, like me, to critique or fiddle with the idea, there's no idea at all without his amazing mind.You really should see this.",Hamilton

Unlike most musicals with one or two showstoppers and the rest being fillers that bore you to tears, Hamilton almost had no bad songs.

317,DGMcCready,I can't believe it's this good,9,4 July 2020,Never believe the hype. I didn't believe it. For years I had heard so much about a play about of all people Alexander Hamilton-but done to rap or something similar? Can't be good and maybe offensive. But then the noise of its greatness never quieted. So when it finally came to my town I had to see it. But first I listened to the soundtrack. I was hooked. Despite mezzanine seating I was floored how good the play was. I repeated the soundtrack. Day after day and the message became clearer. News of a movie but then a live taping with the original cast. I couldn't wait. Up close made all the lyrics more amazing. The story was better than I recalled. Outstanding performances. I truly loved it.,Hamilton
318,brown-488,Truly at must watch for all the family,9,4 July 2020,"After seeing the show live on two occasions I could not wait for the Disney+ addition with the original cast, the thing that struck me is that in your living room on the TV you appreciate the characters so much more than you do live, as you get to absorb their emotions throughout and see their expressions in detail. The live show provides you with a lot more in terms of viewing, as the cast are constantly performing during the set which you don't get to see on Disney+ version (Camera focus on main characters within scene). I have to admit, when I was 1st introduced to Ham, I was not sure but I am now true fan. I recommend you listen to the soundtrack and then watch the performance, well done Lin & Co, you have captured many of us. May up it to 10 after I watch it a few more times 😜.",Hamilton

It is such a privilege to see the original cast perform this, something I never thought I'd be able to see, and to be able to rewatch at any time. The cast is phenomenal, Diggs, Soo and Groff especially. It makes capturing a complex stage musical look simple when it's anything but - I've never seen a filmed staging done so well, it genuinely captures the feel of attending a live performance but supplemented with just the right amount of close ups and aerial shots. I hope the success of this will encourage the filming of more shows in a similar way, as someone who's unlikely to get back to Broadway any time soon!

Don't throw away your shot at seeing this epic musical!!",Hamilton
325,pedrometzker,"Powerful, unique.",10,6 July 2020,"Broadway is a very exclusive place. There, acclaimed and historic plays are interpreted for some weeks and, most of the times, stay there. Rarely, they are filmed and distributed or interpreted to other publics. Hamilton came to change this, selling not the same experience of watching in the theater, but a very similar one. In the first minute, I was hypnotized. Since then, I didn't take my eyes from the screen. Is a charming film with two acts, one better than the other. The twist of the play is on the songs from GENIUS Lin Manuel Miranda, who wrote the lyrics and composed the melody. The score is a delicious blend of Hip-Hop, R&B and Jazz. Not happy with telling a story and creating songs that have a connection with which other, Miranda added a precise humor in the lyrics, in the right moments, that made me laugh a lot. Besides that, which is too much already, I will summarise other achievements: the costumes are out of this world; the lighting is accurate; the set, although simple and relatively small, is used with intelligence and creativity; the choreographies are fluid; is well filmed, capturing all the emotion and action; directed with a smart eye and performed by a great cast, flexible and competent. After using every adjective that I know, what I can say about Hamilton is that it is a valuable production. You can be sure that this movie is the start of a new trend in the cinema industry. Is a reason to congratulate the ones involved.",Hamilton
326,mchorley-41606,Best thing I've watched in years,10,7 July 2020,"I went in blind, not really knowing anything about the musical or what it was about and was blown away. The difficulty level in the stage play was off the scale. Highly recommend",Hamilton
327,awsafzidane,And that's how musicals should be made!,9,22 July 2020,"If you're not a fan of musicals and can't bear listening to songs for more than 150 minutes without any dialogues, then this film isn't for you. Everything is expressed through songs and you won't listen them talking without being in rhythm. It has 50+ songs (yes, you read that right) in its 2 hour 40 mins runtime. Like other musicals, it does not have songs of a definite genre, but it comprises jazz, rap, hip-hop, acapella, soft songs and many more. Since musicals have a limited audience, it won't gain much popularity. It's a pity that films like Extraction and 365 Days get so much hype whereas a great work like this goes unnoticed.A lot of films like The Sound of Music, Amadeus, My Fair Lady have been adapted from award winning plays. But, this one did it in another way, they filmed the entire play and released it as a film. As a result, you get to be in the room where it happened and experience the magic of watching a live play sitting at home. Lin-Manuel Miranda stars in and as Hamilton along with being the writer of this musical. He does a magnificent job along with the whole cast delivering impactful performances.To me, this is the best of 2020 so far and arguably the best musical of this century. I'd even go as far as saying this is one of the best musicals ever made.",Hamilton
328,user-9826,I loved it,10,7 July 2020,I'm glad it came to Disney plus. I know nothing about American history but I have been searching up these historical characters to find out more.

I loved the actor playing George Washington he has such an amazing voice!,Hamilton
329,suranap,Maybe I would have paid $300 to see it live.,9,29 September 2020,"Lin-Manuel Miranda did an amazing job at everything in this musical. However, he is the weakest actor/singer on stage. It's a long show but you don't feel it because the story is always moving forward. There's enough levity to keep you going. And there are some neat techniques used to make the stage feel alive. Special shout out to Daveed Diggs playing Thomas Jefferson. The man has so much swag he needs his own show. I'm writing in Jefferson for president this year.",Hamilton
330,JudgyJoey,Sang me to SLEEP!,5,3 July 2020,"Most boring storyline I ever had the privilege to fall asleep to! Why?! Why has ""Hamilton"" become everyone's love child?? Social media has rotted the brain and pop culture is dead to me. Don't get me wrong!! The talent cast in this show is amazing, incredible, awesome, kudos all around- But the set, costume, and storyline- ugh - did not keep my eyes open, and!! unless I pop an Adderal, I ain't getting through the second act!! On the contrary, the biography, ""Alexander Hamilton,"" written by renowned historian Ron Crenshaw, once read by and inspired Lin Manuel Miranda to write and act in this broadway production, is now in my Kindle to read. Both Crenshaw & Miranda won a Pulitzer Prize for their adaptation of Alexander Hamilton's life. However, unless you were really studious in American History, this show will go over your head. Especially if you are only an American public high school graduate. (Cause your government failed you, and you is dumb, PUT ON A MASK!) If you are attempting to watch this broadway show (that is filmed on stage with a live studio audience), do yourself a favor and read the Wikipedia breakdown of the show-unless you want to challenge your American civics course teacher and their public school salary. (Hint- they don't get paid enough to care if you can retain the Federalist papers or even recall a single Founding Father's name... I think they are more worried about affording rent for the month.)Judgy Joey",Hamilton

338,ethanelliott-59357,"Lin Manuel Miranda is up his own posterior, but still brilliant",7,2 September 2021,"Watching Hamilton is great. There aren't many complaints for me: the rapping is a bit difficult to keep track of if you don't have subtitles, and it is a bit weird initially, but apart from that it's brilliant. I found the vast majority of the cast to be extremely brilliant in all fields. They all were brilliant actors, however the worst of them seemed to be Hamilton himself as portrayed by the writer, Lin Manuel Miranda.Whilst I would not call him untalented by any stretch of the imagination, I feel a job in music theatre was not Miranda's calling. He isn't BAD at anything per sé, but he's not a brilliant singer or dancer, as shown by the rest of the cast constantly having to make up for that. This isn't my main criticism, but I don't think he would get a role had he not written Hamilton. But that isn't my main complaint.The man is just completely up his own ass. Whilst I understand he's portraying a historical figure, he's being a bit overkill. I'm pretty sure the words ""handsome player"" were not in the history books on this, and for goodness sake it's just so dumb. He has not one but 2 WOMEN saying he's attractive, and for me it's a bit weird considering he probably wrote this. He's quite literally complimenting himself, even in an indirect manner. Everyone who's not a women calls him smart apart from the antagonists, which makes this scream how much Lin Manuel Miranda is up himself. I just think he shouldn't have cast himself because it winds me up.That said, I suppose he has some justification considering he's an exceptional writer and clearly very intelligent. I have no complaints apart from this. Probably exaggerating events in history, but what can you do? After all, no one wants to see ""Alexander Hamilton settles down with one woman"" or ""Hamilton is standing in a field whilst a bunch of men shoot each other and he doesn't do anything."" so I don't really care.All in all worth a watch.",Hamilton

340,ejoshcoronado,How do I justify a 3 Star Rating?,3,6 July 2020,"I feel these criticisms are not trivial, they are musical/storytelling/songwriting fundamentals1. With very few exceptions, the songs that aren't just rapping have very little melody. It's almost like if you gave someone a page of dialogue and said ""instead of saying this, make it into a song on the spot"". It really often feels like there's that little planning put into the melody structure. Contrast that with the music in The Book of Mormon, where nearly every song is an earworm, and incredibly well written.2. Add to that the lyrics themselves, same thing. If you told me the show was improvised on the spot (Which is exactly what Lin did with his group Freestyle Love Supreme) then I could be impressed. But it's not. Lin had time to pre-write this. They're so basic, and repeat SO much. I can't believe the quality of writing choruses like ""I want to be in the room where it happened, the room where it happened, the room where it happened"". Look at the lyrics to The Story of Tonight:
I may not live to see our glory
I may not live to see our glory
But I will gladly join the fight
But I will gladly join the fight
And when our children tell our story
And when our children tell our story
They'll tell the story of tonight
Let's have another round tonight
Let's have another round tonight
Let's have another round tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
Something they can never take away
No matter what they tell you
Raise a glass to the four of us
Tomorrow there'll be more of us
Telling the story of tonight
They'll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
Something they can never take away
No matter what they tell you
Let's have another round tonight
Raise a glass to the four of us
Tomorrow there'll be more of us
Telling the story of tonight
Let's have another round tonight
They'll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
They'll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
They'll tell the story of tonight
They'll tell the story of tonightThey just repeat themselves so much, it's so hard to stay engaged with lyrics like this. You find this throughout the show.3. In Lin you have a man you cannot sing surrounded by phenomenal Broadway singers and it is jarring. If he wanted to put the quality of his play first he wouldn't have taken the lead role.4. This is a story that is complex, covering numerous historical figures, events, policies, court cases, places and dates. And you choose to rap it? It makes it incredibly difficult to catch all of the information they're firing off. I didn't want to but I ended up having to keep the subtitles on.5. Finally, in my opinion, even if this wasn't rap or even a musical, just scenes, I don't feel like it was a cohesive, well paced or structured story/choice of scenes to represent Hamilton's story. It jumps around so much, to different time periods and events. Now suddenly a whole song about some other character who just got introduced halfway through the show. it just felt scattered. Telling the story a man's whole life that was surrounded by so many consequential historical events is a titanic undertaking. It takes an incredible amount dedication and thought and talent. Knowing what it essential to keep in the story, and what should be shed. Where the focus should lie. I like Lin, been a fan since his early appearances in Collegehumor videos, I just feel unequivocally that he did not succeed in pulling this off.To me kind of an exception and the highlight of the show is like 15min in: The Schuyler Sisters and their song. Those three were great together. Special shoutout to Peggy, who kind of stole the show with like 4 lines.",Hamilton

What was most surprising was how well they all fit together in that long time. Great/ super/amazing vocals.I especially liked that it was brought to this day with a little humor. So young people also would enjoy history and theater.Special :d love to King. He was really impressive even he had such a little part.Can't image how it feels to really pull it off :) All great.

344,fefeeley412,Profound in it's humanity.,10,4 July 2020,"Hamilton - last night, I settled in to watch Hamilton and within moments, I was nodding my head along with the hip-hop-inspired musical.
I wasn't raised on Broadway. I am not familiar with a lot of musicals besides Phantom (which I've seen a million times) and Les Mis (about the same).
So that's my limited experience.
But this was mindblowing.
The complex lyrics - forcing me to pay attention to everything that was spoken or sung, held me breathless for the almost three-hour set.
The cast of characters from Alexander Hamilton to Aaron Burr, from Lafayette to George Washington was incredible.
Throughout the story you see the growing animosity between Hamilton and Burr fester.
Meanwhile, you see a very complicated man in Alexander Hamilton - you see his humanity.
You see him rise and you see his fall and everything in between.
From awe-inspiring moments to portions that made me laugh out loud, (Mrs. Washington naming her Tom Cat after Alexander Hamilton), and portions that made me weep (It's quiet uptown) I did not walk away from this unmoved.
""Forgiveness, can you imagine?"" was probably the holiest thing I've heard uttered in my entire 39 years of life. There was mercy, there that took my breath away.
Dealing with issues of war, slavery, immigration, and loyalty - this show was captivating.
Most of all - Lin Manuel Miranda drove home the point that historical figures such as Hamilton and others were very much human. In exposing their flaws, their great deeds shine ever more the brighter.
Gods' profundity is mundane. Human being's moments of profundity are sublime.
A true Tour De Force that was unique in its storytelling ability that kept me on the edge of my seat.",Hamilton
345,scocasso,I Was Really Looking Forward To This,3,3 March 2021,"I had heard about this play for many years, but of course I could not watch the play as it never played anywhere near where I live, so I was looking forward to watching the filming of the play.The production was great! Fantastic sets, costumes, lighting, sound.It started out with anticipation. The audience seemed like they had seen the play at least ten times before, excited, cheering etc. and the audience microphones picking up all this gave the feel of being in the crowd. Really great audio.I kept watching. We kept watching; a number of us watched it together.After a few songs, okay, I get it, it's a historic piece with modern music thrown in. Okay, they're trying to be hip and make boring historical politics cool. Alright. I'll go along with it.After a handful of songs, the lyrics are kind of lame with some kind of barely rhyming hip hop of the same tune, beat, dance'n in the street every next song is sounding like the last one on one sparring verbally throwing in a pun here there and a crick in his walk as some punk gang member strutting his stuff but it's all fluff enough's enough I can barely take it anymore this show's a bore.I started getting confused as to which person was which historical character, so I hit pause and looked up the main people. Oh, I see now, all is clear, they've inserted people of various ethnic backgrounds hooray cheer for all the virtue signally let's grab a beer and celebrate diversity is here clink clank clunk this metaphorical boat is soon to be sunk.Alright, with another eye-roll we kept watching. Oh of course, throw in some feminism, too; can't do anything these days without throwing that in. Which will turn out to be the trans character? Which the lesbian?Don't get me wrong, the performances were great, but the actors are merely doing their job and can only work with what they've got, and it isn't much. The best song, and also a great performance, was by Jonathan Groff as the king. By intermission we were all getting very tired of hearing the same song over and over with merely a change in lyrics. Literally, it was tiring us all out, ""How much longer is this?"" kept going around the room.Very disappointing. The entire script should have been handed over to some real song writers who know how to create a flow that doesn't put the audience to sleep through similar sounding songs. Then cut the entire thing down to 90min.",Hamilton

I think they are cheesy and the opposite of subtle. But I quite enjoy this, the music was really good. But WHY is this so high on IMBD's top 250 movies? It's above Star Wars, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Chinatown, and The Apocalypse Now???
And great films like The Irishman and Annie Hall aren't even on the top 250, yet this is?The music is incredible, but when it's on a Top Rated MOVIES list, I need more than just a great soundtrack. Maybe the labeling of the medium is wrong, and it should be on a list of musicals and not movies, who knows. But when it's with the top rated movies I need more than just a great soundtrack, I need great characters, a great plot, a great script, ambitious themes, and great cinematography. This greatly lacks these, but especially lacks the latter.I get that it's a lot hard to film a live performance, but my god, half the shots in this movie have the characters head completely out of the frame. There's a scene where it holds on George Washington for about 10 seconds, and the frame is centered on his chest and his head is completely cut off. Most of the stuff in the background is cut off. It really took me out of the movie.Besides that here are some pros:Humor was on pointMusic and lyric written was really cleveras far as I know it respected the historyEccentric performancesKing George was especially funnyending was coolReturning themes felt a little forced but was cool to see returning themesObjectively the movie is about a 9 but subjectively for me it was around a 5 or 6",Hamilton

All the dances are so seamless and the dancers are incredibly talented and skilled. The main cast members are all fantastic. Lin-Manuel Miranda is a perfect charismatic and witty Hamilton but the real star of the show in my opinion is Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr. His voice is so beautiful and he has amazing vocal range. I love all the music as I previously stated, but the performances add a lot of emotion and meaning to those songs.My only issue has nothing to do with the show itself and is more of a personal preference.

It's very, very long and the songs all sound practically the same. The set is quite basic compared to many other big productions. Lyrically, it's very clever but the lead character's voice is quite weak and high pitched and it's hard to feel any empathy with the characters as there is little chemistry between them.

It's a performance of its time borrowing from popular musical themes and references. If you don't appreciate rap (talking over music) perhaps it's best missed for you. I was more than OK with the style.But is it up there? I doubt it very much.It seems to conflate British with slavery, but perhaps I misunderstood. But I found that irritating and frankly cheap. Perhaps that is what popular culture is limited to - a cheap inaccurate narrative.It looks like a forerunner to something great. In itself, it's not a bad way to while away a couple of hours, but in my opinion, it's not a masterpiece.For the performers, they should be very pleased and there are several people in this who are extremely capable.Original - for sure, but if I was looking for something truly great I would look elsewhere.",Hamilton

To begin with let me tell you I do know a little about the founding fathers of America, but not the story of Hamilton (1) and I am not an American, but born and raise in The Netherlands (2). And before I say more, the musical is just great.I like all the players, the costumes, the dance and the songs. When you ask me who of the five players you like best I would say Lin-Manuel Miranda as Hamilton, Daveed Diggs as Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson, Renée Elise Goldsberry as Angelica Schuyler, Jonathan Groff as King George (such a great performance!) and Chris Jackson as George Washington. Offcourse a great compliment for Miranda, who was also responsible for the story and music; he also was one of the producers.There where great scenes and songs throughout. I find the hip-hop awesome from the beginning to the end. As a not-American I had a little time to adjust, but with the capital on a little time. With the first song going I became fascinated. Okay yes, the best enjoyment would be to have been there live. Never the less, seeing it on your television has also positive things for it to say.

I have been to The Lion King multiple times and loved it each time, it's actually a huge part of my youth. But living in Europe, I couldn't just go out and buy a ticket for Hamilton. Instead I waited. And after 4 years of waiting, I was finally able to experience Hamilton in full. And let me tell you: it was worth it.",Hamilton
377,flordiper-52828,Incredible,10,7 July 2020,"This is the first time I've ever written a review on here but Hamilton deserves it.
It's my favorite musical and I was lucky enough to watch it live on Broadway in october 2018 and it was absolutely amazing but now thanks to this I had the chance to watch it with the INCREDIBLE original cast.
I love how it's just a recording of the show. Best way to captivate what it's like to be in the room where it happens!",Hamilton
378,khaycock,Something truly original & entertaining with the WOW factor,9,10 July 2020,"Hamilton is a fantastic modern musical of which there was no hype about it in the UK - not that I noticed anyway.
It was something advertised on Disney + that I just decided to watch due to having time to kill because of the COVID-19 quarantine! ...but WOW. I was blown away, I'm English & knew nothing of American history (I do now).
I never knew who Hamilton was, so I went into this rather blindly and naively. This show somehow manages to do what other stage productions have not successfully achieved; make that leap to a film and be incredible, breathtaking and executed impeccably.
I was delighted by the modern rap, the casting, the jazz, the virtuosity of the actors, the rap battle (what a giggle in itself) the close up expressions (which you miss in a theatre & greatly enhanced by the expertise of the performers), the stage choreography & the humour. American humour doesn't usually bring a smile to my face, let alone make me laugh. Hamilton however, managed to break this pattern and had me giggling out loud all by myself.
Being English I had to write a review to let other Brits know how fantastic this film/show is & how it will entertain them too. Don't pass this up just cause you think it's going to be some boring US history stage show that won't quite make it, cause this is anything but that!
I never rate anything 10. Although I rated this 9/10, I must admit, I did deliberate scoring my first 10 over this show.
I recommend you watch this, you won't be disappointed. It's quite unlike anything I've seen before. Thoroughly entertained from start to finish. In fact it was so splendid, nothing I watch in the near future will come close to satisfying me half as much as Hamilton managed to achieve. Plus I learnt something through osmosis- :-)",Hamilton
379,markussia,Brilliant,7,6 July 2020,One of the untraditional musicals I have ever seen. The actors who played their parts were superb. Not a fan of rap but my mind is open.,Hamilton

381,eme-59343,"Nothing short of an 'Awesome, wow!'",10,6 July 2020,"As a huge fan of the soundtrack, this was such an amazing experience as it is truly an unprecedented capture. Without having seen the show before you don't realize how much Groff and Ramos steal the show, as they added the most contextual yet non-singing moments. It really puts into perspective how much of a phenomenon it really is. 10 out of 10, would watch again, I hope they release it on digital and DVD at some point.",Hamilton
382,fairk,Hamilton is Superb,10,11 July 2020,To have an opportunity to write and preform in the most highly acclaimed Broadway show since Gilbert and Sullivan. Sheds no comparison to the times it was written by a young Puerto Rican and preformed by such a talented cast of singers and dancers to be preformed while in office to our first black President and his First Lady and daughters. It goes without saying the storyline parallels Hamilton's actual achievements for such a young man as this young writer. Bravo all I can say is the stars aligned in this moment in time.,Hamilton

384,oliviajmakar,It's a 3 hour rap,1,12 July 2020,"I watched the entire 2h 40m film to give a solid review for the whole movie. I personally didnt think it was all that great, but I can understand why people hype it up to be this amazing production. It helps knowing Alexander Hamiltons story before seeing ""Hamilton"". I'd compare the script writing like a poetry slam with rap. The music that backs up the script/lyrics is so bland. It's a solid beat 90% of the movie, nothing like an orchestrated score. I wish they played around with the beats given, added some variation to it. Im loving the diversity, but I did find it odd when some historically white characters had black actors. The historical inaccuratcy of the play gave me a unsettling and confused feeling. For a fanfiction, it's really great and unique with a new spin on history. It's just not my cup of tea and I had to force myself to finish watching it. I've seen a few Broadway plays and a Shakespeare's globe play, Hamilton is my least favorite.",Hamilton
385,matthewwhittick,10 stars isn't enough for this masterpiece,10,23 July 2020,"This is absolutely the best thing I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The acting was brilliant, the songs were amazing the casting was spot on. I usually dislike it when British people are painted as comic book villains in media about/containing the revolutionary war, but King George III was one of the best characters and was amazing to watch. I highly recommend watching it",Hamilton

After hearing all the buzz about this musical about a founding father (of all the topics they could choose) for five years, I decided to spend the beginning of my 4th of July weekend watching Hamilton.Was it good?No....It was great. Amazing. I was actually blown away by how good it was. The songs are catchy (the lyrics and flow are just 10/10), the performances are brilliant, there's nothing not to like about Hamilton.I'm currently looking up everything I can about Hamilton.I think I'm a fan now!",Hamilton

390,mrnanuplstouchme,A masterpiece and life changing experience,10,20 July 2020,"A while back me and my niece, Acerola, took a roadtrip to Chicago to go see Hamilton: An American Musical. We had some trouble getting there since Acerola kept getting distracted by the beauty of Chicago (We had to bring our pokemon along with us so they kept distracting us as well). However, it was one of the best experience I've ever had with musical theatre. Recently with the quarantine, me and Acerola decided to introduce this musical to my son, Guzma. We all watched it together on Disney+ (Since we're not time-travelers and I can finally afford to get a month of it) and he actually really enjoyed it. Every now and then I find myself humming ""Satisfied"" and not even realizing it. My favorite character was Thomas Jefferson. Putting that pain Alexander in his place. Anyhow I recommend this show to anyone who has Disney+.",Hamilton
391,josephinelu87,MEH.,5,27 July 2020,"I hear so much about this. Guess the hype spoiled the show. Incredibly difficult to follow, unless you're a teen or milemial who can follow rap. The first parts are just way too fast. The slower songs are great and it does have so much going for it, but it does not live up to the hype.",Hamilton
392,matwheatley,Boring and hard to understand.,3,7 September 2020,Everyone in the production is incredibly talented. It's just boring and hard to understand the actors. It is definitely not meant to be historically accurate either.,Hamilton

394,dalexbury,Worst movie/play ever. A waste of my time,1,30 December 2020,"I had fairly high expectations for this movie/play as it was highly recommended by my friends. The songs were repeated again and again making the whole show tedious. The characters were completely dull. I could barely follow the plot as the movie could not captivate my attention at all. The film was also far too long. It was a complete waste of time. I absolutely hated it. It's even worse than Les Miserables.I was so stupid to give this a second chance to see if I my opinion had changed about this film but nothing improved my opinion. In fact, the rewatch made the experience worse.
Disney should be ashamed for releasing this abomination. I wouldn't even recommend this to my worst enemy.",Hamilton

396,Walt48,Outstanding filming of an outstanding show.,10,4 July 2020,"I saw this show on Broadway about 2 and a half years ago. This film version of the play is just the right combination of close and distant shots, capturing the feel of theater and combining it with the intimacy of film. I have been attending Broadway for a bit over 50 years now and this show is certainly in my top three. The material is outstanding, dancing, singing, history lesson. I know a film can never totally capture the experience of seeing a show live, but I have to say, this one comes as close as I think anyone is ever going to get.",Hamilton
397,nc_costa2002,how is it rated so well by others?,3,22 July 2020,I was forced to watch. I was told that I was so wrong about thinking I wouldn't like it. That I would love Hamilton and for me to just watch and see. Absolutely nothing about it was enjoyable for me. Just a long boring musical. I love musicals and I'd say this is the worst one that I've seen (love or on screen),Hamilton

402,poliwhirl-213-266201,"Superb, lives up to the hype",10,15 December 2020,"Funny, clever, catchy, quotable, highly watchable...
I originally watched the bootleg that a friend had lent me. Even though the sound and image were bad I was completely drawn in right from the first song. My TV viewing attention span is generally around half an hour max, but I watched the first part in one go.
After familiarising myself with the soundtrack, watching any stray videos on YouTube and downloading the Hamilton app in the hope of winning one of the free tickets, I started hearing the rumours about the movie version on Disney of all places.
The very morning it was released on Disney I was up practically at the crack of dawn subscribing, and the next thing, watching the whole thing in bed. Finally proper visuals and sounds, and close ups! Leslie Odom Jr's expression at the end of the first song is amazing: ""I'm the damn fool that shot him"".
And it just gets better from then on.
I'm not a great musical or history fan but this musical is a cultural landmark and the movie not only does it complete justice but also consoles all of us who never got to see the real thing. Superb.",Hamilton
403,ncpeeper,Awesome!,10,7 July 2020,Genius! This is great! It was simply amazing! I love how diverse it is while telling the story of Hamilton.,Hamilton
404,duffasaurus,Surprisingly Fun,8,9 September 2020,"I had heard of this musical for years and even though I like musicals I just thought it would be super boring. I'm not a fan of historical fiction and assumed this would be awful. Surprisingly it's a lot a lot of fun, the songs are really catchy and I found that I was really enjoying myself. As a movie it isn't incredible, but there are plenty of films that get high ratings just because of special effects, plot or acting so I guess I can rate this highly based on really enjoying the music. The acting is okay, nothing special. The story is good, mostly accurate but obviously taking some artistic license. The lighting and cinematography are mostly great but there's some times I wondered why the camera was so close to a person's face and wished I could see the other actors. The singing is phenomenal. Overall I really enjoyed watching it and l listen to the soundtrack when I cut the grass now. That being said I think this is one musical that would benefit a lot by being translated into an actual movie with proper sets and locations.",Hamilton
405,arch-ssm,I finally get it!,10,20 July 2020,"When the hype around this stage production reached the mainstream, all I kept thinking was That 'there is no waaaaay that this is all it's amped up to be'. Honestly I just watched it for the sole reason of proving that theory. It's not so foreign to me that Americans usually magnify things that are made about their history to huge proportions for no apparent reasons. All that said though, I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS WAS! The story itself is very interesting, and I'm saying this as a person who has almost no knowledge about that period of American history. I believe a runtime of 2 hours and 40 minutes is long for anything, but certainly not this. Entertaining, witty, weirdly romantic, sad, not shy, impressive and most importantly refreshing! I highly recommend it for the sole reason that it's conveyed how much hard work and dedication went into it. It IS worth the hype, if not more.",Hamilton
406,om-lab-rat,1 star was the least I could do,1,5 July 2020,"This was the worst musical I have seen since La-La Land. To be fair we only watched almost 18 minutes (which was 4 more than La-La Land), but we were not compelled to continue. The story, the music, it just did not grab ahold of our attention. It didn't help having to watch the 'king' slobbering thru his solo. We truly love seeing musicals, but this one was overrated and a serious let-down.",Hamilton
407,majeda9,Epic and intimate,10,5 July 2020,"So I couldn't go see Hamilton in the theatre because of the lockdown and don't know when I will be able to. But this turned up on Disney+ and my head is still spinning by how incredible this production is. Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius to have written this. Every performance in this story is flawless, engaging and emotive. The big moments are heart stopping and the intimate ones are heart breaking.My 8 year old son, who was engrossed in his Switch, stopped playing his video game and couldn't take his eyes of the screen within the first moments of ""Alexander Hamilton"". He said the songs were amazing.Hamilton lives up to all the hype and hyperbole, and then some. The best show I have watched since Les Miserables.",Hamilton
408,a-ehsangar,A great movie to get familiar with the early american history,10,31 July 2020,"As a middle eastern, I think this movie is great in every aspect; however, the most important factor is the way that it narrates the early history of the United states for somebody foreign. I was glued to my seat because of the spectacular music, acting, and lightning of the scene. Believe me, you will get so astonished in some parts of the movie that you won't even want to blink. I know some people don't like history or think it's boring, but this movie is the exact opposite of boring. Overall, I think this movie is a great choice for foreigners to understand what the founding fathers of the United states did. Furthermore, it shows how important it is for everyone to understand the history of other countries as well.
Hats of to everyone involved in this project.",Hamilton

414,boodle-72886,Exhilarating,10,5 July 2020,"I almost never write reviews on here but I watched the recording of Hamilton over 24 hours ago and I think I'm still feeling the emotional impact of it. I can't lie, I was one of the diehard fans of this show in 2016, and my mum and I used to listen to the soundtrack together all the time so when we saw that this recording was being released we were super excited even though it's been ages since we were properly into the show. I was kind of nervous going into watching it because I was worried it might not live up to expectations but I had nothing to fear. The live vocals of most of the performers were somehow even better than they were on the cast recording, and seeing the staging made me appreciate certain songs more than I ever had in the past. Had to subscribe to Disney+ for a month to see it but it was well worth it, even though they bleeped a couple of the swear words. A beautiful viewing experience I would recommend to anyone, whether they're a fan of the show or not.",Hamilton

I've been keen to see Hamilton since it's opened but no performances in my country yet and couldn't spare the expense to travel overseas just to see a show. This met all my expectations. Took my love for the show even higher. I hope we can see more musicals done this way with the same cast that performs in the live show. After the awful abomination with the massive budget Cats film, this shows you don't need to go over the top with CGI and special effect to produce a fantastic musical film. Watched with my dad who had never seen or heard anything about the show, and he also thoroughly enjoyed it to the end. I hope Lin-Manuel Miranda has a few more musicals in him ....",Hamilton

Yuck!
Its historically inaccurate (to be kind) and apparently Broadway musicals no longer require the lead to be able to sing. He just raps and chants.

I did realize that it was a staged historical musical and I was intrigued what this combination had to offer.15 minutes through, I was still searching for answers. Sure the Music and the choreography, flashy lights, talented people and... what else exactly?
I see forces in action but I don't see any yield!What I actually saw after the first 15 minutes is: the first 15 minutes of decent performance multiplied by 12: 3 hours of repetitive good stuff.To prove my point, While I was fast forwarding through, I couldn't even see any change in stage set or backdrops. Not even in the lighting color pallet. Just the same stage setting throughout. No matter how good a story is, no matter how lively and active you cast, a little bit of stage creativeness wouldn't hurt.Sorry to burst your pink bubble all you mainstream hype fans. But that's not my idea of entertaining history story telling.",Hamilton

Would recommend to literally anyone.",Hamilton
426,gonikassif,Great but too repetetive,8,4 July 2020,"Good songs, good plot, good everything basically, but someone needs to explain to Lin that there's a difference between establishing musical themes for different subjects and between having the same character sing the same song 5 times with slight lyric changes. That's not smart that's just lazy and it makes the musical longer than it should be. I think it would have been better if it would be 30 minutes shorter and less repetetive.
This musical is still great though, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and I think almost everything about it is done fantastically, but this little detail of repeating the same songs over and over made this thing feel long and slightly exhausting to watch.",Hamilton

442,sleeper-33811,"Rotten, conservative, slavery-promoting and too long.",1,14 July 2020,"To quote Ezra Brain in Left Voice:""""In the midst of a movement against systemic racism, Disney has released a filmed version of the musical Hamilton. But when one looks past its diverse cast and enjoyable score, it becomes clear that Hamilton glamorizes slave owners.Even a cursory investigation of the text of the musical reveals it to be one of the most conservative shows in recent memory. Miranda has written a very effective piece of propaganda for the slave owners who founded this country. He adds insult to injury by having Black and Latinx actors portray the very people who oppressed and murdered their ancestors...Is there anything less progressive than presenting the Founding Fathers as moral stalwarts fighting for liberation? Miranda views the Founding Fathers as great heroes and slavery as just an unfortunate lapse in judgement. The political point-of-view in Hamilton is actually to the right of most modern K-12 history books. In a time when protesters for racial justice are tearing down statues of slave owners, this is a musical designed to celebrate those same slave owners.""",Hamilton
443,ChelseaKT,Almost as Fantastic as the Real Thing,10,2 August 2020,"When we are all mourning and enraged on racial justice in the world, this lyrical musical shines a light on the stories that built the United States and does it by including all cultural backgrounds.The film is beautifully shot, choreography outstandingly orchestrated, and performances blow out of the baseball park.As someone who knows every word in this singalong socially relevant story, I will watch this again and again for years to come. I will also still go to see it live in person.",Hamilton

I was not expecting it to be that enjoyable, as I've never had a good experience watching a live recording of a Broadway Musical. The crew did a great job, camera angles and the cast, impecable, good work! The music is totally the key, and the lyrics Wow! I can't tell how long is the script. Great adaptation, really creative. Perfect timing; I realized of the length of the movie only at the end of it. It really caught my attention 100% to the bone. And make me wanna buy tickets to experience it live.",Hamilton

450,shamarmcraig,Absolutely Amazing,10,9 March 2021,This is one of the best musicals I have ever watched and I am so appreciative that a series of people were incorporated within the show. It really opens the world up for new opportunity when everyone feels included and accepted.,Hamilton
451,yahyaagustian,Must watch!,10,24 July 2021,"I've never been fortunate enough to watch the production at broadway cause I live 10,000 miles from there.

452,adassaofficial,"Innovative, Artistic, Timeless!",10,9 July 2021,"Seeing history with a modern twist performed by such an amazing cast was incredible! David Diggs, Leslie Odom Jr., Rennee and of course the AMAZING Lin Manuel Miranda brought a flawless performance not just to the stage but to the big screen!",Hamilton
453,autumnmoloney,Genius!!,10,30 July 2021,"As soon as the opening song begins, it instantly gets you hooked!! The music in Hamilton really is nothing like you average musical theatre sound, and that's what makes it outstanding.It has a hip-hop, pop and rap style of music throughout the performance which will not be found in any other musical.The actors are superb and portray the roles perfectly in their own way. There's something in Hamilton that everyone will enjoy.They say that Hamilton is 'the story of America then, told by America now' which i think is genius.How Lin Manuel Miranda has decided to portray the founding fathers as people of all races, i think is amazing. It shows how America really is nowadays.Overall the story is emotional, beautiful and powerful. I 100% recommend it.",Hamilton

455,gilbertsnyde,What the heck????,2,9 July 2020,"I was told if I like musicals, I have to watch this one. I wish I had been warned. Maybe if I wasn't blind sided I might have liked it. First, the characters are blackwashed, which made things a little confusing for me trying to figure out who is who. There is no attempt at all to try to look like the actual people they are portraying.Most musicals have scenes interluded with great musical numbers. This is one constant song that is mostly hip hop and rap. Did not appreciate the many uses of the Lord's name in vain either.The background never changes, this is the first musical I've ever seen that used the same background throughout the entire production.I don't understand what all the hype is, but it definitely wasn't for me.",Hamilton
456,mexfogel-2,Watch it at 60fps and not at the default 24fps if you want to get the real liveness of a live show,8,7 July 2020,"I've watched the show live in NY and in SF and this is my advice to get the most raw live realism possible out of this movie of a live recording.The movie was released at 24fps which is good for normal cinematic movies but for live shows or live sports you want 60fps for realism. You achieve this by turning on the frame interpolation on your TV also known as the soap opera effect. With this feature on your TV will generate the in-between frames missing to make it look like it was recorded at 60fps and it will look more like what you see in real life. The performance will look more honest and you will be able to appreciate the show more for what it is.TV's have different names for the same setting so here is a few to help you find it:Motion Smoothing
Motion Interpolation
Sports Effect
Action Smoothing
TruMotion
MotionflowThe raw liveness of the show is already compromised since it was made with the recordings of 15 separate shows in the span of 3 days and was mixed to look like a single performance (2 with a live audience and 13 without to capture close-ups). Even thought the editing and mixing is exceptionally very well done it is simply impossible for the audio to match the lips perfectly on every single shot. Your brain subconsciously will catch the millisecond discrepancy no matter what and it will take away from the realism. If you add an unnatural 24 frame rate the whole show looses its realism completely. 24fps for films is great because it makes the acting more dramatic and cinematic, for live shows it takes away the raw intensity of their performance.Trust me on this if you want to watch a 10 and not an 8.",Hamilton
457,spudit2003,"Did I miss something? Was ok, but nothing great",5,19 September 2021,"My main reason for watching this was to find out what it was about, I didn't exactly know the story and wasn't even aware quite the level of hype around it. But ultimately, I did not find it very engaging at all, it was difficult to follow the story line. Whilst rap and RnB are not my sort of music, even the other songs were not particularly catchy or that good. The main thing I noticed was their similarity to Moana - I did not know before I watched, but it turns out Lin-Manuel Miranda who wrote Hamilton also wrote the music for Moana, and this is not something youtubers have missed!I got a vague sense of what was going on, but felt there wasn't enough 'action', the story was pretty much all told through singing at each other.I understand that the concept of using different styles of music to bring something new to musical theatre, but just feel that as a whole, it didn't work that well, but possibly because of the story. The wars were not portrayed that well and as mentioned, the rest of it is just talking (well, singing).The standout parts for me were the King, who's songs were pretty good and performed well, the women, who had some good songs and Jefferson who was the only character which I felt had any distinction, I couldn't even work out who most the others were.I usually enjoy musicals, I would suggest anyone who is thinking about watching it to watch some clips on youtube and see whether you think its the best thing ever (like apparently everyone else) and then either invest your time in it or don't based on that. But its fairly samey throughout.",Hamilton

I live in a small town in remote Australia. I bet you can guess how many times I have had the opportunity to see a Broadway show, but damn have I dreamed. While I completely understand that live stage shows have a magic that is near impossible to replicate, I NEED to thank Disney for trying.Lin-Manuel Miranda was incredible, and such a goofball. The sisters three were captivating. I couldn't take my eyes off of Renée especially. What a voice! And my dear Jonathan Groff, while his part was small, really deserves more recognition. I will forever be referencing his Groffsauce.When this is all over, dear reader, make sure you go out and support the live shows. Support the actors. The crew. The writers. The producers. The directors. This is such a hard time for anyone in the creative industry, but we need them. We need to help them get back on their feet for what is life without creativity?",Hamilton

Basically the theatre is dead and its stages are only used for comedians and singers. The same people who try to prove otherwise (using the same methods) are burying it even deeper.Hamilton knows this, he gets rid of everything that has killed the theater and creates his own rules to create a MASTERWORK
With the standards that today's audience considers entertaining and fun. An almost three-hour play that doesn't let you blink at how interesting it is.Hamilton reinvented the theater as it should be!I'm sorry to know I won't be seeing anything like this for a long time.",Hamilton
473,johnnieortega,Much better than I expected - but definitely not for everyone,9,26 August 2020,"After reading a bunch of reviews on IMDb, I watched this play on Disney+. I was not super interested in it, but decided to watch it anyway. I have to say this is not for everyone, if you're older, you might not like the music or singing; or if you like a more traditional broadway production.The music, lyrics, and execution is flawless. The story flows quite nicely with very emotive scenes and some amazing singers. Lin-Manuel Miranda is not the best singer, but he does a nice job with the acting. The show will require an open mind and acceptance of a less traditional format.Historical Accuracy:
They do take some liberties with historical accuracy to advance the plot, which is okay, I'm not watching it for a history lesson; as I have already read quite a bit about Alexander Hamilton. This is ENTERTAINMENT.Socially:
I am sure there will be some fragile white folks who will be extremely angry that black and brown folks are playing white folks, after all, racism is alive and well in the US, but I don't mind at all (and yes, I'm white).The reason I gave it a 9 is because I felt the show is a bit unbalanced. The first half is better and feels less rushed than the second. Overall I really enjoyed it.",Hamilton

Not only does it school you on a lot, but the way it's played was amazing. My husband and I watched it without wanting to look away at all. The music is great the way it's sung, well preformed by all actors. I can't say enough good things about this play! Watch and see what I'm talking about. I wanted to see this on broadway and so did my husband, I'm am great-full I finely got to see it. One sad thing I had to watch it home. It was all I had wished and more!",Hamilton

Its inclusion is making this lists lose its meaning, like when a last ""Evangelion' series long last chapter was included as well.",Hamilton
481,poleypup,Easily the second best musical about the founding fathers,2,4 July 2020,"Overall it is not very impressive, and way overhyped. The writer feels a need to denigrate other more well known founding fathers in order to prop up his guy. It mocks John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, without whom there wouldn't have been a Declaration of Independence to begin with. Even Washington seemed to be clueless unless the great Alexander Hamilton was advising him. It's very New York centric which probably explains why it's so popular on Broadway.
Musically, I guess it was ok but not really anything I would normally listen to.
There are many other broadway shows I would recommend over this one.",Hamilton

493,LaSky16,A Stunning Capture of a Broadway Phenomenon,10,3 July 2020,"The music and story of Hamilton will forever be at home on Broadway. However, not everyone can afford to attend a Broadway show, especially one as high profile as Hamilton.That is where this stage recording of Hamilton comes into play. This stage recording makes it possible for many more to see this masterpiece of a musical performed by its original Broadway cast.Some may claim the camera work is simplistic and that it doesn't quite feel like an authentic theater experience. Both can be valid criticisms, as a recording will never be the same as actually being in a seat in the Richard Rodgers theater, experiencing the show.However, as someone privileged enough to have seen Hamilton at the Richard Rodgers Theater in person (Not the Original cast though!), I can say I felt nearly as much emotion from this stage recording as I did in person. That speaks volumes of the powerful music and story that Lin Manuel Miranda has created about the life of the Ten Dollar, Founding Father without a Father.It is a beautiful thing that this stunning piece of Broadway can now be made available to the masses of the world through Disney Plus!",Hamilton
494,shawndobbyn,The Musical to prove you don't hate musicals,9,30 August 2020,"If you're like me and have a strong agenda against seeing musicals then Hamilton is absolutely the movie to break this notion, as the sheer genius of the music alone will have you replaying the songs over and over again for weeks after first watching, the story often takes a back seat as the choreography and musical numbers are the main attraction here with the story giving the songs much more potency",Hamilton

I never understood how people could say something like a movie or musical could change their life but I have to admit this is life-changing. When I first started listening to the soundtrack in late 2016, it was after Prince, David Bowie, Glenn Frey and others passed away. Hamilton was the bright spot in an otherwise yuck year. Then this movie comes out- oh my God. To see the original Broadway cast and such an amazing production- it's beyond anything I've ever seen before. It's not perfect, but that's what makes it great. If you're a fan of '90s rap, broadway show tunes, or history, then this is for you. If I could give it a higher rating than 10 I would. Awesome in the true sense of the word!",Hamilton

It also makes Hamilton and other characters like Washington out to be innocent of slavery while vilifying only t.Jefferson of it when in fact they all participated. I was hoping for more. Again musically it was good, not great, but historically it ignores major character flaws while focusing only on positive attributes. He picks what characteristic or virtues of Hamilton to even bring up, while sweeping his shady stuff under the rug.",Hamilton

510,herewegoagain-57051,Male fantasy,7,10 July 2020,"Sorry to rain on the parade, but... the female characters were really bad. No it's or buts about it. They all sing about how much they love Alexander Hamilton and little else, and make huge sacrifices for him even while he is mistreating them horribly. Their songs are all dedicated to him, yet he never sings about love, if that's what he feel for any of them (his actions makes me think not). I suppose that would make him unmanly?I also noticed that his saintly wronged wife has pale skin, while the seductive red-dressed adulteress has the darker skin of the main trio. A bit of colorism there, no?I think the show should be empowering not just to non-white men, but also to non-white women. Before I watched this I had the impression the Schuyler Sisters were feminist icons and the intro song was an immediate rude awakening. That said, the female singers were great and deserved better roles.",Hamilton
511,yvonnew-16142,AWESOME!!!!!,10,10 July 2020,"I don't usually like musicals but this one was AWESOME!!!!!!! Beautiful songs, a GORGEOUS cast, and wonderful scenes. I am DEFINITELY watching this again! It's very informative as to the life of Alexander Hamilton. It's a MUST SEE!!!",Hamilton
512,bfkofhebdo,Most overhyped thing I've ever seen,2,16 July 2020,"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I cannot understand what people love about this show. There is absolutely no character development. The story is boring, too long, and too verbose, the rapping makes it extremely difficult to follow and the beats are terrible. The people rapping aren't very good, Miranda being the worst of them. His rapping and singing are god-awful and he ruined character by casting himself instead of putting in a performer who was on par with the rest of the cast. The all minority cast is purely a gimmick for attention and ticket sales to distract the audience from how monotonous the show actually is. This story is boring, no matter what race the cast is. If I'm going to see an all-minority cast, I want to see a true minority story. That would've been much more earnest and compelling, in my opinion. The women in the show have absolutely no identity beyond how much they all love Hamilton, even though I feel they were the best part of the show, performance-wise. Their songs are some of the few redeemable points of the show. I also liked Washington and King George's performances, but even King George got boring after a while because there was literally no variation in his song each time he came out. If this is supposed to be a Les Mis-inspired show, I'd say it's garbage comparatively since Les Mis is my favorite musical of all time. I feel like I wasted 3 hours of my life but I'm just thankful I didn't pay money to see this live.",Hamilton

514,moviedirectoraidanwalsh,Best History Lesson of the Century!,10,20 August 2020,I just watched Hamilton! It was very good. The music was sooo good that I bought the whole soundtrack. I liked how the actors portrayed The characters and I think Lin-Manuel Miranda did perfect work on the play. I am actually working on a Hamilton recreation movie on Minecraft,Hamilton
515,lauracatslsf,This is by far best musical I've ever watched.,10,1 April 2021,"How can I describe Hamilton?... The choreography, all the songs, those amazing details... All the cast, producers, artists are BRILLIANT. Lin-Manuel Miranda really did a good jog here. Breathtaking!",Hamilton
516,martinblancoireneimb,"Innacurate, disrespectful and anti-black",1,23 July 2020,"Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote a story about himself, only replacing his figure with that of Hamilton. The only problem as that if he included slavery or the massacre of indigenous people, well, it wouldn't exactly be as palatable, right? At least not to white people.
The music is good, really good if you can look past some of the lyrics, and the choreography is excellent, but that's kind of what we expect from a Broadway show, and those two things definitely can not be used to counter all of its flaws.
At its core, having idealising the founding fathers is anti-black. Having a cast that is not white perform does not change the fact that they are still portraying these historical figures. It's not fiction, its a historical show. It does not even present itself as a retelling of the story, but as the story, as it happened.
Slavery is mentioned only a few times, and it is used only to remind the audience that Hamilton was totally opposed to it, even though it is a lie. The only real abolitionist mentioned in the whole show is John Laurens. When I first heard it, I, too, fell for it. I was obsessed, the only thing that annoyed me was the whole Angelica Schuyler unreciprocated love thing Lin decided to add for some reason. I was annoyed that John Laurens was dismissed as a gay man and only mentioned as Hamilton's dear friend who died. But besides that? I would sing it at the top of my lungs. Jefferson's songs were my favourite and I legitimately did not see a problem with the lyrics ""Sally be a lamb, darlin', won'tcha open it?"" when Jefferson receives a letter. This was Sally Hemings, an enslaved teenager. The girl picked after his wife died. The girl he raped, who was forced to bear his children time after time. That might be the most extreme instance of Lin's lyrics being disrespectful (to put it lightly), but in general, everything Jefferson says that is supposed to be 'hypocritical' (e.g.: ""I can't believe that we are free"", after defeating the British but while still relying on slavery to sustain their economy and lifestyle) is not presented as such, or when it is (Hamilton calling Jefferson out during the first Cabinet Battle) is, once again, used to point out how good Hamilton was, even though he married into one of the wealthies slave-owning families and he himself traded slaves. This is a man who documented everything, who wrote and wrote and wrote until every single idea in his mind was also printed on paper. If he had been an abolitionist, we would know. If he had been an abolitionist, he would have made sure the three thousand enslaved men who fought alongside his friend would have been freed, as it had been promised, instead of being returned to their masters. There are many more problems with this show, of course, but the idealisation of these historical figures (Washington is literally just the great general, an even greater father figure to both Hamilton and the nation, such a nice guy, 10/10) is immoral.
Another, lesser problem, for me would be the fact that it also presents and reinforces the idea that anyone who works hard, no matter their situation, will rise to the top. That's why Lin wrote it, that's why Obama and many others relate to it. Hamilton was intelligent and lucky. His ability to learn languages and improve his writing was that of a genius. People paid for him to get to the continent and he quickly gained fame because he was smart and had a silver tongue. While he worked his ass off for the things he got, a fact that no one can deny, so did those around him. He was loud and confrontational and openly against the revolution, little fact that simply inst mentioned in the musical. He was basically that Samuel Seabury figure that is later relentlessly mocked and didn't change his mind until meeting Laurens and other revolutionists. Back to Washington. Charles Lee was a good general and in the position to make calls such as 'hey there's a bazillion British troops let's maybe not die', he might have made mistakes in battle but in this musical, he is framed as a lousy general, a villain used, once again, to highlight just how good Hamilton and Washinton are.
I'll stop here, but I hope more people, especially those in positions of power, understand how this show is problematic and harmful.
The ensemble are great actors and I would totally recommend checking out their musical and acting careers ('Blindspotting' and 'Monsters and Men' are great movies), but this musical is simply unsalvageable. I understand that, for a story to be compelling, you cant include crude facts such as massacres and injustice on such a scale, but since it is how things were, Lin should have known that, rather than erasing and omitting so much pain and suffering and altering facts as he pleased, he should have simply not made this musical. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.Also, go watch 'The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda' by Ishmael Reed.",Hamilton

518,zw-03216,a revolution in musicals,10,24 July 2020,"Hamilton, is a musical about revolution, and also a revolution in musicals.When the British King became the ""clown"" in this musical, when the actor of Aaron Burr was also the ""narrator"" of this show, when the congress debate became a rap battle, when the death was prolonged by Montage, I knew it was a unique show.But more importantly, it taught me that pain is stronger than happiness, and loss is more touching than success.It could have described the success in Yorktown or the rule that Hamilton had set. However, they were not as touching as the moment when Burr and Hamilton had disagreement, as the moment when Angelica gave up and let her sister married Hamilton, as the moment when Eliza was disappointed to Hamilton, or as the moment when she forgave him, as all of those painful, hurtful moments.Who lives? Who dies? Who tells the story?Alexander Hamilton, should have been written in those history books. But ""Hamilton"" cut those books with a knife, and the blood came out of it.

NO, cinema don't work like that, thinking in giving it 10 or 1 stars is just be part of the problem, this video (because I don't consider this a movie, maybe the most this can hope for is a TV representation) is just garbage like cinema, 4/10 only because is not a steady cam in the place of the audience (all the time, because IT IS A STEADY CAM in the place of the audience most of the time, like a thrash bootleg).

I ended up very moved and almost cheering at the end.Of course, now that I am familiar with the story, I would love to see it live and would enjoy it immensely.But I would strongly recommend this for a first time viewing.

Now having seen Hamilton for the first time I have one flaw that keeps it from being perfect. The GD sound mixing. There were multiple instances where the sound was muffled and I could barely hear what was being said. This happens a good bit mostly in the first act. I will definitely watch it again, but whoever mixed the sound was either working with what he was given or really didn't care. Maybe the early release put him on a time crunch.

554,theatricalscot,Not Quite A 10... but close.,9,7 July 2020,"Seeing Hamilton as a film rather than the play (which I saw on Broadway with some of the main cast) has its pluses and minuses. On repeated viewings of the movie version I'm picking up things I never saw in the play, and they are magnificent. The stage version is, I say this unashamedly, the single greates piece of art in any form that I have ever experienced, but part of that was the shared experience and maybe that is the element that is missing here.The film is sensational, but it also shows the flaws in a way that a live audience may not pick up. Some of the harmonies don't quite land in the film (Schuyler Sisters being the most glaring), the close ups both enhance certain moments and yet the loss of the bigger picture at times slightly detracts.Any quibbles are minor in the extreme, but if the show on Broadway was a 10 (and it was), the movie is a 9.9. Tremendous, but just shy of perfection.It's a cultural phenomenon for a reason, and undoubtedly there will be those who just don't get what the fuss is all about, even those who hate it. Nonetheless this is the kind of cultural event that you should participate in, even just once. The references from this show are numerous and will infuse our culture for a generation or longer.But also, its just that good. I think most people will instinctively get why, even if they're foreign to theatre. Some things just touch the soul, and Hamilton has already proved it is one of those. The movie isn't the same experience, but its as close as many people will get.Don't throw away your shot.",Hamilton

571,kasey-albayati,Everything I wanted and more,10,8 July 2020,"I want to start this review by letting everyone know I have seen this show twice in person and it never ceases to blow me away. I was unable to watch this original cast live and in person, but thank you Disney for giving us this gorgeous piece of theater.I am dumbfounded by these one and two star reviews calling this musical ""trash"" and ""utter nonsense"". I have been listening to the original broadway album since it was released on major music streaming services five years ago. Being able to put a face to these incredible voices is an absolute treat. To those who fail to understand what the hype is about, I feel sorry that you do not enjoy and feel the same emotions that I feel when watching. Seeing Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr, perform ""Wait For It"", brought a type of characterization that you simply cannot get from a recording on Spotify. His portrayal of Mr. Burr brings a sense of vulnerability and encapsulates the emotions of the human experience that I never experienced with other actors in the role. Similarly, hearing Christopher Jackson as George Washington sing ""One Last Time"", made me overwhelmed joy (not to mention his voice is butter) These are the voices I have spent the past five years with. I listen to them when I drive to work, go to the gym, or when I'm hanging out with friends. Now I have a live production I can watch at my fingertips!Is the story 100% historically accurate? No, of course not. Is the story at its core true? Yes, I believe it is. There are too many characters that made an impact on Hamilton's life to include in a two and a half hour musical. Some things are exaggerated and some timelines are off. For example, Burr and Hamilton do not duel after Jefferson wins the presidency, it is years later for a separate, but similar matter. A ton of research went into this show, like the relationship of Hamilton, Lafayette, Mulligan, and Laurens.The raps are quick witted and the music never gets old. This story has a ton of implementation for our current generation. Also, it is safe to say that Hamilton's vision of America is pretty close to where we are today in terms of capitalism and our federal government. Jefferson and Hamilton GREATLY influenced and shaped America. We owe a lot to them and I think this show eloquently gives them the credit they deserve.",Hamilton

Did they not get one of the many themes that was put into place in this musical? Do they not remember the line: ""Immigrants, we get the job done."" It boggles my mind that THAT is what people are upset about. They're upset that there is too much diversification and that Lin Manuel Miranda, and man of Puerto Rican decent who grew up in Washington, wrote a masterpiece designed to cast people of color.This musical is amazing. The ones are catchy and poignant with their wordplay, the acting is amazing (especially that of Daveed Diggs and Leslie Odom Jr.), and the fact that it teaches us certain aspects of our history that schools won't even teach us is amazing.

583,blaketierney,Near perfect but please fix the sound issues!,10,3 July 2020,"The show and cast are unbelievable. Such a gift to a of us that they recorded the original cast and are now making it so readily available.Filming was excellent but there are significant issues with the audio. Specifically, their voices are generally on the center (or center/left/right) channel(s) like most movies. But then they randomly cut in and out of the surround channels as well. This happens right in the middle of when they're talking or singing. It's clearly a mistake/unintentional and is super distracting. Listening on a 7.2.4 system and rewinded to make sure it wasn't my system - nope, always messes up the same way in the same spots. Please fix the sound issues, and then this will be perfection!",Hamilton
584,Trevtenntitans-1,It's Not a Movie,1,24 December 2020,"I thought Hamilton was great and I listen to the soundtrack often. However it's not a movie and it shouldn't be included in the ranking of the best films of all time. If someone recut Breaking Bad into a 2 hour version and put it on Hulu should it then be considered a film? Hamilton is a wonderful recorded musical, I just don't think it's a film.",Hamilton

That being said, it seemed to me to lack the true signature melody that makes really great musicals classic. It was not the kind of show that I would feel compelled to go see again and again as I might other true classics of the stages. I think it's novelty is largely what propelled this show to its status, not necessarily its excellent writing.I enjoyed it, but it lacked any solid hook aside from the overall concept.",Hamilton

Like so many others it drew me in and wowed me with its catchy, clever and poignant lyrics and I was desperate to see the stage show. An incredible friend bought me tickets to go this year but due to covid it got cancelled, I along with thousands of others were devastated by this.
When I heard Disney were releasing this version it was like wedybeen given a second chance, not only to see the show, but the original cast! I've never been one to queue or refresh pages to get something first but at 8am UK time I was hitting play as soon as it appeared.And wow, what a show. I laughed, I cried, I want to watch it again and show everyone I know already.The songs I was already so familiar with felt new and exciting as each performance was so expertly choreographed to tell the story. With not much more than a single revolving stage piece I felt the action tangibly, Hurricane and The World Was Wide Enough were breathtaking.I know this phenomenon already has a huge fan base who will be watching this over the next few days but it's amazing that so many people who may not have had the opportunity to watch will now be able to.",Hamilton

Not only is it an incredibly accurate and powerful musical, but the cast... KILLS IT. The standouts are Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr and Phillipa Soo as Eliza Hamilton, but everyone else gets their chance to shine and rises up to make this musical a piece of art that WILL stand the test of time. Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius and has a mind like no other and his great work should and will be applauded for generations to come.P.S. Jonathan Groff as King George is utter perfection in every sense of the word.",Hamilton
599,mafnaan,The only film I feel about for watching on a torrent.,9,5 August 2020,"Thoroughly polished, rigorously checked, constantly enhanced, coherently embellished, and I don't know what adverbs I can use to describe this masterpiece. Hamilton will keep you glued from the very beginning. The rich and diverse music, the lyrics fitting in with each event, the costumes, the acting, the comic timing, everything is PERFECT.
It's not just a film, but more than 2 hours and 30 minutes of a rich and diverse story about one of the founding fathers of America. A very important masterpiece in terms of American culture, this film is definitely worth a watch.
And like I said, it's the only film I feel bad about downloading off from a torrent because you'll never see, ever, any troupe of actors putting in that much an effort as Lin-Manuel Miranda and his team did in a span of more than 2 and a half hours of this film.",Hamilton

606,michaelkrynski,This musical won't age well,2,11 July 2020,"Just a couple years departed from it's premiere, Hamilton is already losing some grace. The dialogue and songs are very literal and require no thinking on the part of the audience and the character development never gets started as a result. Good art needs to provoke thought and emotion, for you to really care about it. I felt bored outside some of the better numbers.The novelty of the the racially prejudiced cast will surely wear off over time, so I'm not exactly sure what Hamilton will hang it's hat on in the coming years. It's quite possible, after all is said and done, that Moana turns out to be Lin Manuel Miranda's masterpiece.",Hamilton
607,zollaaaron,A great gift to humanity during the virus,9,3 July 2020,"Hamilton became the most popular musical in recent years for a good reason. It tells an interesting story through beautiful lyrics, music, and acting. The Broadway musical is incredible, and anyone who was able to see it in person are extremely lucky. With the recording finally released, anyone can get the front row feeling in their home.To the many who have listened to Hamilton countless times, this is your movie. To the many who have never seen Hamilton and know nothing about the revolutionary war, this is your movie. Hamilton tells the story of a founding father. It tells of his success through his many failures and flaws.Personally, I loved the recording. It felt very well produced. The mixing was great, except I felt like some songs could have been louder for emphasis. An additional thing that I would like to say is that there is no autotune in this recording, which makes these three shine: Christopher Jackson, Daveed Diggs, and Phillipa Soo.9/10, very rewatchable.",Hamilton
608,pwanless-25678,Sound mixing really needs some work,7,4 July 2020,"While the acting, story. and music is as spectacular as the hype and Tony awards indicate, there are just too many parts in the show where the orchestra does not balance the voice, most especially in the chorus parts. If you've listened to the album enough times and know the words as I have done, obviously this is not an issue. But when I watched with friends, two of them who had never seen the show, each independently told me that they could not understand all of the music being spoken. Solos, duets, no issue on that at all and they both loved those parts as much as they should.",Hamilton

613,chrisst-33817,"A Nonstop Display of Awe, Wonder, Theater Magic, and History!",9,13 July 2020,"Hamilton is a wonderful modern telling of an important historical figure. What makes the film incredible is the jaw-dropping performances, the incredibly entertaining set design and costumes, the impecable story-telling through rap, and the addicting music. I had listened to the album WAY before I was able to see the musical, so I had an idea of what to expect. However, the musical was nothing like what I expected. It exceeded all my preconceived notions about the film. Lin-Manuel Miranda is a master at his craft and I hope that his future films are at least as good as Hamilton. Please watch this film to be entertained and to learn some history! HIGHLY recommend.",Hamilton
614,mattyliao,Theatre Nerds Try To Write HipHop,5,19 July 2020,"I finally watched Hamilton.
I enjoyed it like I enjoy jam scones. Problem is I was expecting some flaming bombe alaska; not because of all the hype though that surely played a part; but because that's what listening to Hip Hop normally feels like for me. Flaming Bombe Alaska, not jam scones.
I love the lyricism. It's clever, slick, powerful. Props to Miranda for writing some sweet bars to spit. Also, the use of leitmotif was well executed, if not subtle. And some of the choreography was pretty brilliant, especially the use of the 'turntable ring stage'. Awesome.
The music itself though. If you know someone who can't get over how great the Hamilton soundtrack is, who can rap every line of 'Alexander Hamilton'... I mean this in the nicest possible way but just picture that person in your mind for a while and ask this: on a scale of 1 to Dababy, how black are they?
I get that the founding fathers were in fact, white guys, and that hip hop in broadway is novel. But I think the musical arrangement seriously sounds like a white theatre geek tried to write hip hop and forgot to add any gangsta cause he was too busy eating jam scones. Where are the fat 808s that make my car seat vibrate? The trap runs that slap fire? The syncopated stabs/plucks coined in the 2000s that scream 'badass', or the repeated piano riff ala Eminem et al brimming with down-to-earth raw emotion? Nowhere.
Instead we get almost classical vocals from the main love interest; who did have a wonderful voice (perfect for the Sound of Music or Elsa from Frozen) but sounds so cringe when toplining over a pseudo-rap beat just 1 minute 30 into the first number.
Then there's the titular character himself. Why, Lin Manuel Miranda, did you think it was a good idea to cast yourself as the centrepiece of your own musical... did you seriously think your lack of vocal training wouldn't blatantly show amidst a FULL CAST OF BROADWAY SINGERS? 😭
Look, jam scones are nice. I really do enjoy them still. Hamilton is worth a watch. If you love it, props to you. Now go get some actual hip hop into your system!",Hamilton

My seats were up in the back, and it's absolutely wonderful to be able to see the expressions on the actors faces, the dynamics of the choreography a bit better and to watch it with the subtitles on so that every terrific bit of lyric can be enjoyed.And, yes, I had to add the above side note in the title to my review, because there is false information going around that Hamilton owned slaves. He was opposed to slavery and should certainly be faulted for not doing more to prevent it, but no, he didn't own slaves:",Hamilton

626,EliseHeaney,Inspiring title with modern views,10,24 November 2020,"Despite Hamilton being around for a few years now, it has become more popular this year. This is all for good reason. It tells the story of Alexander Hamilton in such a beautiful and artistic way that captures and engages the audience with a variety of different numbers. The change in tempo between various songs and all of the incredible and moving dance sections enhances the audience's attention meaning that everyone is hanging onto every last word being sung.This Broadway show is an a very good way of learning about this founding father and the lengths that he went to in order to do what he thought was best. The amount if detail that is hidden within this show is what makes it even more enticing.The lyrics, music, acting and dancing has allowed the audience to feel every single emotion being portrayed.

So I let it go. Until yesterday. This was like me walking into the theater in 2016 with no knowledge except that I heard it was great and something about ""my shot""... MY GOD. I was stupefied. Enthralled. Enchanted. Entertained. Riveted from beginning to end (and it's not short). I laughed, I cried, I grooved, I sang. I marveled at the choreography and staging.
