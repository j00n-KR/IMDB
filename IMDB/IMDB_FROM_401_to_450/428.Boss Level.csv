0,Leofwine_draca,Same old,6,7 September 2021,"Not a bad film per se, just one that's entirely predictable and offers nothing new for the seasoned film fan. Frank Grillo plays a guy caught in some kind of real-life computer game where he ends up getting killed by assassins on the same repeating day, so it's very much THE TOMORROW WAR, GROUNDHOG DAY and EDGE OF TOMORROW rolled out yet again. This works to a degree thanks to lots of inventive CGI-dominant action and funny one-liners, although it tends to stall whenever heavy emoting comes into play; Naomi Watts is completely stiff here and the climax a complete let down. Still, the rugged Grillo does this kind of thing in his sleep by now and it has enough energy to see it through, just about.",Boss Level
1,SnoopyStyle,video game Groundhog Day,6,25 March 2021,"Roy Pulver (Frank Grillo) wakes up to a repeating time loop being hunted by a series of outrageous assassins. He is killed every time for unknown reason. On the previous day, he meets up with his ex Jemma Wells (Naomi Watts) who is working on a time-space machine run by Colonel Clive Ventor (Mel Gibson).The first twenty minutes is a crazy action film. It's glorious fun. Then A-lister Watts and former A-lister Gibson show up. It loses a bit of steam while it lays a plain vanilla sci-fi story. I do like some of the personal story but the movie just couldn't maintain its momentum. Also, I'm getting tired of the Gibson rehabilitation tour and Will Sasso is not a heavy. They both take away from my enjoyment. This starts with lots of kinetic fun and it stays somewhat compelling all the way to the end.",Boss Level
2,Prismark10,Boss Level,5,28 August 2021,"Boss Level is a time loop arcade style action movie.Roy Pulver (Frank Grillo)is an ex soldier who has his very own Groundhog Day. Every morning he wakes up, people want him dead.Assassins are after him and Roy tries to make it as far as he can before someone kills him. He has no idea why until he decides to get smart.It is something to do with a secret project that his ex wife Jemma Wells (Naomi Watts) has been working on under the auspices of Colonel Clive Ventor (Mel Gibson.)The arcade style action is to do with Roy levelling up as he needs to go further into the day to find out just what his wife was working on. This includes learning sword fighting skills from Michelle Yeoh.It is fun as a mindless action film. It loses momentum badly when it goes for the more emotional character beats. The boss level is going one on one with Mad Mel Gibson.",Boss Level
3,nogodnomasters,The real Liam Neeson,8,20 February 2021,"Roy Pulver (Frank Grillo) was a member of Delta Force. He is separated from his wife/girlfriend ( Naomi Watts) who is the lead scientist at the Osiris Spindle project which alternates time. She works for the evil Mel Gibson who wants to change the past for the better. Roy is stuck in a Groundhog day like time loop with a bevy of assassins after him. He gets killed multiple times and like a computer game, starts over. He needs to get to ""Boss Level"" and take out Mel Gibson.The plot was fairly simple. Decent action film. Great soundtrack.Guide: F-word. Near sex. No nudity",Boss Level
4,kosmasp,Rinse and repeat,9,10 June 2021,"How many times can you repeat the same thing over and over again? And will you get tired of it? I imagine there are some deleted scenes here with some interesting stuff that was cut due to pacing issues. But even with the stuff left in, it is more than enough to tingle your action bone/sense or whatever you want to call it. No innuendo here and just a lot of violence, in case you were wondering.Having said all that Frank Grillo does an amazing job playing the guy who knows a lot of things and has also seen a movie or two (Taken reference in regards to himself and also the Indiana Jones scene ... a very infamous one, taken here with a twist). And add some gaming references too, a very small role for MIchelle Yeoh and others. Actually that may be the only thing that I sort of ""dislike"" here. There are so many different and cool characters I would have loved to have explored more ... to have more scenes of! Will Sasso looks anything like that fun Dude I know from other movies ... he's quite buff and strong like a mountain here. And then you have Mel Gibson ... how cool is he? That's rhetorical ... and while I wish there was more of him ... he at least has that one scene/monolgue or story time that kind of makes up for that.So if you are not squeamish and you know the director and his work and humor ... you'll probably love this as much as many here did.",Boss Level
5,paul_haakonsen,Very enjoyable - and repeatable - action movie...,8,5 March 2021,"Well, I must admit that I wasn't really expecting all that much from the movie titled ""Boss Level"". Why? Well, it was a movie with Frank Grillo and Mel Gibson in it. Not really something that thrilled me particularly.But given the fact that I hadn't already seen it, and was presented with the opportunity to do so, I found myself sitting down to watch director Joe Carnahan's movie ""Boss Level"".And color me impressed...This movie was a blast. I loved the storyline and the way that things were repeated over and over, but at the same time made quite different. And it was these changes to the same situation that made the movie so enjoyable. Sure, the storyline was also good and definitely proved to be entertaining.And I will say that Frank Grillo was actually quite good in the lead role for this movie, and his performance was spot on. He was actually rather nicely cast for a movie of this type. And while Mel Gibson was in the movie, though not for all that long, it was actually fun enough to see him in a a villainous role for a change. ""Boss Level"" also have the likes of Selina Lo and Michelle Yeoh on the cast list, which was quite a nice treat.""Boss Level"" is action from start to end, and it was the enjoyable kind of non-stop action. Which was something that surprised me, and definitely brought a lot of enjoyment to the movie for me.If you haven't already seen ""Boss Level"", I can strongly recommend you take the time to do so, if you get the chance. This is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie.My rating of ""Boss Level"" lands on an eight out of ten stars.",Boss Level
6,bombersflyup,Total Carnage!,4,16 February 2021,"Boss Level mostly only succeeds in its humour.I've seen so many of these repeating the day films, it just doesn't find a unique path. Grillo's alright, but a better lead could of made a difference. Gibson and Watts decent, but Gibson once again underutilized.",Boss Level
7,deloudelouvain,Sci-fi action Groundhog Day.,7,29 March 2021,"I just watched Cosmic Sin a couple days ago, another movie with Frank Grillo, and that wasn't a pleasant experience at all so I wasn't sure about Boss Level once I saw he was in it. But in Boss Level there is also Mel Gibson and Naomi Watts, both actors that I can dig, so I felt a bit more confident. In Cosmic Sin there was also Bruce Willis, but lately that's far from being a good thing as he seems to have lost it and just gets involved in bad movies. Boss Level is enjoyable to watch, and even if you think it's going to be yet another version of Groundhog Day (how many times more can they make a repetitive day movie?) this one is actually not that bad. There are a lot of good action scenes, with good choreographed fighting scenes and creative killings. Although repetitive it's never really boring, on the contrary the little changes in the story make it unpredictable and intriguing. Boss Level is a good sci-fi action movie that is easy to watch.",Boss Level
8,siderite,"Excellent and concise, it is a proper sci-fi story, with some decent action",9,1 March 2021,"Do not get deceived by first appearances. Yes, it's a small movie, it stars Frank Grillo, who had to act in some pretty shoddy films in order to get ahead and it's not something for the Oscars, but it is a perfect little film for what it wants to do. The plot is simple: infinite time loop, second movie like that I've seen in two days. But instead of having the hero moan about the boredom of having infinite time, which always annoys the hell out of me, it starts with people wanting to kill him. All top assassins, finding him wherever he runs. And if he dies, he starts over, if he does not, his wife dies, then his son, then the world ends.If I had to compare it with an existing film, I would rather compare it to Hardcore Henry than to other time loop films. Yet that film was an experiment in video game cinematics, while this is a decent sci-fi story: a good ole what-if, with some action sprinkled for fun. So congratulations to Joe Carnahan and to Frank Grillo, because they made one of those gems in the mud that people talk about. And yes, Mel Gibson is a secondary character at best, but so is Michelle Yeoh, and both are perfect for their roles and they clearly have fun with them.Bottom line: watch it, you won't be disappointed.P.S. Is Naomi Watts annoying in real life, too? I mean, all her characters are awful. In this one she admits she didn't know whether her plan would work, you know, the one where she kills her husband over and over and over again, then the world ends.",Boss Level
9,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Uneven but above average sci-fi thriller,7,17 August 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Morning * Monday MorningRoy Pulver (Frank Grillo) is a former special forces operative, who wakes up every day to relive the moment he was killed at the hands of a group of assassins. After thwarting their efforts to kill him in various differing ways each day, he is left to retrace the events leading up to his death, calling in on his research scientist ex Jemma (Naomi Watts), who's discovered her boss, Colonel Ventor (Mel Gibson) is up to something dodgy, and may hold the key to his present predicament.With a minimum of publicity, Boss Level, the latest film to explore the well trodden concept of time travel, arrives on Amazon. Director Joe Carnahan employs the same style he used in his previous Smokin' Aces, at least at the start, with a slick, snazzy visual style that jumps out and grabs you by the throat. The video game style 'Attempt No. ...' that spring up on the screen alluding to each effort to kill the lead character give a frivolous, throw away impression that conflicts tonally with the darker, more reflective feel the writing develops later on.Cast wise, Russo has presence as a cynical, wise-cracking action hero, with the veneer of a modern day Bruce Willis, and he's matched by Gibson, who in his later years, employs the same zaniness and intensity that used to make the action heroes he played in his younger days so cool work well in villainous roles. The plot requires a bit of sticking with, but if you give it chance to develop, it emerges as more intelligent and considered than it at first seemed, even if it sadly does allow itself to meander away and drag on at the end.It's Groundhog Day meets Kill Bill, basically, a worthwhile effort that, while maybe not quite the sum of its parts, is still a superior, above average film that is ultimately a pleasant surprise. ***",Boss Level
10,Cineanalyst,Stuck in a Deadly Time Loop,6,6 March 2021,"It's the same thing over and over again: quarantining at home watching ""Palm Springs"" (2020), watching ""The Map of Tiny Perfect Things"" (2021), heck, even ""Tenet"" (2020) in a way, rewatching or catching up on other movies such as ""Happy Death Day"" (2017), its sequel, ""Naked"" (2017) and, of course, ""Groundhog Day"" (1993). ""There is no way this winter is ever going to end as long as that groundhog keeps seeing his shadow."" Now, ""Boss Level."" At some point, even a fan of the growing time-loop genre and someone who often prefers avoiding physical interactions like me is going to become fatigued. Oh, the days of sitting in a crowded theatre of inattentive, glowing phone gazers to see the same thing over and over again but with superheroes or aliens or some such preposterous reboot, remake or sequel is but a memory. But, as for ""Boss Level,"" have you ever wondered how the time-loop movie would be if it were like an action-packed video game? If so, watch ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014). But... if you've wondered what it would be like if the video-game references were explicit, yeah, then check out ""Boss Level.""Frank Grillo's protagonist Roy compares his situation in the opening scene to a video game, repeatedly dying and continuously restarting the level. There are rather unnecessary graphics flashing on screen early on to further drive the point home and hold one's hand through the timeline. Going full video-game-inside-a-video-game, Roy plays the vintage sort to bond with his son. And he must defeat a series of contract killers and security guards before reaching the boss as played by Mel Gibson.It's a fun-enough, if mindless popcorn-fare, action flick. I'm not quite sure if Gibson's lines complaining about ""liberal"" worries over the space-time-continuum and not making swords about race is a gag on his real-world public persona and scandals, but they're throwaway jokes, anyways. As a cigar-puffing, action-flick baddie, Gibson fits the bill. MCU and Purge franchises alum Grillo is also capable in the lead. Naomi Watts is rather wasted, though, in a part that literally doesn't go much of anywhere (I can relate). Some of the bits get, er, repetitive. ""I am Guan Yin, and Guan Yin has done this,"" for instance, may be funny the first few times and, then, kind of funny again after it's repeated a ridiculous number of times, but after that it gets over done. I guess it's kind of cool, too, that a bit of Ancient Egyptian mythology is thrown in with the video-game, time-travel and apocalyptic stuff. In the end, I wouldn't mind rewatching ""Boss Level,"" but I'd also be happy not to do so.",Boss Level
11,851222,A surprisingly good movie,8,13 March 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.After i read a premise of ""Boss Level"" (2021) is decided to watch it as a guilty pleasure on a boring evening - i did not believed this movie will be any good somehow but i liked the premise on paper. What i can say after watching it, is that you don't judge a book by its cover, because ""Boss Level"" really delivers.This movie was superbly paced - at running time 1 h 38 min it never dragged and was interesting from start till finish. The story here was an interesting one and involving. Directing was very solid and basically because of good directing this movie was actually really good one. Action scenes (and there are plenty of them) were very well made.Overall, ""Boss Level"", no matter how stupid its title is and it maybe sounds on paper - was actually a very entertaining flick. Don't take it too seriously and you will be pleasantly surprised.",Boss Level
12,The-Sarkologist,Another Fun Time Loop Film,9,28 February 2021,"Yep, this is definitely a straight to streaming movie, which only landed up in the cinemas because, well, there doesn't seem to be all that much else coming out due to a bulk of the cinemas around the world being close. Like, honestly, there isn't really all that much with this film that hasn't been done before, even though it is probably a more action orientated version of Groundhog Day (and the multiple copies that all of the sudden seem to be coming out of the woodwork). Actually, it is probably a bit closer to Edge of Tomorrow, though this is more of an action movie where they fight some bad guy organisation as opposed to being a full blown war movie.Mind you, it sort of does show you how these style of films make it somewhat more interesting. For instance, the protagonist dies - a lot - which is generally something that doesn't happen in your typical film. The other thing is that you know what happens when the protagonist loses, which is another thing that you tend not to get. Oh, and the big bad guy can be put down in a couple of shots because, well, once he's made the big speech, and revealed his plans, you really don't need him any more.So, we have this special forces guy that is living the same day over and over again. This is to the point that he pretty much has a routine everytime he wakes up to make sure that he doesn't get killed. The problem is that the film starts something like 199 days into the loop, and he still always ends up getting killed. Of course, there are some subtle hints as to why this is happening, especially when he wanders through the video arcade.Mind you, it is a pretty fun movie, and for a straight to streaming film, it actually isn't all that bad. Actually, it's pretty good. In fact, Mel Gibson plays the bad guy, which is something slightly different for him (and I must say that I haven't seen him around for quite a while, but it looks like he still manages to get a few gigs). Yeah, I liked this film, and while there isn't all that much too it, it is still quite a fun film. Mind you, I don't think the time loop thing has worn off too much yet, but I'm sure it will sooner or later.",Boss Level
13,cruise01,Ridiculous action that feels like an action video game.,6,12 March 2021,"3 out of 5 stars.Boss Level is a fair science fiction action film that follows the Groundhog Day and Happy Death Day mixed with a hardcore shoot em up action film.What worked? The plot is decent. It follows Roy (Frank Grillo) who wakes up every day repeating itself with every assassin after him and lead by Mel Gibsons character. While Roy is discovering that there is more to the agenda with his former love interest Jemma (Naomi Watts) engineering some kind of new time and weapon device.The film is action packed through out. Lots of thrill ride chases. Fighting and shoot em up action that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. Does feel like a video game with a character battling through new assassins and every bad guy has a new unique challenge skill. Which the character gets killed off and learns something new to fighting them off. Yes the action can be ridiculous and cheesy. It is done by the same director Joe Carnahan who did The A Team and Smokin Aces. You know what to expect with the action.The cast ensemble was decent with there characters. Not much development to the characters. They were forgettable. Frank Grillo works great as an action star. Mel Gibson as a villain was okay. Naomi Watts. Annabelle Wallis. And Michelle Yeoh were all underwritten.What did not work? The humor and narrative structure was not as funny it was trying to be. The humor and cheesy direction. It was annoying.The script was filled with cheesy dialogue. The visual effects were obvious and terrible.Overall, Boss Level is a cheesy action film that may entertain to some but a forgettable one.",Boss Level
14,eddie_baggins,Kicks off with a bang but fizzles as time wears on,4,9 March 2021,"Originally planned for a 2019 cinematic release, scrapped to a 2020 date only to disappear off the radar entirely and saved by streaming service Hulu (cinemas here in Australia) who paid a handsome sum to release this $45 million dollar production from the Hollywood dumping ground, Joe Carnahan's time loop actioner Boss Level did well to see the light of day, even if the end result suggests we weren't missing out on much had it never made its way into our lounges.Having one of the most up and down careers behind the camera in recent history, Joe Carnahan has delivered great highs with the likes of his impressive cop thriller Narc and misunderstood classic The Grey but also plunged to fairly average depths with the likes of The A-Team, Stretch and Smokin' Aces with Boss Level sitting comfortably in the lower-tier of his filmography despite a decent start and some solid set-up work.Not doing a lot to differentiate itself from fellow time loop thrillers like Edge of Tomorrow or Deja Vu, a lot about Boss Level feels familiar and at the start it appears as though its doing its best to try something else with a dry Deadpool light humor courtesy of the sick of dying Frank Grillo as Roy Pulver but what starts out as a fun and over the top bout of high-kinetic energy very quickly gives way to a dry story of corporate meddling and a plot that starts to take itself far too seriously.Proving again that he can handle a set-piece or two, Boss Level's video game like action and carnage is initially enough to win us over and the colorful array of assassins hellbent on taking Culver out is joyously executed (dwarfs with explosions!) but once Roy tries harder to unlock the mysteries of his time loop problem and deals with his on and off again lover (played by a slumming it Naomi Watts) and Mel Gibson's bland baddie Col. Clive Ventor, Boss Level becomes more of a chore than a treat.It feels somewhat like a unloved movie, one that started out with positive intentions and dreams to be a thrilling slice of high concept indulgence but just as the studios that dumped it must have thought, that sentiment changed along the line as Carnahan's latest fizzler found itself devoid of any spark.Final Say -The time loop action/thriller has been done better before as Boss Level's video game inclined delivery gets lost in a dull plot and an increasingly po-faced exercise.2 early morning choppers out of 5",Boss Level

16,imseeg,"Ridiculous story, but fantastic, computer game like action...",7,26 May 2021,"I hesitated watching this movie, because the story was so ridiculous and I didnt much like some of the really gross bloody scenes (not suited for below 16!). But half an hour into it, I did get the hang of this violent story and started to like it more...The good: the computer game like action is fantastic and over the top, with some really gruesome scenes that made me look away though (extracting your own teeth!). But all the violence is portrayed in a lighthearted, funny way, just as in a computer game, so I could cope with the gruesome violent scenes. More good: the story (however ridiculous) does have a really nice twist to it, that is rather charming. To top it of, Mel Gibson is back in a great bad guy role, with some cool oneliners and a couple of good jokes. This is simply good old fashioned action fun, with many great looking special effects!Any bad? The leading actor looks like a B-movie hairdresser, without any charisma. But who cares, this is a computer game movie, with only macho fighting stereotypes. It's all about the fun of continuous figthing scenes with a lot of gruesome killings...The story: fight, fight, fight. A man has to relive the same day, every day of his life. And that particular day just happens to be a day in which he gets attacked by dozens of assasins! Will he ever get out of this repeating killing maze?",Boss Level
17,billcr12,A Wild Ride,7,5 March 2021,"A science fiction-comedy-adventure film, Boss Level works as a time shift story with a strong lead, Frank Grillo. Mel Gibson is perfect as the villain, and Naomi Watts is the heros love interest. The concept is somewhat absurd as Watts is a brilliant scientist working on a time machine for the evil Gibson, when she drafts her old boyfriend to stop her boss. Plot holes abound but as entertainment it still works well. Look for Rob Gronkowski as Gunner, the guy firing a machine gun from a helicopter. He has no lines, but for football fans, it is something to look for. Overall, a good way to escape for an hour and forty minutes.",Boss Level

Starts over, he does not understand how or why. Will he figure it out, and put an end to the loop.Frank Grillo brings a joy to the rough edgy moments, you see he's having a blast making this. Action scenes are well shot, sometimes on a level of a video game, even the violence seems very cartoonish. Mel Gibson does pretty well, what he is giving.

24,aidanratesmovies,Fun and Familiar- with lots of heart- Give this One a Chance,8,27 May 2021,"Although it does take its time to get into the groove of things, Boss Level proves to be a rather enjoyable, incredibly entertaining, and stupidly funny little action flick- much in style of the many 80's action blockbusters of the past. Frank Grillo fully commits to his leading role in the film, and truly provides the heart and soul of this film. He may not be perfect, but without his charisma, or heart shown on screen- the film simply wouldn't work. The action scenes throughout the film are remarkably well done, especially as we get closer to the end of the film. The plot can be a bit familiar, and some characters can be a bit on the plain side- but I feel the film truly accomplishes what it set out to do, that being, to be a fun ride. It largely combines the narrative of other familiar film trademarks, such as action films Bloodshot and John Wick and the comedy Groundhog Day. As stuffed as that may sound though, it eventually is able to find its footing and prove to be the delightful action flick it intended to be all along. It has its bumps along the way, but all in all, Boss Level is a very fun little action film that I certainly don't regret watching or enjoying.My Rating: 8.2/10.",Boss Level

28,baumer,Groundhog Day with bullets and beheadings,8,25 March 2021,"Boss level is an adrenaline rush of an action film. It's got a terrific cast, it moves at a breakneck pace and the hand-to-hand combat is the highlight of the film.Leading the charge into the this frenetic movie is one of the most charismatic actors of the last 10 years in my opinion and that would be Frank Grillo.Just recently I saw a movie called pride and Glory with Edward Norton and an almost unrecognizable Frank grillo. It came out in 2008 and I don't know what happened to Grillo after that. He completely transformed his physical appearance. He went from an actor who could be any other actor that just blends into the scenery and then metamorphosized into a man who looks like he was chiseled out of stone. And it's not just his muscle tone it's his entire ethos and attitude. Frank Grillo oozes charisma on screen. This generation probably knows him because of the Marvel universe where he played Crossbones. And if that's all you know him from you need to go out and find some of his other work. Films like The purge election year, The purge anarchy, Zero Dark thirty and then his betrayal of big Daddy in Wolf Warrior 2. Grillo is someone who I will watch in any film because of what he brings to each and every character.I only bring up this little bit of history with Frank Grillo because I read that originally the studio did not want Frank as the lead actor. Director Joe Carnahan fought for him and eventually got his way. And you can see what Carnahan sees. Grillo just brings the intensity that this character needs and he brings it to life.The film has Frank Grillo dying everyday for what seems to be eternity. Each day that he dies he gets further and further into unraveling the mystery as to why he is dying. Along the way we are treated to beheadings, bodies being blown apart, helicopters with cannons for guns, street fights, brawls, sword fights and everything else you can basically imagine. The script is sharp and funny and really META in a lot of ways as well. It also slows down from time to time to develop an estranged father and son relationship.I'm not really going to give away much more of the plot than to say that if you think you'll enjoy Frank Grillo kicking the crap out of people and in turn get in the crap kicked out of him while trying to find out why he keeps dying every day on a perpetual loop then this is definitely the film for you.8/10",Boss Level

After discovering a message left by his girlfriend Jemma Wells (Naomi Watts) that reveals the mastermind behind his assassination is her boss Colonel Ventor (Mel Gibson), Pulver turns the tables of Ventor and find out the cause of and hopefully end the time loop.A long time passion project of writer/director Joe Carnahan, the movie began development in 2012 under the title Continue at 20th Century Fox before stalling in development hell for about 6 years. The movie was eventually produced independently in 2018, but problems with distributors resulted in the film sitting on the shelf for three years thanks to various distribution deals falling through for one reason or another. In the time between its inception and eventual release, Boss Level's selling point of an ""action movie Groundhog Day"" was done multiple times (Source Code, Edge of Tomorrow/LiveDieRepeat, Predestination, etc.) diluting much of the film's novelty. As the film finally surfaces as a Hulu original, is it worth it? Mostly yes.Easily the biggest asset for Boss Level is Frank Grillo. While Grillo is known mainly for his TV roles and supporting work in the MCU Captain America movies as Crossbones, Grillo has also shown himself to be quite a capable leading man in many low to mid budget productions. In many ways Grillo's image is something of an update on the images of leading men of the 60s and 70s like Roy Scheider, Steve McQueen, or even Charles Bronson. Male leads who while not classic ""leading men"" managed to cultivate a mystique and allure based around their rugged and hard edged delivery and style that made them intimidating and commanding leads in material where the heroes operated more in areas of gray than black and white. Grillo definitely has that same appeal and it's been put to great use in both The Purge movies as well as the Netflix movie Wheelman. An issue Grillo runs into however is many of those types of movies aren't big draws for the larger studios, so he often works with smaller independent productions which as seen with The Purge, Wheelman, or even Beyond Skyline can utilize him quite well, but unfortunately the nature of that business model also leads him to co star in many Direct-to-Video ventures, notably ""co-starring"" with Bruce Willis on critically panned material like Cosmic Sin or Reprisal. Luckily Boss Level doesn't run into that issue, and despite not having the same budget as a AAA release from the bigger studios, it's a well made mid budget release that takes its presence, characters, and performances and runs with it.The movie itself is somewhat mixed. At a brisk 83 minutes (not including credits) there's not a lot of what you'd call ""depth"" to this movie. In the opening half hour the movie's very frenetic and frenzied pace is reminiscent of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor films like Crank 1 and 2 or Gamer, but while Carnahan does definitely keep the frenetic energy of those films, he wisely doesn't ape the overly shaky and unfocused camera work those films are also known for. The action sequences are beautifully choreographed with good establishment of spacial geography for gun fights, and long uncut shuts showing the smooth and graceful movements of sword fights, fistfights, hand to hand combat and while the choreography probably isn't on point with the likes of John Wick or Atomic Blonde, it's very much on the edge of those two benchmarks.The story has the same tonal issues that Carnahan has struggled with before with him trying to alternate between over the top cartoonish violence and moments of sincerity of seriousness, and while it's not as clumsy a mix as Carnahan's Smokin' Aces, there's definitely a noticeable shift in tone around the 45 minute mark where the movie dials back its over the top moments in favor of more straightforward revenge exchanges (which are well done enough and aren't overly serious). The movie also tries to play up the sincerity with a ""tug at your heartstrings"" plot of Pulver trying to reunite with his estranged girlfriend and son, and while Grillo does effectively sell the scenes and has nice moments where we see him bond with Joe (played by Grillo's real life son Rio Grillo) it's definitely a case where it feels like Frank's more thank for selling it than the script is.While Boss Level is a a very messy and frenetic film, it's made a worthwhile watch thanks to some creative action beats and a commanding performance by Frank Grillo that gives him more room to stretch than his usual fare. While it doesn't exceed the standards set by other time loop thrillers that beat it to release, it's a respectable B-Level film which uses its high concept to good effect and shows that Grillo is more than capable of taking on larger scale projects.",Boss Level

34,Movi3DO,Generic but Still Entertaining,7,8 March 2021,"A brand new sci-go thriller on Hulu. A retired special force officer got stuck in a time loop where he is killed over and over and over.The best thing about this movie was Frank Grillo and the action sequences. Grillo had a lot of charisma and was made for action. I thoroughly enjoyed his presence and how he made each action scene entertaining. He did a lot of voice over, which wasn't as cool as it could have been due to the dialogues being pretty cheesy.There was quite a bit of violence and gore, and they were entertaining for me. I don't think they were not that bad and gory, so if you don't like gore I think this wouldn't be much of a problem.The time loop genre has become pretty loaded and at this point, there aren't a lot of new ideas or tweaks. Boss Level definitely suffered from this predictability. I knew what stages Grillo's character would go through and how he would end up. They tried to spice the premise up a bit with the retro-gaming style, which worked for me. Then, the plot itself was generic, and I don't even care that much about it. Lastly, Mel Gibson was part of the movie, which got me excited. However, he didn't have much to do in the movie, which was pretty sad.Overall, despite its generic plot and premise, the dope action and charismatic performance from Frank Grillo made the movie very enjoyable. 7/10",Boss Level

36,0w0,"It's no 'Edge of Tomorrow' or 'Ready Player One', but it ain't terrible",6,16 February 2021,"This movie tries to be like 'Ready Player One' and 'Edge of Tomorrow' SO HARD and it really shows (not that that would have been a bad thing, but when you're working with a much smaller budget, it's not gonna work out well).And while we're on the subject of 'budget', I don't understand how this movie has a $45million budget... It seems more like a $20million film and NOT a $45million one. My suspicion is that they spent a good chunk of the film's budget on Mel Gibson and Grillo (which was stupid), and that's why the film's CGI and overall production quality leaves a lot to be desired and it looks like a $20mil film instead of a $45mil one.From the very first 60seconds of the film, you can already see that they wanted to make this film be exactly like 'Edge of Tomorrow' and for some reason they threw a bit of 'Ready Player One' in the mix as well. The sad truth is that this film isn't even close to 'Ready Player One' and it's LIGHTYEARS away from 'Edge of Tomorrow' (RPO got 8/10 from me and EoT got 10/10).Perhaps if this film had a different cast, it could have gotten a 7/10 or even 8/10 score instead of just a 6/10 score... but it would NEVER have had a chance to reach 9/10 or 10/10 on a $45mil budget simply because it's going up against films with such massive budgets such as the two I've mentioned above.But overall it's not a terrible film... it gets a 6/10 from me and it's totally watchable. I wouldn't watch it twice or more times simply because it's not good enough to watch more than once.",Boss Level

40,latinfineart,Really awful. Horrific dialogue.,3,28 March 2021,"I think there is no doubt that the majority of the nines and tens that have been given to this movie were written by kids between the age of 6 and 15. This is not really an adult film, unless it's an adult who loves Disneyland amusement park type films, like Transformers, Fast and the Furious, the recent Bruce Willis films and other completely inane and ridiculous movies. There was absolutely no writing in the story. Mel Gibson's dualogue was pure comic book, and it was beyond stupid.They thought that this movie was funny but I just didn't see any humor in it, just sheer monotony without a story line, without any clever dialogue or particularly interesting characters. I usually like real Frank Grillo and he did a good job with what he had to work with, but he sure didn't have much to work with.A bit of an attempt at a Nolenesque time loop, but only for kids.

43,dfle3,Boss level: What if life was like an action video game? Score: 90%,9,12 March 2021,"Getting its title from the frustratingly hard to get past sections of action video/arcade games, ""Boss level"" is more entertaining than the premise should allow and has fun with the concept, piling on the video game references. The basic plot, delivered in the style of a Deadpool film, starts off proceedings: our hero, Roy Pulver (played by Frank Grillo, who is new to me, so he doesn't stand out to me in the films which I've seen which apparently have him in it, like Minority Report , Edge Of Darkness, Zero Dark Thirty and Avengers: Endgame), a former US Special Forces member, wakes up every morning with a a conga line of suckholes (as notorious Australian Labor Party leader Mark Latham would put it) trying to kill him. And succeeding. Every day. Despite his best efforts to stay alive. In this way, the film is a twist on the romantic comedy ""Groundhog Day"" (although the reality of video game boss levels predates that earlier film). In the way that video game players constantly have their character die, requiring them to play through that section again, in order to proceed the game, there is a lot of repetition in the film. However, this doesn't work against the entertainment value of the film. Like Groundhog Day, Boss Level has a few funny moments, making me laugh out loud. Unlike Groundhog Day, Boss Level has a lot of violence. I'll return to that point later.What makes Boss Level a superior take on this concept is that the mystery of this phenomenon drives the story forward. Like Roy, we want to find out what on Earth is happening to make this bizarre reality. I'm not sure if it took me shorter or longer than average to have the gist of the answer to this mystery. There is a science fictiony explanation but, unlike last year's film ""Tenet"", it makes no pretence of being based on any sort of science or science speculation. And it's all the better for it. If you like your sci-fi serious, this film is probably not for you.Returning to the topic of violence, there is a lot of graphic violence. Whether intentionally or not, the horrific nature of some of the violence didn't disturb me. In other hands, some of the violence would have been painful to watch. If you feel sympathy pain watching violence inflicted on people, this could be an uncomfortable 100 minutes to sit through. I had a really bad reaction to the implied violence in the flim ""Law abiding citizen"" and gave it a low score in my review of it here. Other films with ultra violence I've enjoyed immensely, like ""Watchmen"" and ""Kick-Ass"". Fortunately the violence in Boss Level is of a comic-book variety, not traumatising to watch.Another aspect of the superior storytelling of this film is how new information is drip-fed to both Roy and the audience. It's these narrative additions which make the film richer to watch. Weak genre films lack these tricks. When I watched the horror movie ""The exorcist"" years later, I appreciated its attention to realism, which weak genre pictures eschew in favour of just getting to the next kill scene or what have you.Returning to the topic of Groundhog Day, there was one striking scene in that, where Bill Murray's character tries to recreate a wonderful moment with Andie MacDowell's character. There is overlap as well as divergence between the two films as far as how these repetitions play out or evolve.Naomi Watts doesn't exactly have a thankless role as Roy's ex.Another (more or less) Australian actor with a major role is Mel Gibson.I didn't mind the ending of the film. Maybe I should have been looking closely at Roy's eyes?Random observations:* I chanced upon a mention of this film somewhere and after looking at its Wikipedia entry for the reception to it, I took a chance on it after finding the premise interesting.* Frank Grillo looks to have spent a LOT of time in the gym! Maybe he has looked like that since his work in the Marvel films?* There is a dedication to Ros Grillo for the closing credits. I'm not sure who she is. Rio Grillo, I read, is Frank's son in real life, not just this film!* Towards the end of the film, I had the feeling that Roy was being played by the man playing Roy #2 for some reason!* I really enjoyed hearing a little bit of the terrific track ""South American getaway"" (from the film ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"") in this...almost as much as I loved hearing ""Joy"" by Apollo 100 from the film ""Boogie nights"".* Looking at my reviews on this site, I'm reminded of ""Edge of tomorrow"" which I'd forgotten about but maybe has a similar premise to this film. Another sci-fi film whose specifics escape me but which I scored very highly (10/10) was Source Code.",Boss Level

Dialogues, execution, sentimental value,characters and action scenes. There is nothing I hated, and more importantly, nothing I would never change my opinion on this film I will always love this movie this film is for die hard action fans. I have seen Frank Grillo in a few movies he seems like a bit of a B-Grade Action Movie Guy - boy was I wrong. My opinion never changes and I am happier for films that way. greatly such that you should greatly see other great films and show he is in like Purge 2&3 Kingdom TV series, Demonic, Wheelman, Point Blank and now with this film great film it's one of greatest films he ever did in his career in my opinion he delivered an outstanding performance. Grillo character is a blasé deadpan attitude was very funny - after all he is a guy who was just over it, starting each day, dying, rinse and repeat, that's main character our lead guy I love characters like that I highly recommded this movie with him in it he also worked in Mel Gibson in other film called Edge of Darkness 10 years ago now with this movie it's sold flick with them 2 in film, and now with Mel Gibson he is barley in film he is in it he does what the does as in acting he does great job in this film I got pissed off with Dragged Across Concrete, Force of Nature, Fatman sucked as hell now with this movie is brilliant he play's villain was very good, a typical Action Move Antagonist - some of the other quite unique characters maybe be somewhat clichéd, but still very funny. but don't expect Oscars please don't expect what critics say because they are full of crap big
freaking time they don't help me at all that's all I can say. don't expect this to 100% in rotten tomatoes and plus this film in box office made over $349,449 in box office very good this must be in top success films in 2021 look I am reviewer but at least I tell truth about this movie is great if you love action films, non stop, fast pacing, tons of laugh's, this is most fun experience to see it at movie theater it's fun experience if you miss out you will regret it big time I am a reviewer, and a reviewer had done this who really loved film go and see it or else you will regret it big time you will say to yourself man I wish I saw this in theater well get your ass up and go see this movie... if you hate actions and then theirs something very wrong with you....",Boss Level

Comedically and unapologetically violent with some outrageously entertaining set pieces.A retired Special Forces officer is trapped in a never-ending time loop on the day of his death. He wakes up every morning with a horde of assassins hellbent on taking him out. Each time he awakes he becomes that little bit more proficient at surviving through the day.This premise has been done before.'Edge Of Tomorrow' with Tom Cruise immediately springing to mind.'Boss Level' carves out its own identity by being very funny, relying on a witty script and excellent delivery by Frank Grillo and the legendary Mel Gibson.

Sadly no Atmos but the 5.1 mix on offer is strong. Surround sound effects are very immersive but it is LFE where this movie shines. Explosions are cartoonishly loud. Bass gets so low that if you don't have adequate subwoofers you may pop them due to how deep the bass gets in this movie. Low frequency effects are over exaggerated to compliment the onscreen mayhem.'Boss Level' is a treat for Home Theatre enthusiasts with the witty dialogue delivered crisp and clear.Final thoughts'Boss Level' is an absolute surprise and a clear demonstration of Frank Grillo's potential star power.

They were both in The Grey, which was directed by Joe Carnahan, who, of course, made this...I like inside jokes and that was a good one.The science behind what's causing the Groundhog Day situation is mostly nonsense gobbledygook and to fret if it makes actual ""science"" sense is to miss the point entirely. This isn't a strong Sci-Fi film, but it IS a strong action film that is clever and moves along at a quick clip...each day Grillo learning a few more clues in order to solve his predicament.It'll be interesting to see what Carnahan's remake of 2011's The Raid, will look like.

58,jamesjustice-92,Foreplay / Long time,9,17 March 2021,"Getting into this movie head on I immediately felt the resemblance to Doug Liman's Edge of tomorrow and by the end of it I noticed it had actually more borrowings from Harold Ramis' Groundhog day, with a far more stress on comedic and dramatic altogether, and not on action per se (although there was plenty of that too). Acting here was absolutely splendid: Frank Grillo wasn't just an unstoppable killing machine but did play a lot with his emotion muscles as well; Mel Gibson is one of my very favorite actors not without a reason - he hadn't got as much time as I would have desired for him but he squeezed the best out of every scene he was in and every line he delivered; the one I was especially surprised to see was Will Sasso - his character was so distant from his usual comedic roles and it was great to watch him play against type. Overall the movie plays off of its premise pretty well: the idea of having to re-live the same day isn't new and the scientifics of this phenomenon weren't clear enough to grasp from the first watch but well-paced action, well-suited narration, well-fitting soundtrack, fine visuals, a few good jokes and a nice afterthought of cherishing your family despite all odds, re-evaluation of everything you've known and willingness to become the best possible version of yourself earns this gem of a movie a re-watch for sure.",Boss Level

63,ivko,better than I thought it would be,7,4 September 2021,"I won't reveal much in this review that you couldn't get from the movies overview description (meaning I don't consider this review to have spoilers), but I will mention some details of the high level plot structure that could allow you to guess events in the film, so if you are particularly spoiler adverse you may want to stop reading.This movie starts as a typical action film, kind of a poor mans Edge of Tomorrow, with some unknown force causing the protagonist to relive his day over and over until he dies. As per the usual recipe, he tries a number of strategies to deal with his imprisonment like giving in to despair, drowning in booze, killing the bad guys with extreme finesse, etc. It's fun, but nothing the audience hasn't seen many times before.In the second half of the film the protagonist starts focusing on unraveling the mystery and spending time with his family. The more time he spends, the more he realizes how much his lifestyle has cost him precious moments that he can never truly get back, causing him to grow as a human being. Again, it probably isn't anything the audience hasn't seen before, but for me this is where I started really enjoying the film.The movie reaches its conclusion after the protagonist solves the mystery and has a moment of personal growth, but must still clear one last hurdle to achieve his happily ever after ending. The fact that the movie doesn't show the audience what happens past a certain point is simply to underscore that it ultimately doesn't matter. The important event was his personal growth; whether he succeeds or fails on the final hurdle is not as important as his realization of what is important in life, which is kind of a nice ending.I enjoyed the movie; for a low budget action comedy I thought it had some good heart. That said, the movie is full of one-note characters who never grow or change, only the main character experiences any kind of growth or interesting development, with some antagonists so cookie cutter that the main character notes that their monologues don't change no matter the circumstances. But I think sometimes there's only so much you can ask from a film like this, so it didn't bother me overly much. Would I watch this several times? No, but I think you could enjoy it as a fun diversion for a couple of hours.",Boss Level

And though I'm sure some of this bundle was spent on the action scenes, I have to conclude that the production company wasted its money on them.

""Boss Level"" isn't one of this record number of possible entries, but who gives a damn?
This movie about a retired special forces officer caught in his own ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Happy Death Day"" scenario is so much fun with its gratuitous cartoon violence and hilarious one liners you won't care if it wins awards so long as you had a fun night out at the movies.
The concept is not new...in fact this movies script has been in circulation nearly as long as some of the arcade games it mimics, but it finally got green lit and I'm so glad it did.
In essence, what we have is yet another time loop, end of the world, dying repeatedly movie, but it works.
Officially it's an Action, Mystery, Sci-Fi flick and its been available state side since 2020 through VOD Hulu and finally we are seeing it on Australian Big Screens.
Personally no home theatre is going to do this movie as much justice as XD.
Frank Grillo is in amazing shape for a 55 year old man (he's body shaming the rest of us middle aged guys) and normally is seen in B-Grade action/cop movies, however in ""Boss Level"" he ramps up his on screen performance as former Delta Force Captain, Roy, up against a virtual army of villains.
Roy is a regular Duke Nukem 3D!
Video Gamers are going to lose their stuff watching the on screen game play, stunts, special effects and cool soundtrack.
It feels like you are in the game and suffer every death his character endures, before resetting to start and go through it all again for the umpteenth time.
Each time he learns more about the big picture and his part in it no matter how painful.
Aussie Watchers: Both Mel Gibson and Naomi Watts get a guernsey.
Mel fresh after playing Santa Claus in ""Fat Man"" is the Big Boss, Colonel Clive Ventor, while Naomi has two movies out now.
As Roys ex, Jemma Wells"" she tries her best to be a nuclear physicist.
Thankfully one of the most annoying actors in Hollywood, Ken Yeong, only has a small part, but we all knew that after seeing him bare all in ""The Hangover"" franchise.
Fun Fact: Listen out for an inside joke in the script about movie 'tough guy' Liam Neeson. (Both this movies Director, Joe Carnahan, and Frank have worked with the big Irishman before)
""Boss Level"" tag line is ""Gone Today, Here Tomorrow"", and I have a feeling this movie will gain cult status from all the game boys and girls who love to go old school 80's style.

91,MovieWarfare,"High energy, chaotic fun with some pacing issues",7,2 May 2021,"I am a sucker for these Time loop movies. So when I heard there was an R rated action time loop movie, I was already sold. The premise is simple ""A retired military operative finds himself in a never-ending time loop on the day of his death"". So is this a fun entry in the genre or a loop you're going to forget?Firstly, I like the premise and idea behind it. Revenge stories aren't rare and stories, where the main character is hunted by assassins, isn't rare either. A time loop story containing both of these is relatively unique though and it makes you wonder why it wasn't done earlier. I also really like the video game motif of Boss Level (2021). Throughout, the movie it is frame like a video game with attempt numbers and him trying to memorize all the timings. It makes it quite fun as we go along with him as he learns more in each attempt. Although, the story isn't told linearly as when it begins he is already on over 100 attempts. There will be a lot of scenes referring to previous attempts before going back to the present attempt but this is never jarring in any way and is handled fine.Due to the R rating, we get some great violent scenes such as seeing our main character, Roy Pulver played magnificently by Frank Grillo, get decapitated or shot multiple times or even blown up. There are very fun deaths in Boss Level. There are also some high energy and cartoony action sequences from a pretty ridiculous car chase, shoot-outs and even a sword fight that are an absolute blast to watch. I also really enjoyed the dark humour such as our main lead getting annoyed with certain ways of dying since it takes too long. While there is a lot of chaotic fun throughout, there is also some heart in the story. Roy Pulver does get a character arc and there are some sweet moments between Roy and his family. The writer and director utilized the time loop idea effectively for a key part of the story and funny moments.However, for a movie that is only 100 minutes, it is baffling that there are so many parts where the pacing slows to a downhill. After an amazing 10 minute intro, it then decides to do the entire flashback right after and it lasts WAY too long. Every scene concerning Jemma Wells (Naomi Watts), Roy's wife, is just very boring to watch and this isn't down to Naomi's performance or anything. It's because the scene is meant to give one important info but is dragged by meaningless dialogue that is just padding the run time. Another example is a monologue from the villain Clive Ventor (Mel Gibson) about some snake just to amount to ""don't bring visitors Jemma okay?"". Going from high energy action scenes to these slow-paced talking scenes brings the movie to a standstill, especially if the talking scenes don't have enough significant or emotional impact. Unfortunately, the pacing doesn't just drop at the beginning but also drops at the ending which goes on for a bit too long as well.I'm also disappointed in how Mel Gibson and Michelle Yeoh are used in the movie. They are both amazing actors but are just not in the movie a lot. Mel Gibson plays the main villain but we don't see him do much apart from just monologuing for a long time. Michelle Yeoh is on the poster which seems to signify an important character but she is nothing more than a 1-minute cameo. I wish there was more conflict between the main character and the main villain but they won't interact that much. Some dialogue isn't that great eitherOverall, I had a lot of fun with Boss Level (2021). It doesn't blow you away in the action department or do something never seen before.

96,PerryAtTheMovies,Not worth paying to see....,5,28 March 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
This review is strictly based on the movie and not compared to the video game.This is a lesser quality time loop movie. It doesn't standout very well compared to other time loop movies such as ""Edge of Tomorrow"", ""Palm Springs"", ""Happy Death Day 2 U"", or even ""Groundhog Day"".It lacks, what I would have expected to have lots of, action. For me it feels like they said, ""Ok, we'll do each scene up to 100x. Once everyone gets tired and bored of filming we'll use those scenes because then it feel like a worn down movie."" Let's say they used those worn down scenes. You can already tell as soon as the movie starts the action isn't going to be good, the voice over dialogue gets boring real quick, and you have no feelings for the outcome of the characters.I understand it's a time loop movie and that the point is to live a certain period of time over and over and over again. In this film, however, it legit feels like you're living the same period over and over and over again, and not in a good way. I felt it took too long to get to the point of ""ok something new is happening, I should pay attention"". By the time this something new happened. I was no longer interested. So speaking of taking too long to get to the point. When the end of the movie finally arrived. All I could think was, ""What the heck was that!? That's it?"" The film is an hour and a half and it finishes like that. Very disappointing from my point of view and made the whole movie a waste of time. If they do make another film it could only get better because the bar is set so low.Overall:
Honestly, not worth paying to watch this movie. If it comes out on a streaming service and you want to watch it, go for it, otherwise save your money. Too much voiceover dialogue, not enough actual action with the enemies, and it lacked true connection to care for the characters outcome. Oh yeah, and for a one and a half hour film, it really seemed to drag.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'Only on a streaming service'.Enjoy the show!",Boss Level

98,terrencepatrix,"Very good ""Groundhog Day"" action flick",6,10 December 2020,"This movie was pure popcorn flick fun and Frank Grillo totally carried this movie. The same repeating day themes are here but to spin it as an action movie and have it work is a bit of a feat. There are really awesome high quality action sequences in this movie, great narrative from Frank Grillo's character throughout the movie that don't become annoying, and the story actually has some levels of complexity that keep you guessing about the plot.The plot is basically a man that wakes up every morning on the verge of being murdered and he has no idea why. He's spent over 100 days trying to figure out why to little success, sometimes he survives the first several assassination attempts but always ends up murdered several hours later. Until a breakthrough happens and the plot is able to progress, which it does, and it does actually explain why the days are repeating so there is closure here.Frank Grillo, who I love as an actor who is typically found in B-flicks, carries the hell out of this movie. It's probably his best performance of his career. The special effects are effective, this doesn't feel like a cheap movie at all. You can tell the rest of the cast showed up for a day or two to shoot their scenes, which is part of why I lowered my score, the movie is entirely carried by Frank Grillo. Which is not a bad thing, I just realize that people will be pulled to this movie from names like Mel Gibson, Michelle Yeoh, Naomi Watts, and Ken Jeong...and they're definitely in this movie, just not in much of it.I rate it a 6 only because out of ALL action movies it's not going to break the mold, but it is very watchable and enjoyable and I highly recommend it.

The supporting cast was fun to watch and there were plenty of ""Deadpool-style"" scenes. BUT the writing had plenty of holes in it and the editing, though at times good, DID get pretty repetitious and leave some continuity holes in it.It was poised to appeal to both the ""Sci-Fi"" (Quantum time jump) crowd and the Gaming crowd, but even though there were plenty of gaming-type scenes and lines, there was no real foundation built. As far as the time-jumping crowd (ala Ground Hog Day, etc.), it missed that boat too!It dragged on until the last 15 minutes then it felt like everyone was just tired of making the movie and said ""okay.. time to put an end to it"".Without giving it away, I can say.. do NOT expect an ending (and you'll be more satisfied wasting your time watching this).Bummer.. because this COULD have been far, FAR better! The premise was good (though certainly NOT original), and the ability to cut comedy and adventure were there.. but it was sloppy in writing and editing. There were things that were meant to somehow mean something (look for this in the video arcade), BUT zero explanation (apparently editing room floor material).On the positive side, most visual effects were good, though ""explosions"" were very ""video game'ish"". Think of Kingsman (2014) head explosions when it comes to realism and believability (none).

And the more information we're given as to his role in the whole process.Mel Gibson plays the evil puppet master with a sense of pride and wonder, while Naomi Watts does a good job of scientific know-how, meanwhile the humour is provided by Ken Jeong's barkeep, and Sasso's henchman (he's one of the new Stooges!).At times corny, predictable and repetitive, it also has moments of awe, heart and great action scenes that make up for its blunders! If you want to escape for a bit, this film could be played on loop and wouldn't hurt you...that much!!",Boss Level

Not perfect but ok to live with flaws? Thats ur theory? Hopefully the director would treat every bad review seriously.I heard so many praises before watching this film, so I was a bit disappointed, to be honest when Mel Gibson talks about snake and pig for 5 mins (I am serious), it could never be entertianing, I guess the movie is too short in time, so the director had no choice but to put a lot of meaningless talking scenes in between to make it over 90mins.",Boss Level

It has its cool ""John wick"" action moments, but for the most part, it's really repetitive.

It's worth a quick watch, and that's it.
The lead actor works out, but not on his acting skills. Mel Gibson makes you realise why he doesn't get any movies these days.
And most importantly, the movie drags every now and then, and gets boring and repeatative... That's the biggest mistake of the director.

A ""Time-Loop"" movie genre (So far I've seen 4 of these genre in the past year). But by far this is the most violent - in the nicest way of being a good action movie.The movie isn't perfect, but it held our attention during it. Unlike other movies that you simply wanted to see finish ASAP, this movie kept us seated and glued to the screen. Acting was good, the pace on par - no unnecessary deep and meaning dialogue that doesn't contribute to the narrative. It is actually well shot and edited. I liked it.SUMMRY: Think of this movie as an action packed, R18+ rated Groundhog Day. If you haven't seen Groundhog Day, shame on you. I recommend you go and see it now.VERDICT: Worth a watch.

Well developed characters you come to care about, excellent pacing, great action scenes, humor that lands and a generally well written story that condenses a lot of enjoyment into its run time.The cast alone has the chops to carry this movie; but they make the most of a fun opportunity to make a great action film with some genuine heart to it.Like many people who reviewed this film, I fail to see where the lower rating has come from, unless it is film studies students who are incapable of enjoying anything that doesn't have subtitles and is filmed in B&W...action films are not the three colours trilogy...you can enjoy more than one genre guys!!!Grillo is underrated generally and puts in performances that don't get the credit they deserve; this film is no exception.Mel Gibson might not be the force he once was but dammit if he doesn't put in a great turn as a maniacal villain!Even the kid is acts well and feels like a normal kid rather than some annoying creation that you spend most of the film wanting to slap!With so many ""attempts"" to choose from this film does excellently in picking the best parts from the best ones, so you're not watching the same scene time and again.And there is some genuine emotional pay off to boot.

Since then, good action movies ... really good action movies ... have been few and far between. Recently, with the rise of the PC culture, it seems like Hollywood no longer has the stomach for doing what it takes to make a really good action flick, probably afraid that they might offend someone.So it was a pleasant surprise to watch Boss Level, which turned out to be one of the best, possibly the best, action movie since 2000. It has all the ingredients. A clever storyline that grabs you immediately, a great protagonist played brilliantly by Frank Grillo, and hot action scenes that just keep on coming, yet never get tiresome as those in say, The Transformers got tiresome after the first 30 minutes.As mentioned, Frank Grillo is born to play the hero in an action movie. His narration is spot on, and his character has that self-abasing sense of humor that we've seen in other great of the genre, like Bruce, Arnold and Harrison. Mel Gibson is menacing as the villain, Will Sasso gives as solid performance as the henchman, and Naomi Watts is not only a wonderful actress, but is also very wonderful to look at on screen. Rio Grillo, Frank's actual son in real life, was a complete surprise as one of the better child actors that I have seen in quite a while.If you love action movies, definitely give this one a look, you won't be disappointed!",Boss Level

The movie is just a continous line of action combined with several moments of comedy and sometimes even combined with emotional moments. The way the story is told is enjoyable and it doesn't make you to get lost in details.The acting is alright, but I feel that it should have been worked a little more at the special effects. The ending is not really dissapointing, but I would have prefered to have a clear answer to the question ""does Roy die?"". Anyway, maybe it is something I've missed, maybe in the movie is a clue that could tell me if he is going to die or not. Probably the production team wanted this to be a mistery and leave place to assumptions.Anyway, the movie is not bad, but not great either.

158,Shadowboy_25cm,"Hilarious, cartoonish action mayhem",8,11 August 2021,"The first movie I saw by director Joe Carnahan was ""Narc"" (2002) with Ray Liotta and Jason Patric. A tough cop thriller from a promissing director.The years went by and Carnahan did some solid action flicks like ""Smokin' Aces"" (2006) and ""The A-Team"" (2010), a really good action adventure ""The Grey"" (2011) with Liam Neeson and he did some tv episodes for ""The Blacklist"" and ""State of Afairs"".Now (2021), Joe Carnahan is back on the big screen and presents one of his and Frank Grillos long years project. Finally.And the result is a blast of an action movie:
Frank Grillo is charismatic as ever and it's his role. Naomi Watts is the love interest and Mel Gibson as the antagonist plays an opportunistic bad guy. Nice, classic premisse, the execution is very fresh and modern.For my taste a little bit too much CGI that gives the movie a cartoonish look and takes away the drama behind Roys' (Frank Grillo) character and motivation.But, who wants too much drama in an action flick. Drama is just the second player here, it's about coolness, action and entertaining the audience with a fast-paced, high octane, violent and very dark humerous tale of a man who wants to save his life and finally has to save much much more than this.Fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride.Highly recommended.",Boss Level

160,Jim_Screechy,Very Good action flick,8,10 December 2020,"I going to come clean and say I flat out loved this film. It has a great cast, script, action, direction and of course special effects. Equally important, the choreography in the fight scenes is excellent. I never thought I was being hoodwinked or short changed by careful cutting, rapid shot changes or careful camera placement.Although it has a pretty good if somewhat simplistic storyline, it has been adapted very imaginatively with what is actually quite a lot of forethought planning and development. I felt a little cheated with the ending but on retrospect, I couldn't really have asked for too much more... maybe they're doing a Boss Level II.Normally I expect Frank Grillo to be either a second tier good guy, when the likes of some A-lister is unavailable or possibly out of budget, or a first rate bad guy, a role he tends to somewhat excel in. Here he's the star attraction and with Naomi Watts and Mell Gibson bringing up the rear and it's a good combination.Grillo is sharp, witty, romantic and... well, displays a range as an actor that we rarely see him portray, and he does a great job. As an action actor there are few who can walk in his shoes, both physically and with his on screen presence, let's face it, he gets a lot of work in this area for a good reason, but I wasn't expecting him to be a lead in a role that really demands a lot more of his acting ability, and quite frankly, I'm pleasantly surprised. Not that I'm saying he couldn't act before, just that, well... I've not seen him in many parts where he's had much more to do than be/look hard, and or beat people up.Gibson is Gibson at this stage of his career, gritty, unhinged and accomplished.Watts is never truly convincing as a scientist/doctor/researcher. The rather alluring slinky dress that functions as a lab coat or some other type of boffin garb was ill thought out, but she nevertheless manages to deliver a competent performance whilst adding a sultry appeal that doesn't go unmissed... perhaps the dress isn't such a bad idea after all.The minor cast is for the most part an accomplished line up of add-ins who do a pretty good job in filling in the necessary spaces for villain-hood, goonish ineptitude and thuggery. Some are quite enthralling and I loved the way that a multitude of baddies are employed for skulduggery, even if it is (given the protagonist and his lack of superpowers) somewhat excessive. Whilst Michelle yeo is largely unused, she nevertheless gives the story some credibility.Anyway, I won't give away any details on the plot but it is a good film with a pretty solid delivery all round. I'm not going to nit-pick on the fine points of the story or temporal mechanics of the notions therein, and even though I do like the fact they didn't try and explain away some aspect of science, I didn't so much like that a fair amount of meat was left off the bones of the science aspect of the film... not that it mattered much since it wasn't really the focal point of the film... well, not really.Anyway, go see it. Solid 7.5 out of 10 for me but I'll give it an 8 since it was an unexpected pleasure to watch.",Boss Level

And I have to get killed, over, and over again, until I can save her "" .
______________________________________________________
Right, So, ...Hypothetically... If you had queried me, about halfway through this picture, from one of the two "" Pandemically-Correct 😉 ✅ "" do-not-sit cinema seats beside me, as to how I thought this thoroughly 'relentless' movie's narrative arc might progress, or even culminate, I wouldn't have been able to answer correctly, 'to save my life'. And when it comes to movies & me .....that is -Most- definitely a "" Very, Very, Very Good "" Thing. Why❔because I'm an -Absolute- Stickler❗for films that ~{ End }~ up, when all is said & done, being, shall we say, ~{ "" Wonderfully "" }~ Unpredictable -DESPITE- the marked presence, within said film, of a seemingly obvious predilection towards a predetermined outcome .
However, even -{ Having }- said that... In Truth ...it took -A Good While- for the film to -Actually- start to grow on me. Let me 'Attempt' to describe whatever it was that ~{ Genuinely }~ surprised me in the case of -THIS- particular 'High Octane Big Action Blockbuster' flick , ( as follows ) . Well, so..... 👉{ On-The-One-Hand }👈, the ~{ Fact }~ is, that this film felt : -Not Only- a little annoying & 'repetitive, as well as "" straight up gruesome to the point of being almost outright "" Macabre "" ; but -Also- rather 'Crass', Stereotypical, & chock full of standard, 'Run-of-the-mill' popcorn-flick clichés .....{ for what seemed like the ( -Entire- ) first quarter of its 01:45:00 run time }. Not to mention the decidedly ""Glaring"" fact that a movie utterly ~{ REPLETE }~ with all manner of Gaming-References ( including a few rather sweetly-Nostalgic 'Analog Type' ones ), is in effect... ~{ "" Phenomenally "" }~ ...inappropriate ⛔ for children of -Any- age, on account of the gore & language in the film, -Alone- ( ...& that's a bit tragic, really, come to think of it... ) .
But 👉{ On-The-Other-Hand }👈 though, when some loose ends ""Very Gradually"" start to be squared away & a few critical backstories begin to come to light ; ~{ EVEN }~ leading man Frank Grillo's potentially irksome, somewhat nasal, 'N.Y.C-By-Way-Of-Calabria', ( & profanity -""Saturated""- ), drawl... thankfully ...does -Not- stand in the way of bringing that real ""Thrill-Factor"" ( 👏 💥 ) into the house, & with ""Full Effect"", at that. So, in retrospect, I'm going to attribute this to the delightful ability of Director Joe Carnahan -( 2010's 'The A-Team' Remake )- to interweave 'A Little Heart And Soul' into his films, ~{ Irrespective }~ of how Chaotic, Irreverent & indeed, even outright "" FRENETIC "" the unfolding action in the picture might prove to be. An often subtle... yet ultimately "" Tremendous "" ...Performance from the ""ever-Resplendent💎"" Naomi Watts ( 'Jemma Wells' - Roy's ex-wife in the story ) is a huge & 'obvious' Boost to the entire paradigm ; while the -Biological- son that she & Roy Pulver share in the film, 'Joe Wells' ...{ get this : played by none other than Frank Grillo's ~{ Real Life 👦❗}~ child Rio }... brings a "" Vividly Radiant "" Cuteness & Innocence to the fray, -Significantly- lightening up what would otherwise ~{ Just }~ be fairly crude, bloody & -( Unquestionably )- less appealing cinematic fare .
Summary : Once you get over the slightly, err... ~{ Tedious }~ ...& remarkably violent flashback ""Inundated"" buildup to the -Actual- ""Real-Time"" narrative ( or as 'close-to-that' as is realistically possible, given the, um... 'Edge Of Tomorrow meets Groundhog Day' aspect of the film ) ; this ~{ Is }~ an ' Unabashed , & Refreshingly small-talk and B.S-Free { 👏 ✅ } ' ..... "" In-Your-Face "" sort of a film ..... & -Yes- it's most definitely laced with its fair share of some really ~{ "" Darkly "" }~ Funny Moments, as well.

I can't.To me, it was like watching one of my favorite movies, only instead of the hero surviving the bad guy does. That's not the ending of this, but the ending completely sucks, so having your hero fail would kind of suck, right?Can someone tell me how this flick rates such high grades when the script, director, and editors take you up, prep you for awesomeness, then.........roll credits.There, I said it and although I've never given a spoiler alert in the past, there's literally no way for me to finish this review.

172,Grismar,Not bad but...,7,26 October 2021,"It's certainly not bad and if you've never seen Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow or recent action / revenge movies, you'll be very entertained.It's well done and it looks good in most places. The story unfolds at a decent tempo, but the main issue is that it doesn't really add all that much. It does the same thing that's been done before in a bunch of movies and even though it does it well, it fails to add something, which makes you wonder if you should watch it if you've seen any of the material it's based on.Another issue is that the world feels very much like it has computer game logic. For a large part of the movie I felt the main character was stuck in a computer game. The styling of the titles certainly works hard to make you believe that. But if this really is a game, it's a very unsatisfying one and you're better off watching Free Guy.It seems however that it isn't, in spite of its zany assassins, game references and generic plot, which makes me miss the ending I was hoping for - that would put it all into context and make this a good movie instead of just an OK & fun one.",Boss Level
173,itakethesquare,Funny and fun!,7,1 September 2021,"I know many filmmakers and they say they have to force social commentary especially left-wing at least for a few seconds in a film so luckily they made it the most obvious one. It's still cringe because it's in everything you see in every movie nowadays but it's more of it being too obvious of a ""yes"" than it is ""oh these group of people blah blah blah"". It's only at the last 10 minutes of the film too. I wouldn't speak about it if it wasn't positive and it's a positive. I'm tired of pooping on bad cinema which is why I suggest rejecting modernism and enjoying very old movies and television.Mel Gibson is in it and still does great. This is on par with ""Fat Man"" and ""Nobody"" which dodges all of that pandering and made a fun movie that you SHOULD at least watch once and maybe add to your collection. It's a blast.If you like Groundhog Day, Edge of Tommorow, and Happy Death Day (the first one) you'll enjoy this. It's very 90's.I'm happy the main actor who is usually type-casted as a Schwarzenegger/Stallone type only malicious playing a wholesome fun loving dude that should have replaced Rick in the Walking Dead is getting some spotlight.

I was expecting a B maybe even a C level movie but boy was I wrong! BooM... John Wick meets Groundhog Day!The movie starts off with a an assassin trying to kill Frank Grillo's character Roy Pulver and never lets up on the action. When it does ease up you have some quirky comedy met with some touching father & son moments. Very interesting that Franks Grillo's real son played his on screen son Joe, this explains their natural chemistry. Some of my favorite moments are of the swords-woman Guan Yin and every time she kills Frank Grillo says, ""This is Guan Yin and Guan Yin has done this!"" So it's hilarious and satisfying when Frank Grillo's character Roy kills Guan Yin and says, ""This is Roy and Roy has done this!"" Such brilliance.I never really appreciated a Frank Grillo until now. I remember watching a Purge movie with him but nothing super memorable came from it, but this movie really showcases his talents in the most superb way. I think the guy is in his 50's and he's rocking a perfect in shape body and looks healthier than most 20 year olds. I'm left with wanting more of this awesome action star.Oh yeah and the movie also showcases some heavy hitters like Mel Gibson and Naomi Watts who do a great job as well.

With a ""Groundhog Day"" style movie that isn't very easy to do as each day is a repetition. Yet this makes it eventful, fun and completely a fluid ride that logically tracks (except for the science).While much of the movie has some over the top moments, the whole thing comes as a plausible when reliving a moment over and over. As well as it just was supposed to have that cheesiness that was more of a flavoring to the movie and it's hero. It makes sense as there is an element to the entire movie of campiness and cheese. Yet they are able to balance it and make it work so it's so much more fun.The special effects could've used a bit more polish but overall it's not the CGI, it's not just the acting of Grillo (superb btw) or any one actor, it isn't the story, or the directing/cinematography, it wasn't the soundtrack, or overall sound quality, it was the combination of a variety of professionals that came together to make this a ride that is truly at Boss Level.",Boss Level

People that compare this to the best of action movies need to take a closer look. The humor falls short and is very repetitive. The narration is terrible, and the guy talks likes he has relived the same day thousands of times, we pick up at only 140. If the guy missed the truck 22 times, how many times did he die elsewhere? Well a dozen times in this second and that and... FFS show and don't tell. If you are going to tell, you better back it up and follow your own continuity.At this point you are probably wondering, ""so what, probably some good action right?"" Unfortunately its pretty mediocre. Most 'action' scenes are close up shots of people staring at each other before a sudden movement and someone dies, or an explosion with some half assed CGI that is outdone by movies from the early 2000s.If you are wondering ""WHY IS THIS SO UNDERRATED?!?!?""

Just like in Edge of Tomorrow, the hero remembers the events of the previous time loop iterations, learns, adapts, and progresses the story forward. But, unlike Edge of Tomorrow, it's not set in the far future, pitted against aliens, but set in the modern time with a megalomaniac (a la Mel Gibson's character) wanting the ability to change the past.What sets this movie apart is it has has very little science fiction, but focuses more on action, drama, and plenty of comedy. Especially with the scenes with the attractive Selina Lo. Those are quite entertaining and funny. The story is quite simple, direct, with no mystery at all. But it is entertaining, will not drag, nor bore you. The movie keeps itself simple and that's what I liked about it.A side note, not sure why Michelle Yeoh is billed, as she has only one main scene which lasts a couple of minutes, and two minor appearances that last a few seconds.

Besides Wahlberg being in it. Boss Level seems to be similar case. Except Frank Grillo actually fits in the role and is great at what he does. Unfortunately most everything else falls flat. The action is cheap (at times with bad B-movie level CG) and uninspiring, The pacing is all over the place. The overly long and pointless conversations give little value and try too hard to come across smart. And fail. Everything is so simple and comes easily to the MC (plot armor wise). Constant V. O. exposition is inane and unnecessary. One would think they'd even do some basic research what can be considered as e-sports or classic 80's computer games. Brr. Go watch Nobody instead.

Watching someone say the F-word over and over isn't cool & isn't entertaining. If you love shooting and action this film is let down by long periods of attempted witty chatting and chatting about 'how I abandoned my son but I really love him.' If you love witty mind-bending action thrillers, this film is let down by too much ""uhhh...duhhh...whaat um am ah sposed ta do now, duhhh? Oh yaa, an hour lata I figured out I shud do whut ma ex-waaf tols me tuh doo, errr (drool)."" This is far from Inception, Edge Of Tomorrow, Minority Report, Deja Vu, etc. The title shows some link to video games, as do the section titles and the games arcade, but the film itself has little to do with gaming or boss level fights.The guy learned how to be a swordmaster in 50 days. From a swordmaster (Yeoh) who happened to be sitting in a bar waiting for a flight the next day. Because thats what swordmasters do. And the sword assassin he was trying to kill? He couldn't hit her with two machine guns at 20 paces. This is the hardass special ops guy. Dumb. But there are lots of car chases, explosions, shootings, stabbings, decapitations & kung-fu, and making fun of geeks, so will appeal to the above mentioned. No idea what Gibson is doing in it (he's been in such violent films before, but not usually this low brow). There is zero chemistry between the hero & the love of his life. There's more between her & the villain. The tender moments with the kid are cringey. And whats with the stupid $750,000 Adolf Hitler gun? Is the the 1960s?",Boss Level
221,wentos,versatile,8,24 October 2021,"Very good performances, good production values. That there is already a genre of time travel movies I was aware. That there is a time loop sub genre not but hey it has been a long time since groundhog day.Most of the sci-fi movies but especially of this type suffer from explaining too much what the 'invention' is. It is not why we are watching the movies. We watch them because we like stories. Good stories. Here there is not even a pretense to explain stuff to scientifically. That is good. After all we recently lots of people claiming 'science' w/o understanding the basic principle. The main characters are nicely developed. They have a good arc. Even ones that have no clue that they are in the loop with the main character. There is a portion of romance and of family time. The main character is male and not much fun is being made of that - that must be a coincidence or is this movie not made in Hollywood late into second decade of 21. Century? In any case all important stuff is there. The premise is too silly for some for sure. But then again the authors do not take themselves very seriously which one can see in game like visual elements made explicitly so that we see and identify them as such.I liked that.Interesting is to compare the movie to all these other looping films - the good ones that I can still recall were talking about the way humans develop and interact. This one does it nicely too.I gave it 8 because I did not like certain elements of the fundamental explanation of how things work but hey it is just a mechanism to make movie going and it is not soo painful to watch either. They added a new twist to it that I have not seen before so 8 seemed to be exactly right.There is not much woke nonsense here either. Characters are strong or weak. They are just people. I liked that too.Good actors. There is even Mell Gibson. And he is adding value.I liked that movie that much that I watched it a second time few months after the first time.

222,orcanimal,Worth it! Better than your average action flick,10,5 March 2021,"The movie only really has one flaw, and that's the VO story device which becomes slightly overbearing at points. There's just too much of it, which I get, because they decided to just rely on it continuously as the main story engine. I dislike the use of VO except for when absolutely necessary. It could've been done in a different way, sure, but that's the choice they made.
But like I said, it's the only real flaw of the movie. The action is fantastic, with Carnahan's direction really propelling this from disinteresting visuals to beautiful shot selection. Some of the CGI looks a little undercooked at parts, but there isn't a lot of it fortunately. The movie is very fun, and has excellent pace. As for the story, it's nothing special, but the delivery is so enjoyable, with Frank Grillo's fantastic charm, that it never bothered me really.

Frank Grillo does a great job of trying to keep things alive and no idea how Mel Gibson and talented Naomi Watts were lured into this crazy expensive $45M budget B movie action extravaganza.Just go and watch it for fun because it really makes no sense and the action is phenomenal yet after 1 hour of watching Grillo get grilled and killed in more ways than you ever wanted... you just get bored...and the plot is so bloody silly you only wish the writers cut 45 minutes of action and replaced it with something meaningful besides the silly Father/Son lame attempt which comes so late in the film story that you scratch your head wondering why....so it is all about the action as the rest makes little sense.Kudos to yet another rip off story/film by Carnahan and better luck next time finding an original story that is entertaining besides just silly action/violence.A 5 for Frank Grillo getting the s..t kicked out of him for literally 2 hours and I read Gibson dislocated his jaw during a fight scene.

Only then we didn't know how to call it. Later on there was an episode in science fiction series and some action series from the 90s up to 2020s. And we called that episode Groundhog day.Years have passed and the terminology nowdays is Time loop and not Groundhog Day (yes i know i typed it 3 times already like in a loop).Now i would have liked to see this movie before any other movies or series so i can quote: ""Oh man! That is like the Boss level movie""!Action sequences are excellent. Direction is superb! Frank delivers! And his character manages to grow like our beloved first movie... Not only emotionally but also in his psyche! The supprting roles are superb and they give a dramatic/comedic flare!Also there are some punch lines or easter eggs only an old arcade gamer would get.And while watching the movie, i knew the catharsis for the hero will come. And it came exactly as i had hoped at the end!I rate with a 9 because i didn't see it in the big screen and probably missed some details.... Just kiding!

With the number of highbrow story elements compressed into 100 mins (causality loops, DNA coded missing mass, Egyptian mythology and catastrophism) it would have been very easy to overwhelm and confuse the audience with too many ideas - but Boss Level doesn't. The story is well told, very well paced and seems to make a point of intentionally evolving from chaotic and complex to calm and clear. Clive Ventor's plan is horrific but logical and it's eventually revealed that Roy Pulver really only ever had one job from the start. When he devises his final, final, final, FINAL plan, despite everything that's happened, it makes perfect sense and also provides a valuable message about not giving up - even when you know the situation is completely hopeless.

237,JasonKleeberg,It's about to get...steel.,9,6 March 2021,"As reviewed on the Force Five Podcast...A retired special forces operative named Roy is stuck re-living the same day over and over again, a day in which he's repeatedly killed for reasons he doesn't quite understand by a rogue's gallery of assassins, each with their own style of mayhem. One of these days, Roy finds out new information and decides that it's time to end the loop.Wow, this movie is a lot of fun. I'm a sucker for a good 'Groundhog's Day' film. In fact, Palm Springs was my favorite film of 2020. And just like that movie, Boss Level drops us right into the life of a man who's lived the same day over and over again with a highly engaging (and funny) action scene right off the bat. Par for the course, as he learns more, we learn more, all presented with a video game aesthetic that I really enjoyed.The cast is great. Frank Grillo plays Roy, a jaded man who's just tired of getting up early each morning to stop his own death. He's perfect for the role and is just in incredible shape. We don't get much of Naomi Watts or Hollywood's ""Man of A Thousand Chances"" Mel Gibson, but they're awesome as usual. Selina Lo, who plays Guon Yin, is really great as the only assassin that really gets a decent amount of screen time.The action is really cool and the violence is unrelenting (we get to see Roy literally lose his head many times). I had so much fun with the small flashbacks to other attempts that have led to Roy's death in creative ways, including being run over by a truck, flying through a bus, and getting shot in the balls. It uses the formula in very interesting ways as Roy retains the information that he had the previous day. While the action is the main focus here, the film had a surprising amount of heart as well.I really enjoyed this film, but I have two bits of criticism. First, the film gives us all of these really cool assassins that feel like they were plucked straight out of Smokin' Aces, but we really don't see much of them aside from Guon Yin. Some are on screen for less than a minute, but they seemed like a really fun bunch and I'd have liked to have seen more of them.The other criticism I have about the movie is how it ends. It's very ambiguous, and I have a feeling that the screenwriters just didn't know how to end it. I'm not against ambiguous endings, but I don't think there was really a reason to leave this one up to the imagination. It's not an Inception kind of movie. A small gripe, to be sure.Imagine dying in every way imaginable and feeling it every time. Swords through the gut, rocket launchers, having your head detached from your body, being stabbed in the face, having C4 stuck to you before it explodes, and falling three stories to your doom. That's what Roy has dealt with every day for the better part of a year.Speaking of ugly, was that Gronk?I had a great time with Boss Level. This is one that I'll definitely watch again and will probably add to the Blu-ray collection. It doesn't really add anything new to the old formula of ""person relives the same day over and over again"", but it is a ton of fun, has a great cast, and is infused with way more feeling that actually lands than most action movies are.",Boss Level

It's literally edge of tomorrow (a fixed reset based on an outside influence) meets John Wick (guns go BrrrrRRr), and a mix of Groundhogs Day (MC uses resets to learn about himself and make the perfect day happen or change to how he wants)Like I said,... zero new things.Honestly the weird thing is I had NEXT vibes from the movie and not quite sure why, but it wasn't a good reason.A lot, and I mean a LOT has you entering conspiracy and history hating territory though.

Well also is good for nights Sunday through Friday too.Frank Grillo stars as a former soldier named Roy who is reliving the same day over and over while he is assassinated in all manner of different ways not knowing why. To tell you more would be to say too much as it is a straightforward, easy going flick, story wise. Also Grillo has carved a great little corner for himself in Tinseltown which has been fun to watch in wheelman, a few Purge films and point blank.The film moves briskly only slowing when we actually are in need of developing our characters. While this is when the film suffers, it is needed to help propel Roy into the third act.Joey C is one of those directors that should be doing more in Hollywood and this film reminded me, in ways, of a previous little gem he directed called 'Stretch' from 2014 starring Patrick Wilson.

It makes you expect nothing but still look forward to a descent action flick; the good news are that you're wrong, the best is yet to come.
The first impression as the movie starts is that the movie has its own pace, and a great one. That's the same director of Smoking Aces, and you can see a lot of his dynamics playing out perfectly on this movie.
The big surprise comes with the main character's arch. The story is good enough, but the journey the protagonist has to go through in order to see the next day is a game changer, satisfying, it pays off.
The movie is not perfect and that's all right. We can't expect a film to meet everyone's expectations. Those guys did their best and at the end of the day, they achieved it.
I'm one of those people who doesn't get impressed easily, I hate CGI and think that most movie makers these days don't have the balls to make characters with unique, even flawed attributes that go against the Hollywood stereotype.
It ain't the best CGI I've ever seen but I was too busy having fun to judge how well made it was.

It succeeded to keep me engaged for a couple of hours and not wanting to stop and do something else, like drink more wine or read some outrageous political news.Good acting, - even from previously well-known mediocre actors.I watched it in my bed, being irritated and tired on Friday night, and did not have to use any extra alcohol as a way to put my brains into a silly and relaxed mood.Highly recommended.",Boss Level

But after that all comes to the place.The storytelling has been borrowed heavily from video games at least the character's behaviour and the director doesn't hide this in fact there are references from the start and throughout the movie.The way it is directed is absolutelly brilliant how everything is cramped into a one and a half hour time format. Many times you spend watching a movie when really nothing happens except for some boring shooting and car rampage and then it's over.I can honestly say it is underrated movie in terms of the score.The movie is really not so much about the story rather the experience.

As it's not in theaters, open a beer, put your bottom on the couch, and enjoy a fun ride that has just enough ""today feels like yesterday"" humor to find relatable if you're stuck at home in the pandemic.PS: This should have been a sleeper hit at the box office, had the Covid-19 situation not happened.

What's my point? The point is that films, society, life is being dumbed down and multiple choice in T.P is just one in a long list of examples that support this fact, added to which. This film.God help you if you use narration in a film unless you are Kubrick or or Robert Bresson. Boss Level suffers from the needless pointless drivel that is its narration. It does not allow the veiwer to learn and figure out, to have any semblance of mystery or intrigue,instead you are told point blank 'this is what is going on' and I imagine if you watched a trailer for this movie you would have already known this but, if you are like Frank Costanza, and like to go in fresh you are denied any chance of working out what is happening because the producers, directors, and writers don't trust you to work it out so they tell you whats happening every step of the way thus denying you any meaningful growth as a film goer who learns with the main character in this instance played in the usually gruff, pork chop head way that Frank G has as he chews up the scenery shirtless and delivering sophomoric dialog and one liners so devoid of imagination and wit that you could be forgiven for thinking the producers got a drunk, meth addled teenager to do the final pass over the script. Though, for this movie Frank G is a good choice for lead and he can lead in a solid B+ way see for example 'Wheelman' which is surprisingly good in part due to Frank G. I do wonder how 2010 Jason Statham would have come across in this roll?The supporting characters are derivative and hollow, mostly unlikable, often not formed or annoying and lacking like a public toilet lacks charm. Naomi W phones it in long distance, Mel G I'm certain is only saying yes to films he can shoot in a day, seriously if you note the Passion of the Outbacks scenes you'll see he takes a page from Krusty the Clown recording lines for his doll and again I'm sure Mel wouldn't give you more than three takes.The story is confused, not confusing, it's confused. The plot is lacking in imagination and for a great example of this lacking view 'Palm Springs' another film that uses the GHD structure of repetitive days but does it in a way that is orginal, well, as orginal as it can be, clever, witty and charming. Yes one is a film and one is a movie both aiming for different audience demographics, and going on the average rating of B.L it hit with its young males demo like a fat man being hit in the stomach with a canon ball though this does not change the fact that this is a terrible movie pandering to the moronic and the lowest common denominator.

The ""acting"" is,,,adequate enough to stop you falling into Dante's Inferno by your own hand, along with the HOPE,,its gonna make sense! And yet all through the film (god knows how long it lasted, i'm still in therapy after watching it), it crashes from scene to scene, sometimes leaving you thinking ""i've got to watch that again, because i cannot believe its actually included) Mel did this for cash only,,,surely ?,, his vocals were from other films (except Braveheart thank god), and sometimes the look in his eyes,,he believed HE was on another set too.

Grillo is an engaging screen presence, more than capable in the action scenes but there was much more to him than that. He engaged me emotionally and his world-weary humour really worked well.I would have liked a slightly different ending but that isn't a criticism, just personal preference. He's a busy actor at the moment and I'm looking forward to seeing him as a leading man again.Big thumbs up from me.",Boss Level

This isn't a cheesy action packed version of the very, very often used Groundhog Day plot.Well, actually, it IS a a cheesy action packed version of Groundhog Day. But it's also much more than that. It's very funny, good acting and it even gets away with morality lessons like you should spent time with your loved ones.I don't think I'd seen a movie with Grillo before, at least not that I remembered. But he's the perfect man for this job: being the fatalistic, cynical anti-hero.

Most of it, ridiculous race, gender or social virtue signaling. This movie seems to cut through all that nonsense and laugh at itself doing so. Well written, well acted and good effects without being over-the-top. Mel Gibson has a small part but lends credibility here. This is a fun action movie that will make you laugh with a good balance of action. I enjoyed this film because it entertains without insulting your intelligence. You can sit back and take this one in with confidence. It's not the greatest movie in the world, but that's the point. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It does it's job, plain and simple... Good work all around here. Quality workmanship with a few good twists in the story to keep your interest all the way through. My suggestion is to see it cold. Don't even watch the trailer. It's a fun ride that you will enjoy. Let it take you on the adventure and I bet you'll dig it too. I applaud the team that created this film. It seems familiar but makes its own mark.

358,EShy,I'd rather have a sequel or a reboot,4,9 March 2021,"Instead of bad writing ripping off other movies, that were much better.The first 15 minutes of this movie assume it's the first time you're watching any movie.
While ripping off things from Back to the Future, Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow and others, they feel the need to explain in boring detail everything that is going on.
While those other movies take you into the time travel/time loop story and let you figure out what is going on with the characters, this one just bores you to death.Once that very long exposition telling you things you already know is over, it gets a little more interesting.Of course, they still assume you will be lost and feel the need to show graphics for every ""attempt"" and keep narrating everything that happens.The cast is full of known names, the type who are at a point in their career where they might take any role for the money.
That's what you do when you try to attract viewers with names instead of actually making a good movie.There's nothing original. They can call it an homage, but it's just a rip off.
Maybe instead of paying all of the known actors they had on there, they could've hired better writers and at least make it watchable.All that said, the action scenes are fun enough that if the story didn't ruin it, the movie would've been much more enjoyable.I'm sure Joe's take on The Raid will be great",Boss Level

And he just keeps on talking and talking and talking. And I had to turn it off.Hollywood doesn't need to rehabilitate that raycist. There are tons of other talented actors who don't make people feel like they need to take a shower when they see them on screen. Don't believe the hype that hollywood is ""librul.""

Hey There's Ken Jeong! And what in the hell persuaded Naomi Watts to join this mess? There's a lot of ass-kickin' and shootin' and car crashes, and stuff occasionally blows up, but there is nothing approaching a narrative that makes sense or even produces an occasional chuckle.

The way I judge a film is primarily is when I finish watching I ask myself ""Was I entertained enough to such that I would pay to see that again?"".While I admit openly that my threshold for entertainment is low, this one far exceeded that.I have seen Frank Grillo in a few movies, he seems like a bit of a B-Grade Action Movie Guy - boy was I wrong. My opinion has changed greatly such that I shall go seek out other Frank Grillo movies.As the main guy Boss Level, he delivered an outstanding performance. His blasé deadpan attitude was very funny - after all he is a guy who was just over it, starting each day, dying, rinse and repeat,There are some real parallels with Groundhog Day on the journey he takes - the ups and down, and how he games it to his advantage.Mel Gibson was ok, a typical Action Move Antagonist - some of the other quite unique characters maybe be somewhat clichéd, but still very funny.There are no Oscar's here, then again who cares about the Oscar's anymore?

I mean it's exactly the same thing I would think, say, play even, it's amazing and it's so dope if it's just a coincidence. It is an action packed awesome and brilliant movie if it's just a coincidence with Death Loop because if not they need to get together and make the movie come with the game in ultra 4K! It's smart the whole way through and funny, not to mention well acted, written and even more funny when you think about it like you're playing that day over and over or a ""Boss Level"" you couldn't get past, and how you would think, it's spot on. Such a great surprise and wonder if one has to do anything with the other? I haven't even looked it up but I enjoyed it more than a non gamer for sure, but that's just what I thought of the movie, I couldn't stop laughing when he said what he said at the end SPOILERS!!!!

Really, I can't say enough positive things about it. From the acting, the directing, the subtle choices to NOT make every gun shot sound like a damn cannon.. the soundtrack. Damn near perfect. Even the fight scenes were realistic for a video game movie.
Now, this is a film for a certain audience, to be sure, but within that limited scope I think this might be the best I've seen. It's got just enough heart to not be a dumb action hero shoot-em-up waste of time, but doesn't get bogged down in drama (there's an appropriate dramatic core). And I wasn't expecting numerous belly laughs out of this one but it really delivered in my perspective on that angle. Just witty, well timed comedy. In the action. Highly recommend.",Boss Level

425,paul-verkruissen,Much better than I expected!,7,5 March 2021,"I honestly did not expect much from this movie. We saw it solely because it was on at the right time (yes I have kids, no they didn't come).It opens strong, straight into the action. You get a bit of an idea early about what is happening, and they feed you nuggets nicely as we go. The story aligns closely with 80's arcade games which is at first odd, but important, and works well if you grew up in that era, or are at least aware of those games.There is plenty of action - so much - and given the ""Groundhog Day"" style of time flow I was impressed with how the repeating scenes are stitched together. Frank Grillo is thoroughly enjoyable in the lead action role, with Mel Gibson only playing a relatively small part in comparison. The real supporting characters are the other bad guys and girls, and there is plenty of fun as those scenes play out over and over.Not a perfect film, and there are some plot traps but that's not unexpected given the premise.But if you are looking for a fun, sometimes bloody, sometimes funny and often non-sensical sit-back-and-eat-popcorn high-action movie then I recommend this for sure.",Boss Level

It's quite suitable, too, because most action movies I've seen from the last 10 years are just like most of Roy's days: repetitive, with minor variations.I've always liked Frank Grillo, but in this movie he's shown something special. I now not only consider him fun to watch and charismatic, but one of the most underrated action actors there is. Naomi Watts was fine, Mel Gibson was forgettable (did they need his name there just to get more people to watch this?). The plot was well conceived and executed. If this was a Nolan movie, it would need one extra hour and still not be clear. Luckily, it's not, and quite a complex plot (for an action movie) is very well delivered. I'm also grateful the film doesn't have any scientific mambo jumbo that sci-fi films sometimes feel inclined to include.Overall, it's well worth the watch, and a breath of fresh air in the copy paste desert of today's action flicks.",Boss Level

Could never be bothered to write one up before, but this film surprised the hell out of me, so here we go.I came to this film expecting another popcorn flick at best. Yet another variation on the ""Groundhog Day"" of which we have seen a million. At first glance, this film seems exactly like that, but you have to stick with it to the end to fully appreciate its depth.It's fun and action packed, it has a lot of low-brow humor, the main character appers to be just a macho smart-mouthed guy past his glory days seeking to correct his regret ridden past. You've seen this story many times before, but the devil, as they say, is in the details. And the details make this film not just a good action flick, but a great film in general. If you stick with this film to the end, you will realize that the main character and his motivations are surprisingly deep and you will not regret the time spent watching this. Unlike most modern films you actually get the full hero's journey here and what a journey it is! From a selfish seld-absorned man to a savior of humanity! I'm being vague on purpose here, because I don't want to spoil the story for anybody.To sum up: Action: Good, seen better, but good nonetheless.Acting: Excellent across the board, especially Frank Grillo. Didn't expect this much range from him!Story: Simple, yet satisfying.Production value: Great. Expected another forgetfull nonesense....got one of the best action films I've seen in my life.",Boss Level

This movie was action pack, fun, entertaining, witty with a blend of sci-fi and eventually a deeper message. Frank Grillo at his best holding his own With an all-star cast. I enjoyed Michelle Yeoh's Cameo especially. This will become a cult classic alongside of other time travel/time loop films like Groundhog Day or Edge of tomorrow. This film delivers the way an action film of its kind should deliver, reminds me of the good all days watching fun action movies of the 80s and 90's, You can say it's almost a Parody of one of the classic video games, bare bones, No-holds-bar action.",Boss Level

My own personal opinion, if marvel and disney can pick up the rights, the ending could tie into the MCU universe. Now think about it before you misjudge me. She was talking about the mutliverse, and with dr strange and the multiverse movie coming, he could be alternate good guy crossbones just wanting to get home.

But in this one John Carnahan spiced the humor with awesome action sequences and a little bit of a drama. Frank Grillo was a really good choice for the lead role and Naomi Watts for the love interest is great. Mel Gibson for villan is always nice to watch but he could have some more screen time.

Frank Grillo has on-screen presence that perfectly suits his role as a detached father, macho military man caught in a mysterious time loop. The directing of this film is very well executed, revealing plot points at just the right moments that keep the story evolving right until the final frame.Along with the gratuitous action scenes, you're suddenly sideswiped with an emotional element that blows away all the CGI explosions, guns, and graphic sword fights.Naomi Watts as the scientist love interest and Mel Gibson as the penultimate antagonist balances out the star power wonderfully.Whatever wince-worthy instances that occur are overcome with the timeless lesson of facing your most personal fear with renewed resolve.",Boss Level

It can't compete with the brilliant top of the line movie from 2014, but a direct comparison would be unfair because it didn't had the same budget.

504,ian_bolton,Very good.,8,4 March 2021,"There's a lot more to this film than you originally realise or expect. He only get's so far, each time trying to learn new things to avenge his wife's death, but his connection with his son was the key and the build up to it all was full of great twists and turns.The direction sometimes gets a little muddled as we lose some of the pacing at times, but Frank Grillo plays a great lead role - both hilarious and touching at times. The story was way more complicated than you originally think, from it being a schlocky Groundhog Day action romp to being a complex ordeal in which you're never sure where it might go.Great soundtrack, some brilliant action scenes and Mel Gibson does play a decent bad guy. Wasn't really sure about Naomi Watts though. She's very unpredictable in her films and this one seems a bit over-edited - like, she had more parts but they were taken out because they were probably no real use to the overall tempo of the film.Think there were a few nods to the current 'woke', 'PC' briggade which may have made a few studio's hesitant in today's climate, but glad it's finally getting a proper release. Would definitely recommend.",Boss Level

The whole movie I was not thinking where the plot goes next, it was the whole time what would be Franks next shenanigan.

I felt every emotion before in most games I've played, that his character goes through (both in writing and acting). Mel Gibson is just kinda there to be genericly evil, but with a little emphasis on him and what he does, so it's not that bad.
I kinda wanted to hate the movie, but I just couldn't. There isn't a single ""it's so bad it's good"" moment, it's just fun (and funny), mostly not serious, movie. But again I expected a terrible waste of time. Glad I was wrong.",Boss Level

518,sirdashingtonthethird,Subversive Trash,1,15 April 2021,"Painfully protracted exposition for characters with ambiguous motivations in a plot with even more ambiguous premises. Unexplained time-magic that is conducted with shiny lights and something to do with dna. Action scenes whose budget is more impressive than their action, starring the diversity crew of hair-dye models and hey, a midget. This freakshow is supposed to out-perform the few-dozen militarized operators at the base. The black ""German"" twins were a nice touch after the migrant crisis, how insulting. This entire movie is underwritten by a subversive narrative to pacify the goy and normalize outlandish concepts as well as religious ones as a precursor to the great social change and collapse of empire we are currently experiencing. In terms of production, this movie is flashy but lacking substance. In terms of story-telling and immersion, the relations between the characters are forced and the tale is lack-luster, owing to its double-narrative.Most movies today are subversive predictive programming meme-magic, and this one smacks of the Kabballah, with Mel Gibson spouting a line of Tikkun Ollam, ""peace to the nations,"" when he says that he is trying to reset the world (predictive programming for the ""great reset"" as it is happening) so that we can have peace, free from Hitler and 9/11.Hollywood isn't your friend, this movie is subversive propaganda trash not worth the few seconds of action jackson living the dream of the gamer and performing irl trickshots.",Boss Level

This movie might not be worth subscribing to Hulu over but if you already have their streaming service and want a fun film to watch then this is for you.Frank Grillo carries this movie and proves his worth as an actor, his character Roy Pulver is a generic ex-special forces soldier with most of the tropes to accompany him but he gets some laughs and a good few action scenes, a lot of deaths but also a good emotional kicker. The action sequences are exciting to watch and a lot of them usually end in an amusing death.The pacing is a bit off and the sci-fi elements don't totally work and character wise we don't really get a wide array of interesting faces. The assassins are very two dimensional, the Villains motivations are never really explored and Mel Gibson is kinda wasted in this.I do recommend this movie for those who liked the Netflix films Extraction and triple frontier as they feel quite similar except for the more humorous elements in Boss Level.",Boss Level

Yes, the language is ridiculously foul, but I managed to handle it. After all that, what's left is a REALLY fun and clever movie that's a mashup of Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, the Taken series and anything by Sam Peckinpah. It was too intense for my wife. That's the only reason I docked it a point. I haven't felt compelled to write a review of any other movie I've seen in the last two years.

I gave it a 2 out of spite because theres a lot of misplaced 10s somehow (even it up).It's being compared to other movies that fit the plot such as edge of tomorrow, groundhog day, deadpool. It shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence as these cult classics, let alone see the site of day.This main actor is cheesy in the worst way and really hard to watch. The jokes came across almost as if the movie was meant to be a spoof of others like it, but still wasn't funny. CringeworthyThe plot gave you almost nothing to relate to whatsoever, and that feeling where you really don't care whats going to happen.This movie is probably well suited to those with low brow humour who loved fast and the furious spin offs, stale one liners and have never seen a movie that actually earned a high rating.I would highly recommend it as a form of torture.",Boss Level

The movie stars Frank Grillo in the lead role along with Naomi Watts, Mel Gibson, Annabelle Wallis, Michelle Yeoh and Ken Jeong in the supporting roles. They've all done a good job but we kinda feel that Frank Grillo underperformed a bit.The movie's direction is a bit unevenly paced to begin... although it gets exciting in the middle phase but never escalates to a level which makes up for the former. The plot is nothing new, the groundhog day loop is shown in the film and the concept of Osiris from Egyptian mythology is taken which isn't shown to be very fascinating in the movie. The side characters are the best parts about the film, they're exciting to watch but even they fail to keep us engaged with the hollow storyline. The emotional element of the movie is the best part about it, the importance of a parent while growing up is shown in a very subtle but beautiful manner. The dialogues are good, some punchlines are catchy which carry the screenplay forward. The ending is predictable but isn't completely revealed, but it fails to generate the excitement at the end despite nice action sequences which are well choreographed look a bit on the low-budget side. The music is catchy and tries its best to bind the movie together but it isn't enough.Summary:-
A passable one time-watch which does entertain you to an extent (you'll like it if you're a groundhog day-loop fan) but never escalates from its bland and predictable screenplay.PG - There are loads of abuses and lightly gory action sequences so not a family watch.Catch this movie.",Boss Level

Full of cliches and an unlikable lead, feels like watching bots reciting lines, not characters.The only reason ""Boss Level"" gets 2 stars is it's promt, as time loop movies tend to be interesting in general (goundhog day or palm springs), but this movie falls short of it's predecesors.",Boss Level

566,niffty-83456,2021 is the new 1980,10,15 August 2021,"Just Cause meets Kick Arse. This film has the boyish humour of a bygone *and much missed* era mixed with the pace, slick style and plot line we've come to expect in a world competing for each moment of our attention.I suspect it's aimed at a younger audience but I lapped it up like a cat with the double cream.I confess my initial expectations were low and it did start out as a slow burner but the generic elements were dealt out with charisma and as the film progressed I found myself warming more and more to the characters and plot. It surprised with a few changes of direction and by its conclusion I felt this could become a cult movie to remember. I just wanted to go back and re-watch it from the start, I might even do that.",Boss Level
567,mybnp,"Oh yes, finally a great film that kept me laughing and intrigued all the way to the end",10,21 August 2021,"There has been nothing like this for some time. Everything has been just so samey lately. The best way I can describe this film is Deadpool vs John Wick. The sick humour, the great one liners. Great fight scenes that just get better every time he is 'respawned' 🤣 - just brilliant. I stumbled across this an Amazon Prime and I am so glad I watched it. I laughed so much at the one liners, the amazingly funny dark kills. Wow.Rillo is just so good at this. For a Deadpool type film you need the right character or it will just fall flat. He does such an amazing job at not just the action but the delivery. Of course his arc is just perfect, from dead beat drunk dad to John Wick, but always with a coolness, smile and attitude.It one of those films where you think it's about to wrap up, then goes to an even higher gear for the finale. I can say nothing more as I'm still buzzing and if you like dark comedies with action thrown in. A great original story with Groundhog Day vibes then this is a much watch. Loved it.",Boss Level

572,melvinsidd,One of the best Netflix movies. A must watch,10,10 October 2021,"I'm usually very jaded when it comes to movies these days. Hollywood is pretty bad when it comes to emotional scenes. But this one definitely has it's moments. It feels sincere at some point. That scene near the end was quite charming.The rest of the dialogue are really good as well. I like when movies don't try to just shower us with special effects and explosions. It's human interactions that makes a good story. And this one takes it's sweet time for some long dialogues. Reminded me of old Tarantino movies.I think it's quite well researched too. Nice touch with Guan Yin godess of mercy and all that stuff. I think it's cool to be open minded and research about other culture.And of course, it's really packed with lots of awesome action scenes. The first couple of minutes almost comes across as trying too hard, and the sword fighting scenes are a little bit awkward (although the story line that leads up to it was a really cool concept, and I still liked it overall, nevertheless). I really don't care if other people don't like it. I loved it. It's a movie that is definitely worth watching. One of the best movies from Netflix in a while.",Boss Level

576,grillcrew,another sloppy timeloop movie,3,30 June 2021,"These groundhog movies are an absolute trend lately, but it would have been a decent watch if the action was ok unfortunately it never pleases.Choreographys sucks, effects are so so, often it feels slow the way the action is filmed maybe because the movie rather tries to be a comedy which isn't working for me. There was a swordfight scene that showcased that they really didn't care to put some effort into it , but it had lots of build up so i thought this should've been the highlight or one great scene.No thrilling moments not even in the final run /third it never felt gripping.The story here doesn't matter and it's told mostly by going back a day or him having some fun with his son didn't help to bound the experience since it was rather uninspired and dull which could've overseen if the action was good... It was nice to see some Mel Gibson again but shame that the movie is one to forget quickly don't get fooled by the high ratings. 3 stars is probably most i could squeeze here for some references and good picture quality and grillo looked fit and naomi did fine with what was given but that doesn't change terrible dialogues.Pacing was decent but who cares if sitting through it is tiresome since it's forseeable not funny and no good action didn't enjoy that much even paused couple times and forced myself through without pushing forward too much.",Boss Level

580,scottwilljames,"Legitimately, very okay.",9,28 June 2021,"I was hesitant at first, as the ""B Grade"" action flicks of the 90's rarely hit the mark any more, but this holds up. After a bit of research, it's clear the director, writer, and Grillo were invested in this, and it shows. They have taken quite a bit of time and effort to get this up and running without having to compromise their vision (such as it is), so though it may appear as a typical paint by numbers formulaic offering, it rings truer than that. It's not Tenant, but nor is it a quick time travel/action shoot em up/80's video game fan boy movie pitch either (though I loved the video game shtick). I wouldn't be shocked to hear Gibson and Watts were in it for a quick pay cheque, but neither would they have signed on for total garbage, and they were solid. It has very few plot holes, or the usual eye roll action movie components (aside from the intended ones) avid movie fans wish script writers and studios would spend the extra few hours and dollars avoiding. If you go into this expecting exactly what it says on the label, you'll be entertained and happy. I saw one review liken it to ""John Wick crossed with Groundhog Day"" but I'd more compare it with Deadpool and the same, due to the humour. If you want a good action romp, and you can't enjoy this after being sat at home all through this pandemic with so few good movies on offer, you're kidding yourself. Really quite good.",Boss Level

583,snwot9,"A brutal ""Live die Repeat"" Action SciFi",8,7 August 2021,"This is a really fun 'Live, Die, Repeat' action fest that is brutally gory. It manages to still keep a strong Sci-Fi backbone, and if you don't pick at the plot for holes and just enjoy the ride it is pretty rewarding.Any film that is about reliving the same day over and over will have a few gruesome deaths in store for the protagonist, even in Groundhog
Day. In Edge of Tomorrow the landing battle showed many repeated deaths, but this film really revels in the deaths and takes it to another level, and the imagery is visceral.If you can stomache that, then you're in for a fun ride. The story is really quite fleshed out, I got a bit worried early on that it was going to start going off the rails, but it pulls everything together as it goes. Frank Grillo was made for this role, he controls the action and narrates the psyche and he really delivers. Underrated on IMDM atm as a 6.9 possibly because of the violence, I'd probably rate it a 7.7.",Boss Level
584,talisman69,At least now I know to avoid this Grillo guy in the future,4,18 August 2021,"Horrible choice of lead actor. He sucks, he's bad and I don't like him. This mediocre director was hanging out with him in the gym (where Grillo had his shirt off) and he said to Grillo ""hey, bro, you could be the lead in an action movie, y'know"" - I am 99% sure that that is what happened.I got half way through the film and I refuse to watch any more. With a better lead actor I reckon it could have been maybe a 6/10. Bear in mind that I am not some idiot who will rate something 1/10 just because I don't like it, I am realistic and Grillo can realistically get the eff out of my face.",Boss Level

590,stevekelly0503,This is the first review I have ever contributed on here,9,26 March 2021,"I have been reading IMDB for over ten years and have never written a review. Because of this movie I felt COMPELLED to tell people how awesome this movie is. Frank Grillo is perfect as the flawed anti-hero who finally achieves his full potential, becomes the hero, and saves the world. As thrilling as the action was, I think the real winning theme in this movie was the father son relationship. As a father with a young son, it brought tears to my eyes to see that this man really loves his boy and he was going to stop at nothing to save him. Yes the movie is a time loop; yes he is playing the same final level over and over until he has it memorized; yes he finally wins and saves the day. And what is his prize after all this hard work to beat the last level of the game.... the love of his son. So yes, great action movie, but deep down, this big tough guy just wants to hang with his boy. And really, isn't that a great way to spend the last day of the world. Watch this movie!

It's funny, gory, action packed, semi original storyline. Frank Grillo is the 2010-2020's answer to that actor u get when no one else wants the role, then takes a mediocre film and raises it up a few notches by home self.

The supporting female actress is unmemorable. If you want to see Frank Grillo with his shirt off, then this movie is for you.
